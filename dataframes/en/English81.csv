"I do not, however, endorse the fact that the deadline for implementation is to be extended."
"I hope that we will be able to improve on that."
"I am rapporteur for the last phase of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme."
"It set relatively ambitious aims, and that applies to air quality too."
"Its objective was to ensure that we no longer cause harm to human health."
"Now it has to be said that with this first legislative thematic strategy, which is meant to fulfil the aims of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, we will not achieve the targets contained in it."
"This will also water down the targets we settled on in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme."
"."
"Mr President, the importance of clean air is, of course, beyond dispute, and it is also clear that its benefits largely outweigh the costs."
"The aim of this legislation – and I am mainly focusing on the draft directive – is therefore commendable, and I am particularly supportive of Mr Krahmer’s attempts to make it as workable as possible."
"We should nevertheless question, though, whether we in the European Union are on the right track and whether the legislation we are drafting is not symbolic."
"Why am I saying this?"
"While we want to impose strict requirements on Member States, they even fail to meet the old air quality standards."
"Since the entry into effect of the Air Quality Directive in 2005, which specifies ceilings for PM10 dust particles, ten Member States have failed to meet the requirements."
"Even before 2005, it should have been obvious to the Commission that Member States would not meet the limit values without a systematic source policy involving restrictions on exhaust fumes from cars, lorries and ships."
"Between 2002 and 2004, approximately 96% of the cities exceeded the daily standards, and the annual standards were exceeded in various regions in southern Europe, the Benelux countries and in Germany, as well as in central and eastern Europe, accounting for some 73% of the cities."
"Without source measures, that were often announced years ago by the Commission, stricter or less strict values for PM10 or PM2.5 serve no purpose whatsoever, and I am not even talking about nitrogen."
"Without source measures, Member States will be unable to comply with the limit values, and I am of course delighted to hear the Commissioner confirm that they will produce all those source measures, but not just yet."
"There is phenomenal opposition to this policy in the Commission, and, in fact, also in this House."
"Local short-term measures are ineffective."
"Effective policy must focus on long-term measures, and must therefore also include source policy, which this, however, does not."
"The object of the legislation is commendable, but the path chosen to reach it is questionable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has been said, air pollution kills more than 300 000 Europeans prematurely every year."
"Experts in environmental health have said that the Commission’s proposal was bewilderingly inadequate, but will the European Parliament now give cause for even greater bewilderment?"
"The majority on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are actually proposing that current legislation should be made less stringent."
"It postponed entry into force by more than 10 years, and would double the number of days when limit values for pollution can be exceeded, from 30 to 55 a year."
"It offered the excuse that in the distant future yearly limit values would come down from 40 to 30 micrograms per cubic metre."
"This is only an apparent improvement, however, as the current limit value, if it may be exceeded on more than 35 days, in practice represents an annual average of 30 micrograms."
"It is a falsehood that companies with daily limit values would have a negligible impact on health."
"On the contrary, the hospitals always have more heart patients coming in when daily pollution levels have been exceeded."
"This scandalous suggestion by the Committee on the Environment was justified by saying that the Member States could not do any better."
"The Member States themselves in the Council, however, have provisionally agreed on a tougher line, where postponement would only be for three years."
"Following this preliminary display of agreement in the Council, the three largest groups made a more spruced up compromise proposal, which would nevertheless still postpone the entry into force of norms for longer than that in the proposal by the EC Council of Ministers."
"It has been awful to witness how the negotiators in certain groups have taken guidance from the automotive industry."
"It will be a shame indeed if Parliament’s largest groups succumb to pressure from lobbies in the car industry."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to you not to agree to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment or Mrs Weisgerber and others to postpone the entry into force of legislation, but to stand up for the rights of our citizens to breathe clean air."
"Air pollution causes major public health problems within the European Union."
"The Commission’s own calculations show that getting on for 370 000 premature deaths per year are caused by emissions into the air."
"Particulate emissions are the most important cause of these premature deaths, to which should be added all the health problems that affect people with asthma or allergies of one kind or another, children being an especially vulnerable group."
"Air pollution also creates major environmental problems in the form of eutrophication, acidification and ground-level ozone."
"There are clear reasons in terms of health and the environment for placing a strict limit on these emissions."
"Socio-economic calculations lead to the same conclusion."
"Society would benefit significantly by avoiding these costs linked to emissions."
"The Commission’s proposed thematic strategy and proposal for a directive on better air quality are therefore a disappointment."
"The level of ambition is very low."
"Once again, we have been given sad confirmation that an ambitious environmental policy is not a priority for this European Commission."
"Unfortunately, the draft reports produced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are also inadequate compromises."
"The decisions proposed in them are quite simply not good enough to provide real remedies to the problems."
"We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left have therefore tabled a number of amendments with a view to making the proposals for directives more stringent."
"There are a number of purposes behind these various amendments."
"Firstly, we wish to remove the very generous exemptions that Member States would be allowed and as a result of which we should have to wait an unnecessary number of years before seeing the directive implemented in practice."
"Where the exposure reduction target is concerned, we believe that this should be binding, and we believe that it can be increased to 25%."
"When it comes to the concentration cap for particles, we wish to reduce this to ten micrograms, so putting it at the same level as that recommended for industrialised countries by the World Health Organisation (WHO)."
"We also believe that the same requirements for low levels of pollution should be imposed everywhere, irrespective of natural sources of emissions."
"Otherwise, environments of different quality would be required for different people, dependent on where they happened to live."
"That is our position."
"Mr President, I want to use the last half-minute to say a personal thank you."
"Tomorrow, I am standing down as a Member of the European Parliament, so this is my last speech in the House."
"I wish to thank those fellow Members with whom I have worked during the last 11 years."
"It has been a pleasure to have been able to work in this House."
"I also wish to thank Parliament’s services and, above all, the interpreters. Thank you very much."
"Mr Sjöstedt, I am very moved that I am here for this moment."
"I can assure you – and I am speaking on behalf of all of the Members here – that we are very satisfied with your participation in all of our debates."
"You have been a Member of this Parliament for a very long time, and a Member who is well-liked, not just within your group, but far beyond, as I can testify."
"."
"Mr President, I should also like to wish Mr Sjöstedt well for the future."
"As a Member of the Committee on Environment, Public Heath and Food Safety I support the strategy on air quality that has been set out by the Commission."
"That strategy sets out a series of health and environmental objectives and emissions reduction targets for the main pollutants."
"It calls on the Commission to bring forward a range of sector-based initiatives, including the following: reducing emissions from shipping; reducing emissions of ammonia from agricultural use; the extension of integrated pollution prevention and control measures for smaller units; more stringent emissions standards for vehicles, and the implementation of a national emissions ceiling directive."
"We all recognise the significant benefits that accrue from reduced air pollution and we support cost-effective integrated approaches to achieving improvements in air quality."
"Undoubtedly greater investment in renewable energies and in the biofuel sector will also help to create a cleaner environment."
"My report on the future of the biofuels industry was recently strongly approved by the Environment Committee."
"Key points that I made in that report included the following: biofuels emit between 40% and 80% fewer greenhouse gases compared to fossil fuels; biofuels offer new sources of income for farmers via sustainable and multifunctional agriculture of the kind the common agricultural policy purports to promote."
"The European Union should be ambitious in the strategies it pursues to promote the use of biofuels."
"We must stimulate a greater demand for biofuels in Europe and we must guarantee that the seventh EU R[amp]D Framework Programme for the period 2007 to 2013 is geared heavily towards the promotion of the biofuels sector within EU Member States."
"I believe that we can all recognise the potential of renewable energy as an important means to boost employment and create added value in rural areas."
"The decoupling of income support from production introduced by the 2003 common agricultural policy reform will help to facilitate the supply of energy crops."
"The advent of biofuels is good news for the agricultural sector in Europe and in Ireland and it is good news for the medium- to long-term protection of our environment."
"We need firm action in the European Union to promote the biofuels sector."
"We know the importance of that sector."
"We know of the environmental benefits, so let us now go and collectively meet that challenge."
"."
"Mr President, in no other Member State has air quality been the subject of such a discussion as in my own country."
"As I see it, the problems that are current in the Netherlands should also be evident in nearly all other Member States, certainly in the urban areas."
"The agreement that has been reached between the political groups throws open the possibility for delay, rightly so, before the limit values for PM10 start taking effect, and I shall be advising my group to vote in favour of it."
"I should, in fact, like to draw your particular attention to Amendment 76, because it is my belief that the agreement – and, I think, wrongly – has taken no account of the position of nitrogen oxide."
"I should like to ask the Members to support that amendment."
"I should now like to turn to Commissioner Dimas."
"So far, Commissioner, you have always claimed that the Commission cannot agree to the idea of a possible delay in combination with new measures from the Commission."
"You will notice tomorrow that you have a broad majority facing you."
"You also undoubtedly read the report last week compiled by the Institute for European Environmental Policy, which states that combining the two would be a very good thing."
"Is there really no chance of you meeting us half-way in this?"
"Finally, of course, a word of thanks to both rapporteurs."
"I know it can be very tricky to negotiate all the difficulties in an issue as sensitive as this, but I think you managed it really well, and that is why we are indebted to you both."
"Mr Sjöstedt, many thanks for the good teamwork; God bless."
"() I would like to thank the two rapporteurs for their work on this important topic."
"Air pollution is known to reduce average life expectancy by as much as nine months."
"More than half of Europeans are living in conditions where the daily concentration limit is exceeded more than 35 times a year."
"In the European Union the situation is worst in Benelux, northern Italy, and in the new Member States."
"Air pollution is the cause of multiple respiratory and other diseases."
"Under Article 152 of the European Community Treaty, public health falls under the purview of the Member States, and the European Union has only limited powers in this regard; hence it is necessary to look for ways to enable the European Union to act indirectly, that is, by means of other policies, in order to improve health."
"Improving air quality is undoubtedly an example of such policies."
"If the Member States and, especially, the new Member States for which EU law is still a new legal area and which are facing major economic problems, are required to implement a Framework Directive in their respective legal systems, along with four more pieces of legislation, three daughter directives and a Council Decision, it is clear that implementation will be fraught with difficulties, errors and incompleteness."
"The public will find it difficult to identify the binding EU standards of air quality."
"I therefore greatly appreciate the fact that the proposed draft will simplify the existing legislation by as much as 50%."
"The European Union needs long-term goals, strict controls and checks as to whether the Member States are properly implementing the Directive."
"On the other hand, the EU should adopt standards that are transparent and that focus more on limiting emissions by polluters."
"The targets set in the legislation, be it PM10 or PM2.5, or the date on which the Directive will come into force, should be ambitious but realistic."
"Failing that, we expose ourselves to the risk of non-compliance by the Member States."
"In this regard it is important to realise that even the most earnest activities on the part of the European Union will be in vain unless the EU is engaged in global cooperation, since air pollution will then be imported, and we will not be in a position to prevent that."
"Mr President, if you want to know why we are having this debate, come with me down Oxford Street, in my constituency of London, where you can smell, taste and feel the air pollution that we seek to tackle."
"An earlier generation was faced with smog and it tackled that with Clean Air Acts, which stopped coal burning in homes, in industries and on railways."
"Now we face the challenge of fine particles and the respiratory and cardiovascular effect that has on our constituents: the extra medication, the millions of lost working days each year and premature deaths."
"In my constituency, 1 000 people die prematurely as a result of pollution and another 1 000 are sent to hospital."
"It is now estimated that PM2.5 pollution is responsible for reducing our life expectancy by some eight months."
"That is the challenge."
"That is why we need to tackle pollution at source in relation to cars and heavy vehicles, ships, agricultural feed, energy-using products and so forth. However, we also need to tackle it through this directive, simplifying the previous legal instruments while bringing in this new standard for the smaller particles, the 2.5s, because we know those are the most dangerous to human health."
"We need a robust directive and the Commissioner is right to remind us that we must not go back on things already agreed."
"My delegation will certainly vote for standards that are challenging, that are effective and that will be implemented sooner rather than later."
"I thank the two rapporteurs who brought this through the committee to this plenary and I wish the Commissioner well in his work."
"May I also wish well Mr Sjöstedt, our friend and colleague from the Environment Committee."
"As he takes his environmental credentials across the ocean, may we hope that he influences the Americans too, to ensure they understand the need for environmental measures of this sort."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the rapporteurs for the work they have put in and for their capacity for compromise, which is reflected in these compromise amendments."
"Air quality is a yardstick for quality of life."
"Every year in the European Union, over 300 000 people die prematurely as a result of particulates, an intolerable state of affairs that must be brought to an end, and so it is to be welcomed that a strategy is being developed and the directive on air quality and clean air in Europe rolled out."
"The main concern where improvement of air quality is concerned has to do with the limit values for PM10 and PM2.5 particles."
"On 21 June, the Committee on the Environment, Public Heath and Food Safety expressed itself in favour of ambitious limit values for these."
"What is of significance for the EU’s Member States is that not only the limit values for good air quality are defined, but that the means should also be devised for ensuring compliance with them, and I would give the Euro 5 emissions standard for private motor vehicles as an example of this."
"As well as the instruments, the time element also plays a vital part in compliance with the limit values; even if more stringent limit values for private motor vehicles are laid down immediately, it will take some time for the number of environmentally-friendly motor vehicles on European roads to increase."
"The compromises on which we are to vote guarantee more stringent limit values and a realistic time frame, making it possible for the instruments to work and the limit values to be complied with."
"Laying down ambitious limit values for air quality and developing instruments for ensuring that they are complied with can improve air quality, and hence also quality of life, in Europe for years to come, and that is what we must aim to do."
"Finally, I must also extend thanks to Mr Jonas Sjöstedt, who, as a shadow rapporteur, worked with me at the end of the negotiations on the Euro 5 standard."
"I have not been here very long – only ten months – but I can tell you, Jonas, that you have in this time become a dear colleague to me."
"I wish you much success in your further career, and all the best."
"Mr President, I am not on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety but, like Mr Bowis, I represent London, the city traditionally known as the ‘Big Smoke’."
"London’s air today is still very polluted and is amongst the worst of any city in Europe."
"EU air pollution limits are significantly exceeded along London’s major road network, in Central London and around Heathrow Airport, where nitrogen dioxide is 50% above the limit, due to a combination of aeroplanes and vehicles."
"I welcome much that is positive in the new proposals and the Krahmer report, such as the streamlining of the law, greater public accessibility to monitoring results, new limits for fine particulates and stricter ones for other pollutants."
"However, I am very concerned about the effect in my city of postponing the deadlines, perhaps until 2018 instead of 2010, for hot spots."
"Londoners would be asked to trust the British Government or the Mayor of London to seek postponement when it is genuinely impossible to meet the 2010 deadlines."
"However, surely it comes down to political will to cut road and air traffic."
"One barrier between the UK Government and its goal of bulldozing through a third runway at Heathrow is EU air-quality limits, in particular nitrogen dioxide."
"I fear a long postponement will allow it to wriggle round those limits."
"I am surprised and somewhat disappointed that MEPs are being less progressive than EU governments, at least on the issue of deadlines."
"It is the first time in seven years in this House that I have found the Council more progressive than the European Parliament."
"I hope, for the sake of Londoners, that we will stick to deadlines that are as tight as possible."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we want to combat air pollution effectively and to get results in the area of health, then we have to adopt far more ambitious drafts in this House."
"The poor excuse about certain Member States encountering difficulties in implementing environmental legislation is no longer acceptable, because people’s health is no longer a matter for negotiation."
"The cost of diseases caused by air pollution is rising on a daily basis."
"The fact is that it is the authorities that are currently picking up the bill for health care, as the cost of this is not yet integrated into our budgets."
"What is more, economists estimate that the price of a gallon of oil, which currently stands at USD 3, will have to be increased to USD 10 in order to integrate the cost of health care and climate change."
"That is what would profoundly change the situation."
"The Union must not grow weak, Commissioner, on environmental policy, as its cunning game of simplifying and merging the European legal texts would suggest that it has a tendency to do."
"That is why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is calling for more binding approaches, particularly in relation to PM 2.5, and for the abolition of the derogations."
"The threat of an environmental disaster that hangs over us, ladies and gentlemen, requires drastic measures, and an example of this comes for once from the United States, where the State of California has provided food for thought by lodging a complaint against the largest car manufacturers for damage to the environment and public health."
"Finally, I would like to say a few words to our dear friend, Mr Sjöstedt."
"I believe that we are going to miss your perspective on matters at the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but we wish you well on the other side of the border, on the other side of the European Union."
"Take along with you, too, the message about protecting nature."
"Thank you."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, although pollutants in the air are difficult to see, they do nonetheless jeopardise our health."
"I need only say that the cost to the national health of these illnesses exceeds 10% of the gross national product."
"As far as the derogations are concerned, the best solution would be for there to be none."
"I should like at this point to emphasise our support for the relevant amendment, Amendment 73 by Mr Jonas Sjöstedt; if this amendment is rejected, Amendment 54 by Mrs Hassi safeguards the minimum period of time during which derogations will be permitted."
"We should emphasise that reducing the upper limit for concentrations of PM2.5 will certainly benefit European citizens."
"However, recent studies have shown that a reduction in the order of 25 µg/m3 would only reduce premature deaths by 4 500 whereas, if the reduction extended to 15 or 10 µg/m3, as the World Health Organisation proposes, premature deaths would be reduced by 13 000 and 22 000 respectively."
"It should be noted that one of the strongest points of legislation on air quality is that the limit value of 50 µg/m3 for maximum concentrations of PM10 must not be exceeded more than 35 times."
"The amendments supporting an increase in the number of days on which the limit may be exceeded from 35 to 55 significantly water down the directive, on the one hand and, on the other hand, do nothing to safeguard protection for public health and on this point I absolutely agree with the Commissioner."
"We owe you a debt of gratitude, Jonas, and I personally extend you my especial thanks, because you taught me a great deal as a new MEP here."
"Good luck for the future."
"Mr President, in the one minute I have at my disposal, I would like to point out that the Directive on air quality in Europe, together with amendments which significantly tighten up standards, treat the Member States that have only recently joined the Union on an equal footing as the so-called old Fifteen."
"The latter, however, have been implementing methods of reducing emissions of pollutants for a considerable time."
"According to estimates by the Polish Ministry of the Environment, we need an investment in excess of PLN 50 billion if we are to comply with the requirements laid down in the Directive."
"There would also be a significant increase in social and economic costs."
"For the poorer social classes, the increased cost of living could neutralise any benefits gained from better air quality."
"Their standard of living would fall as a result of poor diet, inability to access health care, and inability to maintain basic standards of hygiene, along with other environmental factors contributing to good health."
"‘Cleaner air for Europe’ – other approaches will not deal with the issue in the short term."
"That is why we are in favour of extending the time period in which the standards are to be met, especially for the new Member States."
"It is also the reason why we are opposed to stricter conditions for derogations."
"We shall vote against the restrictive amendments."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, my dear Jonas, I think the compromise we have reached here is a good one, with its combination of demanding targets and flexible apparatus."
"That is a good decision, combined as it is with a statement to the effect that there will be no free rides for those who – even if perhaps not by their own free choice – take no action on this front."
"The transport industry, for example, is set to grow by 60% over the next 20 years."
"Everyone who has spoken today has mentioned the importance of a clean environment, and that is why this does not just concern car manufacturers, but also the builders of heating systems; it has to do with power-generating plant and with loading systems – with, indeed, a really big and wide-ranging area that has to be addressed."
"The industry must come to understand that standards of this kind are ultimately an opportunity for it to sell modern technology throughout the world, and that is why car industries, and the manufacturers of other industrial equipment as well, must realise that these standards present them, today, with an opportunity to develop new technologies and work at research and innovation."
"This directive will also lead us to ask who, in future, will be researching into better fuels, for renewable fuels are not the only crucial issue; the question also arises of what fuels we are actually using now."
"If you put that question to the motor industry, the answer you will get is that they are not of high quality, but rather deficient."
"Heavy demands have been made of the car industry over recent years, but it has always had to run cars on relatively low-quality fuels, and that is something that must change over the next few years."
"In ten or fifteen years’ time we will be able to drive, using a litre of fuel, five times as far as we do today, and that is what makes innovation and research so significant; that, too, is why demanding environmental standards are called for."
"My dear Jonas, you have been a good colleague and have become a good friend."
"I wish you all the best for the future."
"Mr President, everyone has the right to a clean and healthy environment and nobody should endanger the health and lives of other people."
"This principle should be the cornerstone not just of our environmental policy, but of our would-be Constitution as well."
"People have the right to clean air, and politicians and industrialists have the responsibility to guarantee that right."
"Some decades ago, industry was the main cause of air pollution and the diseases connected with it."
"With technological changes, industry became less polluting but, as the number of cars increased, the situation did not improve."
"Eighty per cent of our citizens live in cities and for them the main cause of air pollution is traffic."
"During the PSE Group hearing on air pollution, we had clear evidence of this."
"If we want to provide cleaner air for our citizens, we should change our traffic policy in cities."
"In cities with polluted air we have to reduce individual car traffic and improve public transport."
"The strict pollution reduction targets, as proposed for particulate matter, can only be achieved in that way."
"That should be the main target, but we also have to reduce dangerous emissions from cars, with cleaner engines, fuels and filters, as indicated in the Euro 5 and Euro 6 proposals."
"When human lives are at stake, wishful thinking and soft recommendations are not enough."
"We need binding targets and strict regulations."
"Annual and daily limit values are also needed."
"Limit values must be low and strict but, on the other hand, they should reflect reality."
"It is better to lower them step by step than to set up unrealistic measures and allow them to be ignored."
"My last words are to Mr Sjöstedt: Jonas."
"Mr President, what the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has come up with is a feeble compromise, nothing more or less than an invitation to inaction, and if it is accepted, Europe’s clean air policy risks becoming a laughing stock."
"Many municipalities have already put in place ambitious policy measures for clean air, including such things as modernisation of their car fleets, environmental zones and so on, and so there should be no rewards for inactivity, yet that is precisely what the Committee on the Environment’s feeble compromise, with its extended deadline, would offer to them and to all those who have failed to do their homework."
"Just what do we think European law is for if we reward those who do nothing?"
"We have been talking about the more stringent standard for PM2.5."
"We know that 20 gets us nowhere, and nor does 25, so why not vote for the Greens’ ambitious proposal of 12?"
"I hope that we manage, tomorrow, to save European clean air policy from being thrown away, for it would be a source of shame if Europe were to cast aside its leadership role and risk denying industry – the motor industry in particular – a future."
"Air pollution kills over 350 000 people in Europe, 65 000 of them in Germany, and so it would be a good thing if we were to do more than just give out hot air."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to thank Mrs Weisgerber, who has shown so much understanding, has listened so much and has also worked out a sound compromise with Mr Krahmer and Mrs Corbey."
"I am indebted to them all."
"Mrs Corbey, you are in favour of strict and new source policy."
"I would like to say to Mrs Breyer and Mrs Hassi that in order to actually meet the air quality standards, we may be able to lay down strict standards on paper, but if we subsequently do not get the opportunity to achieve those technically speaking, then they are of no value."
"Moreover, the Netherlands is being criticised for wishing to speed up the introduction of soot filters."
"Well, if all of that is unacceptable, we should not prescribe any strict standards as we cannot meet them."
"I also know, and I am once again addressing Mrs Hassi when I say this – for Mr Blokland and Mr Maaten have said many things with which I am in total agreement – I also know why the Netherlands has voted in favour of this legislation."
"They did so because it gave them the opportunity of injecting some flexibility into a number of areas."
"That is the very reason why they voted in favour."
"What can one see, though, when one compares the Council’s position with that of Parliament?"
"Whilst the Ministers of the Environment may be able to sleep the sleep of the just for having laid down strict standards, they subsequently get home and are faced with an inquiry by the Environmental Agency which concludes that everything that was laid down on paper cannot be achieved at home at any rate."
"We should stop playing politics in that way."
"I have run out of excuses back home."
"That is also the reason why I endorse every detail of the compromise that was reached here in this House."
"‘Strict’ it may be, but we, in this House, say ‘yes’ to that, as long as it remains attainable."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, air quality is one of the keys to the success of sustainable development."
"Our fellow citizens know what effects the quality of the air can have on their health."
"They are rightly worried when a school is situated near a crossroads with heavy traffic."
"Parents are demanding that measures in relation to air quality be implemented because they want to know what kind of air their children are breathing."
"The Krahmer report is useful in that it gathers together various texts in just one directive, which should enable us to improve our approach to the problem."
"We are therefore trying to be ambitious faced with this issue of air quality."
"Yet, in order to know what the quality of the air is, we first have to measure it."
"That means relying on organisations that are as close to the area as possible, and that are familiar with the geography of the land being studied: they are the neighbourhood networks."
"We know that the displacement of pollution by wind interferes with this."
"We also know that mountain ranges have a role to play."
"Pollution moves and reaches areas that are not in themselves sources of pollution."
"Contrary to what is said in the explanatory statement, high levels of air pollution are not always recorded in densely populated urban areas."
"If this European policy is to be clear, however, it must above all be consistent and be part of an integrated approach to combating climate change."
"It is not enough to set limit values."
"We also need to know what to do with them."
"The fight against CO2 emissions is at the heart of the proposed systems."
"Allow me to refer to the regulation on motor vehicle emissions, the Euro 5 regulation."
"The consequences of applying this regulation are already well known."
"If we solve the emissions problem, on the one hand, we increase CO2 emissions, on the other, and, as we know, CO2 emissions are the cause of climate change."
"Thus, there are many contradictions in all of that."
"We therefore need to be flexible."
"There is no use in deciding on strict measures if they cannot be applied in the Member States."
"We must therefore take as much time as we need."
"I am specifically thinking about a prevention policy that will hinge on urban transport plans and on the development of clean technologies."
"Be that as it may, I should like to thank all of the rapporteurs for the compromise they have reached, which seems a good one to me."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission on its proposals and also the rapporteurs on having once again demonstrated their major commitment to the environment."
"Of course people want ever cleaner air and a high level of protection."
"The very same people say, however – and this has been shown in many surveys – that they are not prepared to foot the bill for such a level of protection, and that means that we have to take a balanced view when adopting measures."
"I am surprised at the amount of space that the report devotes to agriculture."
"I sincerely believe that it is far too little for a sector that is increasingly beleaguered and which, moreover, fulfils a number of functions that have a positive effect on the environment and social cohesion."
"In relation to the maritime transport sector, I agree with the aim of achieving a level playing field, but I also believe it is important to work within the International Maritime Organisation to designate the new sulphur emission control areas; otherwise, we shall drive part of the European fleet to register in non-EU countries where controls are virtually non-existent."
"I should also have liked to see rather more ambitious measures regarding vehicles, the prime causes of pollution in cities and of dependence on foreign sources of energy."
"I should like to hear the Commission’s opinion on this, because I believe that cleaner vehicles would dramatically improve air quality in cities."
"Lastly, it is important to continue implementing and developing the directive on the integrated prevention and control of pollution."
"This directive will allow industries to continue innovating and to control their emissions more effectively, without forcing any plant closures."
"To conclude, I would ask the Commission to use flexibility and common sense when implementing all these proposals that have been put to us today."
"Mr President, as a Hungarian MEP, I am particularly sensitive to the current debate about air pollution."
"My place of work, Brussels, as well as my home, Budapest, both figure among the darkest spots on the map of European air pollution."
"With regard to suspended particles, for instance, Budapest had already exceeded threshold values within the first four months of the year, and it is not uncommon to see levels rise to 4-5 times the maximum."
"This has been going on for many years, without the least sign of improvement."
"Yet the harmful effect of fine particles on health is a fact."
"A European resident loses on average eight months of his or her life as a result."
"In the case of Budapest’s inhabitants, however, this loss is as high as three years."
"For this reason, I welcome the new thematic strategy on air pollution, as well as the regulation of fine particles."
"However, regulation does not achieve anything if its enforcement is not guaranteed."
"We cannot expect local communities to do more than they are really able."
"But we must expect them to do at least that much."
"It is obvious that air pollution is strongly influenced by numerous external causes, including the weather, for instance."
"This does not mean, however, that with proper urban planning and the development of public transport networks, we may not achieve significant improvements."
"Thus, it is extremely important that only those communities be given extensions on observing the threshold values which have truly made every possible effort."
"We must ensure that not a single European city should experience what is going on in Budapest today; namely that despite the European obligations in this regard for all these years, the municipal government still does not have a strategy for improving air quality."
"That is, they do not even have any idea how they might come closer to observing the limits that are so essential for ensuring public health."
"It seems to me that we have to offer the citizens of Europe a more attractive alternative than the masks that cyclists in China are compelled to wear."
"."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank all the speakers for their important contributions to this discussion."
"As a closing remark, I would like to restate the importance of continued action to tackle air pollution."
"The adverse health impacts, lost economic productivity and damage to environmental quality are still much too great."
"Some have criticised the strategy from one angle, some from another angle."
"Some consider that the proposed flexibility goes too far, others think that this flexibility is too little."
"We will be reviewing the strategy to see what progress has been made and how much further we can get towards the objectives of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme."
"I understand the concern expressed by those who want to see more Community pollution abatement measures so that the strategy’s objective and air quality standards can be met."
"I think that there is a consensus between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the measures required."
"In fact, the Commission has already undertaken much of the preparatory work, the fruits of which will be seen in the months to come."
"As a result, I do not believe that there is any need for an interinstitutional agreement in this area."
"On Amendments 30 and 81, I understand the concerns of those who call for more flexibility in implementing the existing air quality legislation."
"However, one cannot have flexibility without weakening the legislation."
"I think the Commission’s proposal of five years from the entry into force of the limit values strikes the right balance and the Commission cannot support any further weakening beyond that."
"By way of explanation, according to the Commission proposal, the time extension will go up to the end of 2009; according to the general approach of the Council it will go up to 2010; and according to the rapporteurs’ amendment it will go up to 2013."
"So there is a difference on this point."
"It is four years plus two from the entry into force of the new directive."
"I understand this to be the proposal tabled before this plenary."
"On Amendments 46 and 82, I should provide some further clarification about the daily limit value of PM10."
"This protects sensitive individuals against the impact from short-term exposure to particles in the air."
"It is different from the annual limit value, which provides protection to all from long-term exposure."
"One cannot simply substitute a more stringent annual limit value for the daily limit."
"This is what the health experts say."
"The key to ensuring compliance with both daily and annual limits is to undertake good and timely air quality assessments and to take the necessary steps to reduce emissions."
"It is clear that many authorities have not done this and now they have compliance problems."
"On Amendments 49 and 50, the proposed concentration cap for PM2.5 is set at a level consistent with the stringency of the annual limit value for PM10, which the Commission is not proposing to change."
"It is also useful to remember that the Commission has proposed two ways of tackling PM2.5: the concentration cap of 25 micrograms per cubic metre and the exposure-reduction approach, where average levels in urban areas will be reduced over ten years."
"These methods combined will work to deliver health improvements."
"Our modelling work, which underpins the thematic strategy and the air quality proposal, shows that greater health improvements can be obtained by allowing the Member States to choose where to reduce pollution levels."
"This is the aim of the exposure reduction targets."
"This flexibility will be limited if the concentration cap forces Member States to divert resources to ensure compliance in some specific hotspot regions, where few health improvements may be available."
"For public health, a general reduction in exposure is preferable."
"In summary, on the air quality legislative proposal, I am pleased to say that the Commission can support 32 amendments, in part or in principle."
"I shall give Parliament’s Secretariat a list detailing the Commission’s position on the amendments(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m."
"The Commission can accept fully, in part, or in principle Amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19, 21, 23, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 65 and 80."
"The Commission reserves its position on Amendments 54, 56, 58, 61, 62, 63, 66 and 75."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 5, 7, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 28, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 43, 46, 51, 52, 53, 55, 57, 59, 60, 64, 67 to 74, 76 to 79 and 81 to 84."
"The next item is the report by Mr Hegi on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the thematic strategy on the urban environment. [2006/2061(INI)] (A6-0233/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, some 80 % of our citizens live in urban areas, but their needs and interests are strongly under-represented in Union funds, projects and initiatives."
"As regards the level of EU funding, these city dwellers are second-rate citizens of the European Union."
"The thematic strategy on the urban environment should be a brave and progressive initiative, not just a lukewarm recommendation of wishful thinking."
"Sadly, the Commission document on that subject is rather weak."
"The Sixth Environmental Action Plan has set encouraging goals, but this time the Commission failed to propose legally binding measures and deadlines."
"The Commission does not attempt to balance European policy between urban and rural areas and does not have any vision for a cleaner urban environment."
"I cannot do the job of the whole Commission, but I can at least try to propose some useful measures."
"Firstly, I propose that a sustainable urban management plan and a sustainable urban transport plan should be required by Community law for every agglomeration with more than 100 000 inhabitants, as proposed by the Commission in 2004."
"Representatives of European cities have expressed their satisfaction with my proposal."
"Those kinds of binding measures make life easier for environment-conscious city councils, as they have legal bases for action on the environment."
"As far as transport is concerned, non-motorised transport should have priority over every other kind of traffic, public transport over private, small and less-polluting cars over other vehicles."
"Congestion charging, as used in London and Stockholm, is a success at present."
"It is the only possible future for every large European city."
"The referendum some days ago in Stockholm showed us that people liked the idea and only a minority of certain lobbyists oppose it."
"I am also proposing a 5% shift in passenger kilometre from individual transport – namely cars – to public transport and cycling."
"Speed limits in city centres, such as in Graz, Austria, reduce accidents, save lives and reduce air pollution and noise emissions."
"Low emission zones are also useful in combating air pollution."
"If we really want to do something about climate change, we should act in our cities as well."
"As the English say, ‘charity begins at home’."
"That should also apply to sustainable development."
"Due to climate change, heatwaves turn many towns and cities into hell during the hot summer days and nights."
"Heatwaves kill thousands of European citizens and they die a painful and humiliating death."
"Heatwave emergency plans are crucial for most European cities, except in some Nordic communities."
"The basic treatment for heatwaves is simple: more water, green roofs and facades, fresh water and natural cooling systems, reducing car traffic."
"Hot summers are coming and we should save the lives of city dwellers."
"We need more green spaces in our cities."
"Even some ten square metres of green islands can improve the spirit of a city, together with bigger parks and gardens nearby."
"Summertime urban beaches like those in Paris, Brussels and Budapest are also useful projects for those who cannot leave the city on long vacations."
"In both old and new Member States, tens of millions of people live in mass-produced, prefabricated housing estates."
"In many western cities these have become ethnic and social ghettos."
"Complex social, cultural, educational and environmental programmes are needed to rehabilitate those suburbs."
"In Central Europe, in Hungary for instance, most of those housing estates have not yet become ghettos."
"The majority of their dwellers still belong to the lower and middle classes."
"In their case, the physical state of the housing is worrying."
"In the EU-10 countries the repair and rehabilitation of housing estates is a crucial step forward in preserving social peace and improving city life."
"As rapporteur, I accepted many amendments tabled by my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group in the hope of good cooperation."
"I was rather surprised that the PPE-DE Group then tried to kill my report by deleting all the important targets and measures in committee."
"I call upon all Members to support the importance of binding targets and measures."
"Without them our work is just words, words, words."
"My report can be summed up in one sentence: less cars, more green and water."
"That is the only survival strategy for our cities."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in this evening's debate on the thematic strategy on the urban environment, which the European Parliament has been waiting for from the Commission with particular interest."
"I should like to start by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Hegyi, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for the full and ambitious report being examined today."
"I also welcome the contribution by Mr Ó Neachtain and the Committee on Transport and Tourism and by Mrs Kallenbach and the Committee on Regional Development."
"Before I continue, I should like to share with you the welcome news that the Commissioners approved the seventh and final thematic strategy on soil last Friday."
"The preparation of these strategies was difficult and time-consuming. However, a clear way forward has now been identified for topical environmental issues, which include the policy on the urban environment."
"The urban environment is an important issue for us all."
"With the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, the Commission recognised the role which the urban environment plays in the lives of so many European citizens and undertook to take action in this sector."
"The urban environment directly affects the way of life of millions of European citizens and also has important repercussions on the environment in general."
"European cities must be viable, sustainable and offer high quality of life, so that citizens will want to live and work there and companies will invest."
"Nonetheless, a great deal of effort still needs to be made in this respect."
"Clearly urban areas promote economic growth and have high levels of supply of and access to public services, such as education, health and transport."
"The reverse side of the coin, however, is the myriad problems relating to life in the city, such as the deterioration in the environment, traffic congestion, economic and social exclusion, crime and alienation."
"The purpose of the strategy in question is to promote and facilitate sustainable urban growth, focusing on environmental issues such as air pollution, external noise, high levels of traffic, emissions of greenhouse gases, chaotic building development, water consumption and waste generation."
"The problems were easy to identify, but finding solutions to them was very difficult."
"This mainly applies when the objective is to find solutions which can be tried and are viable and suitable for the plethora and variety of conditions and problems in the various cities of the European Union."
"That is why, despite the fact that the European Commission and the Committee on the Environment agree in substance, they disagree on the way forward."
"Some people have called for more legislation and targets which will bring about improvements."
"I can understand that from a theoretical point of view and agree in principle."
"I wish that it were in fact possible for us to proceed in this manner."
"Unfortunately, this is not useful or feasible and there are basic reasons why the strategy is not in favour of introducing new legislation."
"To be specific, the reason is that solutions must comply with the principle of subsidiarity and our cities are so different from each other that there is no common solution for them all."
"We already have legislative acts which would have positive results on the urban environment if they were properly applied."
"We already have legislation which has a positive impact on the environment and the quality of life in cities."
"Just think, for example, of all the legislation we have on ambient air quality, noise, waste and water, to mention just a few of the issues covered."
"Nonetheless, this legislation must be applied better."
"Instead of legislative solutions, the strategy proposes guidance on how to improve the management of urban areas in an integrated manner and increase sustainability in the transport which will be included in the Green Paper on urban transport which is expected to be approved in 2007."
"This will lead to better compliance with current environmental legislation and to improved cohesion between the various political and the various administrative levels."
"This is the approach which all the interested parties which we consulted clearly and repeatedly stated they preferred."
"This approach will be supplemented by other support measures, such as creating suitable structures, exchanging best practices and setting up incentives under the Community Structural Funds."
"The Member States should include urban environmental issues in national programmes for funding under the Community cohesion policy, so that regional and local authorities can benefit from the funding opportunities available."
"."
"Mr President, as draftsman of this report on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I believe that the policy initiatives in the European Commission’s Green Paper on energy should be integrated into sustainable urban transport plans, particularly with respect to the promotion of biofuels."
"Sufficient support needs to be given to the development of public transport using sustainable energy sources."
"In Ireland alone, transport is the third largest contributor to CO2 emissions."
"Biofuels should represent 5.75% of our energy supply by 2010."
"In real terms, for example, again in my own country, Ireland, 70 000 fossil fuel-burning cars will be taken off the roads."
"Urban centres running public transport on biofuels have the opportunity to showcase the ease of use of those fuels, which will in turn increase demand from private companies such as taxis, and individual domestic use."
"In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is only through a policy of integration in the areas of energy efficiency and environmental protection that realistic targets can be set and achieved for urban areas."
". – Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Hegyi for his very ambitious report and for the very good and fruitful cooperation."
"On behalf of the Regional Development Committee, I am particularly glad to see the particular attention given to sustainable town and transport planning."
"It is self-evident that future urban planning must combine the ecological with the economic and social dimensions, including within it the creation of job vacancies and the promotion of education, culture and sport for both young and old."
"We must, once and for all, reduce land use and re-use brownfield sites."
"We call on the Member States and regions to take this into account when drawing up – as they are now doing – their operational programmes, for this will not only benefit the local environment, but will also be an outstanding means of communicating the goals of European policy to men and women on the street, and it is certainly high time they were made aware of them."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, particularly on his willingness to engage in dialogue."
"What I would say to him is that I know that, fundamentally we both want the same thing – an environment worth living in in the big cities and conurbations of the European Union, but it is evident that our opinions diverge completely when it comes to how this goal is to be achieved."
"Personally, I think the Commission’s approach is the right one: a thematic strategy and nothing more, and no legislative proposals, since we are not, in any case, empowered to make any."
"We can, of course, publish guidelines referring to existing provisions on such things as air, noise, waste, and so on; we can encourage the sharing of experience and support it, including financially, for we know that not everyone has to keep on reinventing the wheel."
"The rapporteur is trying to save Budapest, his home city, and that is an honourable thing to do, but he is also trying to circumvent the subsidiarity principle."
"He wants binding legal measures; he wants to tamper with local and regional authorities’ powers over planning matters and intervene in that area."
"I have to tell him that that is wrong; if you do that, you stir up public disaffection with the European Union."
"There are, then, a number of things about this report that my group and I want to see changed."
"For example, important though the protection of the environment is, it must not have the end result of making life impossible for businesses; the quality of urban life is dependent on the quality of the environment and on economic vitality."
"Nor, as I see it, does a congestion charge solve anything."
"Yes, of course there is a need for environmentally-friendly modes of transport, such as buses, trains, bicycles, and so on, but it would be wrong to ban cars, which are a means of transport for individuals, from cities."
"All that would do would be to encourage shopping centres on greenfield sites and the depopulation of the countryside, with people leaving the towns, inner cities becoming wastelands, and the quality of urban living declining."
"Nor is there any sense in demanding of cities things that they are quite simply incapable of managing – things such as the collection of data, even on the local use of biocides, a category which, let me remind Mr Hegyi, includes the flea powder that I use on my dog!"
"That sort of thing makes us look ridiculous."
"We have to ensure that the subsidiarity principle is maintained; that is what I see our role as being, and that is the intention underlying our amendments."
". – Mr President, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Hegyi, on the work he has done."
"We have here a report that asks the right questions and that offers some good answers."
"This report highlights the need for consistency and cooperation, something that some Members call the ‘integrated approach’ and that the European Commission communication echoes."
"We need an overall view so as to better understand the urban environment challenge, particularly in social, cultural and environmental terms."
"I approve of the emphasis given in this report to a number of fundamental points: exchanging best practices and promoting the training of local players; controlling the growing volume of traffic and decoupling transport growth and GDP growth; encouraging people to save energy and improving the energy efficiency of buildings; making the implementation of sustainable urban management plans and sustainable urban transport plans compulsory for every urban area with more than 100 000 inhabitants; and, finally, proposing a per capita target in relation to green areas in new urban developments."
"I believe that we do, however, need to find the right balance between giving instructions to the Member States and giving the power of initiative to local players, because they represent a breeding ground for innovation, having, as they do, first-hand experience of the realities of urban life."
"Our aim must in fact be to create a framework that will give rise to local initiatives by leaving the choice of targets and solutions up to local decision-makers."
". – Mr President, many thanks to the rapporteur for this splendid report."
"I also appreciate the way he has taken up an idea that matters a great deal to me, that being the idea of a new pact, of a new quality of cooperation between the European level on the one hand and the great cities in Europe on the other."
"In Europe, 80% of people live in towns."
"If we want to make progress in areas such as the conservation of resources, energy policy, air quality and so on, one thing that is absolutely necessary is closer integration of the policies made in cities and those made at the European level."
"What is needed, then, is better use of the European Union’s financial instruments, including, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank."
"The last thing I want to say is addressed to you, Mrs Sommer: even Governor Schwarzenegger and his conservatives in California have moved on further than you have."
"What he has done with the automobile industry in its present form is to unmask it before all the world for what it is, namely a bunch of crooks who should be up before a judge."
"Your self-appointed role as this House’s resident lobbyist for the German car industry is something I find almost shameful in someone who claims to want to preserve nature."
"."
"Mr President, in former times, countries were preponderantly rural and cities were the exception."
"The growth in population and the advent of urban professions have changed this dramatically over the past century to the extent that the large majority of Europeans now live in real cities, in suburbs and in rural areas that have been urbanised to a large extent due to industry, ports or mining."
"In the developing world, but also in parts of Europe, we notice that such urban areas can become completely unviable on account of traffic chaos, slums, pollution and land speculation."
"Where clean drinking water, a dense network of frequent public transport, sound waste removal and affordable, good housing are absent, or health care, social work and education are inadequate, those cities become hell."
"As soon as cities go downhill, well-educated people on high incomes can move away from the area, but labourers and immigrants have no choice but to stay."
"To this day, national and European policy is based on the increase in the number of cars and cut-backs in public services."
"That is putting the future of our cities at risk."
"It is right and proper that the EU’s attention that was originally focused on agricultural production and the countryside should, in recent years, have shifted to the cities."
"There was also a downside to this, unfortunately."
"If the Commission’s proposal from 2000 for a contract obligation for urban transport had been adopted without any amendments, this would have prejudiced the extension of tram networks and free public transport, as well as the creation of a dense and frequent transport network."
"It is cities and regions themselves that should, as far as possible, be responsible for regulating city transport, physical planning, urban development, open space planning and bicycle paths."
"Where the European Union can add value, though, is in areas like research, and in the exchange and transfer of knowledge."
"In that way, we can control dangers and abuses, promote initiatives for improvement and reinforce the development of, and compliance with, better environmental standards."
"Particularly in the future Member States Romania and Bulgaria, much needs to be done in this area."
"I support Mr Hegyi in his striving towards non-polluting transport, the protection of historic city centres, the adoption of careful water management, economical energy consumption and protection for areas of natural beauty."
"Mr President, I thank Mr Hegyi for his report and for accepting a number of amendments that I put forward."
"I hope that he will likewise accept the amendments that my colleague, Renate Sommer, has put forward, in the sense that Europe is at its best when it is sharing good practice."
"It is geared to sharing good practice between Member States and between local authorities."
"The amendments are intended to make sure that this is directed to them and that the Commission is not called on to do everything for them."
"If we can get that straight, then we will be able to support the very good ideas in the report as a whole."
"Our constituents are rightly worried about many aspects of the urban environment."
"We have just had a debate on air quality: that is very central to it."
"However, it is more than that; it is the noise that we have to put up with in the urban environment, from neighbours as well as from vehicles, from ghetto blasters and so on. This is not territory for European directives, but we can share best practice as to how to tackle it."
"Similarly, street cleaning and the sheer dirt of our cities are a public health issue that ought to be on our agenda."
"We can learn from each other."
"Just as one sees in Paris the gutters running with water at night to clean them, there are ideas all over Europe."
"We want to see the phasing-out of crime as part of our strategy for urban areas, with emphasis on designing estates which avoid those traps for citizens where they can be pounced on by wrongdoers, making sure that we have safe routes to railway stations, and so on. We must also ensure that we have sensible development alongside our rivers to avoid building on flood plains and the disasters that can cause."
"There are many good ideas in this report with opportunities to share best practice and that is what could come from this."
"I hope the Commissioner will take it forward in that spirit."
"– Mr President, I wish to thank all those colleagues who contributed to this report in the hope that it will be adopted."
"Especially those, of course, who agreed with most of my ideas."
"As regards subsidiarity, I think my views are somewhat different."
"We are not talking about a directive here, but rather about a strategic proposal."
"Therefore, we should not water down our demands at this time."
"When the time comes to draft directives, we will face a long process of negotiation in any case."
"By the way, I have met with representatives of European cities and local authorities and with staff members of Eurocity, who came to see me at the European Parliament building."
"What they expected from me was precisely that binding measures be included as much as possible so that they can carry out their environmentally-friendly ideas better with support from the European Union, since there are obviously other interests to be considered in the cities."
"It is also very important not to let this strategic proposal get lost in the shuffle."
"That is why in one of the paragraphs I have put forward the need for a follow-up on this report within the framework of intra-institutional consultation."
"Luckily, this proposal had the support of all the parties in the House."
"I am therefore asking Commissioner Dimas to allow me the opportunity next week or at another time to discuss how to proceed with the follow-up of this report, beyond its adoption by the European Parliament."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers for their positive and constructive contributions."
"This strategy is an important step towards more sustainable urban development."
"It is a response to the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and a key contribution to improving the everyday lives of Europe’s citizens."
"I am pleased that Parliament will soon adopt a resolution that recognises the importance of urban issues for citizens of the European Union."
"I think, despite some differences on how to tackle this important challenge, the Commission and Parliament have a common view and understanding on the key issues, namely on substance and effects."
"While the Commission believes that an approach based on guidance, incentives and the dissemination of best practice is the way to proceed, it will, however, monitor the effectiveness of the strategy and undertake reviews from time to time to see how it helps address this important challenge."
"The Commission will report to Parliament on the results of this monitoring."
"I hope that Parliament can adopt a resolution supporting the strategy’s aims and objectives."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m."
"– Cities play a key role in generating wealth: economic, social and cultural development constitute a driving force for growth and employment."
"Efficient urban planning, pragmatic development of urban environmental models and tools with an integrated approach and an exchange of best practices help cities ensure sustainable development and reconcile economic, social and environmental challenges, and they also contribute to the health and well-being of EU citizens."
"These actions, based on comprehensive policies with clear, concrete, measurable targets and frameworks, must be sustainable, future-oriented and supported by adequate EU funds."
"For the urban environment – being a wide, comprehensive and constantly changing issue – a flexible approach is needed, and so emphasis must be placed on research which could be included in the 7th Framework Programme on Research."
"Among the wide variety of priority targets we find some of the most important challenges."
"One of these is adopting measures to reduce land use, and in particular limiting greenfield and extending brownfield developments in urban development programmes in order to protect green spaces."
"Sustainable urban public transport, the progressive introduction of environmentally-friendly modes of transport and technologies, and promoting the use of public and non-motorised transport rather than private cars are just some examples of the main priorities."
"The European Commission with the help of, Parliament and Council, produces many strategies meant to give guidance and disseminate best practise."
"To ensure a European Urban Strategy is taken seriously is challenging."
"The financial interests in urban planning and development are such that it will take more than suggestions to ensure what we do now leads to safe liveable cities in the future."
"Rather than the Strategy including a statement that green space is important to urban design, I think it better to state we need, say, 15% green space in urban areas or so many metres per 1000 population."
"Only a real target with weight behind it will stand up against land hungry developers."
"In my constituency is a public housing area built 30 years ago."
"Planned in a way foreseen by this Strategy, there is ample green space, wide easy to negotiate roads and community infrastructure."
"This area has been a model of good practise and has served a community very well."
"However, this area is threatened by city planners looking to build houses."
"Only an urban strategy spelling out actual percentages will create sufficient green spaces in cities, and prevent the elimination of those presently enjoyed."
"The next item is the report (A6-0280/2006), by Mr Ferber on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004: Section I – European Parliament [N6-0027/2005 C6-0357/2002 2005/2091 (DEC)]."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps I might observe at the outset that it is stated in the report we are about to discuss, and on which we will be voting tomorrow, that we are giving discharge to the President of Parliament, and so I think it highly regrettable that the President of this House is not present for our deliberations today."
"I would like to point out that he is under a particular obligation to be present."
"Although we had in fact completed the discharge procedure for this House’s 2004 budget back in April, careful reading of the local paper here in Strasbourg brought to light something that, in terms of its drama, certainly takes some beating."
"I think it unacceptable that, even though the House authorities were informed by the city of Strasbourg as long ago as November 2005 that the latter still had to conduct negotiations in respect of the two buildings – known as IPE 1 and IPE 2 – with a Dutch pension fund, both the House authorities and the Bureau pressed on with the purchase negotiations and it was only our own initiative that prevented the deal going through."
"Moreover, what we have managed to find out from investigating this – and it is on this that I would like to concentrate in the little time remaining to me – makes for a pretty interesting tale."
"Back in 1979, when direct elections were introduced, the European Parliament decided that it needed office space."
"There can be no objection to that."
"It asked the city of Strasbourg to make such space available – and there is nothing objectionable about that either."
"The city of Strasbourg decided that it could not afford to do that itself, so it commissioned a third party – the Dutch pension fund to which I have referred – to build an office block."
"What resulted from this was a sub-letting arrangement, with us ending up paying the city of Strasbourg between EUR 30 and EUR 60 million – depending on which study one consults – more in rent than it, in turn, was paying to the pension fund, even though this House’s Committee on Budgets and the Quaestors had, in 1980, insisted that no more be paid from then on to the city of Strasbourg that it itself was paying to the pension fund."
"It was this House’s Bureau that, in 1983, reviewed the acceptability of the rent charged and devised a new system of calculation based on comparability, on which basis the rent was calculated anew, and, since it was during the 1980s that inflation in France was at its height, the city of Strasbourg wanted the lease index-linked, albeit without any limit of time."
"This has led us, in the report which I have the honour of presenting today, to two basic conclusions."
"The first is that, with effect from 1983 at the latest, the authorities charged with the management of this wonderful building, the European Parliament, stopped doing anything about the leases that they had concluded with the city of Strasbourg."
"That is unacceptable, for, to give a quite specific example, one consequence of the introduction of the euro is that index-linking has become meaningless."
"The second conclusion – and this is something I want to spell out plainly – is that the city of Strasbourg, which provides the European Parliament with a home, has given no kind of example of good and trusting cooperation between the institution and the city."
"All our audits have established that there has been no corruption, no fraud, no mismanagement, no misappropriation of funds."
"I very much regret the absence of the honourable Member who has been known to sit here wearing a gas mask and claiming that the place stank of corruption."
"It was not for us to judge whether or not it was wise that the European treaties should lay down where the seat of Parliament was to be."
"There is a lady Member who lives in Brussels and no doubt has a miserable time of it in the youth hostel when she comes to Strasbourg; I also very much regret her absence, not to mention the fact that she has contributed nothing by way of input to this report."
"What we were required to do was to go through what had happened in the past, and that is what we have done."
"My warm thanks go to all the Members who have played their part in this."
"We were not, however, called upon to decide where the European Parliament’s seat should be, which is a matter for the infinite wisdom of the Heads of State or Government, and I am sure we all know that the issue is safe in their hands."
"So, then, many thanks from me to all who have had a hand in this, combined with sadness that there were so many who sought to turn this into a media campaign without, however, taking any part in the real work that was done by the working party and in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"All these observations notwithstanding, and with suggestions for the future, we are giving discharge for 2004."
"We will, however, be discussing further developments in future reports as and when this proves necessary."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferber."
"The main conclusion of the investigation into the allegations on the two Strasbourg buildings is that there is no indication of illegality."
"In this sense, therefore, the allegations were unfounded."
"However, a number of findings have emerged that, although not illegal, should be stressed here today."
"The first is that there was indeed an excessive payment of rent in the order of between EUR 32 million and as much as EUR 60 million."
"Secondly, the City of Strasbourg acted in breach of trust when it did things which it knew would never have been acceptable to Parliament, such as keeping part of the rent payments and negotiating a cut of EUR 29 million from the purchase price."
"Thirdly, the administration of the European Parliament was also found to be lacking, because over a long period of 30 years it failed in its duty of diligence to ensure that the rent that was paid to Strasbourg for the buildings was not excessive."
"Finally, the European Parliament was not united on this issue, for how else can one explain the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control was informed of the allegations well over a month after the Bureau of Parliament itself?"
"How else can one explain that, even as our investigation was taking place, our Bureau continued to negotiate the purchase of the buildings, thereby undermining the political authority of the investigation itself?"
"Although none of these points constitute unlawful acts, they surely cannot be condoned, still less repeated."
"Mr President, I shall not be addressing you today in my capacity as the official PSE Group shadow, so I shall not be taking my three minutes’ speaking time."
"I only wish to say that I support the conclusions of the Ferber report."
"This report argues that there is in fact a breach of faith between the City of Strasbourg and this institution."
"This is something I can wholeheartedly support."
"Two public institutions dealing with public money should behave in a way that is not only legally just but also ethically and morally acceptable."
"After having participated in this working party, I find that in the tripartite negotiations one party has consistently acted according to those ethically just principles, and one party, namely the City of Strasbourg, has not."
"I have become known in my short time in this Parliament as one of the leaders of the anti-Strasbourg campaign."
"I am not used to using words like ‘anti-’ because basically I do not like the way it rings."
"I have tried my utmost to avoid mixing up the discussions on Parliament’s seat with the discussions on whether tax money has been well spent."
"I would like to put it to Parliament today that the only people who have consistently mixed up these two debates have been, firstly, the Mayor of Strasbourg, who, when she addressed us during her hearing, reminded us that having such a debate was in fact quite dangerous because the Alsace region has a very symbolic meaning."
"I am absolutely convinced that this is true and I totally agree."
"That is why I should like to use this short time in the sitting today to ask the City of Strasbourg – if what it says is really true and if it really believes that this is a region that deserves to be honoured – why is it that since 1979 it has consistently acted in a way that, to put it mildly, is inconsistent with that aim?"
"These are two public institutions that are trying to do the best for their citizens."
"I stand here because I wish to ensure that the money that Dutch citizens pay into the account of the European Union is well spent."
"I should just like to point out that, according to the auditors’ report, it has not been well spent and that this has in fact been, to put it mildly, ..."
"."
"Mr President, the 2004 discharge was certainly marked by a strange turn of events."
"If it had not been for a newspaper article that appeared just before the discharge date, drawing attention to the compensation element involved in the purchase of two new buildings in Strasbourg, we probably would have simply granted discharge in April."
"Once the report was out in the open, the administration reacted entirely appropriately by cancelling the purchase of those two buildings."
"I also have to say that the Committee on Budgets reacted very adequately by immediately setting up an internal committee of inquiry to examine all aspects of the case."
"I can only say that in this process and in that committee of inquiry, Mr Ferber has played a star role, and all credit to him for that."
"The committee of inquiry has also done a good job within a short space of time."
"The conclusion that I have drawn, like others – so at the risk of going over old ground – is that there was a relationship of trust between two public institutions, between the City of Strasbourg and the European Parliament which, as a result of this issue, has been dealt a huge blow."
"The fact that two public institutions make profits on each other’s backs is inexcusable, since it is still taxpayers’ money that is involved."
"Legally, however, everything is watertight, and so there is little we can recoup from it."
"In my view, the Ferber report is right to conclude that the purchase of buildings, subject to a number of conditions – provided that the price is right and we purchase land and buildings at the same time – is still the best option for the taxpayer."
"I subscribe to that view and I think that that is set to happen shortly."
"I should also like to point out that this purchase of the building is completely unrelated to the issue of seats."
"As Mr Ferber has already said, a decision by Heads of Government could change this."
"Parliament may have its own view, but is not in a position to change anything."
"What matters are the taxpayers’ interests."
"I believe that if the price is right, in the long run, and even in the relatively short term, it would be cheaper than carrying on paying rent."
"A discharge is always about the past."
"Apart from the buildings, the report also contains a whole list of interesting things with recommendations for the future."
"It contains useful recommendations about the contracts that have to be given to parliamentary assistants, as well as about the new opportunities which communications technologies offer us, with which I, myself, endeavour to get to grips on a daily basis."
"As for the general conclusions, I can confirm that my group broadly endorses Mr Ferber’s views."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to single out two sections of Mr Ferber’s excellent report: the buildings policy and the voluntary pension fund."
"Turning to the buildings policy first, about which all speakers have had something to say, we now have before us a second report as a result of that article in the press."
"A special working party was set up, in which, I believe, we all worked very hard and very well together, and in which we tried to give Mr Ferber maximum support."
"The conclusions are therefore identical across the board, and most Members have quoted them."
"We have been unable to identify any unlawful actions or corruption, but what we do know is that, over the past 20 years, the European Parliament has paid the City of Strasbourg quite a bit over the odds in rent, at least EUR 32 million and probably more, between EUR 42 and EUR 60 million."
"What is also unacceptable in my view is that the City of Strasbourg took the unilateral decision at one point to set aside EUR 11 million over that period for what it referred to as covering the risk of Parliament ever leaving its seat in this City."
"These actions have dealt the relationship between the City of Strasbourg and the European Parliament a heavy blow, and it comes as no surprise, then, that this has cranked up the entire debate on Parliament’s seat."
"Whilst I am aware that this is not what this discharge report is about, I do think that Parliament should, in a recommendation to the Council, finally make up its mind and say whether it wants to continue to have its seat in this city or not."
"Finally, I should like to mention the voluntary pension fund, which is another important aspect of Mr Ferber’s report."
"At the end of 2004, that fund suffered an insurance deficit to the tune of EUR 43 million, which, fortunately, dropped to EUR 28 million by the end of 2005."
"I should like to draw attention to my Amendment 5, which expressly states that Parliament itself can never be held liable for that deficit."
"It is a voluntary pension fund, one that is managed by the managers."
"As such, it is they who should be saddled with any deficits, not Parliament or the taxpayer."
"It is the managers who are responsible for the unethical, or incorrect, management of vast amounts of money."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Ferber for his work, notably for having succeeded in drawing up a report that is competent and to the point on the basis of scant information."
"A number of general comments concerning the control system and method of controlling implementation of the European Union’s budget come to mind in the context of the debate on discharge."
"I note with regret that the control system is rather general and superficial."
"Much is said about the reliability of ledgers, the number of errors, and the inadequacies of the control system."
"General remarks of this kind are repeated again and again, but in fact we do not have a full understanding of how the Union’s budget is implemented."
"Issues such as those concerning the Strasbourg buildings and before that the Eurostat affair and similar irregularities tend to be identified by the press."
"The control system is not helpful in this."
"The system needs to be rethought, to ensure it is more targeted and specific, and perhaps more akin to the system used by national control departments, which is more effective that the Union’s system."
"."
"Mr President, I am eternally grateful to this august institution for allowing me a miserly one and a half minutes to comment on the discharge of the budget for 2004."
"Given that the report describes this Parliament as ‘the democratic representative body in the EU’, let everyone be clear about just how little it deserves that description."
"We do not have debates in this institution, but tightly controlled and orchestrated speaking time without the opportunity for reply, hence the empty Chamber this evening."
"We simply go through the motions in what is a pale shadow of a parliament."
"It acts as a fig leaf of democratic respectability, designed to mislead the people of Europe into thinking that they have some say in the management of the so-called European project."
"There can be no better example of this than the one million signature petition calling for an end to the utterly pointless and grotesquely expensive monthly pilgrimage to Strasbourg."
"Ignoring this entreaty from the people we are supposed to represent, this Parliament is seriously considering purchasing these buildings and making this bizarre arrangement permanent."
"It is all very well for this report to question the City of Strasbourg’s good faith, but the reality is that the City ..."
"Mr President, I should just like to point out that Mr Titford from the UK Independence Party just gave one of the most passionate arguments for a European Constitution: he was supporting the initiative of one million Europeans and that can only be legally binding if we have a Constitution."
"I would like to make three points."
"First, congratulations to Mr Ferber on a wonderful report."
"It was a good idea to postpone the discharge report because of the lack of clarity regarding the relationship between the City of Strasbourg and the European Parliament."
"I fully support the content of the report and how it has been written."
"We dealt with that in the Committee on Budgetary Control, where the report was adopted with 25 votes in favour and only one against."
"The second point is about the blame game."
"It is true that both parties should be blamed: Parliament’s administration, which was perhaps a little naive, and the City of Strasbourg."
"There is no denying it."
"I agree with Mrs Mastenbroek and Mr Busuttil, who said that the City of Strasbourg has worked with us in bad faith."
"My confidence in the workings of this city has gone down."
"My final point concerns whether this report and the seat of the European Parliament are somehow linked."
"They are not, but at the same time it is a matter of how we use money."
"As in a marriage, it is important to talk about sensitive issues."
"I fully realise that this is a sensitive issue, but we must remember that it is not only the rent."
"The truth is that us coming here costs EUR 209 million of taxpayers’ money every year."
"That is a waste and I support the idea put forward in the ‘oneseat.eu’ campaign of having only one seat."
"Let us talk about it openly and try to find a solution, but separately from this report."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate our rapporteur and the working party set up by the Committee on Budgets on their creditable handling of this matter."
"What has become apparent is something of which one gets a sense in today’s sitting, namely that those who call for transparency often, at the end of the day, do not want the facts to come out, and – as the rapporteur has observed – it sometimes turns out that the facts are not quite so scandalous and not quite so extraordinary as what they would have liked to see in the newspapers, but the Committee on Budgetary Control, the rapporteur and the working party have acquired these documents by honest means, and they stand by them."
"I warmly congratulate them on the results that have come to light."
"I have no great desire to go over again how appalling it was that so much was superimposed on this debate."
"Everyone has an opinion on Strasbourg, on Brussels, and on other things, and that makes it more difficult to do the job properly."
"I think it has been done rather well, and Mr Ferber’s report deserves our support."
"What are the lessons we should learn from this? For a start, our own administrators, our own Bureau – of which, or so I believe, our current president is a member – were in possession of information that was not supplied to us at a time when Mr Ferber was already working on his report."
"That is not acceptable, and there is a need for change here."
"A different way of doing things must be required in future, or else we will have to look out for ourselves."
"Secondly, another lesson that I think we can learn from what Mr Ferber has written is that those who run this place should be required to review old contracts rather than waiting a thousand years for something else to crop up; that must not be allowed to happen."
"Thirdly, I think that all those who believe the current debate on building policy in Strasbourg could be combined with the ‘one seat’ debate, should first be sure in their own minds – which I am not – how things stand as regards this House’s policy on the other places where it meets."
"Mr President, I want to use my minute to speak on paragraph 88 about the MEP pension scheme and the way the contributions are paid."
"Firstly, I deplore very strongly the fact that some colleagues in this Parliament have been casting slurs on other colleagues."
"Those who are casting the slurs are not present in this debate, and they have no evidence."
"It is a disgrace that they can go to the press and try to make their names by casting slurs on honourable Members of this Parliament."
"Let them produce the evidence before they go around saying such things."
"I have no objection – and I have heard no objections – to our contributions to the pension scheme being deducted directly from our bank accounts."
"That is perfectly okay."
"But it should be borne in mind that Parliament would apparently have to recruit five extra full-time staff to do this, at an annual cost of EUR 400 000, in order to check that the right amounts have been transferred from each of the national bank accounts to the central pot."
"This is because some banks make bank charges to transfer the money and some do not, so that the amounts will vary."
"Furthermore, as there is no euro currency in 13 of our Member States, the monthly payments will also vary with fluctuations in the exchange rate of national currencies against the euro."
"All this involves very considerable expense, and we should keep cool heads and refrain from insults."
"Mr President, I am the longest-serving Member of the European Parliament and the one who has travelled most often to Strasbourg."
"I was a member of the Committee on Budgets and of the Conference of Presidents when the majority decided that the secretariat should be in Luxembourg and the meetings held by turns in Strasbourg and Brussels."
"When we had to choose between Strasbourg and Brussels, I voted in favour Strasbourg, so I am not addressing you from an anti-French perspective."
"A million signatures have now been collected so that we might have a single seat."
"That is a striking expression of grass-roots opinion."
"We no longer want to find ourselves wasting taxpayers’ money and MEPs’ and employees’ time."
"We should therefore do what we can to respond to people’s criticism."
"When we set the calendar of sittings for 2008, we could decide to meet each Tuesday in the city where the Commission meets."
"We could be given a report on the day’s decisions and take all the votes requiring absolute majorities."
"In that way, the need for moving between the two centres would be drastically reduced. The ball would be in the prime ministers’ court, and they would be forced to establish a single place of work."
"That is something that we ourselves can do without violating the Treaty."
"We can also send out a signal by not purchasing new buildings now."
"I have tabled Amendment 9 in order to prevent or postpone their purchase."
"No one has had the imagination to picture the city of Strasbourg taking financial advantage of the European Parliament and European taxpayers."
"That idea was not put forward at any meeting I remember, and I will not accuse successive Secretary-Generals of having been negligent."
"It must be possible to expect public authorities to be honest and to show loyalty to one another."
"I understand, moreover, that Strasbourg has not contravened the law."
"That being the case, the law must be changed so that public authorities have a duty of information when they deal with each other."
"Here in Parliament, however, we are not obliged to purchase buildings from the city of Strasbourg."
"We have enough buildings, and now we must unite in demanding a single place of work."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Ferber on the way in which he has presented the discharge and the report, and on his working methods."
"I – being a mere acting member on the Committee on Budgetary Control – should also like to extend warm thanks to my group colleagues Mr Busuttil, Mr Stubb and Mrs Grässle, for the excellent working relationship we enjoyed with Mr Ferber, not least in the preparatory meetings of the working party of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Mr Ferber has tabled a critical report – critical, that is, about the buildings and about a number of services, whilst nevertheless being fair."
"It contains a number of sound recommendations for the way in which changes can be made for the better."
"For example, a discharge report must be used in order to control Parliament’s own housekeeping and budget more effectively."
"Needless to say, he devoted the necessary attention to the issue of the buildings, the problem we faced with the City of Strasbourg."
"He spelled out quite clearly, but also fairly, that at times Parliament, and not just the other parties in the conflict, is also to blame to some extent."
"Accordingly, whilst we Dutch Christian Democrats subscribe to the thrust of the Ferber report with regard to spending of the 2004 Parliament budget, as prepared and adopted in the Committee on Budgetary Control, I should nevertheless like to make a few observations, which I see in isolation from the Ferber report, not least because he has done an excellent job with regard to Strasbourg."
"Tomorrow, in the Committee on Budgets, we will be discussing a possible purchase."
"It is obvious that my party is opposed to this, not least on account of the fact that the discussion that is being held surrounding this topic – and I only need to refer to Mr Stubb's words, with which I am in agreement – should in actual fact be held prior to the purchase of buildings."
"Moreover, strictly speaking, Parliament cannot discuss this for another two years, during the 2006 discharge, which does not strike me as the right way of going about things."
"I also have a comment with regard to content about this purchase, namely about the possible presence of asbestos."
"The environmental aspects in this connection have not been adequately addressed."
"Whilst I should once again like to congratulate Mr Ferber, we cannot agree to the purchase of the building at this moment in time on account of the issues I have mentioned."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, for his work and for the dynamism that he instilled in the working party and the Committee on Budgetary Control, as well as in the Committee on Budgets."
"Nonetheless, we did not fully agree on some of his conclusions in committee and with his decision to revisit other subjects, which I believe have partly blurred the conclusions that were quite clear in the initial mandate."
"This was going to be more of a management approval exercise for Parliament, but the information apparently given to the press by the City of Strasbourg about the profit that it had made on the price paid by Parliament – by using a kind of middleman contract which it never explained – threw up, or turned this exercise into, something much more interesting, from which we have gained some important experience."
"The working party found that the practice was legal and was also customary in these financial engineering real-estate contracts, as was what, in my view, is the improper use of actual middlemen."
"It has to be acknowledged that the middlemen really earned their money."
"Well, if there was too much trust on one side and a lack of good faith on the other, I believe that we, as Parliament, have learnt not to trust the good faith of other institutions so much."
"This whole exercise is therefore welcome if it can instil a greater awareness of the risks and dangers involved in real-estate transactions and if we can thereby – and I think that this is what we are aiming at – avoid such unpleasant surprises happening again in future, since they make it more difficult for Parliament to have the necessary trust in our own seats."
"On the other two subjects that have again been included through the back door – pensions and Parliament’s seat – I confirm that I share the opinion expressed several times in this House that that is not the solution proposed by the majority."
"– Mr President, I should like to take my turn in thanking Mr Ferber for having done an excellent job of carrying out the follow-up work in a context that was not only legally complex, but also quite often turbulent."
"I am, of course, grateful to the Committee on Budgetary Control for having seen through its investigations aimed at shedding a little light on our debate."
"While I, for my part, sincerely regret the clumsy way in which the City of Strasbourg has managed this issue, I have learnt two lessons from it."
"One concerns the running of our Parliament: as the rapporteur points out, in future, we must pay more attention to the legal status of our contracts, even when they are complex."
"The second lesson is more fundamental and is political in nature. It still concerns the discharge, however."
"I hope that the adoption of the discharge will enable us to put a stop once and for all to the constant confused attempts aimed at turning attention back to the cost of the seat in Strasbourg, something that is determined by the Treaties and by the wisdom of the Heads of State or Government, as Mr Ferber pointed out."
"If we do not succeed in this, I propose two solutions: either we repatriate all of the institutions of the European Parliament, which is the democratic body , and we will have just one seat, as one of our fellow Members said; or, at the very least, we perform an audit to establish the cost of all of the European institutions spread across the whole of Europe, and we draw the lessons from that."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to have an extra 25% speaking time."
"The rehashing of this business with the lease of the Strasbourg building – which has been going on for 28 years – puts me in a very reflective frame of mind."
"It leaves me with doubts – doubts that will not go away – about the professionalism of the people who manage this House’s buildings and about how important value for money is to those who manage its finances."
"For 28 years, the House authorities did not check to see whether the leases were still good value – not even when the capital costs originally included had been written off, nor even when, in 1997, the Treaty of Amsterdam laid down that Strasbourg would be our seat, for it was at this point, at the latest, that it became necessary to assess the risk involved."
"For years on end, the rent paid was excessive, to the considerable detriment of this House and of the European taxpayer, amounting – as even the assessor appointed to act on behalf of the French Republic admitted – to something between EUR 28 and EUR 32 million at the least."
"Who is actually responsible for this?"
"Why have this House’s internal auditors failed to do their job?"
"Nobody is answering these questions, and I am mad as hell about it."
"I, like every other Member of this House, will make sure that these issues, far from disappearing into oblivion, are, as they must be, followed up."
"Tomorrow, we are to release EUR 80 million to buy these buildings, which we actually paid for years ago."
"We are even getting one of them thrown in for free, without knowing what long-standing liabilities it conceals."
"A contract has been cobbled together under considerable pressure of time, without the purchase price being renegotiated in view of what has transpired in the past."
"If this contract is no better or no worse than its predecessors, it will, within the foreseeable future, be the subject of another debate in this House."
"."
"Mr President, I would just like to point out – further to what I said in my speech when you were not here – that, the next time the discharge of Parliament is debated, I expect its President to be present."
"We shall inform him of this request."
"I would simply point out that, as we sit here right now, the Bureau, for its part, is sitting under the presidency of the President of Parliament."
"That is the explanation that I am able to give you."
"The President of Parliament is not endowed with the ability to be everywhere at once; he is not omnipresent, like Fregoli."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"The next item is the report (A6–0255/2006) by Mrs Prets, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on transnational mobility within the Community for education and training purposes: European Quality Charter for Mobility (COM(2005)0450 – C6-0291/2005 – 2005/0179(COD))."
"."
"Mr President, once again, I would like to thank Mrs Prets, the Culture Committee’s rapporteur, for her commitment and constructive work, including several long meetings with my services and those of the Council."
"For similar reasons, let me also express gratitude to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, and especially the rapporteur, Mr Kusstatscher."
"Thanks to their political will, flexibility and negotiating skills, we have been able to agree on a reliable compromise text."
"Let me first refer to the main objectives of this proposal from the Commission."
"The aim of the charter is to lay down common principles to make all types of mobility for learning purposes more efficient and more effective."
"These principles include quality information and guidance for the candidates; a sound learning plan; preparation, especially linguistic preparation; adequate logistical support and mentoring schemes in the host country."
"We also want to make clear what the responsibilities of all stakeholders are and to ensure fair recognition and evaluation of the study and training on return."
"We expect the charter to bring significant benefits to users."
"First, it should help make citizens more confident that mobility is useful and is being carried out in the right conditions."
"Additionally, it should make it easier for the large category of people learning in another country to exercise the right to move and study freely within the European Union."
"It should have a positive impact on the employability of those concerned."
"Indeed, the charter responds to the important components of the social dimension of the European Union: mobility, education and training for the acquisition of new skills and employability."
"I come now to Mrs Prets’ report, which I welcome very much."
"I know that the European Parliament’s amendments mean that the text now fits even better with the objectives of the proposal."
"For instance, you point out that mobility is based on common values and on respect for diversity."
"You have extended the scope of the proposal to the specific needs of disadvantaged groups and people with disabilities."
"You have invited the Commission to encourage the use of a mobility charter by national agencies and other organisations."
"You have insisted on developing gender-specific statistical data and you have also mentioned the portability of government grants and loans to the host country."
"To summarise, of the 36 amendments voted by the Culture Committee, only four have not been accepted by the Commission."
"That was not a refusal of the underlying ideas, however, but only because the matter was outside the scope of the proposal, or else covered by other parts of the text."
"All the remaining 32 amendments have been fully integrated, either literally or with slight rewording."
"Finally, as you know, Coreper last week agreed on the compromise text."
"Not a single Member State opposed the text or maintained a reserve."
"That should ease the agreement in the first reading."
"Therefore, I ask this House to confirm the text in its vote."
"It should be an excellent conclusion to a most efficient cooperation between institutions."
"But, before that, I am open to your questions."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad that we have been able, after long-drawn out wrangling, to agree on this document, and, moreover, that we have been able to produce it in good time before the Year of Mobility is over, for I do not think it would make much sense to roll out a Mobility Charter next year; that would not exactly have the desired effect on the outside world."
"More to the point, this Charter is needed as an accompaniment to the new educational programmes that are due to start next year, in which we have put a great emphasis on quantity, in that we want, for example, to have three million students on the lifelong learning scheme by 2012, and 80 000 per annum on Leonardo."
"In view of that, the need for quality must not be ignored; it really must not be allowed to lose out."
"Quality must be guaranteed not only in the host countries in which students spend time, but also in their countries of origin, so that the best possible use can be made of their experiences when they return and can really be seen to be added."
"I would also like to emphasise that mobility must not merely make them more employable; there is a purely personal benefit involved as well, for education is of value not least in that it is character-building, and should therefore ultimately also contribute to greater European understanding."
"The Charter is intended for all those who want to complete a formal or informal period of education or further education abroad, but there must also be a certain balance, not only for the students’ benefit, but also to promote the use of the Leonardo programme and create more openings for businesses to take on trainees."
"While I do believe that this document can set a lot of things in motion, that will depend on how it is received in the Member States."
"What we have set before this House is not legally binding, and so it is for the Member States to commit themselves to doing what it calls on them to do."
"We know that very many resolutions are adopted in the Council and accepted without dissent in the EU or within the Council, only to be inadequately implemented at national level."
"That would be sure to diminish young people’s confidence in what we are doing and also in our intentions."
"There are, though, a number of points I would like to highlight, some of which you, Commissioner, have mentioned."
"It is important that there should be a Mobility Guide containing introductory information on mobility options, grants and contact addresses."
"It is also important that the various educational systems be made transparent and capable of being compared with one another, so that young people can know what is in store for them in this or that country."
"It is also, of course, important that there should be information on the recognition of diplomas, on financial and other support, and that language barriers should be removed."
"The transferability of grants – to which Mrs Schöppges has already referred – is absolutely vital, in that it is needed, not least, alongside logistical support, insurance, residence and work permits, accommodation and preparations for travel, and is every bit as important as the transferability of loans."
"The same is true of social security insurance."
"If young people are going to venture to make this leap and be prepared to embark on this ‘foreign adventure’, then their own country’s social security system is one of the things they have to be able to ‘take away’ with them."
"The intention is that the mobility charter should be seen as a frame of reference for making mobility more efficient and effective, with the persons using it having a checklist of ten matters to be sorted out before their departure, such as advice, information, and a learning plan; there are others, but it is not absolutely necessary that I discuss them now."
"I would like to thank all those who have played their part in putting this compromise together."
"That was not an easy thing to do, but we did eventually manage it."
"I am glad to see that all the groups have tabled amendments or compromise amendments, and that we will, no doubt, be able to get through tomorrow’s vote quickly and then be able to present a good report."
". – Mr President, Commissioner Figeľ, particularly in this Year of Mobility, it is a good and necessary initiative to put in place a Europe-wide quality charter for mobility for all citizens who travel around Europe for their education and further education, although it has to be said that this mobility charter is also an example of the half-hearted approach that has been taken to the Year of Mobility."
"We, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in considering this resolution, saw it as particularly important that vocation training should be treated as equal in value to general education."
"Our second concern was that it should be stressed that good continuous education and training is the best instrument for confronting unemployment and poverty."
"The negotiations with the Council were both disappointing and revealing."
"I regret that I am unable to confirm the statements already made, according to which there was a high degree of consensus."
"The Council turned the procedure on its head as soon as it realised how willing the rapporteur of the lead committee was to compromise."
"We, representatives of Parliament, found ourselves being told by the Council what Parliament was permitted or forbidden to recommend."
"The rapid agreement made this a less than democratic process."
". – Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Prets on her report and on her desire to make a success of a text that presents certain problems and that, although it is not a legislative text, is the expression of a strong commitment."
"This Charter is part of an attempt to go one step further in establishing the idea that education is an area in which cooperation among the various national systems is becoming crucial."
"If we want to promote mobility, then we shall have to improve the way in which we exchange our knowledge and our information, promote multilingualism, reduce the administrative obstacles and guarantee welfare cover and the portability of financial systems."
"We will obviously have to ensure that candidates are prepared before their departure, monitored during their stay in the host country and reintegrated into their countries of origin."
"The finding that, despite the wide variety of specific programmes, mobility has not increased, confirms that this Charter is a step in the right direction."
"However, the Council has pointed out on more than one occasion that the area of education is a responsibility of the Member States."
"The compromise reached is worthwhile even though the progress made still lacks ambition and, above all, depends on the goodwill of the Member States."
"We cannot build Europe without making the area of education and culture an open space in which each country and each system, bolstered by its own resources, will no longer be afraid of the other."
"The Lisbon Strategy encourages us to aspire to be more effective and to modernise our education systems."
"While the Charter will be able to help better coordinate the mobility plans, everything will obviously depend not only on the will of the Member States, but also on the demands of Europeans who, like their ancestors in the Middle Ages, ought to be able to go round Europe without having to negotiate a path full of pitfalls."
"For that to happen, we need more Europe in the area of education and culture."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, today is a special day for the European Parliament and the Committee on Culture and Education and for our three honourable friends Mrs Prets, Mrs Trüpel and Mr Beazley, the rapporteurs on three separate reports on education in the European Union."
"The mobility of European citizens in the education and training sector makes an important contribution towards improving the quality of their knowledge and broadening their experiences and skills and, at the same time, it is a unique tool for mutual understanding and better knowledge of the various cultures which make up Europe."
"It is true that over recent years, thanks to the dissemination of existing education and mobility programmes, such as Comenius, Erasmus and Leonardo, the mobility of young people in Europe has increased considerably."
"Nonetheless, it is a fact that there are still a great number of other obstacles which hamper mobility."
"Even today, the number of young people crossing the borders of their country in order to participate in an education programme is still at relatively low levels."
"This is linked, among other things, to various practices and omissions on the part of the Member States, which directly or indirectly restrict the mobility of young Europeans."
"The European Quality Charter for Mobility, if correctly applied by the Member States, may make an important contribution towards lifting these obstacles, by offering adequate support for administrative assistance to people on the move, which will include, among other things, suitable preparation prior to departure, the provision of information and assistance, social security, resident's permit, housing and the facility to transfer grants and loans to the host country."
"At the same time, it is especially important for the experience acquired through these programmes to be recognised on returning to the country of origin."
"Particular attention also needs to be paid to safeguarding equal opportunities for participants."
"Within this framework, use of the Europass must also be strengthened."
"To close, I should like to extend my especial congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Prets, and to the other rapporteurs because, thanks to her work, the European Quality Charter for Mobility will be given more quickly into the service of European citizens."
"Mobility in training and employment within the European Union is important in raising employment levels among European citizens."
"It can improve inter–connectedness, bring about ever closer cooperation and promote knowledge of other nations and languages."
"As far as education is concerned, cooperation is improving, although funding is still too low."
"If we want to attain better results, however, we must also make arrangements for higher quality education."
"If all that companies see in the organisation of programmes for improved mobility is a higher workload without any added value they will not strive to make such programmes a success."
"In their eyes these programmes will only appear to create more work, increase their costs in arranging mentoring, and leak information to their competitors."
"If the mobility of workers is to be increased, suitable incentives need to be offered to employees working for companies and organisations."
"Of course, appropriate measures will be needed to encourage them."
"We also need to raise employees’ awareness, so that they become familiar with the opportunities and advantages of mobility."
"To this end, lists of organisations wishing to take part in the process need to be drawn up, but, at the same time, institutions responsible for the preparation and promotion of such lists should be established."
"Moreover, employees are still facing difficulties in having their qualifications and skills recognised in other countries."
"In many countries, students and employees are already successfully using Europass, the use of which also needs to be expanded and improved."
"Knowledge is an asset and the best investment we can make in order to meet the challenges of the future."
"."
"I too am pleased that we have been able to prepare and submit the charter for the vote this year, a year of mobility in the European Union, because this is an important contribution."
"I agree, of course, that a recommendation does not have the power of a binding instrument."
"Developments so far have demonstrated, however, that the numerous recommendations adopted to date in this particular area have resulted in progress towards specific goals, benchmarks and the fulfilment of agreements; as a result, we can see a broad range of activities pertaining to the Bologna or Copenhagen processes."
"I would like to confirm that not only today, as the Committee on Culture and Education submits several important reports, but also over the recent months and even years the momentum of development in the field of culture and education has been very strong."
"As Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges has pointed out, a common Europe needs more culture and more education."
"I believe that this is the direction in which we are moving."
"When the recommendation is adopted, it will advance coordination, transparency and culture, the evaluation of feedback concerning the effects of mobility and the conditions prevailing in individual countries and institutions."
"I for one would like to express my gratitude and assure you that I am prepared to take follow-up steps, especially towards implementation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"There can be no doubt that increased cohesion between European citizens depends on their mobility, mutual acquaintance, understanding and acceptance of cultural diversity."
"Knowledge of languages and recognition of educational methods and systems are crucial to fostering the mobility of European citizens."
"Vocational training is a particularly important aspect of this, and one which brings us closer to achieving the aims of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Considering the issue under discussion from this point of view, I would encourage Member States of the Union to:"
"1."
"Create the conditions necessary for at least two of the national languages of the Member States of the Union to be taught at secondary school level, in addition to the mother tongue."
"2."
"Ensure vocational training is provided with the support of local economic bodies and organisations, as these are best placed to understand the economic needs of their country."
"The development of cooperation between relevant bodies in EU countries will allow them to work with their governments to devise and take responsibility for vocational training tailored to the needs of the whole EU."
"3."
"Introduce a twin-track training system at the earliest opportunity. This means devoting half the time to theory and half to practical vocational training."
"The so-called old Fifteen and the new Member States of the EU are equally responsible for efforts to promote increased mobility."
"In addition, appropriate financial support is essential to achieve greater mobility and better vocational training within the EU."
"– The next item is the report (A6–0262/2006) by Mrs Trüpel, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on key competences for lifelong learning (COM(2005)0548 – C6-0375/2005 – 2005/0221(COD))."
"."
"Mr President, as I said to Mr Sifunakis, this is a special group of reports confirming that cultural education gets a momentum in these discussions."
"I would first of all like to express my gratitude to Mrs Trüpel of the Committee on Culture and Education, but also to the other committees involved in this report because others were engaged, and also to the political groups for their constructive discussions with the Presidency and with the Commission that have led us to the agreement on this recommendation on key competences."
"All institutions have made efforts in order to find a balanced text and to allow a first reading agreement."
"We all agreed on the importance of this proposal for European citizens and for developing consistent and comprehensive lifelong learning strategies which should help Europe to fulfil its goal of becoming a Europe of knowledge, a knowledge-friendly Union."
"The purpose of this recommendation is to identify and define the skills that everyone needs for living, learning and working in a knowledge society."
"It covers the traditional skills such as literacy and information communication technologies – digital grammar – but it also goes beyond them by including skills which are important for citizenship, for living together in more and more varied societies."
"I believe that this recommendation after approval should be translated as quickly as possible into concrete measures in order to help people in their studies and training."
"Our aim is to improve citizens’ employability, job opportunities and chances for the future."
"I think that a lot of work was done, especially by Mrs Trüpel and her colleagues, to analyse, discuss and amend our initial proposal."
"As a result of the successful negotiations, I think a number of clarifications and improvements have been made, while keeping the text short and concise."
"I think that the recommendation now better addresses the literacy problem and the need for equal opportunities, the need for procedures to validate skills and to evaluate achievements."
"Target groups now include those with low skills and specific groups such as people returning to work; moreover, a number of definitions of competences have been clarified."
"This report, together with some other reports and with the programme which we will have from New Year 2007 for lifelong learning, could create much better conditions for the value of knowledge, for the value of qualifications and for a knowledge-friendly Europe."
"I appreciate the strong support in this Parliament – whether we speak about the programme or legislative tools – for education and learning and training policies."
"I would like to thank you all for your cooperation in achieving this base for a recommendation and also I look forward to further support when we come to implementation."
". – Mr President, Commissioner Figeľ, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Commissioner Figeľ for his introductory remarks, and also for having so clearly summed up the spirit of this agreement at first reading, and explained the improvements in the text that our joint efforts helped make possible, pointing out that, ambitious though it is, it is now more sensitive to social factors and more balanced, which is a triumph for our joint endeavour."
"Looking back briefly, let me say that the recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning takes as its starting point the changed state of the world, with a globalised economy in which Europe stands a chance only if we provide our people with better education and training, which is why education policy is meant to be – and must be – an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Being a continent without much in the way of its own raw materials, our chances of having a future in a globalised economy are closely tied up with the resources of education and research; it is in people’s qualities and skills that our future potential is to be found, and that is why the Member States and the European Union must invest more in education and clarify their thinking about what skills are actually needed in a knowledge-based society."
"That is the purpose of the recommendations on the eight key competences, and I will repeat that these are no more than recommendations."
"The key competences are: firstly, communication in one's mother tongue; secondly, communication in foreign languages; thirdly, competences in maths, science and technology; fourth, digital competence; fifth, learning to learn; sixth, interpersonal, intercultural and social competences, and civic competence; seventh, entrepreneurship, and the eighth is cultural expression."
"All of them are needed for social cohesion, employability and personal development."
"It is intended that the Member States should be supported making policies enabling all young people, once their basic education is completed, to possess sufficient key competences to be able to embark on adult life, and adults to develop these competences in line with the latest knowledge throughout their lives."
"The key competences are not ranked in any kind of hierarchy; while they are all equal in value, they do of course overlap, and they all contribute towards a successful life in a knowledge-based society."
"These competences are defined as a combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes."
"It is the key competences that we all need if we are to enjoy personal satisfaction in the knowledge society, that we need for our own personal development, for active participation, social integration and employment."
"The concept of mankind underpinning this definition of key competences bears the stamp of humanism, and what breathes life into this recommendation is the idea that competences are not to be considered solely in terms of the uses to which they can be put, but that education is always of value in itself as well."
"This concept of key skills includes such attitudes as critical thinking, creativity, the seizing of initiative, problem-solving, the willingness to take risks, decision-making and entrepreneurial flair."
"As I see it, we have, politically speaking, opted for the right approach in giving the Member States these definitions as guidelines for their educational policies, thereby enabling them to prepare themselves better for the future."
"My particular concern was that it should, in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission, be made clear that, no matter how ambitious these key skills are – for we must all keep on learning if we are to succeed and be content in a knowledge-based society – the social aspect must not be forgotten, for not everyone starts from the same point or with the same opportunities."
"That is why it is particularly important to help and support people with learning difficulties by reason of their background or social position, those who have dropped out of school, people with poor literacy skills, the long-term unemployed or people who want to get back to work after a long break, not least – and in particular – women returning to work after having children."
"All these circumstances need to be taken into account if people are to be given the specific help they need to make use of their educational opportunities."
"Following a number of rounds of negotiations with the Council, we were able to agree on a recommendation that is socially aware and emphasises gender equality, while at the same time being very ambitious."
"I regard this compromise as a good one, and so my recommendation to all the Members of this House is that they adopt this text in the version agreed at first reading."
"The negotiations were constructive and interesting, and for that I want to extend the warmest of thanks to the Members of this House, to the Commission and to the Council."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Figeľ, over the past year, 10% of all adults in the European Union took part in further education – far too few in terms of the adequacy of the skills needed in an age of globalisation."
"People need to learn at every stage of life; key competences need to be acquired and constantly refreshed – such things as command of one’s mother tongue and of foreign languages, technical and mathematical expertise, social skills and awareness of other cultures."
"Help is available from the European level to develop these skills and thereby help make individuals more employable."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted – unanimously, indeed – my opinion, in which we had achieved compromises across party lines."
"My concern was with something to which the Commission draft does not yet give much emphasis, namely better provision for disadvantaged groups, such as people with disabilities, the long-term unemployed and those who dropped out of school early, all of whom find difficulties placed in their way when it comes to acquiring new skills on their own initiative."
"If they are to make up for what they lack, they need to be provided with something tailor-made for them."
"Young people on housing estates with high levels of unemployment feel abandoned and frustrated too; they need psychological support and special help if they are to gain self-confidence and be motivated to work to improve the conditions under which they and their families live."
"The object of lifelong learning is the acquisition of key competences in order, not only to adapt oneself to change, but also, and in particular, to be an active agent of change."
"Our committee is in favour of these competences being tested every three years at national, regional and local level, and the results of these tests being published, for only then will it become clear in which areas real progress has been achieved."
"."
"Mr President, lifelong learning and education are an important part of the Lisbon Strategy."
"This is an important part of European competitiveness."
"The point of education is to ensure that our citizens have work."
"Education is a matter that the Member States have to take decisions about, but if the EU and its Member States want to guarantee jobs for their citizens, as well as competitiveness, all our citizens should be included, and investments of time and money should be made in lifelong learning."
"I wish briefly to raise two matters."
"We need to pay particular attention to middle-aged women, and secondly teenage boys."
"Middle-aged women are at a disadvantage, as they do not receive adequate training. This results in their not being able to find work either."
"The other subject which I wish to draw attention to is teenage boys."
"More and more, large numbers of teenage boys all over Europe leave school straight after finishing secondary education, and this leads to unemployment."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a recommendation puts forward a European reference tool for key competences of lifelong learning."
"The recommendation should help to improve the quality of life for all EU citizens."
"In other words, it can help hundreds of millions of people."
"Given those numbers, it is extremely difficult to create a structure and definition of key competences that is optimal, well-balanced, appropriate and user-friendly and that would also meet expectations, help integrate people into society, and contribute to the fulfilment of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment."
"The recommendation attempts to define the skills that will form the modern profile of the European citizen, skills that all EU citizens could and should be able to achieve."
"I feel this is a lofty ambition and that it is a long way from being fulfilled."
"As a reference tool, this document should prove useful."
"Its clear weakness is, of course, that it attempts to profile the citizen in all the complex aspects of life, yet without defining a hierarchy of the competences involved."
"Just as every scientific project has different goals and different methods for achieving those goals, the target competences of an integrated social nature should be identified; in this case, for example, I refer to relations between people and relations between cultures, or business skills and the more methodical competences that lead to the achievement of goals."
"I mention the relationship to scientific projects deliberately, because competences in the field of science, including scientific principles and methods, are among the key competences."
"The significance of key competences is all the greater in relation to an information society and a knowledge-based society."
"I feel there is a lack of emphasis here on how society must be based on mutual respect and democracy."
"For me, the social principle is a priority and I regard people’s ability to live together as the most important competence."
"I wish to congratulate Mrs Trüpel, as she has made a very positive contribution to the quality of this document."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Trüpel for the outstanding cooperation, which smoothed the path towards agreement at first reading."
"Globalisation presents us with huge challenges; ordinary people are obliged to adapt themselves with ever-greater speed and flexibility to new conditions, and in this, education – in both the social and economic sense – acquires strategic significance."
"If you want equality of opportunity in Europe, you must ensure that education is made accessible to all and that disadvantages – whether resulting from personal, social, cultural or economic circumstances – are minimised, and this is particularly relevant in view of the forthcoming ‘Year of Equal Opportunities for All’."
"In view of the Lisbon Strategy’s ambitious goal of making Europe the world’s most dynamic knowledge-based economic area, making outsiders of wide swathes of the population is something we cannot afford, and so we, in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, welcome the reference framework that Mrs Trüpel has outlined, which includes the eight key competences."
"It is particularly such disadvantaged groups as those whose parental homes or lack of primary education denied them the opportunity of secure and sound vocational training who must not be excluded."
"People with learning disabilities, those who dropped out of school, the long-term unemployed and those returning to work after having a family – which means primarily women – not to mention older people, migrants and the disabled, must be supported in their endeavours by targeted policies and programmes, such as those for lifelong learning, although we are well aware that the regulation of education systems is largely a matter for the Member States and is also highly diverse."
"It is only recently that educational matters in Germany have, by means of the reform of federalism, been transferred from the national level and handed over to the regions, and so I urge that agreement be speedily reached on a European frame of reference."
"To take a narrowly and pettily national view of education and of lifelong learning would be to capitulate in the face of the challenges of today’s world, our response to which will, at the end of the day, determine whether the European economic and social model proves to be a success or a failure."
"."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on this excellent report on key competences for lifelong learning."
"Eight competences are listed in the report, but I personally believe that the fifth competence, ‘learning to learn’, is one of the more important, because lifelong learning is a process."
"It enables us not only to adapt to change but also to manage change, and I believe it helps us effect change."
"In this context, it not only contributes to achieving the Lisbon objectives or to coping with globalisation, but also greatly enhances our quality of life."
"Education is not just about knowledge and jobs: it is also about the development of the whole person."
"Lifelong learning is an enabling process."
"It often gives people a second chance or, indeed, a third chance, or simply another chance."
"As a former teacher of 20 years, I am fully aware that formal schooling is just one part of education and that lifelong learning should be a natural continuation of that process."
"It is crucial that lifelong learning is accessible to all and that realistic, practical and accessible opportunities are available so that citizens may acquire basic skills or indeed enhance their existing skills."
"In this context, appropriate provision should be made to include, in particular, those with special needs, early school-leavers, people with a disability, the long-term unemployed and those with poor literacy or numeracy skills."
"A recent survey in my own area of North Leitrim, West Cavan, indicated low levels of literacy among men in rural areas in particular."
"This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency, in particular because it is crucial to realise that poor literacy skills act as a barrier to political participation."
"I agree with a previous speaker that is not just an educational issue but a fundamental democratic one."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I am always glad when we discuss educational policy, for we are then all thinking along the same lines and trying to make progress."
"We very rarely disagree about culture and education, and that is terrific; the only thing is that we have no money, and that is a problem that we all have to deal with, so I am glad that we have been able to roll out the mobility charter as part of the new lifelong learning programme and are, today, discussing the key competences, which – since this is an area in which we have no power – can be seen only as recommendations."
"What we can do, though, is make suggestions."
"A week ago, I was in Sarajevo at a major conference on lifelong learning, at which we discussed key competences – a concept that everyone is taking on board."
"I think it sends out a wonderful signal when we make such suggestions and countries that are not yet in the European Union act on them."
"Striking a positive note, I would like to observe that this will provide a frame of reference for key competences, which make it possible for people to adapt themselves to a changing labour market in a knowledge-based society."
"I would also like to say how glad I am that this proposal advances the development of national strategies for lifelong learning and thus also curriculum reforms, while also, of course, promoting the standardisation of adult and continuing education in the Member States."
"I also welcome the recommendation relating to the inclusion of people with special needs, about which much has been said, and about how to bring the European dimension into civic competences, which means how to impart knowledge of our European history and foster awareness of our European cultural identity."
"I would suggest that you buy a copy of the Franco-German history books that have been on the market for the past three months, and which are wonderful in the way they show what European identity means."
"Finally, I would like to urge that we should not, on the basis of this recommendation, indulge in excessively utopian fantasies of what 2010 is going to be like; superlatives are not, in essence, of any use to us."
"Let us instead build on it a realistic possibility for all members of the public to acquire basic skills and develop them."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as a country, the Republic of Estonia, which was restored fifteen years ago, is a winner."
"Shock therapy ensured Estonia’s rapid return to the European cultural and economic area."
"But Estonian society has split into winners and losers."
"Among the working population, the winners are the young people, who in this new situation quickly acquired the necessary diploma and skills."
"The losers are those who are nearing pension age."
"They were considered relics who could not be retrained."
"The acquisition of the eight key competencies proposed by the commission would definitely make it easier for workers to adapt to the changing requirements in the labour market."
"American workers change professions an average of three times during their lifetimes."
"This will soon become common in Europe as well."
"With the increase in life expectancy, a forty-five-year-old worker will be only half way through his or her career."
"This means new initiatives in middle age, although age discrimination is still undoubtedly a reality for workers in middle and lower-level jobs throughout the world."
"In introducing the system of lifelong learning, we must change societal perception."
"The eight key competencies must be given a content that would give workers confidence in the future; a confidence arising from their belief in their own ability to develop."
"At the same time, employers must be encouraged to invest in experienced people from outside."
"Europe must become accustomed to lifelong learning as an everyday phenomenon and an integral part of working life; otherwise, the achievement of the Lisbon objectives will only be wishful thinking."
"."
"I very much appreciate this atmosphere and the obvious consensus regarding the need for more and better investments in education."
"This report, this recommendation concerning key competences, is about using the same funds more efficiently so as to ensure better outcomes."
"Last year there were six million student dropouts in the European Union."
"This is an enormous number."
"I believe that this number alone should be enough to make us focus more on what subjects are taught and how they are taught, on curriculum content and on improving the supply side, as our schools all too often produce young graduates who join the ranks of the unemployed."
"Let me make just a few observations for everyone to consider."
"This understanding of key competences implies a kind of equilibrium and a single space both for economic competitiveness and social cohesion or social responsibility."
"The same argument can be used regarding the relationship between the humanities and the natural sciences."
"Both are necessary."
"I believe that the key competences reflect this."
"As Mrs Pack has said, this serves as a basis of reform for many countries in the Western Balkans, the new Member States, and even in the old ones."
"It is a good thing that we can stimulate and in a way unify this process and progress towards modernising educational content."
"I would also like to underscore what Mrs Harkin has said, namely that the key competence is learning to learn rather than wait for encyclopaedic knowledge to be acquired in school; being able to handle information, experience and an environment which are increasingly more complex and more global."
"In addition, the cultural faculty for perceiving and expressing oneself, as well as interpersonal and intersocial relations are extremely important in shaping personalities and mature citizens."
"I would therefore like to thank Mrs Trüpel again for her excellent presentation of the committee’s position."
"I believe that this will be reflected in the vote."
"I am looking forward to more progress in implementing the key competences and skills."
"This is a process."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"– In the current context of globalisation, the world of work, which has become complex, multifaceted and subject to high-speed changes, is a source of insecurity and anxiety."
"New ways of working, manufacturing, innovating and trading are forcing workers to continually call into question their own knowledge and skills."
"In order to reconcile these increasingly harsh economic objectives with our humanist vision of work, lifelong learning, as a principle upheld in the majority of our national laws, is the subject of a broad consensus."
"There are already countless official orders, including European ones, but let us not just make do with the slogan!"
"We are still a long way from putting into practice and systematising lifelong learning."
"All too often, it is either a legal obligation that companies enter into without really thinking about the added value of such actions and without any real long-term policy; or a formula used in an emergency to respond to social problems."
"Thus, work must now be done at national and local level to develop, on the one hand, effective learning facilities, and, on the other, a real commitment on the part of businesses and employees."
"The next item is the report by Mr Beazley on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education on initiatives to complement school curricula providing appropriate support measures to include the European dimension (2006/2041(INI)) (A6-0267/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, the purpose of this report is very clear and specific."
"It calls upon the Council of Ministers to give a fresh impetus to the inclusion and enhancement of the European dimension in school curricula."
"That is a national competence and the national, regional, and educational authorities in our Member States vary."
"However, this Parliament is totally within its rights – and indeed has a duty – to remind the Council of Ministers that it passed a resolution back in May 1988 calling for the enhancement of the European dimension in education."
"It is the virtually unanimous feeling of the committee that it is high time that this was updated."
"So what are the practical steps?"
"First of all, the European dimension should not simply be a vague platitude, a notion that governments pay lip-service to but in actual fact do very little to achieve."
"I hope attention has been drawn to this in committee and I hope that the Finnish Presidency will be able to confirm by correspondence that this item will be included on the agenda of the next Council of Education Ministers meeting in Brussels on 13 November."
"I look forward to receiving confirmation of that."
"We think that there should be a discussion by our ministers, specifically about what the European dimension entails."
"As far as Parliament’s committee is concerned, we have looked at two aspects."
"Firstly, in citizenship classes, what used to be called ‘civics’: an understanding of what the EU is, how its institutions operate and, in particular, the democratic input of individuals, interests and concerns in the decision-making; and second, and equally important, an understanding of our common cultural and historical heritage."
"Parliament held a hearing on the teaching of history and its European dimension two years ago."
"Of course, national stories are the foundation stone of an understanding of our past, but it is impossible to teach the classical empires of Greece and Rome, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Napoleonic wars, the Industrial Revolution, the struggles between democracies and dictatorship without reference to the European context."
"We also dwell specifically on the importance of language teaching."
"That has declined very significantly in my own country in recent years."
"In the last two years, the number of 16-year-old students studying languages has dropped by as much as 14%, as our government has made it an option rather than a compulsory element of the curriculum."
"Looking across Europe, our understanding and our use of languages is very imbalanced."
"As English increasingly becomes a ‘lingua franca’, for those of us with English as our mother tongue that is a real problem in terms of motivating students to study and teachers to teach foreign languages."
"And yet without that cultural understanding that goes with an understanding of language, how on earth are we going to be able to cooperate properly and enrich the content of our educational syllabuses?"
"With regard to teacher awareness, I mentioned that there is a disparity, not only across the EU but within Member States."
"Some schools pay considerable attention to the European dimension, fully engaging in European exchange programmes, for example, using not simply resources from the EU but national and independent resources, television and newspaper archive material, while others concentrate hardly at all on the European dimension."
"Therefore we have a ‘scatter’ effect."
"It is important that teacher training courses should offer potential teachers the opportunity to be aware of what teaching materials are available and how they can fit into curricula."
"I draw your attention to paragraph 13 of the report, which we are grateful to Mrs Novak for incorporating."
"It states that: ‘The European dimension complements national content."
"There is a very small fringe of people who would attack this report and say that it is all about propaganda, trying to force people to see only the rosy and beneficial side of the European Union."
"I would return that taunt by saying that it is they who would seek to deny information, who are actually distorting the picture, depriving our students of the opportunity to make a balanced judgment of their own and to consider what their career opportunities might be, because they have had the full information given to them consistently, throughout their time at school."
"This report is a call to the Council of Ministers for action."
"We look forward to seeing the positive results."
"."
"Mr President, once again, this is a very timely initiative, as we are preparing for the launch of new seven-year programmes."
"In future this particular dimension could be much more evident in cooperation on education and training policies than previously."
"This report could also be inspirational, therefore, for the Council and the Member States."
"That falls within their competence and responsibility, of course, but we should at least reflect on where we are and what can be done to improve this educational dimension."
"In his report, Mr Beazley touches on serious and specific problems."
"The Commission shares those concerns."
"In the last joint report by the Council and the Commission on progress in the Education and Training 2010 programme, we concluded, for example, that ‘despite some promising initiatives on mobility and participation in EU programmes, there is still a lack of national strategies on the European dimension in education’."
"Policies that would ensure that, after initial education, young people have the knowledge and competences they need as European citizens – not only as tourists but as citizens – are piecemeal and fragmented."
"It is also true that the term ‘European dimension’ has a different meaning."
"On the one hand, it refers to the concept of Europe, its civilisation, democratic values and projects."
"However, it can also be seen as European citizenship or European identity, with rights and duties as citizens, active participation and a sense of belonging to Europe."
"It is thus important to have clear views on how to integrate the European dimension in school curricula and how to provide schools with both the material and the opportunities to learn about Europe in practice."
"The Commission has already started this work."
"Among our programmes, Comenius, for example, supports projects with partners from different countries working on developing the European dimension."
"The ‘European SchoolNet’ is a good example of an interactive and virtual tool for networking and for dissemination."
"The Youth Programme also aims to familiarise young people with the concept of a European dimension in their lives through exchanges and especially through voluntary service."
"Transnational projects like these are an excellent example of the European dimension in practice."
"The recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning, which we have just discussed, is an important step forward."
"It highlights a number of skills and attitudes needed for active European citizenship as part of social, civic and cultural competences."
"Similarly, our work with national experts on teacher training stresses the importance of European knowledge, mobility and networking."
"These are a very important part of teachers’ professional development."
"I fully agree with Mr Beazley."
"The Commission shares the view that much more needs to be done to raise awareness of the many good national and European initiatives."
"The Commission continues to work with Member States, for example co-financing projects within Comenius and supporting multilingualism, and we will encourage Member States to develop the European dimension as part of their lifelong learning strategies."
"Moreover, my colleague Mrs Wallström and I recently agreed on a number of initiatives to be taken in this area."
"Therefore, for all these reasons, I see this report as providing major input into the Commission’s reflections on the issues of education and citizenship."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Beazley report presents us with a concept that is difficult to pin down, namely that of the European dimension."
"If we wish to bring a sense of belonging to the complex reality that we call Europe, the corresponding European dimension must be conveyed to the citizens, in particular the youngest citizens, because it is a vital prerequisite for European citizenship in the true sense of the term."
"Young people must be helped to understand this, and to absorb the fact that they belong to a shared tapestry of civilisation that gives rise, on the one hand, to diverse cultures and national entities, and, on the other, to a particular view of Europe around the world that, historically, has changed the course of the human race."
"There are issues of great interest to the construction of the EU that go hand in hand with the European dimension, such as scientific and technological progress, which is as much an integral part of Europe as of any other part of the world."
"There are other areas relating to a specifically European dimension that stand out, such as the history, the human and physical geography, the languages, and the cultural and artistic heritage in its tangible and intangible forms."
"The national aspects of these realities have often led to the kinds of partnerships and relationships, and antagonism and conflict, that can be found in relations between neighbours."
"Accordingly, they are arranged in strips that cut across national borders."
"Yet there is a whole that is the matrix in which all of these elements coexist in a framework of dynamic interaction, and it is this matrix that enables us to call ourselves Europeans."
"This is the dimension of which we speak."
"It will be no easy task to reflect this dimension in school curricula."
"It is therefore necessary to define the priorities, find the right methods, recast programmes, prepare teaching materials, and train teachers and educators in each country."
"In common with the European project itself, this will be a gradual, multipolar process which will not always run smoothly, but it must begin as soon as possible."
"The European dimension is the European added value and what we are talking about is more Europe."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the recommendation we are now debating is, together with the previous two, a major step forward in making young people and citizens more aware of, and better informed about, the importance of the European Union."
"It is a fact that the Union currently has few powers in the area of education. While some Member States – only a few – include some appropriate content on European affairs in their syllabuses or educational programmes, others are still a very long way from introducing this element into the curricula taught at their educational establishments."
"In view of this situation, I consider it necessary for us to develop at a European level what is laid down in Article 149 of the Treaty, which states that the Union should develop the European dimension in education, particularly through lifelong learning and the teaching and dissemination of the languages of the European Union."
"The Commissioner has already mentioned some examples that are leading in that direction, but this report must help to strengthen this requirement even more at a Community level, not only in order to provide the necessary skills in the area of European citizenship, but also to help citizens learn about the Union’s policies and institutions."
"There is also another reason, which is to raise awareness about European citizenship; this would lead to better communication between citizens and institutions; this communication is currently showing symptoms of ill health that will result in a number of not very helpful consequences."
"Mr Figel’, I call on the Commission to work even harder to specify what is meant by this so-called ‘European dimension’ in education, so that agreement can then be reached in the Council on how this commitment may be adopted within each individual education system."
"Lastly, I should like to point out the importance of language teaching – as has already been mentioned – in bringing young people closer to the various different cultures in the Union, as well as the importance of exchanging best practices, especially in the area of teacher training, since teachers are a key group in achieving the objectives that we have set ourselves."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I myself would also like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Beazley, for this excellent report."
"This is a very important subject."
"We have to ensure that there is not just a regional and national dimension, but also a European dimension to our children’s identity and thinking, and that they understand what kind of community of values they belong to and what sort of intellectual heritage they have."
"In spite of its mosaic of cultures, Europe has common values based on those of the Christian religion."
"These values are also based on the Hellenistic heritage and Roman law."
"Today they are mainly visible in the shape of democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion."
"It is important to teach children and young people these values from a young age, to promote them and adopt them as a full immersion subject in their education, so that we might understand what it is to be a European in an ever-integrating world, and so that we might be proud of that, as well as of our national roots and our continent."
"."
"Mr President, my thanks to Mr Figeľ, and to Mr Beazley for his report."
"The making of the European Union is a complex process in which, according to our point of view, education plays a fundamental role."
"It is impossible to establish European citizenship without the active support of a proper education system."
"As we know, many of our views about history, cultures, society, etc., are forged during our crucial school years."
"The education system happens to be a means for a state coercion, many times at the expense of cultural plurality and diversity."
"For this reason, history for instance, has been traditionally very highly mediatised by the state."
"The consequences of state-based education can be very counterproductive for our purposes and our values. For example, chauvinism and unilingualism: nearly 50% of European citizens are only able to speak fluently their own language."
"We need to overcome such a state-based education."
"Introducing the European dimension in our education systems can be a fundamental contribution to avoiding national chauvinism, to improve citizens’ command of several languages, to strengthen respect for plurality and diversity, and to build a common European identity."
". – Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that in the Czech Republic at least two foreign languages are taught from primary school age, and in the higher education system, for example at the University of Ostrava, Europeanism has become part of the social sciences curriculum."
"I should like to draw attention to one aspect of Europeanism that does not receive the emphasis that it deserves, however, and that is tolerance."
"The rapporteur mentions the need for agreement on shared history, which in my view is an idealistic target that might be attainable in the distant future."
"One thing that can be achieved, however, is tolerance, which is essential to the existence of the EU."
"The EU Member States cannot have one single overview of their history, because the success of one nation has often meant the failure of another."
"This view has changed only recently, however."
"In Europe, there is no nation that can stand above the continent’s history, providing a viewpoint that would suit everyone without offending anyone."
"The idea of a shared European history can be at best only a compromise."
"A more realistic goal would be to understand the history of other countries and their impartial version of events."
"Showing tolerance of historical and cultural differences would be a first step for Europeans towards sharing their values with other countries and cultures around the world."
"At the same time, tolerance and understanding will become the basis for defining shared European values."
"Young people should learn foreign languages, but should also recognise the culture and history of other countries."
"The job of teachers is to offer this kind of knowledge as a set of values worthy of the same respect as one’s own values."
"."
"Mr President, before discussing the European educational model and its implementation, we must first ask ourselves what kind of model we have in mind, whom it is meant to benefit, and what purpose it is meant to serve."
"Is it to be a model which encourages the all-round development of free individuals, and the promotion of all their skills and interests?"
"Or is it to be a model intended to produce globalised people who are trained for everyday life but lack creativity and imagination, people who possess little knowledge but are capable of carrying out the tasks they are assigned with?"
"I am in favour of the first model, because it is the only one which allows human beings the opportunity to fulfil themselves and the freedom of thought necessary to enable them to enrich the world with their creativity."
"Accordingly, the upbringing and education of an individual should be based on national and family values, and offer the possibility of freely drawing on the culture of other nations."
"We need a Europe of homelands, in which every nation and individual can feel secure."
"Any effort to create a globalised society with one single approved culture, in which it is possible to communicate in only a few languages would make Europe’s intellectual and economic development grind to a halt."
"Therefore, the right European model of education is one that will protect the traditions of all its nations and draw on them to benefit individuals and promote their development."
"."
"Mr President, may I remind you of what our rapporteur said on 12 October last year: ‘Governments know nothing about education; they frustrate the profession of teachers’."
"What frightens me is why he thinks the EU can do any better."
"Mr Beazley is a former teacher and MP and cannot be unaware that the United Kingdom Education Act 1996, brought in by his own party, forbids the promotion of partisan political views in schools in the United Kingdom."
"The EU is a political project – a project which has failed to persuade millions of adults, as shown by the results of the French and Dutch referendums last year."
"Having failed at that level, Mr Beazley now wants to try persuading our children of the benefits of the EU instead."
"I am reminded of a quotation: ‘Give me a child at the age of seven, and he is mine for life’."
"This, like so much else from this Committee, is sheer one-sided propaganda, and I will not tolerate or support it."
"Mr President, the document under discussion refers to a European dimension in education and the inclusion of European content in education."
"These terms have not been defined, however."
"There is a reference to shared history and cultural heritage, but that is not defined either."
"Our shared history consists mostly of wars against each other, but what does our common cultural heritage amount to?"
"Let us endeavour to summarise it."
"What is the nature of our common positive values?"
"If we stop to consider this question we must acknowledge that we are bound together by Greek culture, Roman law and Christian ethics."
"Everything European is based on these key foundations which define Europe itself."
"It follows that we should promote the teaching of Greek and Latin, the classical languages."
"We should also promote teaching of the Christian contribution to the dominant cultural standards of Europe, by which I mean art, architecture, our way of life, and in particular our family and social lives."
"Sadly, however, this House is doing its utmost to erase everything Christian from its documents."
"What is more, a clearly anti-Christian stance is being promoted."
"There was an outraged reaction in the Chamber when the Polish Education Minister withdrew the Council of Europe’s textbook from schools, which recommended promoting homosexuality in schools, with allegations that European values were being rejected."
"This document is empty and useless without definitions of the European dimension, European values and European content."
"."
"Never before have the topics of European identity, European values, European borders and European citizenship been discussed as broadly as they are today."
"Granted, we are not able to define these notions precisely, but this debate is a manifestation of how Europe has changed."
"Where previously Europe was engaged not only in discussing, but also in controlling the production of coal and steel so as to avert the risk of war, today the discussion is about Europe itself and the world around it."
"I believe that this is a positive shift."
"Education about what Europe has been through and the environment in which it exists is very important for its own development and for the world of the 21st century in which Europe may – and must – play a more important and positive role than in the 20th century, when it was a source of tragedy, war, totalitarianism and other woes on a global scale."
"Ignorance and indifference tend to be major sources of intolerance."
"They pave the way for propaganda and the manipulation of public opinion, as well as the opinions of individuals."
"I therefore believe that education about Europe’s past and present, and the cultures that we experience and live in, is an important precondition for a more peaceful and cohesive Europe that will continue to develop its legal system and views on values and culture."
"I believe that Europe will set about doing this in more peaceful and tolerant ways than when it was engaged in mutual annihilation."
"I would like to thank Christopher Beazley again for this own-initiative report and to express the hope that this topic may become a subject of debate among the Member States, for it is they that are responsible for determining the subject matter and organisation of education, something that will not be regarded as superfluous but rather as a highly important complementary aspect of education here in the single legal, economic and cultural space of an enlarged Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report by Mr Mann on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the creation of a European Qualifications Framework (2006/2002(INI)) (A6-0248/2006)."
". – Mr President, Commissioner Figeľ, ladies and gentlemen, since we in the European Union are unable to compete with the low wages and minimal social standards of emerging economies, we must instead be consistent in developing our potential for high-quality work, and for that training in skills and continuing education are essential."
"In March 2005, the education ministers of the twenty-five EU Member States declared their willingness to modernise their national systems in order to enable individuals to adapt themselves to the ever more exacting demands of the domestic and international markets."
"There are still high barriers impeding access to education and training between one institution and another and between Member States, preventing knowledge and skills from being effectively applied, and making qualifications less than transparent, with the consequence that there is not enough recognition of degree and diploma qualifications outside the country in which they were acquired, but the more transparent the school, vocational education and university systems are, the more readily the specific models used in the Member States – for example, the quality of dual system in my own country, Germany, and the value of a master craftsman’s qualification – can be assessed."
"The European Qualifications Framework is a meta-framework with three functions."
"Firstly, it is intended to link national and international qualifications."
"Secondly, it is intended to ensure that vocational and general educational qualifications are recognised and capable of being recognised and transferred, and, thirdly, it is intended to ensure greater transparency, permeability and mobility."
"The European Qualifications Framework is founded upon eight reference levels that categorise learning outcomes, ranging from basic skills for simple tasks to the highly specific competences required for academic education."
"At every one of these eight levels, irrespective of the educational route pursued, it must be possible to acquire work-related skills."
"This has met with broad approval from the social partners, from chambers of commerce and industry and the governing bodies of crafts and trades, from educational institutions, teachers in vocational colleges, trainees and apprentices and those who train them, and students at schools and colleges, for all of them are aware that the Member States’ schemes are not being replaced, but rather extended on the basis of expert knowledge to be implemented on a voluntary basis."
"As your House’s rapporteur, I have expressed criticism of a number of points in the Commission’s proposal as representing an excessive emphasis on academic education and taking insufficient account of vocational training."
"I still believe that there is an insufficiently clear link to the labour market."
"The European Qualifications Framework must have as its goals those of, , growth and employment, as set by Lisbon II, combining on the one hand the competitiveness of businesses and, on the other, the employability of individuals."
"The Committee for Employment and Social Affairs shared my objections, and I was very glad to see my colleagues – many of whom are present today – submitting proposals and, apart from three abstentions, voting unanimously to adopt this report."
"Among other things, we endorse the revision of the qualifications framework to include the comparability of the outcomes of learning processes, in marked contrast to many previous evaluations, which have considered only the duration of the learning process and the type of qualification gained from it."
"What is most important to us is that vocational and academic education should be treated as being of equal value, being two sides of the same coin, namely the Bologna process aimed at creating a common European framework for higher education and the Copenhagen process for enhancing European cooperation in vocational education."
"The European Qualifications Framework will succeed only if national qualifications frameworks come into being in all the Member States, if it is then possible to develop them, and if they can be properly coupled to the European Qualifications Framework by 2009."
"My hope is that what the Framework contains will be made accessible to the public at large – in which we in this House will certainly play our part – and that the social partners, the providers of education and the institutions will cooperate in good faith."
"Only then will the right tools be available for the educational establishments and for working life in the European Union."
"."
"Mr President, this is a package of issues that shows that education and training is getting a momentum."
"I am sure that EQF is one of points for the coming years."
"When I was asked about the top issues in my portfolio for the next five years, I said that EQF is one of them and so I think we are delivering it now; not only speaking about it."
"First of all, I would like to express gratitude to the rapporteur and to the Employment Committee, for the excellent report prepared in consultation with other committees, which reflects the Commission’s consultation paper from last year."
"It gives us the opportunity to reflect the formal proposal adopted this month, because I am sure that lifelong learning and mobility are crucial to our competitiveness and social cohesion in the European Union."
"The Commission has always taken positive steps to make progress in these fields. However, in practice people in Europe still too often face obstacles when they try to move from one country to another to learn or work, and when they want to become citizens more than tourists in the Union."
"They also face difficulties when they want to build on previous education and training and move, for example, from vocational education and training into higher education."
"The EQF will help to solve that problem."
"It will improve transparency and make different national qualifications systems or qualifications frameworks more understandable across Europe."
"By helping different systems to talk to each other, it will promote access to education and training and increase mobility for learning or work."
"It could also be instrumental outside Europe, because when I was in Moscow or, in June, in Canada, both countries – Russia and Canada – expressed interest in knowing more about this instrument because they would like it to inspire their policies."
"We already have legal instruments, such as the directives on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications."
"The Europass initiative has been mentioned today, which also pursues similar goals. However, these instruments alone are not sufficient, which is why the EQF is an important further step to improve the situation."
"Our proposal already integrates many of the comments and recommendations contained in Mr Mann’s report; I am sure we can agree on that."
"I therefore consider that Parliament and the Commission are very much following the same line on this issue."
"The document on which you have commented was a consultation paper issued in July last year."
"Since then, we have moved further on the road towards a more practical and user-friendly instrument."
"Mr Mann is right to say that we should do more on vocational education and training."
"I would like to remind you that it came into the treaties in the Treaty of Rome, in 1957; and higher education not until the Maastricht Treaty; in 1999 we started the Bologna process, and only later on the Copenhagen process."
"Now we have two parallel processes, which feed well into the European qualifications framework, but we need it to get there in order to start the real implementation of important clauses in our treaties."
"We are doing that now: in the Bologna process, 45 countries; in Copenhagen, 32."
"Two weeks ago I was in Switzerland and they want to join the Copenhagen process."
"So those are good messages for our work."
"EQF will provide the full benefit only if correctly implemented by Member States."
"They will need to link their qualification systems to the EQF."
"I am convinced that our proposal provides the common language and the means to develop the necessary mutual trust, which is the basis for real implementation of such an instrument."
"That strategy is also helpful to employers and individuals in comparing qualifications across the Union and across diverse education and training systems."
"I am sure that this key initiative is helping people in Europe to face the challenges and reap the benefits of a knowledge-based society."
"We are looking forward not only to further discussions but also to further cooperation following the recent adoption of the proposal."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Strategy proposes to speed up the process of modernising the European education and training systems, with the aim of making the European economy the most competitive economy in the world by 2010."
"Greater mobility within the labour market and an effective lifelong learning system are the basic, essential conditions for this."
"The lack of communication and cooperation among the national authorities and among the training systems at various levels is preventing the skills and knowledge already acquired from being used effectively."
"For this reason, we need to promote a certain interplay among the education and qualification systems of the various Member States."
"As the Commissioner has mentioned, through Directive 36 on the recognition of professional qualifications, for which I was the rapporteur, work has already begun on certain aspects, and the creation of a European Qualifications Framework will naturally supplement and continue it."
"This work will be the way to enhance and strengthen mutual trust among the various systems, and will promote mobility and lifelong learning."
"It must provide a structure that is flexible and that can be easily integrated with the corresponding national structures, while at the same time upholding the various specific characteristics of those structures."
"It must ensure that qualifications relating to vocational education and training are recognisable, compatible and transferable, as Mr Mann rightly maintains."
"This will mean increasing and improving the exchange of information in terms of titles, qualifications, certificates and professional experience recognised in the Member States."
"In its current state, however, and as it is conceived in the Commission proposal, the European Qualifications Framework does not appear at all clear; it needs to be made more understandable, and certain aspects that now appear inconsistent need to be revised."
"We therefore suggest that the Commission revise and reformulate its proposal, while nevertheless maintaining the objectives."
"– () I am pleased to observe that the entire area of life-long education and training has recently moved from a marginalised position into centre stage."
"The review of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment and the need to fulfil its goals have been a major incentive."
"As early as 2000 an important step was taken in adopting the Education and Training 2010 work programme, aiming not only to improve the quality and efficiency of education and training systems but also to make them readily and broadly accessible."
"The proposed concept of the European Qualifications Framework that we are discussing today is a concrete initiative arising from the work programme."
"I regard this concept as a constructive incentive that will contribute significantly to transparency in the transfer and recognition of qualifications on a European level."
"It should also stimulate national and sectoral reforms for the promotion of lifelong education, while playing a substantial role in fostering the mobility of students and employees."
"In today’s discussion I would like to highlight the new element introduced by the EQR, namely the recognition of unofficial and informal education."
"This will alter the approach to evaluation, which has traditionally been based on the duration of education or the type of institution, putting instead more emphasis on performance, knowledge, skill and proficiency."
"I would like to thank my fellow MEP, Mr Mann, the rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for his work on the report into the establishment of a European Qualifications Framework, as well as the attending member of the European Commission responsible for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism, Mr Figeľ, as well as his team who have worked on the policy paper."
"It is good news that at its meeting on 5 September the European Commission endorsed the draft recommendation of the European Parliament and Council establishing the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong education."
"I trust that the European Parliament will adopt Mr Mann’s report at this plenary session, putting us in a position to debate a new Commission paper on the European Qualifications Framework."
". () I consider it an important task of the EU to enact European legislation that will formally and informally enhance the rules regulating the business environment."
"Human capital constitutes a key component of that environment; therefore, business associations describe the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications as the most positive measure taken by the European Union during this term."
"Another major step that deserves particular attention is the establishment of the European Qualifications Framework, which should ensure the transparent treatment of education irrespective of the method of attaining the underlying qualifications."
"I would also like to praise the new element, that is, the recognition of formal and informal education, including the acquisition of professional experience."
"In this regard I would like to thank my fellow Members, the rapporteurs Messrs Mann, Gaľa and Zappalà, for drafting a consistent report."
"I agree with the rapporteurs’ recommendation to simplify and make more transparent the eight-level reference scale that constitutes its basic element."
"I believe that although the European Qualifications Framework is voluntary, it will, along with national qualification frameworks, establish a system that will help tackle obstacles in the European Union’s labour market."
"I am convinced that the business sector will also appreciate this initiative by the European Commission, as it will make the diverse national qualification certificates easier to understand, and employers will then be in a position to use the European Qualifications Framework as a reference tool in selecting highly qualified staff on the basis of education, skill and competency."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the European Qualifications Framework, the Union is providing itself with a tool that can certainly be improved, but that is key to developing mobility within the European Union."
"The mobility of businesses and European citizens actually opens up a new labour market at Community level."
"For all European employees, be they engineers, technicians or manual workers, professional qualifications are the only genuine guarantee of their value in the labour market, both at national and at Community level."
"Just as the single currency, the euro, is a shared value in terms of guaranteeing that the economy is flexible and integrated into the Community, we need a shared value for professional qualifications that is recognised on the European labour market."
"Businesses and employees both need the shared value of professional qualifications to be recognised."
"For businesses, qualifications guarantee an employee’s level of competence and his or her suitability for the role; for an employee, they guarantee and promote this level of competence wherever he or she is within the European Union."
"Whatever our national traditions may be, certification always confirms a person’s ability to do a job and to use the skills necessary to that end."
"That ability is the fruit of knowledge acquired, either through training or through work experience."
"I should like to emphasise how progress has been made in some of our Member States in terms of validating acquired experience, which, as has been said, complements training."
"In the long term, the European Qualifications Framework will have to integrate this process and be open to all forms of recognition."
"The next stage will have to consist in making the social partners aware of, and involved in, this process straight away so as to ensure that the EQF is taken into account in the agreements and collective agreements and so as to combine a genuine social guarantee with the flexibility of the labour market."
"The value truly placed in employment, Mr President, can be seen in employment contracts and pay slips."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has been said several times this evening, education and training policy is to be decided on a national basis."
"That, moreover, is how matters should stay."
"As today’s debate also shows, however, there are many common initiatives under way to develop education and training in Europe through exchanges and cooperation."
"These are sound initiatives, and it is important for them to be communicated to a broad range of the population."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe can sincerely endorse the creation of a European Qualifications Framework, or what is popularly known as the EQF."
"This framework is designed to promote the recognition and use of qualifications and skills that have already been acquired and thus to facilitate access to lifelong learning for everyone."
"The fact that 32 countries are participating in this form of cooperation makes possible a broadly-based development of education and training and employment opportunities in Europe."
"The very fact of concentrating on qualifications already acquired is an important breakthrough."
"The focus is on results and actual ability, and not only on the ways in which that ability is acquired."
"Proper account is thus being taken of the very different structures for, in particular, vocational education that exist in Europe, and, at the same time, we are setting common targets."
"In this connection, I would emphasise Mr Mann’s call for us to focus more on vocational education, including continuing education."
"It is not only university education we should focus on."
"Moreover, it is important to produce a system that is not unduly complicated."
"It needs to be simpler and clearer than what was proposed in the working paper."
"If EQF is to be a success, it is also important, as the Commissioner has already said, for all the countries to be involved voluntarily and to introduce their own national – or, where relevant, regional – framework systems for assessing qualifications."
"It is important to build on the work already done on assessing the quality of education and training and to avoid setting up unnecessary bureaucracy."
"It will not be easy, but we are setting ourselves ambitious targets this evening."
"."
"Mr President, it is surely a very good thing that the Council and the Commission are concerned that skills, abilities and competences acquired at school, in working life or in leisure time, should be, as far as possible, mutually recognised."
"I also want to express my high regard for Mr Mann, who deserves support for his proposals, particularly his proposal that far greater provision be made for vocational training alongside academic education."
"In the one minute available to me, I would just like to say a brief word about the problems with the recognition of qualifications."
"The main difficulty is that knowledge and ability are non-material goods, and, as such, very hard to standardise and measure."
"People who were very good at school, for example, often get nowhere in day-to-day working life, since the qualities measured and marked in school are often quite different."
"If people are going to be successful in working life, they need, above all else, emotional, creative and social competences, nerve, enthusiasm, practical intelligence, tenacity, and the capacity to cope with stress. These qualities are, alas, not especially called for or encouraged at school, nor, indeed, can they be."
"."
"First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very well drafted and balanced report."
"I have no doubt that an effectively functioning European Union employment market is still just a matter of time."
"The European qualification framework will be an important step in that direction, creating the preconditions for the formation of a single employment market and a single training environment."
"I have no doubt that qualification comparability would not only foster mobility in the labour force, but would impart a different quality to the employment market, by effectively distributing the labour force."
"The qualification framework would foster a much closer connection between Member States’ national education systems and the requirements of the European Union’s employment market."
"These steps are closely related to the Lisbon Strategy and the Lisbon objectives."
"The most recent enlargement created an unprecedented increase in the mobility of the labour force within the European Union."
"Jobseekers have travelled from various new Member States in central and eastern Europe to the United Kingdom and Ireland – older Member States, which were the only ones to open their labour markets without restrictions."
"In fact, the situation at this moment is unique, as far as assessing the need for the comparability of European qualifications is concerned."
"The significant differences in salaries have encouraged thousands of highly-qualified jobseekers from central and eastern Europe to take simple jobs that only demand low-level qualifications."
"A study recently carried out by Ireland’s Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment shows that most employees are working in jobs at a lower level of qualifications than their professional training would permit them to do."
"A not insignificant number of workers with university degrees work in jobs that require basic training of just a few hours."
"Those are the difficulties in comparing education systems that are completely different."
"Those are both resources that are lost to the states from which jobseekers come, and wasted resources in the states in which they cannot make use of their professional training."
"I hope that the European qualification framework will encourage those Member States between which there is active movement by the labour force to become pioneers in putting the framework into practice and in the comparison of qualifications, and that these Member States will not be the only ones. Thank you."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Mann on his interesting report."
"Mobility is one of the principles of a common Europe."
"The mobility of students and workers can only come about, however, if the problems concerning recognition of certificates and diplomas are finally resolved. This requires the European Union to set European Qualifications Frameworks."
"The work set in train in Bologna, Barcelona, Copenhagen and Maastricht must be carried forward."
"We need to ensure that as soon as possible, workers arriving from other Union countries are not told by local administrations that there is work for them but their qualification is not acceptable."
"EQFs will improve the quality of training in all Member States of the Union."
"They will help rise to the challenges of globalisation, and increase competitiveness on the labour market."
"There is also a significant psychological dimension involved."
"Recognising someone’s qualifications underwritten by a vocational certificate or academic diploma amounts to recognising the effort made by the individual concerned to gain an education."
"Conversely, there is an element of discrimination and denigration in the refusal to recognise a qualification as equivalent in another Member State."
"We must not delude ourselves."
"EQFs are not a straightforward matter."
"Institutions of higher education and training centres in the same country often find it difficult to reach agreement, so it is hardly surprising if the same happens at Union level."
"That is why the decision must be a political one, at Union level, rather than academic in nature."
"For example, a Polish certificate in bricklaying should be recognised in Germany and a German one in Poland."
"An Oxford degree in psychology should be recognised everywhere, and the same should apply to a psychology degree awarded by a less prestigious university in a smaller country."
"Local professional associations should not be able to raise objections."
"Yet in Belgium, for example, there is not even a competent body to consider the validity of the qualifications of self-employed Polish painters or bricklayers."
"As a result, certain individuals are unable to do certain jobs."
"The question of EQFs is particularly important for the citizens of new Member States."
"It is they who will be offering their professional qualifications, rather than capital investment, to other Union Member States for the foreseeable future."
"A common denominator for capital investment already exists, namely the euro."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that Europe has, during the course of its history, faced many challenges and serious threats, such as unemployment, poverty and job insecurity."
"Nonetheless, these worrying trends towards social disruption are not a self-fulfilling prophesy that we should accept fatalistically. The solutions need to be sought far from perceptions which consider that competitiveness must be achieved by showing disdain for employment."
"With respect for European values and our social sensitivities and with knowledge as our epicentre, we can follow a development course, bearing in mind that the globalisation of economic activity, social progress and environmental protection are based on the continuous development of new skills and the use of new technologies."
"If we upgrade research centres to pillars of innovation and acquisition of professional experience, we shall make lifelong learning efficient, for the benefit of one and all."
"Workers' new skills must meet common European evaluation criteria, thereby expanding their potential for development."
"In light of this and with respect both for the idiosyncrasies of the various professional sectors and the idiosyncrasies of the various regions, we need to determine in a clear, explicit and integrated manner the axes and prospects of the European Qualifications Framework, with knowledge as a social, not a commercial commodity at its epicentre."
"To close, I should like to congratulate Mr Mann."
"."
"It is not only the discussion but also the report itself and the atmosphere surrounding qualifications in Europe that constitute a major challenge for us to establish a space with a more European content."
"This would mean rules and standards that establish a certain quality, and hence mobility, for citizens."
"I would therefore like to emphasise several aspects important to the entire issue."
"One is about creating a space, which means not only availability and quality of primary education, higher education and training but also a space for follow-up education, continual or lifelong learning, and for the recognition of unofficial and informal schooling."
"The European Qualifications Framework is moving in just that direction."
"Secondly, this is a follow-up contribution to what we have already done: the Europass adopted in this Parliament helps make qualifications more transparent, but the Qualifications Framework will be instrumental in making qualifications compatible and comparable, and will thus enable their transfer."
"This is a very important shift."
"If we manage to adopt it definitively, it will provide a good framework not only for employers and employees but also for education and training providers, as it will open up this space and as a result will bring pressure to bear for improvements in quality."
"Openness is all about promoting better-quality education and training."
"Mrs Jensen has mentioned 32 countries."
"I believe that their number will gradually grow as we succeed in developing the Copenhagen Process and the Bologna Process, offering credibility, high standards and guaranteed qualitative parameters."
"I am convinced that this will benefit the EU as a whole, as well as its citizens and institutions."
"I believe that this will be instrumental in ensuring that a plumber, for example, whether Polish or from another country, is not perceived as a threat but as a very important contributor to mobility and competitiveness in a common Europe."
"Let us keep up the good work on this Qualifications Framework."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to inform Parliament that, this morning, a few kilometres from Kabul, there has been a terrorist attack in which an Italian soldier has been killed and another two European soldiers – two Italian soldiers – have been seriously injured and have been admitted to Kabul hospital."
"I believe that it is only right that we express our solidarity with these women and men who are involved in the peace missions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon."
"I am much obliged to you, Mr Tajani."
"We will pass that on to the President, who, I am sure, will cause those things to be done that need to be done."
"The next item is the report (A6-0275/2006) by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on services of general interest (2005/2101(INI))."
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, having the President of the Commission present for a debate on an own-initiative report is not an everyday occurrence, for an own-initiative report is not exactly an outstanding event when what we are actually meant to be doing is making laws – although I shall turn to that in a moment."
"What your presence here demonstrates is that the Commission is clear in its own mind about how important this issue is in the eyes of the public, and hence, too, in those of the citizens’ representatives here in this House."
"It is for that reason that I would like to refer back to a previous President of the Commission, and not just any old President, but Jacques Delors, who, a few months ago, addressing a meeting of the Committee of the Regions, attempted to place services of general interest in the context of the project of European integration."
"He told the Committee of the Regions that the work of European integration took three principles as its frame of reference: solidarity, which brings people together and has social, economic and territorial cohesion as its objectives; cooperation, whereby it is intended that the transnational and European aspirations of the EU’s treaties and programmes be fulfilled, and competition, which is meant to make possible the completion of the internal market on the secure basis of the rules of the social market economy and governed by democratic competition law aimed primarily at limiting the misuse of economic power and guaranteeing consumers the protection of the law."
"Although these three principles refer to services of general interest and to services of general economic interest, there are always tensions inherent in the relationships of the corners of this sort of triangle, and, where services of general interest and services of general economic interest are concerned, it is obvious where they lie."
"Public services have an essential part to play in the quality of life enjoyed by individual citizens; they also have a key role in the European Union’s Lisbon Strategy."
"Good public services can help overcome economic stagnation, social exclusion and isolation, to reinforce social and territorial cohesion, to improve, both internally and externally, the European single market’s functioning, and to enable it to compete better."
"Even so, whenever I am in the region from which I come or visiting others, and sit down with local politicians and the providers of services of general interest to discuss these, I have to deal with their complaints to the effect that we are interfering in their remits, making their jobs more difficult, and failing to make clear under what conditions they can operate."
"Their claim is that they do not, where the law is concerned, actually know where they stand."
"It is for that reason that appropriate legal initiatives to afford them that legal certainty would appear to be necessary."
"There will be those who, in the course of this debate, will ask what we are actually after – after all, they will say, do we not have the Commission to issue communications and enact guidelines, and the Court of Justice to lay down the law? – and to them I have to say that that is evidently not enough, and, moreover, it does indeed contribute to the prevailing legal uncertainty, for the Commission, with its communications and guidelines, does nothing to create legal certainty."
"It may well suggest that it does, but the fact is that a communication is not the sort of black-and-white law on which one can rely."
"We really must take the initiative in matters of law, and we are also making proposals as to how we can do this, not all of which I want to discuss, but the point I would make to you, Mr President of the Commission, is that the right of initiative that you possess is also a duty of initiative, and I urge you to make use of it."
"The building blocks for such legal initiatives are to be found in the resolution on which we will be voting tomorrow, as well as in the resolutions we have already adopted, in, for example, the Langen and Herzog reports."
"We are not prescribing a specific instrument; that is for you to do."
"Our allotted task is to give our own assessment – each group for itself – of the Commission legislative thinking, and we will, after further debate, give our own assessment of the proposal for a framework directive that our group has put forward."
"Others must do the same with their own proposals; then we, working together in this House, must move the legislative process forward, and for that, the codecision procedure is an absolute requirement."
"It is within that procedure that we need legal initiatives, for it is not you and your fellow Commissioner, together with the highly qualified and well motivated staff of the Commission, nor indeed the national governments, but we, the Members of the European Parliament, who enjoy the legitimacy conferred by election."
"It is we who have to get down to the grass roots and discuss these things with the local politicians to whom we are accountable; it is we who bear responsibility for what is done."
"It is for that reason that the codecision procedure must apply, and for that reason that this House must exercise its prerogatives in full."
"."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, services of general interest are at the very heart of our European social model."
"They cover a vast gamut of activities, ranging from the major network services – the energy, telecommunications, transport and postal services – to health and social services and water and waste-management services."
"What we call network services, namely transport, energy, telecommunications and postal services, account for about 7% of our collective GDP and 5% of total employment in the European Union."
"They therefore constitute an essential element of the everyday lives of all European citizens and of Europe’s businesses too."
"The success of the European growth and employment strategy – the Lisbon Strategy – which is vital to our prosperity, also depends on the quality and efficiency of these services."
"Since the Commission published its White Paper on services of general interest, an intense debate has ensued on the role that the European Union might play with regard to these services."
"I am pleased that this debate is taking place."
"I wish to thank Mr Rapkay, the rapporteur, and his colleagues in the committees for having moved the debate forward with this excellent report."
"The reality of services of general interest is complex."
"Moreover, it is changing all the time."
"Technical progress, new expectations on the part of society and consumers, financial pressures and the modernisation of public administration have all profoundly transformed the way in which these services are provided."
"In these times of rapid economic and technological change, services of general interest need a useful and effective legal framework that enables providers of these services to achieve their prescribed aims and to keep adapting to a changing environment."
"The Commission is willing to cooperate in the creation of such a legal framework on the basis of four essential principles."
"Firstly, the framework for services of general interest provided nationally, regionally and locally must remain the responsibility of Member States so that we can uphold the important principle of subsidiarity."
"There is quite simply no alternative."
"I am firmly convinced that the European Union must respect the diversity of conditions and practices that exists among the Member States."
"This diversity reflects different histories and cultures of state intervention."
"I subscribe to the view expressed in your report that it would be absolutely inappropriate to adopt uniform definitions at the Community level."
"Member States must remain free to define their services of general interest on the basis of their varied needs, structures and traditions."
"The second principle is this: the promotion and protection of universally accessible services of general interest that represent good value for money are compatible with open competitive markets."
"For evidence, we need only observe sectors such as telecommunications or air transport, where public-service activities have been successfully entrusted to private operators while the interests of consumers have been fully safeguarded."
"It should, however, be emphasised that, in the event of an irreconcilable conflict between the rules of the internal market or of competition and a service of general interest, the service of general interest must take precedence."
"This is what the Treaty prescribes and what the Court has confirmed."
"The Commission is willing to provide any advice or information that may be necessary in this matter."
"The third principle is that any EU framework applicable to services of general interest must be responsive to divergences and conducive to modernisation."
"It must be based on the aims of high quality, good value for money and universal access."
"It is, in fact, a matter of meeting the expectations of people and businesses but also of preventing social and territorial exclusion."
"Moving on to the fourth principle, legal certainty is essential, as I have said, not only for consumers and operators but also for the public authorities."
"It is incumbent on the public authorities at every level to define clearly the rules that apply to services of general interest."
"At the European level, given the diversity of situations and sectors, it remains to be established whether a single legislative instrument or a sector-by-sector approach would be the better means to the desired end."
"I noted that you asked this question in your report."
"The four principles I have just outlined serve as a guide for Community action."
"Such action is essentially pragmatic."
"We are in the process of formulating sectoral policies at the level of the European Union for those sectors where the need for such a policy is clearly felt and where it can bring real additional benefits."
"Problems affecting more than one sector are tackled as they arise."
"The Commission has been very active in this area along with this House and the Council, and I think I can say that we have made good progress in several areas."
"We used the Altmark package to simplify and clarify the rules on state aid relating to services of general interest."
"We are currently checking the application of the new rules on public procurement which came into force in January."
"We have engaged in extremely broad consultations on the issue of public-private partnerships, and we have announced new initiatives for 2007."
"We have arrived at an agreement on public transport services."
"We have adopted a Communication on social services, and we are now initiating consultations on health services."
"We have launched a broad consultation process on the energy sector, and we shall be presenting other proposals – including, let me stress, legislative proposals, not just communications."
"In fact, at the present time we are revising the regulatory framework that applies to electronic communications, and we shall be proposing a new directive on postal services before the end of the year."
"These recent advances show that the European Union is displaying initiative and ambition with regard to services of general interest."
"They also illustrate the important role played by Parliament and the Council."
"After the adoption of the Rapkay report, which we shall analyse carefully, the Commission is firmly resolved to go further."
"We shall present a communication on this subject before the end of the year."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the main message I picked up from your report was a twofold call to action: firstly for the creation of greater legal certainty as regards the EU rules governing services of general interest, and secondly for recognition of the wide diversity of sectors and situations throughout Europe."
"I believe the time has come for us to consolidate the regulatory framework that applies to services of general interest in the European Union."
"That is what our fellow citizens expect."
"The Commission will take full account of your report when it examines this issue between now and the end of this year."
". Madam President, it is important to state one thing in this debate: there is no better way to ensure high quality, accessibility and low prices than a broad range of competition and entrepreneurship in the European economy."
"We have all seen the results and achievements in a number of sectors that 10 or 20 years ago were looked upon as monopolies on typical services of general interest."
"We have seen achievements in telecom and airlines and we will see achievements in new areas, because we are talking about services that are by nature dynamic and convergent."
"They are a huge and important part of the future knowledge economy."
"We have to open up and, at the same time, respect the specific solutions each Member State needs for what it defines as services of general interest."
"I should like to underline in this debate that there is no call in the report for a framework directive or a horizontal framework of any kind, but there is an emphasis on legal clarity based on a sectoral approach and a call for sector-specific directives where they are needed."
"Mr Barroso, you mentioned healthcare."
"We can look back and see how the sector-specific approach has been quite successful in recent years."
"So we are calling for legal clarity, based upon the sector-specific approach, and we look forward to seeing future sectoral directives."
"We underline that there is no legal basis in the Treaties for a proposal that would interfere with the internal market, competition rules or public procurement."
"We stress that this is an area in which there must be respect for Member States and for the principle of subsidiarity."
"In the coming decades, we will see opportunities arising for more and more cross-border activities in new areas."
"I believe that there will be fantastic opportunities for patients to get better healthcare in different countries and that could also create vitality for the European economy."
"But we agree on the need to respect the internal market, at the same time as we respect subsidiarity."
"I hope, Mr Barroso, that you will read this report and see the need to go further on sector-specific directives and the sector-specific approach, in order to create the legal clarity that also respects the principle of subsidiarity."
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has put my colleague Mr Rapkay’s report, and the issue of services of general interest, at the heart of what it is trying to do during this Parliament."
"We have made so bold – and it was an extraordinary achievement on our part – as to put together our own draft directive, which includes the essentials of what Mr Rapkay has set out in his report, and which I presented to you, Mr President of the Commission, and to the then President of the Council, Mr Schüssel."
"What we see as important in the services debate – certain essential individual elements of which I shall shortly address – is that our strategy should strike a balance between the demands of the internal market, which we social democrats are aware of and acknowledge, and the need to protect the public by reinforcing local and regional institutions, which are still best suited to maintaining the subsidiarity principle in the provision of services."
"The essential message that must be carried by this debate is ‘flexibility where it is needed, protection where it is possible’."
"After all the Councils we have had – in Barcelona, Laeken, Nice – and after all the debates we have had, we see your coming here today, Mr President of the Commission, as the Commission’s underlining of the importance of this debate, and something for which we are grateful to you."
"That is also the reason why I, as chairman of our group, am speaking in this debate."
"The main thing I have to do is to underline on behalf of our group what Mr Rapkay has, in his role as rapporteur, said about this report, but there are two other things I should like to say as well."
"I listened to what Mr Hökmark said with a great deal of attention."
"It is interesting when a convinced liberal tries to take the curve on this issue."
"To be sure, we are all in favour of the internal market, and we all want it to do all it can to spark off economic dynamism; on that we agree with you, but it becomes more difficult when it comes to the subsidiarity principle, which free-marketeers otherwise insist on as a matter of principle, yet, when it is used to guarantee certain indispensable social standards, it suddenly becomes a hindrance."
"That is not on!"
"I do not know whether requiring all health services to actually be subject to the free market is something that is worth striving for, nor do I know whether we have to sit back and watch until the day comes when every last municipal graveyard is run on commercial lines."
"I do not think that makes sense."
"We certainly still need strengthened local and regional authorities to enable us, within the framework of subsidiarity, to provide high-quality services that respond directly to what the public needs and demands."
"That is at the heart of social democratic policy, and we will not abandon it, but we also want the chance for local and regional authorities to enhance quality by means of greater flexibility and opening-up to the internal market, thereby, by their own free choice, being able to ensure flexibility in the provision of good and affordable services, for both are possible."
"It was with a great deal of attention that we heard you, Mr President, saying that you wanted to consolidate the legal framework as a whole, for your acknowledgement of the need for a legal framework marks a great step forward, and your wanting now to consolidate it is an indication of your desire for a broad-based rather than sector-by-sector approach."
"If that is how you want to proceed, then I can imagine us making common cause quite soon."
"I would like to say, on behalf of our group, that our venture in writing a draft directive of our own, combined with what Mr Rapkay has had to say, and with the President’s remarks, will convince you too, Madam Vice-President, that we are on the right track."
". Madam President, I wish to begin by paying tribute to the rapporteur for a magnificent job."
"Even if we did not always agree, he was extremely patient and open to cooperation, for which I am very grateful."
"It is very important that we make our position clear once and for all."
"I am concerned that the report we adopted in committee has been interpreted in so many different ways."
"There have been jubilant press releases stating that the European Parliament has finally called for a framework directive, whereas others state that the European Parliament has finally rejected the framework directive once and for all."
"We need to get away from a situation in which we have watered-down compromises that can be interpreted in various ways."
"I can state, on behalf of my group, that we do not want a framework directive."
"We do not want a one-size-fits-all solution for Europe, precisely because we want subsidiarity."
"But what is subsidiarity?"
"Subsidiarity means that the national and local authorities can define their services of general interest and decide on how they are organised and financed."
"Subsidiarity does not mean automatic exemption from the market rules."
"We are therefore talking about two kinds of subsidiarity here."
"I listened very carefully to what Mr Barroso said and again he left some room for interpretation."
"I would like to interpret his remarks as meaning that he also wants targeted and concrete solutions for real problems."
"Because another recommendation I should like to make to this House is: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!"
"In that case, it is not legislation we need, but solutions to real problems."
"I have worked for a local authority, so I know what the real problems are."
"Local authorities have very legitimate concerns."
"However, we have to acknowledge that there is also a tendency towards protectionism."
"We will have to find the right balance here."
"We also need to get away from the ideological debate, or at least be honest and admit that there is a certain degree of ideology involved."
"Some people very legitimately feel that the public authority should also be the provider of services."
"I agree with my colleague, Mr Hökmark, that the market can provide excellent services."
"Some sectors have been liberalised and that did not mean that more people were excluded from access to those services, but quite the contrary: many services have come within reach of many more people, which is extremely social."
"A market is not a jungle; it has rules, because if there are no rules it is not a market."
"Any market – even the simplest market on the market square – has rules and that is exactly what we mean by the social market economy we have in Europe."
"We need to recognise the diversity of the Member States and allow them to decide for themselves what they call ‘services of general interest’."
"Finally, we should not try to define what services of general interest and services of general economic interest are, because the word ‘economic’ applies not to the nature of the service itself but to the way in which it is provided."
"To take an example: everybody will recognise that water is of general interest, but it may be provided in a purely commercial way."
"So we must not lose ourselves in a senseless debate on the differences between ‘of general interest’ and ‘general economic interest’."
"The only interest we should be looking at here is the interest of our citizens and consumers."
"Madam President, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much appreciated the content of President Barroso’s speech."
"I appreciated the intention he announced to present one or more legislative drafts – I shall return to the question of one or more in a moment – for adoption by codecision as well as the four principles he invoked."
"I believe it was important to reiterate those principles."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs rejected our proposal for a simple reference to the substance of Article 122 of the Constitutional Treaty and, what is worse, for a simple reference to Article 86 of the present Treaty."
"The latter article, as you pointed out, specifies that, in the event of a conflict between the market and public-service requirements in law or in practice, the public service must take precedence."
"I believe it is extremely important that the parliamentary draft reaffirms what we adopted at the time of the Constitutional Treaty, namely the text of Article 122, and confirms that at least we still believe in Article 86 of the present Treaty."
"What we would like is to go much further in pinning down the precise implications of our forthcoming vote."
"If there is one point on which I agree with Mrs in't Veld, it is that Mr Rapkay’s diplomatic and very judiciously calculated statement about the need to legislate can be equally easily interpreted to mean one thing or the other."
"We will therefore ask you, in accordance with both the Treaty of Amsterdam and the interinstitutional agreement, to present us with a draft directive by virtue of the right of legislative initiative vested in this Parliament."
"We are also entirely in agreement with the four principles you outlined to us."
"If we disagree with Mrs in't Veld, the precise bone of contention is subsidiarity."
"I regard it as a grave misjudgement to talk of strict subsidiarity when the Services Directive is actually the applicable instrument in the absence of a specific directive on services of general interest."
"The fact is that we have watched the substance and scope of the Services Directive vary incessantly from day to day and from week to week."
"At one point, subsidised housing was included."
"Then it was almost excluded, only to be reinstated again, though not fully."
"We need only compare our parliamentary draft with those of the Commission and the Council to see the lack of agreement on the public services that fall within the ambit of the Services Directive."
"We need to legislate today to set these matters straight."
"."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the general interest, the public good, the common good, public services: these are all key reference points which, as the President of the Commission has said, are at the heart of the debate on the concept of the European social model."
"We are touching here upon people’s daily lives, on their perception of the future and on our conception of society."
"Fundamental values, such as equality, solidarity and democracy, are at stake."
"The issues are too important for us to deal with by means of fuzzy definitions or unsatisfactory compromises."
"My group wishes to emphasise three aspects that require clarification."
"The first is the relationship between public services and the rules governing the internal market, in other words the provisions on competition, public procurement and state aid, not to mention the powers of the Commission and the Court to monitor and sanction perceived abuses."
"In our view, we need a radically new legal basis that will allow public services to exist in Europe outside the logic of the market."
"It is true, as Mr Barroso and Mr Lipietz have reminded us, that the Treaty gives precedence to the provision of public services in cases where such provision conflicts with the rules of competition."
"It also recognises that national governments have the right to define general interest, but it is the Commission and, in the final analysis, the Court that determine the extent to which derogations may be made."
"Consequently, a country that is not considered to be anti-liberal, namely the Netherlands, has been brought to book for having committed, and I quote, ‘a manifest public-service error, because the subsidised social housing cooperatives counted among their tenants households that were not socially disadvantaged’."
"The truth is that this exemption regime is effectively tending to whittle away at public services."
"This brings me to the second point I wish to make, namely the extent of our ambitions in the realm of public services."
"In our view, these services should quite simply cover the fundamental rights that everyone has in equal measure in this twenty-first century, namely education, health care, housing and decent living conditions, child care, information, culture, transport, telecommunications, postal services, energy and water supply, sewage and waste disposal and other needs that have become compelling, such as access to credit."
"Services in these areas must therefore be governed by the imperative of socially effective delivery without being subjected to the pressure of competition."
"One third and final aspect needs to be highlighted, and that is the link between subsidiarity and the European integration project."
"As has been said, experiences of public-service management, of property structures and of funding methods vary from one country to another."
"It must be the sovereign right of each country to make these choices, with all their implications."
"So do we or do we not need a framework directive?"
"The debate on this issue has begun in our group, and I, for my part, would say ‘Let’s go for it!’"
"Let the Commission prepare such an instrument on the basis of the principles I have just restated."
"Some might object that this approach is incompatible with the rules of the Treaty."
"That, in fact, is exactly why we want to change those rules."
"I propose, Madam President, that we put this question at the top of the agenda for the great debate that has been announced on the future of Europe, and we shall see what Europeans really think about this matter."
". Madam President, one can understand the desire to define the scope of EU interference in the provision of public services."
"It helps if you are running a business or a public service to know what the rules are, but I am appalled that this should hinge on defining the distinction between services of economic general interest and services of non-economic general interest."
"Surely, all services are economic in the proper sense that they have an economic value, otherwise they presumably would not be provided."
"I fear that attempts at such a definition will merely cause more confusion, less efficiency and more scope for ambiguous judgments from the European Court of Justice."
"At root, the problem is that national and local authorities must have sovereignty over the management of public services, because public services are paid for by national governments on behalf of their electors."
"Yet here we are trying to make public services obey a common set of EU rules."
"Has anyone spotted the inherent contradiction?"
"Mr Barroso has outlined an ambitious programme of work for the Commission."
"I say to him: please just leave it alone."
"Please let national governments do their own thing."
"Madam President, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have emphasised, Mr President, that every country of the Union has its own history and its own conception of public services."
"The construction of Europe should indeed be undertaken with due deference to this diversity but should also be rooted in a set of common values centred on social justice, equality and solidarity."
"We can formulate a framework for a European public service."
"Such a service cannot be defined from the perspective of competition, for we know that the benefits derived by society from public services are measured in terms of education, health, security and cohesion among Member States and among their peoples."
"As has been mentioned, we shall shortly adopt a directive opening up the market in services within the Community."
"We are familiar with the issues relating to the market in services at the WTO negotiations."
"In the Community, as at the global level, it is imperative that we should be able to draw a legal distinction between commercial and non-commercial services and to establish freedom to provide the former and rules to regulate the latter."
"Is it right that health, education, social housing and even water supply should be subject only to the law of profitability?"
"Of course not!"
"There is but one valid imperative – that of the general public interest and social progress for everyone."
"And the public authority, at whatever tier of government, is the sole guarantor of that general interest."
"The people of our countries rightly fear that the European project is being eroded by liberalisation and globalisation."
"We must meet their needs for quality, accessibility, social responsibility and respect for the environment."
"What better guarantee can we offer to our concerned fellow citizens, Mr President of the Commission, than a European legal framework for public services?"
". Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Rapkay for the enormous amount of work he has done on this report."
"Indeed I welcome the presence this morning of President Barroso on this important issue."
"It is a signal of the importance that the Commission attaches to this issue."
"There is a broad consensus in Parliament about the role of services of general interest, economic interest, and of their importance."
"There are divisions largely on questions of strategy and, in some cases, tactics."
"There is a commitment here – and also on the part of the Commission – to ensure that any legislation or moves in that area will be by codecision."
"That is enormously important for the credibility of what we do in that area and for our legitimacy with our citizens in what we do in that area."
"I favour a framework directive."
"That was one of the decisions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in its opinion on the report."
"However, two weeks ago Parliament said ‘no’ to a framework directive."
"I believe it would be a mistake to try to push that through again."
"We need to find a pragmatic way of moving forward to ensure that we get clarity and an assertion of the principle you have outlined here today: that when it comes to a conflict between the right of the citizen to public services and the market, that is set down in legislation."
"We should not leave that issue to a decision by the courts on a case-by-case basis; otherwise we would end up with all kinds of conflicting results."
"It is in that context that I favour a framework directive."
"Perhaps that can be found in another way."
"We need to search for that."
"I welcome your commitment to take action in the social services and health area."
"That is also an urgent matter."
". – Madam President, I want to put before the House the Committee’s resolution rather than my own opinion, although the two overlap to a large degree."
"The committee adopted, and by a large majority, a total of 18 points, the essence of which has been incorporated into the Rapkay report, and so we have been able to adopt this resolution by a large majority, having been able to adopt a joint strategy on the basis of what this House has resolved on previous occasions."
"I am very glad indeed that the President of the Commission is able to be here with us, but I am very far from happy at the prospect of yet another new communication towards the end of the years, for, from the year 2000 onwards, we have covered a circuitous route from one communication to another, from interpretation to summit document, without the clarification of the legal uncertainties that we needed being forthcoming."
"The Commission really must overcome the competition Commissioner’s antipathy – and yes, I know that will be quite a feat – and sort out once and for all a number of things that will otherwise have to be left to the European Court of Justice."
"That does not mean that we favour a framework directive, and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has said as much, for there is no legal basis for one, not even in the draft constitution."
"While it is self-evident that we want to see codecision in as many areas as possible, it is not right that we should adopt resolutions that go beyond our remit."
"We have laid down several principles that are in line with what the President of the Commission has said today, and, while the subsidiarity principle means that every level must take decisions for itself, they must also abide by the rules of competition, with subsidies being transparent and the Commission having a watching brief to look out for abuses."
"Within those limits, we can, today, on the basis of the Rapkay report, adopt a good position with advice to the Commission as to how it should proceed."
"Now, all that is needed is for the Commission to act."
". – (Madam President, Mr Schulz has very good eyes, because he sees things in this resolution that are not there."
"I would like to indicate that the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection agreed in large part with the White Paper which the Commission presented to Parliament."
"In this regard, we also agreed with the point that there is no need for a framework directive at Community level."
"At the same time, with respect to these questions, there are, in my view, three essential fundamental principles."
"The first and most important principle is that of subsidiarity."
"We have in Europe a great diversity of systems for providing public services."
"This diversity cannot be reduced to uniformity."
"As a consequence, if Europe does not want to take over responsibility for public service provision, then it cannot make these perspectives uniform."
"That is to say, these questions have to remain within the competence of local authorities."
"The second principle is the question of a gradual approach."
"The European Union and the European Commission are moving in the right direction in deciding in favour of gradual regulation, and this leads to the third point, the matter of a sectoral approach."
"We have already been very successful in regulating various sectors in the field of telecommunications among others."
"We should strive to follow this example and to monitor it on a continual basis."
"I agree, and so did our committee, that greater legal certainty is, of course, necessary."
"And as the representative of a new Member State, I would like to say as well that in view of the principle of equal access, the European Union does indeed have to guarantee a common basis with the help of the harmonisation and cohesion funds."
"In the new Member States, the tools for enforcing competition and for consumer protection are in many cases very weak."
"It is essential that these be strengthened, precisely in order that both equal access and competition be realised in these territories."
"I consider the report on services of general interest to be a good report, and believe that Mr Rapkay and his colleagues have done outstanding work."
"But I would like to ask everyone not to misunderstand it and not to see elements in this report which are not there."
"That is to say, we cannot speak in this regard of a framework directive or of a communication on a framework directive."
"It is also very important that the question of a general directive on services is closely related to this question."
"Here, too, we need to see things clearly."
"The directive on services has, on many points, set down the framework within which we can work in this regard."
". – Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the White Paper on services of general interest, my position, and that of the committee, has been to advocate the complete exclusion of services of general interest (SGIs) from the scope of the directive on internal market services, in accordance with the idea that each Member State has the exclusive competence to define, fund, evaluate and monitor these services, as confirmed by Parliament."
"This will be conducive to the functioning of the market, to solidarity with the citizens and to respect for the competence of the national, regional and local authorities."
"Secondly, we believe that SGIs must be described and defined, and the distinction between services of general economic interest (SGEIs) and services of non-economic general interest (SNEGIs) clarified as regards their legal certainty."
"Thirdly, a framework legislation for SGIs, SGEIs and SNEGIs, a general legal framework, as Mr Barroso mentioned earlier, or a framework directive, according to preference, must be adopted."
"Minimum requirements must be set for carrying out these activities, along with general criteria for the Member States and the national, regional and local authorities to implement, organise, assess and monitor them."
"The fact that this legislation will encompass SGEIs does not preclude the possibility of specific legislation on certain individual sectors such as transport."
"Most of the ideas we put forward are contained in the Rapkay report, hence my support for the report, although I may lend my backing to some necessary amendments."
"Lastly, Madam President, I should like to express my disappointment that there has been no reference to the outermost regions, given that SGIs, which do not currently, and may never, exist, are needed in those regions."
"I hope that the Commission and its President focus not only on the report but also on the points that I have raised."
". – Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that such things as public local transport, refuse disposal, social services and the water supply are things that should be managed on a regional basis, and that is largely the line taken, in principle, by Mr Rapkay’s report, which I welcome, and which has taken on board much of what is in the Regional Development Committee’s opinion."
"While demanding a commitment to subsidiarity, we also call for greater legal certainty where services of general interest are in conflict with European competition law, namely with regard to the law on subsidies, public-private partnerships, and, indeed, the definition of terms."
"A Frenchman, for example, has a different concept of what services of general interest are from a Pole, a Swede or a German, and that is why there must be no single European framework directive on them of the kind that the Socialists want."
"We do not want the same standards enforced right across the EU."
"It makes no sense to dictate to the regions of Greece or the Czech Republic what they are to understand by services of general or public interest."
"It is unfortunate that the Left in this House have managed to get various references inserted into the text of the report that could be taken as pointing the way to that sort of framework directive, and I wonder just what they are driving at."
"Do you want an overarching framework directive that will make the areas of legal uncertainty more complicated than they already are, or do you want an insidious backdoor attack on the substance of European competition law as a means of forcing your socialist ideas about public services on Europe’s regions?"
"Whichever of the two may be the case, we say a firm ‘no’ to it."
"Where there are legal uncertainties, they must be eradicated, issue by issue and sector by sector."
"That, of course, means a lot more work, but I am sure in my own mind that only the sector-by-sector approach can do justice to the European ideal of subsidiarity in the single market in which we all share."
"This is not an area where Europe should lay down criteria of cost or quality."
"Defining services of general interest, funding them and organising them, must continue to be in the hands of the regions, for it is they that have political responsibility for them."
"– Madam President, what I wanted to ask was whether the Committee on Regional Development is firmly in the grip of the European People’s Party, for what we heard from Mr Pieper was nothing more than the PPE line, and not the position taken by the Committee on Regional Development."
"I am sure that we, as this Parliament moves into the second half of its term, will again have to give some thought to the need for rapporteurs for lead committees, and also the draftsmen of opinions for others, to do that to which Mr Langen has just referred."
"Irrespective of the group to which they belong, they reflect the mind and the voting behaviour of the committee."
"I am convinced that all of them have done so today, and anyone who is in any doubt about that can re-read the reports."
"I have to say that I, as an outsider unfamiliar with the subject-matter, did wonder when I heard some of the speeches, but this is something we will be able to return to during the life of the next Parliament – perhaps as part of a reform of this House."
"Mrs Stauner will now have the opportunity to be the last to put her committee’s point of view."
". – Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, even though it has been enshrined in the European Communities Treaty ever since Maastricht, the subsidiarity principle leads a shadowy existence, yet subsidiarity must always apply except where power resides solely at the European level."
"Such is indisputably not the case as regards the services we are discussing today, so any European regulation in this field would be a flagrant breach of the subsidiarity principle, and, moreover, of the principles – integral to the rule of law – of necessity and proportionality if there was any interference in the functioning structures that the Member States have developed over the years."
"If, though, the EU has no powers in this area, it follows that there can be no Europe-wide definition of these services either, and that only those who enact national or regional laws can define what they are."
"Quite apart from that, the White Paper’s attempted definitions of them – which I regard as artificial and cumbersome – reveal themselves as impractical and incomprehensible by the public."
"No strategy – be it of Lisbon or of anywhere else – is capable of being a substitute for a legal basis, whether one is dealing with principles and targets such as competition, or with economic and social cooperation."
"The only possible outcome of this debate, then, is a call to have nothing to do with any European regulation on services of general interest, quite simply because there is no European legal basis for one."
"I ask you to endorse the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which makes for a Europe that is close to its citizens, transparent and understandable."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, we know that we in this House invariably end up in politically sensitive waters if decisions are taken with the intention of correcting the market or have the effect of doing so."
"Very often, the same degree of sensitivity will kick in and the ideological bias is never far away when we want to apply the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality in specific situations."
"Despite this, Mr Rapkay has managed to compile a balanced report, for which I should like to offer him my sincere congratulations."
"I am delighted with the knowledge that first of all, the importance of the availability of services of general interest is underlined and secondly, that the common position on the Services Directive has been confirmed, namely that it is up to the Member States to determine what services of general interest are."
"Thirdly, I welcome the fact that the question as to legal certainty is taking up a central position."
"I have no problems with what some people here refer to as the rapporteur’s ambiguous wording."
"I would rather call it a wise, if not diplomatic, approach, but in any event one that can help us further in our quest for solutions."
"A framework directive is not specifically what we want."
"This report recognises the sectoral differences."
"If this report meets with approval, we will demonstrate beyond any doubt that we set greater store by essence in terms of substance than by the discussion as to the form it should take. That is what it should be about for us, after all."
"Let us then stick closely to Mr Rapkay's report, since the Commission will then know where Parliament's broad majority lies and where there are still differences, and then we, pending what will emerge from the Commission communication, will be able to take further steps towards the balanced approach that the public can expect from us."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I believe that the time has come for legal and political clarification of this issue of services of general interest."
"On the political front, because the debate on public services overshadowed the rest of the European debate, it poisoned the debate on the Constitutional Treaty, and it was blighted by the initial proposal for a directive on services in the internal market, since that proposal included a vast range of social services and services of general economic interest within its scope."
"The distrust generated by the risk posed to public services by the actions of the Commission or the interventions of the European Union has a long history."
"It is warranted in many respects, one reason being the failure to strike a fair balance between the rules of the internal market and the preservation of the general public interest; another is the impact of a number of single-sector directives that have not delivered the promised or expected results."
"I am thinking, for example, of energy-price trends and of certain fears that have been confirmed with regard to postal services."
"Clarification is also required on the legal side."
"You emphasised this point yourself a short time ago, Mr President of the Commission, when you listed the legislative initiatives that the Commission has taken recently to try to stabilise the interpretation of the law and the treaties with regard to public funding and the regulation of state aid, passenger transport, financing and compensation, etc."
"I therefore believe it is wrong to set the need for sectoral initiatives against the need for a general framework in today’s debate."
"Single-sector initiatives are needed – you referred to some of these yourself – in areas such as health services or social services of general interest, and cross-cutting initiatives are needed too."
"Why?"
"Because, as you said, one of the principles on which we must base our actions is respect for the right of each Member State and its local authorities to continue to define what they understand by services of general interest and by services of general economic interest."
"The interpretation of these concepts certainly varies from one Member State to another."
"The ways in which these services are organised and funded as well as the contours, the delineation, of public service are not the same in all our countries and sometimes even differ between regions within our countries or between local communities."
"In the absence of legislation, it has fallen to the Court of Justice, and sometimes to the Commission, to interpret the Treaties."
"The fact is that these interpretations have generated an inconsistent and fluctuating body of case law, which has created legal uncertainty for local authorities, service providers and users."
"It has also kindled fears that the provision of services of general interest will be jeopardised by a kind of predominance of the forces of the internal market, competition and private operators."
"That is why we have taken this rather unusual step for a group in the European Parliament of proposing, as a symbolic gesture but also as a political measure, an initiative for the drafting of a framework directive designed to safeguard services of general economic interest."
"We wanted to demonstrate that, given the necessary political will, a basis could be found in the Treaties and a directive could be formulated to answer the questions that now confront us."
"From this point of view, may I say the following to Mrs in't Veld: I believe this is precisely the legal framework we need if we are to protect subsidiarity, and that is what we have demonstrated with this draft framework directive."
"I invite Mrs in't Veld to familiarise herself with this initiative, which is intended to define and protect public services and services of general interest and to guarantee their long-term future."
"I believe it is up to the legislature to establish the rules at this juncture."
"It is normal that the European Parliament, representing the people, and the national governments, representing the Member States, should be able to state openly, on the basis of a public debate, how Article 86 of the EC Treaty is to be interpreted and to draw the demarcation line that safeguards the general public interest from the forces of the internal market and competition."
"Public services, as you said, Mr President of the Commission, are at the heart of the European social model."
"People are attached to them because they not only enhance their quality of life, enable them to enjoy their fundamental rights and contribute to economic and social cohesion but also make our continent and its territories more competitive."
"It is therefore a legal as well as a political imperative to show today that the European Union is not hostile to public services, that it is not trying to stifle them, but that it seeks, on the contrary, to preserve, encourage and develop them."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, during the debate on the social model, I pointed out that our fellow citizens want a Europe responsive to their urgent and practical concerns."
"The guarantee of the existence and quality of services of general interest is one of these concerns."
"In Europe today, the legal status of these services is much too fragile."
"It is not healthy that services that are crucial for the social cohesion of our societies should be entirely dependent on the case law of the European Court of Justice."
"Judges, as we are all aware, never have this much power unless politicians fail to take responsibility."
"It is therefore our duty to develop a legal framework at Community level, setting out the procedures and objectives for the organisation of services of general interest."
"Mr Barroso, if not everyone is convinced, that does not prevent us from being more specific about things, quite the contrary."
"I am among those who are asking the Commission to propose a framework directive on services of general interest as soon as possible."
"Allow me to reply frankly to those who oppose this and defend the choice of a sectoral approach."
"This is not an alternative."
"It is a trap."
"Our fellow citizens are not blind."
"They understand full well that to favour this approach would in reality mean delaying the establishment of the legal certainty that they so earnestly desire for services of general interest and for social services of general interest in particular."
"What is more, it is clear that a legal framework does not prevent us from taking account of the particular features of certain sectors, quite the contrary."
"Clearly, defining a framework does not mean standardisation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us not evade our responsibilities."
"A legislative project awaits us and it will prove that the Union is the best guarantor of a high level of solidarity and social cohesion."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, may I too say how delighted I am to see you and thank you, Mr Barroso, for attending this debate."
"For many years now we have been discussing transsectoral European legislation in the field of services of general economic interest."
"The European Parliament pronounced itself in favour of such legislation in 2001 and 2004, and the European Commission – which at the time was the Prodi Commission – did not take the matter further, putting forward the legal argument of the lack of legal basis and the political argument of the lack of the political majority in the Council needed to make progress."
"On this last point, the reference to Article 322 of the draft Constitutional Treaty illustrates at the very least, unquestionably, that there was a political agreement within the European Council to move forward."
"Today, we are faced with a proposal for a directive on the internal market in services which partly covers services of general economic interest, a directive which many experts predict will not prevent numerous appeals to the European Court of Justice and which we have reason to fear will make it harder to achieve the aim of greater legal certainty in the field of the internal market in services."
"Also today, as other fellow Members have pointed out, we are faced with a European Parliament resolution which will be voted on tomorrow and which does not in fact go as far as the resolutions of 2001 and 2004."
"For this reason we have incorporated a number of amendments aimed at clarifying things."
"However, the real political development, I believe, is that in addition to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which has had legal experts draw up a proposal for a framework directive, the European Trade Union Confederation has also put together a proposed text."
"A number of associations – I am thinking in particular of the European Liaison Committee on Services of General Interest, which has an in-depth knowledge of these issues – have also drafted proposals of a legal nature which amount to saying: yes, a proposal for a framework directive is not unthinkable, and, moreover, must be consistent with the four principles that you mentioned in your introductory speech."
"For this reason, Mr Barroso, on the basis of Article 192 of the current Treaty, we ask you clearly to move forward and not to content yourself with responding to us in a few months time with a new consultation paper or a new white paper."
"I would like to finish on a more political point."
"I believe that we must not underestimate the genuine or imagined concerns of a number of our citizens who feel there is a flagrant imbalance between, on the one hand, the implementation of competition law which, in its general provisions, is a horizontal law, and on the other hand, the protection of services of general interest at European level."
"Also, as some Members have said, Mr President, the significance of a framework directive for the Council and the European Parliament is that it provides them with an opportunity to show the Commission and, ultimately, the European Court of Justice, what kind of general provisions they want for European services of general interest."
"I believe that this is in fact what is at stake politically in this whole debate."
"Though I wish the political majorities were different, they are what they are for the moment."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, crude and heedless deregulation has been the order of the day in Europe for a decade now, with fundamental services such as energy supply, great swathes of the transport sector, not to mention education, health, housing and hospitals being made subject to the rule of the markets and of profit, in part under the of deregulatory legislation from Brussels, in part under pressure from the ECJ, and in part on the initiative of neo-liberal governments, the claims being made that it will bring more jobs, with competition bringing lower prices for consumers and inducing private investors moving their money around more efficiently."
"The record of deregulation over the past decade itself demonstrates how false these neo-liberal claims are; in the energy and postal sectors alone, hundreds of thousands of jobs have been wiped out, and those who still have a job generally find themselves working under worse conditions."
"You can rejoice in that and call it increased efficiency, or you can call it what it is – coercion and exploitation."
"Rarely have the consumers benefited from falling costs; in Germany, for example, electricity has never been as expensive as it is today."
"That the report by the Social Democrat Mr Rapkay should transfigure this record into one of success and call for the deregulation of more sectors testifies ignorance of past experience and to an irresponsible attitude towards those who have to endure the consequences."
"Those who call for services of general interest to be made subject to the rules of the internal market are seeking to turn health, education and mobility into saleable goods that only the affluent can afford, for capitalist markets, rather than meeting demand, respond only to those who not only have demands but also the ability to pay, that being the only way to turn a profit."
"That may be the sort of Europe that the rich and big business dream of, but the Left is dreaming of other things, and we, together with Europe’s social movements, shall not cease from resisting this sort of unfettered capitalism."
"Mr President, there were no scholarly books in my childhood home."
"My family were farmers and craftsmen."
"Competent teachers in my state school and free book loans in a well-stocked public library opened up the world of books to me."
"In this report, book loans, education, care, nursing, water, security, hospital treatment and welfare are referred to as ‘services of general interest’ as opposed to the more specific ‘services of general economic interest’ involved in going to the hairdresser or buying a house."
"Teeth, glasses and personal care fall somewhere in between."
"The Court of Justice, through numerous judgments, has created an internal market for many services."
"At the very heart of representative government, however, is the idea of not merely voting with your pockets, like at the market, but also choosing, through one’s votes, what facilities society is to enjoy."
"Do we want private hospitals and expensive medical bills; do we want to pay for book loans; should the price of public transport be reduced; should grannies get their daily wash in their care homes; should our infants be taken care of by discount nursery schools, or should they be educated by trained teachers?"
"The June Movement supports the internal market for goods and services and we oppose national discrimination, but we also want to allow voters in each Member State to define the boundaries between the market and society and to determine the level of quality and service, as well as consumer rights."
"We also want to safeguard the Danish ‘agreement model’, whereby wages and working conditions are agreed in accords and then respected, and our social model, whereby we pay high taxes in order to provide social civil rights to all."
"This is a case where representative government should be able to control the market so that there are also services of general interest for those not born with silver spoons in their mouths."
"We wish to continue to be able to sing with Grundtvig ‘And thus in wealth we have progressed far, when few have too much and fewer too little’."
"– Mr President, the Commission’s White Paper on services of general interest is certainly necessary in order to create a common market."
"In the future, these services and the way in which they are provided should be more precisely defined."
"We should bear in mind that at the moment, the provision of these services is, to a large extent, based on solutions drawn up in individual states and national legislation."
"We can only include these services in common European regulations once we improve the system of services in the European Union."
"Further action should specify the legal status of services of general interest and of measures to protect consumer interests."
"Mr Rapkay’s report, for which I would like to thank him, clearly describes the current legal situation and the scope for further action."
"We must make use of this report."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, it is a wide-ranging area that we are discussing today."
"Although it was of the municipal graveyard that Mr Schulz chose to remind us, municipal organisations can also reach the size of major corporations – such is the extent of this spectrum, and it is open to question whether such big structures are always right."
"Why, though, are we actually discussing this?"
"The reason is that we are balancing the rules of the market, on the one hand, against subsidiarity on the other."
"That can certainly be a thorny issue, and what comes out at the end is not always rigorous."
"I am very much in favour of subsidiarity, of locally-made rules, but a standardised definition in a Europe that may well – to pre-empt today's decision – end up with twenty-seven Member States would be a mess of standardised pottage, and that I reject."
"Europe, though, must always be asking itself what added value accrues from action at the European level, and in what way it benefits the public."
"Why, then, are we putting such effort into discussing the idea of a framework directive, when the rapporteur himself says that his report is not calling for one in this area?"
"The impression I get from some speakers is that they are doing no more or less than attempting to use this debate as a means of creating competition-free zones that will have a derogation from the services directive."
"Quite apart from the abolition of market rules, the risk is that we end up with a European standard-issue concept of what services of general interest are, and Europe is too heterogeneous for that to be our goal."
"What the public, communities, and local politicians need, though, is legal certainty."
"They want to know what is possible and what is not, and that is where there is great confusion."
"Take, for example, Munich, the city where I was born."
"There, at the moment, four major hospitals are being brought together in one company, and nobody knows what has to be submitted to the Commission and what does not."
"This is where the Commission must work together with Parliament, for what is very disturbing, not least to my own group, is that the Commission still retains a degree of ‘licence’, in the sense that it always takes decisions on the basis of what it thinks right and does not consult the voters or their representatives in the manner to which they are entitled."
"What is crucial with regard to the latter point – and this is where these debates in this House are actually long overdue – is that the public must understand why what we do is for their benefit."
"In this field in particular, that is not always clear to them, and what we do in this place is perceived in a quite different way."
"This is an area where the communications strategy might accomplish something."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community says, and I quote: ‘Any action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Treaty’."
"This is known as the principle of subsidiarity, the importance of which has just been highlighted by President Barroso."
"Yet it is clear that the common objective of social cohesion in particular requires sustained political action if quality public services are to be offered to all citizens."
"It is local councils, local authorities, that are closest to citizens."
"It is local councillors who are best placed to judge the services needed for the well-being of their fellow citizens, and the weakest among them in particular."
"Logically, for decades the Union has not concerned itself with these public services."
"However, with the implementation of the large internal market, there have been more and more court cases brought by private competitors against towns and local authorities."
"The judgments of the European Court of Justice have not always been pleasing and have sometimes even been contradictory."
"In the Court’s defence, it must be said that the concept of public service is not easy to define."
"There are significant differences between national practices in the 25 Member States."
"President Barroso has just emphasised the need to respect the diversity of national, regional and local circumstances."
"It is for this reason that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has been fighting for years for a clear legal framework allowing services of general interest to flourish."
"This is all that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wants."
"We want the greatest possible certainty for all operators of universal public services."
"The Luxembourg judges must not become the arbiters of the quality of public services to be provided."
"According to President Barroso, these services represent 7% of European GDP and 5% of jobs, which serves to highlight their efficiency."
"It is for voters, for citizens to decide the universal services they want."
"Former Commissioner Lord Cockfield, who was, together with President Jacques Delors, one of the architects of the internal market was fond of saying:"
"‘the Commission has to help governments to save taxpayers’ money.’"
"– He was wrong."
"It is not the Commission that should decide how public monies are used but, ultimately, the taxpayers themselves."
"It is for the sovereign voters to decide whether their local authority or region is making good use of their money or not."
"That is called democracy."
"Those who believe in the unbridled free market will argue that the Treaties oblige the Commission to remove public aid that distorts competition, but Article 87 of the Treaty stipulates clearly that this aid is only prohibited, and I quote: ‘in so far as it affects trade between Member States’."
"Now, it is difficult to argue that public services supplied locally by public authorities distort trade between Member States."
"Mr President, you have just announced that we will receive a communication before the end of the year."
"I share the opinion of my fellow Member from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Langen, that we have had too many texts that have been well written but that have lacked real political significance."
"Please, President Barroso, submit a legislative proposal to us or as many such proposals as you wish, but finally allow Parliament to do its job as colegislator in a field that lies, in your own words, at the heart of the European social model."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the White Paper on services of general interest, published by the European Commission more than two years ago."
"It is regrettable that liberalisation of the services market has so far been truly inadequate."
"The White Paper provides only a very abstract definition of services of general interest and services of general economic interest."
"The concept of public services has not been defined at all, and therefore it is not used in the Paper, which instead refers to ‘public service obligations’ covering air, railway, road transport and energy sectors, which are also designated services of general economic interest."
"Thus it is difficult to understand what we are actually talking about, while the principal result expected from the White Paper was to draft a legal act regulating and enabling the enforcement of one of the major freedoms of the EU internal market, that of free movement of services."
"The situation regarding services of general interest is very close to the Services directive, which originally was meant to cover economic and common interest services, which currently, with a number of exceptions, excludes transport and postal services, and exempts electricity, gas and water supply from the principle of origin."
"Thus most of the services in the EU can hardly be considered compatible with the principles of the internal market, competitiveness, representation of consumer interests, and the free movement of services."
"Market protectionism will not only lessen the competitiveness of the economy but currently is preventing and will continue to prevent providing consumers with services of appropriate quality at the right time."
"This is evident when travelling through the countries of the European Union."
"As to services of general interest, the prime task is to clearly define them; this is to avoid any ‘free interpretations’ in individual Member States in order to protect the markets."
"It is necessary to draw up a legal act governing such services, duly considering the principle of subsidiarity and opening services markets to competition for the benefit of each country's own citizens and enhancement of EU competitiveness."
"I do admit that regional local governance is an important factor in the provision of services; however, quite often this is used to disguise market protectionism, whereas services are basically ‘big business’."
"– Mr President, services of general interest are at the heart of the European social model."
"Mr Barroso may well have said that in his first sentence, but he went on, in the same breath, to praise the efficiency of the market – rather than solidarity, universal access or fundamental entitlements – as the primary motive for such services."
"What the public expect of the European Union, though, is the certainty that the services they need in order to live will be provided as a guaranteed and fundamental right, and universally, that is to say without regard to their social status or where they happen to live."
"We can gain people’s trust only if services of general interest are intrinsically protected against market interests and kept separate from them."
"I have to tell Mr Barroso that, if he tries to combine public services with the efficiency of the market, he will end up dissolving the core of the European social model."
"You, Mr Barroso, may well rejoice at the demands made in this House for a sector-by-sector approach that would give you all the power you need to deregulate basic services, but it is abundantly clear from the latest examples given in your communication that it redefines basic social services as economic activity, so what you are doing is reinterpreting the definitions given in European court rulings."
"Your proposals on health services, in which patient mobility is to be treated as more important than basic care, have their own tale to tell; they show how illusory is the belief that the market can guarantee fundamental rights."
"The only way to guarantee these services of general interest is by means of an explicit framework directive, one that does not impose the rules of European competition law on basic services, these being the sort of services that ought, self-evidently, to be able to receive state subsidies, which exist in order to guarantee basic amenities and ought not to give priority to the demands of the market."
"Those services of general interest that are economic in nature can also meet basic needs, and universal access to them, too, must take precedence over the interests of the market."
"It follows that any such framework directive must go hand in hand with the services directive, precisely in order to guarantee that protection."
"That, as things stand at present, is the only way to find a solution, for, as a consequence of the services directive, services are already on the market, and so this is a fictitious debate staged by the Right, who believe that one can only look backwards and that the matter would be resolved either by adopting a sector-by-sector approach or by not having a Europe-wide definition at all."
"Mr President, we scented victory when services of general interest were excluded from the scope of the controversial Services Directive."
"The public sector was set to remain safe from Bolkestein, but that may have been no more than a Pyrrhic victory; after all, it is only now that services of general interest are being defined."
"When a directive on services of this kind is being hammered out, it is necessary to settle what belongs to the domain of the market and what does not, as also and above all, the question of who is best placed to decide on this."
"We will fight tooth and nail for our interpretation of general interest and against liberalisation and market forces in such areas as education, health care and culture: we have experience of them and have had it with them!"
"When areas that, strictly speaking, do not belong to the market, but to society are being liberalised, Europe comes across to us as a greedy little pig which, given the chance, will grab every opportunity with both hands."
"This is already apparent in the Commission’s fresh attack on care."
"In our view, this directive will, above all, become an instrument for citizens, pupils, patients and consumers to stand up to this greedy little pig of an ever-liberalising Union."
"The directive must spell out the fact that it is the Member States and their citizens who determine what services of general interest are, for, if they do, it will bring politics closer to the public once more, where it should be."
"Mr President, in the nineteenth century, governments took over many tasks that originally did not fall within their remit, for example, education, access to health care and the regulation of working hours; that was necessary as a response to market failure, and indeed still is whenever the market fails."
"The distinction between services of general interest and services of general economic interest is academic."
"To draw that distinction is therefore intended to make services public and to restrict government interference."
"To curb government interference is a commendable objective in areas where citizens can be expected to display self-sufficiency and responsibility."
"Drawing that distinction should not, however, mean that public access is restricted."
"I would therefore call for caution in making services of general economic interest open to the market."
"Society is well served by a government that does justice to the weak and guarantees access to services that are essential to day-to-day life."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we, in this debate, are indulging in too much shadow boxing and not showing enough respect to the law and the public."
"Let us take our own laws seriously; according to the constitutional treaty, the European Union is united in diversity, and one expression of this diversity is to be found in the many forms that services of general interest take."
"We are united in the internal market, so let us not cause diversity and the single market to be mutually contradictory."
"Secondly, in that we do not see the market as an end in itself, we are in favour of the social market economy."
"The market possesses sustainability and its own social responsibility; precisely where its boundaries lie is a matter for those with political responsibilities to decide."
"Where the market cannot do all the things that the common good requires, or guarantee that they will be done, services of general interest must be allowed to play their part."
"They do not operate in opposition to the market; many general interest organisations compete with one another and comply with market criteria."
"Thirdly, we affirm our belief in subsidiarity."
"Far from running counter to the European Union, subsidiarity is an essential element of the model for it."
"The reason services of general interest are not included in the services directive is that the definition of them is delegated to others by subsidiarity, and now we are debating whether this issue is soluble only by saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to a framework directive."
"We are in favour of social security, security of supply and quality being guaranteed to the public at affordable prices, and of policymakers shouldering responsibility for relations between the market and the private sphere, between which there needs to be a new partnership, expressed in the form of services of general interest."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pay tribute to the work of our rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, which has helped to revive this debate on services of general interest."
"I support completely his proposals to create greater legal certainty for social services of general interest."
"I also support those on the provision of high quality services throughout the EU at optimal cost, respecting social balance and guaranteeing lasting security of supply."
"I am however much more sceptical when it comes to asking the Commission for clarification on applying rules regulating competition and the internal market to public services."
"Mr Barroso, whom I would like to thank for attending the debate, has just confirmed for us the supposed benefit of this competition for consumers."
"As the rapporteur has pointed out to you, since public services lack a clear legal framework, their funding and management are dependent on uncertain circumstances offered to us in turn by the Commission and the European Court of Justice, which change hats as they see fit and act interchangeably as judge, legislator and executive."
"For at least 15 years now Parliament has been asking the Commission to legislate."
"What have we achieved?"
"The Commission is proposing a choice between a simple communication to strengthen the legal certainty of these services and a multitude of sectoral directives."
"Personally, I want a framework directive: a legal framework giving services of general interest a positive and not simply dispensatory status, and one that the market competition rules will then be bound to respect."
"Key sectors such as education, health and water must not be liberalised, and mixed circumstances must be allowed for where social, economic and environmental concerns are interlinked."
"Services of general interest reinforce citizens' feeling of belonging to Europe."
"They are a key element of solidarity and play a part in pursuing social rights."
"I do not want a Europe in which the European model is based only on fiscal and social competition between states."
"With this framework directive, I want to take Europe beyond the mere market, towards a society in which all public services are guaranteed as key factors in social and territorial cohesion."
"Mr President, before I was elected to this Parliament I was the leader of a Scottish local authority which was, if I may say so, a very successful one in terms of both value for money and meeting local aspirations for public service provision in the County of Angus."
"It was then, and remains today, the predominant interest of local government to protect its right to local self-government."
"It is therefore vital that in any new EU initiative we put an end to uncertainty."
"Let us not be satisfied with woolly wording in relation to vital public service."
"Let us not interfere in any way with the principle of local self-government."
"Let us distinguish clearly between private enterprise, which is subject to EU competition law, and public service: services of a local nature provided for the public good, which have little or no cross-border effect and should be provided free of EU competition rules."
"The setting of standards in general interest services should also be subject to local decision."
"Some local authorities are sceptical of the need for new EU legislation."
"I say that if we are to have a framework directive, let us have one that gives cast-iron guarantees of the rights of local authorities to define, organise and finance public services in the way they see fit."
"I recognise that significant economic benefits to business will arise from removing barriers to commercial service provision, but let us not further alienate public opinion by interfering with or undermining the provision of essential local public services."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is one thing that points to the existence of a European social model, it is precisely services, which must be safeguarded since they represent elements of citizenship."
"We have been asked to say whether there should be services of general interest befitting all Europeans and, if so, how."
"In the wake of the Bolkestein Directive, there was some confusion regarding the difference between commercial services and general services. Therefore, we must now clarify what comes under the heading of the market, on the one hand, and of rights, on the other."
"To do this, in a series of amendments we have taken on board proposals submitted by the ETUC, which maintain that all services of general interest, including economic ones, that is, those for which Europeans pay directly or indirectly – so, nearly all of them – should come within the public, government sphere, and be characterised by their universality, accessibility, collectability and quality."
"In other words, they should be services and not goods, that is, they should be Europe and not North America."
"We call on you all to support these amendments, which uphold the trade unions’ position. We also ask you to support them in order to clarify what the aim of a possible framework directive is, that is, to understand what Europe thinks about its social model and what it is proposing to its Member States in relation to services of general interest, whether services of general economic interest or otherwise."
"– President Barroso, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report refers, quite rightly, to the principle of subsidiarity as the legal basis for issues relating to services of general interest."
"It has been only vaguely defined."
"We have moved from a substitution principle to a principle of delegation."
"For this reason, services of general interest can only be defined at the expense of particular circumstances and national needs."
"Once again, we have to lament the fact that the unmistakable warning sent to you by the French and Dutch people should be treated with such contempt."
"I would remind you that services of general interest are only of concern to the European Union from the very disputable point of view of competition."
"The freedom of Member States to define the duties they intend to entrust to public service, in accordance with the will of their people, is being seriously undermined in this instance."
"No, it is not appropriate for countries that, historically, do not have a culture of public services to prevent those that do have such a culture from having public services when they have deemed them necessary."
"If you respected the principle of subsidiarity in its true sense, you would admit that public services, essential to the life of our societies, should be defined, organised and managed as close to citizens as possible at national level."
"We believe that only a strong public power is capable of ensuring a future that is viewed not in terms of the mere quarterly profitability of shares, but over decades in the fields of education, health, transport, energy and the environment."
"The only rule we have need of is that of sovereignty, which means that each State should be free to decide on its public services and that public service obligations take precedence over Community competition law."
"Mr President, I would like to get this debate back, as my colleague Mr Karas said, to the people who really matter in all of this: our citizens receiving public services."
"We know that in many cases those public services are not good enough, not efficient enough and are delivered at much too high a cost."
"Mr Barroso, whom we are delighted to see here this morning, made an important point in his principles for the promotion of good-quality public-service delivery."
"He mentioned the crucial factor of how technology is now enabling those services to be transformed and new models of organisation and delivery to be sustained."
"Those are the things we should be talking about."
"We should be thinking about the diversity that is engaging the best minds, the best technology, the best people and the best managers involved in delivering those services."
"However, the debate we have had, principally from that side of the House, has mainly been concerned with organisational models and protectionism."
"With the Services Directive in place, thanks to our efforts, more of those minds can be unleashed on delivery of services."
"We have work to do on public procurement from recent hearings in our committee."
"We have work to do on competition law."
"If those are included within Mr Barroso’s idea of consolidation, that is fine."
"However, we do not want a directive of the kind set out here, which is a naked political directive."
"They gave the game away in their interventions."
"Mrs Schroedter said that it would protect against liberalisation."
"That is what it is all about, Mr Barroso!"
"Have nothing to do with it."
"Tell us today that you will take it off your agenda."
"I have asked in my committee, but with no reply, what problems for our citizens this directive is intended to solve."
"When those on the Left give us a comprehensive analysis of those problems, we might consider it, but we have far more important things to do today than to talk about their political declaration."
"Mr President, as the coordinator of the PSE Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs I asked to be the last speaker on the PSE Group side, precisely in order to remove some of the prejudices and misunderstandings about this debate."
"So I hope I can eliminate some of those misunderstandings."
"Firstly, I want to thank Mr Barroso for his speech and to say that we in the PSE Group fully understand his four principles and his view that it is necessary to create more legal certainty for the service providers, whether they are public or private or something in between, for the Member States and the decentralised public authorities, and for the citizens."
"As Mr Harbour rightly said, that is the crucial element."
"I think Mr Barroso has correctly interpreted the report that Mr Rapkay prepared on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and that we voted for by a large majority in the committee."
"We have not expressed a preference for any particular form of legal instrument, but have made it clear that legislative initiatives are needed and that we should have a full political process of decision-making on this, in which Parliament and the Council can participate fully."
"Codecision is the right way to deal with these political issues."
"That is the message of the report."
"The report does not say that there should be a horizontal instrument or sector-specific instruments only; it leaves the options open and says that both methods can be used in parallel."
"It will be clear from the debates that preferences differ, but also that there are a lot of prejudices about the options and preferences we promote."
"In my political group, I chaired a group of legal experts who drafted a text."
"Unfortunately I have the impression that many did not read this text, because if Mr Harbour had read it he would see that it is not a political statement but a clear attempt to reconcile the rules of the market, of competition, the subsidiarity that we want to guarantee for local authorities, the quality aspects and the importance of public service and services of general interest and economic interest for the citizens of Europe."
"This is not ideological; it is a concrete attempt to reconcile these."
"The draft is open for debate and we hope you will participate in discussing it."
"But it is up to the Commission to come up with real proposals and then we can set to work on the legislative methods and formulations."
"For the vote on this report, again I state that we have agreed to disagree on the issue of which instruments would be preferable."
"There are amendments now from both sides, from the ALDE Group and from the Verts/ALE Group, to try again to force a decision on the preference."
"I do not think that is wise."
"I agree fully with Mrs Thyssen that it is wiser to stick to the agreement that we had and to leave this issue open."
"It is the Commission that has to decide and if one of those amendments is adopted the only result will be that whole report would fall."
"That would be a pity because, as everyone has said, Mr Rapkay and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have produced a good report."
"– I should like to thank Mr Rapkay for his report."
"I must say that, after reading a great deal of detail on the subject, and following the lengthy debate on this issue, I strongly back the idea of establishing a general directive on services of general economic interest (SGIs)."
"I welcome the creation of this directive, which will guarantee SGIs as one of the main pillars of the European social model."
"The directive should also deliver legal certainty, through a legal basis established on general principles such as equality of access, high quality services, reasonable costs, universality and security."
"A balance has to be struck between the market on the one hand and the public authorities responsible for public services on the other."
"Furthermore, the report raises fresh questions."
"Will we actually be able to ensure that the framework directive will have sufficient substance to uphold the aforementioned principles?"
"Will the directive actually protect services of general interest?"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by thanking the rapporteur for his good cooperation in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which, I hope, will continue into tomorrow."
"I also have cause to be grateful for the way in which the significance of this report as one that determines the future of municipal services – or, to put it another way, of services of general interest – has been highlighted."
"That is also made clear by the amount of time allotted to the debate."
"Those of us who have spent many years in local and regional politics will be aware that, as far as the public are concerned, politics begins at their own front door, and so subsidiarity requires that the right of communities to manage their own affairs, and hence the powers of local authorities, should not, despite the complexity of European structures, be tampered with."
"It follows from that that municipalities must play a major part in defining and organising services of general interest, and that, in essence, must involve, seeking by every avenue available to offer these services to the public at as reasonable a price as possible, and must, of course, also mean that public and private service providers must be brought in as partners together."
"We should continue to urge all the interested parties to take the line that limited market activity within the remits of local authorities should not be required to be subject to all the European rules and regulations in order that local authorities should not be deterred from entering into public/private partnerships that are, in fact, beneficial to the public."
"What is needed is the sort of legal certainty that encourages municipal authorities to be creative in performing their services, that does not overburden them with bureaucracy and makes long-term forward planning possible."
"Creativity and the guaranteed right, founded upon legal certainty, for municipalities to govern themselves, can be crucial in facilitating locally-based contributions to Europe’s economic growth."
"Mr President, the text of the resolution manages to strike the right balance as regards the freedom that the Member States should retain in future in terms of, on the one hand, the organisation and definition of their public functions and, on the other, the observance of internal market rules."
"Europe’s focus – and the text of the resolution does not leave us in any doubt in that respect – must be on legal clarification and a sectoral approach where ambiguity creates problems."
"We demand legal certainty, provided it does not get in the way of competition and protectionism."
"We also demand legal certainty to help local and regional authorities, but we should be acutely aware that those selfsame local authorities want to retain their freedom of choice and do not want additional rules imposed from above."
"We must, above all, provide room for diversity, and refrain from freezing this diversity in a horizontal regulatory framework."
"If Europe is to be ready for battle, it must retain its dynamism."
"President Barroso, I very much appreciate your personal attendance in this debate."
"We demand clarity from you, but you can expect the same from us."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will therefore vote against the Socialists’ amendment which requests framework legislation."
"Mrs van den Burg mentioned the prejudices and misconceptions in respect of the intentions of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"Your group chairman, Mr Schulz, however, is feeding those prejudices himself by saying that we must, at European level, guarantee social standards, quality standards and quality of services."
"That I regard as taking matters too far, and I will therefore be voting against framework legislation, and, for that matter, a horizontal regulatory framework."
"– Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report and to thank him for his considerable readiness to negotiate and discuss."
"It is thanks to the rapporteur’s approach that this report is a well-balanced compromise between various political alternatives."
"The report is a very important step towards defining the legal status of services of general interest."
"It should be highlighted that, in terms of European Union legislation, a framework directive on services of general interest is unnecessary."
"These services should be dealt with by focusing on specific sectors and not on a general basis."
"We should allow Member States to define what they consider to be services of general interest, according to their regional characteristics."
"However, this right must not be used by the Member States to infringe the terms of the Treaty, especially in terms of free competition, state aid or public procurement."
"Thus, the Member States should be able to define services of general interest within their territories but they should not be able to abuse this right, as they frequently tend to do."
"Services of general interest are often used as an argument for protecting the public interest from the principles of the internal market."
"In my opinion, a framework directive will not provide a satisfactory solution either for the European economy or for the consumers, namely the citizens of Europe."
"We should deal with the problem by using a sectoral approach."
"Globalisation is confronting us with greater market openness, greater competition and ever more rapid innovation, all of which call for greater flexibility and adaptability."
"Public services, being part of the social model, therefore need to continually adapt to new developments in globalisation, to democratic changes and to advances in science."
"The European Parliament approved the Services Directive on the first reading and defined its scope."
"Services of general economic interest were included in the scope of the Services Directive."
"The approved draft Directive does not apply to services in the public interest, healthcare services and transport services."
"In the 25 Member States of the European Union, services in the public interest have evolved in ways that reflect distinct regional traditions."
"For this reason I would like to emphasise that it is absolutely imperative to comply with the subsidiarity principle."
"In accordance with this principle, each and every Member State decides for itself which services will be provided by public institutions and which sectors will be liberalised."
"In Slovakia, local and regional authorities elected and controlled by the public have done a good job in providing services for the common good and they are capable of continuing to secure rights relating to codecision, consumer protection and public welfare."
"The competent public authorities should have appropriate instruments made available to them so that they will be able both to foster competition and to ensure consumer protection."
"It is important to strengthen the powers of Member States to monitor the efficient fulfilment of public policy goals such as affordable prices and high-quality norms."
"With a view to these considerations, I am convinced that it is not necessary to give the European Union additional powers in the area of services provided for the benefit of the public."
"My position is clear – there is no legal basis for a framework directive on services in the public interest."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rappkay, for his work."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to start with warm thanks to the Members whose input was crucial to the process of working through this issue, namely Mr Szájer from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mr Rapkay as the House’s principal rapporteur, and our shadow rapporteur Mr Hökmark."
"What you, Mr President of the Commission, said this morning struck me as a perfectly adequate response to the concerns to which the Socialist Group in this House is giving expression by bringing in its own draft for a framework directive."
"While we take – and continue to take – the view that this framework directive is not needed, it has to be said that it does address three areas in which there is conflict between the grass-roots interests of communities on the one hand and the interests of an effective European internal market on the other."
"Irrespective of how clear-cut Members of this House might want the demarcation lines of the internal market to be, it has to be said that it is, in certain areas – whether in the tendering for and award of contracts, or in the law on competition or subsidies for municipalities – not an unmitigatedly bad thing."
"What is needed, though, is to establish greater legal certainty in these areas."
"It remains to be seen whether the communication, the prospect of which you have held out, will be sufficient for this purpose, but I do in any case believe that a communication is a more adequate way of addressing the problem than a framework directive in terms of its effects."
"The fact is – as Mr Radwan has already said – that we have to consider the market versus subsidiarity dilemma far more from the point of view of the citizen, and the European social model, too – although I always wonder how people can keep on invoking it without having anything to say about what it actually is – envisages citizens and consumers being offered the best possible value for services wherever they are in Europe; that is where Mr Hudghton is very definitely right when he speaks so highly of the Scottish local authorities that are able to offer their services at very reasonable prices in line with the market."
"If they want to carry on doing that in future, they will need to be given the legal certainty that will enable them to do so, but that does not mean that this is an area from which the market should be excluded."
"Mr President, I should like to make three points."
"Firstly, I think services should be open to competition."
"That is why we are here and why we have European integration."
"It is clear that Member States cannot sustain their welfare systems without the help of the private sector."
"This whole debate is about having specific public services of general interest."
"It has happened in a country near my own, Finland, formerly the Soviet Union."
"It is absurd to think that services of general interest can be provided only by the public sector."
"I should therefore like to promote public-private partnerships."
"We should draw some lessons from the debate we had on the Services Directive."
"My second point, then, is: There is no basis for it."
"I do not want the Commission to come up with anything, not even a consolidating document."
"It falls within the competence of the Member States."
"It adds no value whatsoever."
"Face the facts: the Commission’s study makes it clear that there are huge differences between what we consider to be a service of general interest in Finland, for instance, and what is considered to be a service of general interest in France."
"This debate is a smokescreen for monopolies and for protectionism."
"That to me is completely anti-European."
"Finally, I wish to second what my Polish colleague Mrs Handzlik said."
"What is the right solution?"
"It is clear that we must have a sector-specific approach."
"We have to go sector by sector, focus on cooperation and have clear priorities: healthcare, postal services, water and gas services and so on, but without a directive."
"Let us stay clear of it."
"Mr President, fellow Members, you usefully referred, Mr Barroso, to the four basic principles that need to guide our thinking about services of general interest."
"Paradoxically, it might be thought that you have reopened the debate on the need either to have a framework directive on services of general economic interest or to choose sectoral initiatives in relation to social or health services."
"The vote on the Services Directive altered the parameters in favour of the second solution since the real dividing line lies not between services of economic and non-economic general interest but – within services of general economic interest – between social and health services and other services."
"This development was reinforced by the detailed and legally painstaking work done by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, and our colleague, Mr Hökmark, who constructed a legal bridge between the Services Directive and the sectoral instruments."
"Indeed, a framework directive on services of general economic interest raises three difficulties."
"Firstly, the Treaty on European Union offers no legal basis, as has been pointed out on many occasions."
"Next, this directive would be incompatible with the scope of the Services Directive, as voted on at first reading on 29 May."
"Finally, it in no respect meets the need for legal certainty expressed by the players and, at the same time, it threatens the subsidiarity called for by Member States and local authorities."
"Whatever the instrument selected and the ideological choices that will help determine the option we choose, these are not what matter in the end."
"The work of legal clarification needs to be continued in the field of social and health services of general interest."
"That, Mr Barroso, is the practical problem faced by the actors on the ground."
"Mr President, this is an extremely interesting debate."
"As you know, the Commission published a White Paper on the issue, recommending that a framework directive be put in place to cover services of general interest."
"However, I do not agree with that approach; I believe that we should support regulations governing specific economic sectors."
"I would certainly agree with the idea in principle, but I believe that an overarching directive would cause enormous confusion in the debate, especially in the debate in Member States."
"It could lead to hysteria if people do not understand exactly what it means."
"That is why I believe we have to be far more specific and look at the directive sector by sector, at the existing providers of services."
"What we are trying to do here is improve services for the citizens of Europe so they will understand exactly what has been proposed; so that consumers will not be frightened that a directive which comes from Europe could privatise or undermine existing services within their country."
"It is very important to approach this with clarity so people can understand exactly what has been proposed by both the Commission and Parliament."
"The EU has competence over matters such as telecommunications, transport and energy, but it does not have competence under the EU Treaties to legislate in a broad capacity on matters governing the operation of social services, health and education within the different Member States."
"The debate boils down to the powers of the EU institutions versus the competence of Member States."
"We must be very careful with regard to that issue."
"It surprises me that some Members are against that, whereas they are very much in favour of tax harmonisation between Member States."
"To my mind that seems to contradict what they are saying in this debate."
"I do not believe in tax harmonisation."
"I believe that Member States should control their own tax systems."
"That would encourage competition within the Union."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, fellow Members, education, health, postal services, water and transport are at the heart of a society’s life."
"What is essential to the management of public services designed to benefit the public is a public legal system."
"It is in Europe that countries like France have invented this cooperative method of administering the shared dimensions of what is owned by society as a whole."
"This is precisely a time when this intelligent technique for making services generally, indeed universally, available could inspire audacious solutions to worldwide problems in relation to water, basic medicines, education and all the shared dimensions of what is owned by the world as a whole, yet the European Commission is reducing the scope of this tool for guiding human societies, if not actually destroying it."
"This mess consists in the destruction of what had worked for a century, and behind it is the belief that the market is supreme, that knowledge is its prophet and that all services need to be privatised, as the World Trade Organisation wants to see happen."
"Such services include those in support of our own sittings – organised by ourselves in the European Parliament as a social squat in which 300 people work without social papers."
"Mr Barroso, beyond the technical problems explained by our fellow Members, such as Mr Désir who spoke just now, the problem is a cultural problem and a problem of choice."
"Either we manage human societies according to the law of the market, which is to say the law of the jungle, or we manage them according to the law of reason."
"Mr Barroso, do you want to continue in this haphazard manner, forever lauding the market while courting the International Monetary Fund one moment and the WTO the next, or do you want to sit down quietly and deal in reasonable terms with problems amenable to reason?"
"."
"I should like firstly to say to you, Mr President, fellow Members, that I have greatly valued this debate."
"I have found it really very interesting and I believe that it will be extremely useful."
"We have not wasted our time, and I have been able to construct a much more specific idea both of your feelings on the subject and of the consequent difficulties in taking the matter forward."
"In point of fact, the debate has confirmed the ambiguities that remain and to which a number of you have referred."
"The Rapkay report is obviously wise and intelligent and seeks to establish a balance."
"It is also the case, however, that it does not fully engage with a number of issues, and this ought, moreover, to give you a better understanding of the difficulties that the Commission has experienced for years in defining the matter and supplying more precise definitions."
"That is because this is a complex matter."
"Let us acknowledge the fact."
"Even considered in a specific spatio-temporal framework, the issue is a difficult one because it involves reconciling principles that sometimes appear contradictory."
"That is the way it is when it comes to the principles of the internal market and of competition – principles that are essential to our Community, that are inscribed in the Treaties and that the Commission is – let us be clear - absolutely obliged to respect, as it is obliged to respect the principles of state intervention and of the general interest."
"If, however, the issue is already difficult in itself, it proves to be still more complex when placed in the developing context of space and time."
"As a number of you have emphasised, the fact is that time constantly moves on, what with structural changes to our markets, increased pressure from international competition and major technological change."
"In territorial terms, too, the situation varies a lot from one Member State to another, and there may indeed be big differences between levels of intervention at national, regional and even local level."
"The issue is therefore extremely complex, which is why it is so difficult, or even impossible, to come up with a standard response according to the ‘one size fits all’ principle."
"Does that mean that nothing can be done at European level?"
"I do not agree."
"On the contrary."
"How, though, are we to approach the matter?"
"Let us look first at what must not be done."
"I believe that there are two extreme approaches that must be avoided at all costs."
"The first consists in saying that services of general interest fall completely outside Europe’s remit."
"They are none of its business."
"That is not the case."
"Services of general interest are, in fact, our business because they are at the heart of our social model, and we want to preserve them."
"Europe therefore has something to say about the matter."
"The other radical approach consists in saying go ahead and regulate matters, as it will enable us – and people have been quite candid about this – to resist what is stated in the Treaties, the idea being that the Treaties tend rather to focus on liberalisation whereas the time has now come to question that perspective by enacting regulations opposed to the rules of the single market and of competition."
"That is something that we cannot accept."
"The single market is our great strength and one of the great successes of European integration."
"If, however, we avoid these two extreme positions – which is to say that of absolutely minimum European intervention and that of a very high degree of intervention to offset the effects of the market - what can we do?"
"Having followed this debate, I think that the principles that I stated at the beginning and to which, moreover, the Rapkay report refers provide us with the solution."
"I would therefore put the following suggestion to you, ladies and gentlemen."
"Instead of focusing on an abstruse debate on the usefulness or otherwise of a framework directive about which, as the debate has shown, there is obviously no consensus, why not focus on the substance, as the majority of Parliament seems to want to do?"
"What is the agreement about?"
"It is about subsidiarity, the desirability of which we all accept."
"I believe that the national and local levels should be respected where this subject is concerned."
"Compatibility between the internal market and the public interest must be ensured in every case where an apparent contradiction is noted."
"Moreover – and this is, in my view, perhaps the most important point – there is the issue of what are the essential features of public services."
"We all want them to be of high quality, to have a good quality-price ratio and to be accessible to all."
"The need to modernise public services can therefore be accepted as a matter of principle, but without forgetting these essential factors."
"Finally, mention must be made of the need for increased legal certainty."
"Having met the various groups and heard the speeches by Mr Rapkay, Mrs Thyssen and many others, I think I can say that, if we agree about these four points, we do have a basic consensus on this matter and prospects for compromise."
"I think it is possible to take this matter forward while sticking to those principles of ours that define our European model: those of the internal market, respect for the rules of competition and defence of the general interest."
"The communication we shall present will be along those lines, and I believe that the debate and my presence in this House today will help us fine-tune our ideas."
"We shall propose something that will demonstrate that we have made progress in our thinking and, I hope, in our decisions concerning such an important subject that is at the very heart of what matters to Europe and to our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, I believe we are all more or less in agreement with what Mr Barroso has just said."
"He is promising us a communication."
"We are waiting impatiently for it."
"But can the President tell us whether he will be asking his services to propose legislative texts as well so that Parliament can at last debate them as co-legislator?"
"."
"Mr President, what I can say at this stage, having listened to the various views expressed, is this."
"As I said, we will by the end of the year be presenting a communication that will be an advance on previous thinking."
"So far as legislative texts are concerned, it seems to me that the debate has made it clear that we are a long way from a consensus on a framework directive."
"Having said that, there will of course be legislative initiatives for different sectors."
"Having said that, too, I think we need to give some thought to what can be done on a more general level;"
"I and my services will be doing so – after all, the Commission is not just a set of services, the College and the President have ideas too."
"I cannot at this stage say what our proposal will be, but – and now I am anticipating without committing the Commission, because it is a question I have to put to the College myself – it seems to me from the debate that it would be possible to adopt an approach combining the principles we have mentioned here, taking into account the need that many of you have voiced to avoid splitting Parliament and Europe today on the appropriateness of regulation, especially where the principle of subsidiarity is involved."
"I believe that is possible and I would like to conclude with a comment of a political nature. I am speaking to you as the convinced Europeans you are."
"If we want to make progress on this dossier, it is essential that we avoid the polarisation we had with the services directive."
"Just as Parliament and the institutions managed to find a positive political balance on that directive, it seems to me that we need the same kind of approach for this question."
"If we become split between two extreme positions over whether or not there should be overall regulation of the issue, I think we will be heading towards a confrontation that will not be in the overall interests of Europe as we understand it."
"Let us therefore concentrate on the substance."
"There is after all enough in the Rapkay report that we agree on."
"Then we will find a solution on the decision-making instruments."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity – PROGRESS (06282/3/2006 – C6-0272/2006 – 2004/0158(COD)) (Rapporteur: Karin Jöns) (A6-0300/2006)."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a happy outcome is worth waiting for; we will, today, be adopting the European Union’s biggest-ever action programme in the fields of employment and social policy."
"As its name indicates, PROGRESS stands for progress and social solidarity, and that is why this House saw it as important that it should be rolled out, as planned, at the beginning of January 2007, and that is what we are, by this vote, going to be able to do, now that the Council has accommodated our wishes."
"I therefore want to thank all those who have played a part in making PROGRESS what it now is, namely a really comprehensive and, above all, well-funded strategic instrument that really can put the fight against unemployment, poverty and social exclusion on a more sustainable footing."
"I must, though, also reiterate my thanks to our budget specialists from all the groups, who, in the trialogue negotiations, had a hard-won fight to get PROGRESS’ funding increased by almost 20%, which amounts to doing the impossible."
"It was, in the past, repeatedly lamented that the previous multiannual programmes – which addressed the labour market, social integration, anti-discrimination and equality of opportunity – would not be enough to actually push through our social agenda in the way it had been planned for, that is to say, to facilitate a real and rapid exchange of political approaches, concepts and measures among the Member States and to bring them together in developing further indicators and more effective measures."
"It was agreed that what was more needed was an exchange that was organised differently and better structured, together with more rigorous cooperation, and it is precisely this approach that PROGRESS takes, and it does so by not merely bringing the existing programmes together, but also by improving the structures of cooperation and involving policy-makers at all levels."
"This, for example, involves the promotion of networking and mutual learning not only at the European level, but also across borders, and at the national, regional, and local levels."
"I am very glad that we eventually managed to persuade the Commission and the Council to continue fostering cross-border sharing of experiences, for where else are we going to get the European added value for which we are constantly crying out?"
"In order, though, to circulate more rapidly the results of studies and analyses, experience gained and best practice, there will also, in future, be a forum tasked with the evaluation and implementation of the social policy agenda, which will also be involved in the further development of strategies and the setting down of new priorities."
"I also see it as vitally important that we succeeded in giving the social partners and non-governmental organisations a considerably bigger role than the Commission had originally envisaged, so that they are now involved in the constructive monitoring and further development of the strategies rather than being limited in their functioning to merely pursuing the European objectives."
"We have also extended Parliament’s influence, in that we are fully involved not only in implementation but also in evaluation, with, for the first time, the Commission’s reports on implementation being sent not only to the programme committee but also to us."
"Finally, I would like, in particular, to thank Commissioner Špidla, without whose support we would not have managed to incorporate in all language versions the concept – which is in fact more than a mere concept – of gender mainstreaming, as satisfactorily as we have now done."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the June agreement on the financial perspective raised hopes for a rapid and successful conclusion to the negotiations on the Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity – Progress, which is the main political instrument for supporting the implementation of the ambitious objectives that the Union set itself in the Lisbon Strategy."
"Reality has borne this out."
"Today you are preparing to announce the decision on which this programme is based."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank, in particular, the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their outstanding work and for their efforts throughout the negotiation process."
"I should especially like to thank most warmly Mrs Jöns, Parliament’s rapporteur on these matters, along with all of the shadow rapporteurs, without whom it would not have been possible to reach such a positive conclusion."
"This text uses concepts based on the agreement reached between the institutions."
"The questions that Parliament raised in 2005 when it assessed the proposal at first reading have been taken on board. The distribution of the budget between policy areas relating to our programme meets your expectations."
"We have responded to your desire for greater prominence to be given to the area of gender equality."
"This has also been the case with social inclusion and social protection."
"Parliament will be closely involved every year in voting on the sums needed to implement the actions arising from the programme."
"This was a point on which Parliament and the Commission share the same opinion."
"We both believe that this must be done in a completely transparent way."
"I am pleased to note that the Council has finally adopted this approach, which also paved the way for the negotiations to reach a speedy conclusion."
"Lastly, I should like to thank the Members of Parliament, whose efforts and determination have helped bring about this excellent outcome."
"Mr President, can you explain or give any good reason why the votes have been arbitrarily postponed to 11.40, when previously they were announced for 11.30?"
"There was no need to start this debate at the time it did start."
"Yet again, the administration of this Parliament is putting the convenience of the Presidency before the interests of Members."
"It is not good enough."
"The debate is continuing because of delays in the voting process."
", . I do not wish to prolong this debate by much."
"First and foremost, I would like to offer particular thanks to Mrs Jöns, who has done some outstanding work on the programme."
"Her work has made it possible for us to quickly achieve a solution and for this solution, in contrast to what happened on the last occasion, to come into effect very quickly indeed. is an important programme, a combined programme for dealing with employment and social issues, promoting equality and combating discrimination."
"We have backed this idea of a combined programme."
"One of the solutions was for us here in the European Parliament to make efforts to have more money appropriated to the programme within the framework of the long-term budget, since this is a matter relating to the social Europe about which we so often speak."
"The agreement to provide more money for the programme also facilitated agreement about the programme as a whole."
"There was a certain degree of discord in relation to the issues of equality and social integration, but these issues have since been resolved."
"These areas of the programme have received extra resources in order to provide greater equality, social integration and social protection."
"This has not been done at the expense of other areas."
"Resources have instead been taken from the reserve."
"I believe that this will be a very good solution and I believe that will play a role in the construction of the social Europe of the future."
"I would like to thank Mrs Jöns once more for her excellent work."
"The next item is the vote."
"."
"Mr President, I have a very brief textual clarification, which refers to paragraph 1."
"The final clause reads: ‘... to prepare them’ – that is to say school students – ‘for their roles as future citizens and as members of the European Union’."
"I propose that we delete the word ‘future’ so that it will read as follows: ‘... to prepare them for their roles as citizens and as members of the European Union’."
"Madam President, the European Parliament is delighted to welcome you to its plenary sitting, and it is an honour for me to welcome the first woman to be elected President of an African country, as well as the delegation of Ministers and Members of Parliament accompanying you."
"I must tell my fellow Members of the European Parliament that the President’s delegation contains more parliamentarians than ministers."
"I would like to remind this House that you were also the first woman to become Finance Minister in your country in 1979, 27 years ago now."
"Unfortunately, your country suffered a coup d’état in the following year. In 1980 there began a quarter of a century of violence in Liberia, a 14-year civil war, the systematic plundering of the country's resources and a mass violation of the human rights of its inhabitants."
"The results of this horrendous and long war – as long as the old religious wars of Europe – could not have been more tragic: 250 000 victims in a country of three million people - almost 10% of the population."
"During that era, three quarters of the population were ‘living’ – if it can be called living – on less than one dollar per day, and up to 85% of the population were unemployed. In other words, there was no economy in the sense that we understand it in the developed Western societies."
"Madam President, under those circumstances it cannot be an easy task for any politician to take on the presidency of a country."
"Our Parliament is delighted with the role that the Economic Community of Western African States (ECOWAS) played in the peace talks in 2002 that led to the presidential elections that you won last November."
"The European Parliament sent observers to those elections, and the head of the delegation, Mr van den Berg, made it clear in his report that, despite a few small incidents, the elections had taken place in accordance with the rules governing them."
"We are therefore receiving you today as a symbol of the rule of law, of peace, of democracy, of women's rights and of the fight against corruption and impunity."
"If you read the President of Liberia’s biography, you will see how often she has resigned from her posts because she disagreed with the ways governments were tackling the problem of corruption in her country."
"You will also remember that last April, here in plenary, I had the opportunity to express my satisfaction at the arrest and extradition of Charles Taylor, which the European Parliament had called for in various resolutions and which were finally carried out at the request of the President."
"This represents progress in the fight against impunity for war criminals throughout the world. It is therefore something that we welcome, and I wished to say this today while you are here."
"After so much suffering, we want to offer you our support."
"It is good that the guns have fallen silent."
"As soon as the guns fall silent, however, the task begins of reconstructing the country – a task that is of less interest to the television cameras – and the danger is that it may be forgotten now that the battlefield has been abandoned."
"This would not be the first time that, having found peace, a society has not found the road to reconciliation and the economy has not found the road to development."
"In travelling along that road, Madam President, you will find that Europe will be there to help you in order to ensure that Liberia continues to be that symbol of liberty that it was at its birth."
"Our hope and desire is that you can build a future of hope for all of the people of your country which will serve as a symbol for the whole of Africa."
"You have the floor, Madam President."
"."
"Mr President, honourable Members, it is with a deep sense of gratitude that I and my delegation join you today on the occasion of your formal sitting."
"On behalf of the Government and people of Liberia I extend warm greetings and felicitations to you, honourable Members, and through you, to your respective governments and peoples."
"I am honoured by the opportunity to make a few remarks."
"It has been barely eight months since the full responsibility of rebuilding post-conflict Liberia was passed over to us, following our victory during the democratically held 2005 elections."
"We accepted the responsibility fully aware of the magnitude of the challenges that our country faces after 14 years of civil war and destruction."
"The damage and negative consequences have been enormous, deepening the state of poverty throughout the country."
"Today, GDP per capita at USD 163 (2005) represents a 90% decline as compared with the pre-1980s pre-war levels due to sanctions and cutbacks in activities in productive sectors such as agriculture, forestry and mining."
"Exports declined similarly by over 95% for the same period."
"Our huge external debt estimated at USD 3.7 billion represents 800% of GDP and 3000% of export earnings while domestic debt and non-salary arrears are estimated at USD 700 million."
"Our budget, just passed recently, at USD 129 million, although increased by over 50% from the previous fiscal year still accounts for less than 30% compared with two decades ago."
"When we took office there was no electricity and no water."
"Schools and clinics had crumbled, roads were impassable."
"Institutions of governance had completely collapsed and corruption was rampant."
"HIV/Aids rates had soared."
"Few children were in school and many were dying of curable diseases."
"Today, well over three-quarters of our people live below the poverty line of USD 1 per day."
"An overwhelming majority of those people, mainly the youth, are either unemployed or employed in the informal sector."
"Yet, I am pleased to tell you, Liberians are resilient people."
"For even after everything they have endured, the people of Liberia have faith in new beginnings."
"They are counting on me and our administration to create the conditions that will guarantee the realisation of their dreams."
"Their dreams are not complicated."
"They just want the simple things that most people take for granted: to live their lives in peace, get a good education and to be able to provide for their families."
"Those things are not too much for Liberians to dream about."
"But time is pressing."
"As you all know, the risks of regression to war in post-conflict societies is high when the government and the international community are not able to make strong efforts at key moments and sustain them over time."
"Liberia today is at one of those key moments."
"Our efforts, joined by those of our partners over the next few months, the next year and beyond, will determine the future course of our nation."
"If we wait too long to introduce the policy changes and reforms that are needed, or if our international partners wait too long to ramp up its support, then we may lose the best chance Liberia has had in a generation to end the conflict permanently and build the foundations for growth and prosperity."
"We cannot afford to let that happen."
"We must quickly consolidate the potential dividends of Liberia’s hard-won peace and arrest the economic and financial haemorrhaging."
"We must respond to the deep wounds of the civil war, and enhance national governance, while quickly introducing new measures of structural reform."
"We must base our approach on the core principles of democracy, accountability, free enterprise, good governance, respect for human rights, and equitable distribution of our natural resources."
"So with everything said and done, what must we do first?"
"Poverty reduction strategies are at the core of both averting a return to conflict and establishing the foundation for sustained development."
"We are basing our strategy on four pillars of reconstruction and development."
"The first pillar is enhancing security and consolidating peace in our country."
"Without peace and security there can be no development or prosperity."
"We must redouble our efforts to train our forces, not just in security matters but also in being accountable to the people."
"Our security forces over the years have been quite corrupt and largely dysfunctional."
"They have lacked the trust of the population and have been used to terrorise the population and to intervene in political processes without respect for due process or law."
"We want to change that."
"We must develop a clear national strategy that will take into account the gradual withdrawal of UN peace-keeping forces."
"We have already started the process."
"We have completed the deactivation of members of our armed forces and are well on the way in recruiting a new army comprising 2000 soldiers to be adequately trained and well equipped."
"With the strong help of UN agencies and other partners, we have facilitated the return of 70 000 refugees and 50 000 internally displaced persons since the inauguration."
"Our police force and other security units are being restructured and trained."
"It is important that we find the means to resettle them in productive endeavours."
"Second, we need to revitalise our economy."
"We need to focus strongly on agriculture, both in food and cash crops with emphasis on the rehabilitation of our traditional rubber industry."
"We also expect rapid growth in our forestry, mining and other natural resource-based industry, based upon policies that aim at creating an investment climate that will encourage investment in activities in which Liberia can compete internationally."
"These activities will create jobs to tackle the 80% unemployment which we face, particularly among our youth."
"Towards this end, we cancelled all non-compliant forestry concession agreements and are in the midst of establishing a new concessions framework for our natural resource products, to ensure the strong growth of these sectors."
"We have taken an aggressive stance in collecting revenue owed to the government, and already revenues have jumped by over 20%."
"We have reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund on a Staff Monitoring Programme, and by all accounts our performance to date has been strong."
"We are concluding our Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy which articulates priority interventions over the period July 2006 through December 2007."
"This builds upon our 150 day Action Plan under which 70% of our desired results were achieved."
"The third element of our vision is improving democratic governance."
"The over-concentration of power and a closed political system bred corruption, restricted access to the decision-making processes, limited the space for civil society participation in the processes of governance, and fuelled ethnic and class animosities and rivalries over time."
"We are working through statutory and policy changes to revise these constraints on democracy and development."
"We are determined to fight corruption, which has eaten away the fabric of our nationhood and society."
"We are well along the way to developing a strong anti-corruption strategy and a supporting legal and regulatory framework."
"Our weak judicial system is under reform and being strengthened."
"We are working towards decentralising decision-making and allocating appropriate resources to county and municipal governments to support their own identified programmes and projects."
"We are placing emphasis on empowering the people, especially the poor and vulnerable, to become participants in the development process."
"The fourth and final pillar of our agenda is revitalising our social and physical infrastructure."
"Education is central to renewal and reconciliation."
"Our vision of education for all – young and old – demands that we enforce the policy of full universal primary education and introduce literacy programmes in communities throughout the country with our resilient market women as key targets."
"We recognise that no nation can develop under conditions of a 70% illiteracy rate."
"We must respond particularly to our war-affected youth, providing them with opportunities for school and skills training programmes."
"We must also rehabilitate health facilities that have been partially or completely destroyed."
"Only 10% of our population today has access to healthcare."
"This must increase to at least 50% within the medium term."
"We must confront the growing HIV/AIDS problem, and fight malaria, parasites, malnutrition and other diseases that kill so many of our children."
"Our roads are in a terrible state."
"Without a decent road network it will be nearly impossible to consolidate security, encourage new economic activity and strengthen local governance."
"We must also improve other social infrastructure, such as water and sanitation facilities."
"In what we consider one of our most important achievements, in July of this year we were able to turn on electricity and water to parts of our capital city, Monrovia, for the first time in 15 years."
"We are proud that we were able to achieve in six months what previous governments had failed to do over so many years."
"We should like to thank the European Union through the European Commission for all they have done to support us in these first beginnings."
"But that accomplishment is just a beginning."
"Our mission is to make the Liberian Government work again and be more responsive in delivering quality services to the Liberian people."
"The associated challenges are so daunting and the needs and expectations of our people so massive that our Government cannot satisfactorily respond by itself."
"There is a critical need for forging and building strong strategic partnerships."
"To this end, let me use this opportunity to express our deep appreciation for the continued assistance we have received over the years from the European Community collectively as well as from individual Member States."
"The Government and people of Liberia appreciate this concerted support and we are keen to harness it for the recovery, reconstruction and development of our country."
"We take interest in the ongoing reforms within European Union development assistance to African nations, as well as the new European consensus on development towards poverty eradication."
"It is our desire to work with our colleagues to conclude the ongoing Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations, bearing in mind the need to arrive at a consensus on bringing into an equitable balance the development imperatives usually derived from such partnership agreements."
"Furthermore, the anticipated European Development Day celebration will no doubt enhance the content and results of your partnership with our countries."
"We welcome this innovative initiative and look forward to its good results."
"In summary, we are off to a good start."
"For that we are grateful to the Liberian people and to the international community, including the European Union and the European Commission, which are key partners in this regard."
"It is just a start."
"In the next few months, we will be engaged in serious planning for our Partnership Conference, which is to take place in the first quarter of next year, and in developing our medium-term poverty reduction and growth strategy."
"We will continue our strong start in the budgetary process and adopt appropriate fiscal regulations with the GEMAP framework."
"But it is critical that in the next few months Liberians begin to see steady, tangible progress."
"I would like to ask all our partners to work closely with us in the next few weeks so that we can make sure that the many activities that need to be implemented during the upcoming dry season are ready to go on time."
"We cannot afford to waste any time, and in many projects we need to speed the process of disbursement and implementation."
"We specifically ask for your support for this objective through the European Commission."
"I also want to make sure that we do not face gaps in critical support during the transition between our emergency programmes winding down and longer-term development programmes getting started."
"In too many countries, this transition does not go smoothly and critical momentum can be lost."
"Finally, I want to make sure that the efforts of Government and partners are fully synchronised and harmonised."
"To best prepare for the Partners Conference, we need to make sure that partners are supporting the most important initiatives, that there is not undue overlap and duplication, and that together with both strong planning and rapid and effective implementation we can be assured that we will take advantage of this critical moment in Liberia’s history to put the conflict to rest and speed the process of reconstruction and development."
"We are glad that our nation has been blessed."
"Liberia is not a poor country, but a country that has been poorly managed."
"We are committed to change that; to pursue those goals that will move us from the crisis of the past to the opportunity of the present."
"We are committed, as a people, to build a new Liberia from the ashes of an old turbulent past to a future of hope and promise."
"We are committed to strategic partnerships based upon mutuality of respect and benefits."
"We thank you all, collectively and bilaterally, for the support provided so far."
"We thank you, President Borrell Fontelles, for the opportunity of being here and we look forward to working with each and every one of your countries in the coming months and into the future."
"Thank you."
"Madam President, I would just like to thank you briefly for your words."
"I am sure that your presence here in the European Parliament and the words that you have addressed to us will help to make the whole of Europe fully aware of your country’s problems and to commit itself to development in Africa."
"We are all aware of the extent to which Europe is now concerned about immigration from Africa and we all know that it is only by overcoming the problems that you have described that we will be able to establish the relationship of cooperation that you have talked about today."
"Thank you very much, Madam President."
"We shall resume the vote."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to request a roll-call vote for the next two amendments, Amendment 3 (paragraph 7) and Amendment 4 (paragraph 25), because those amendments are totally against the spirit of my report."
"Mr President, as I see it, it is fundamentally wrong to demand roll-call votes immediately before we proceed to vote."
"Although we have no fears when it comes to appending our names to this, I do see this as setting a precedent, and therefore believe that there are fundamental reasons why it is wrong."
"That concludes the vote."
"I voted in favour of the excellent report by Mr Mavromattis on the important subject of relations between the media and development."
"Enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948, freedom of expression and information is recognised as a fundamental right."
"Freedom of the media is essential to the good governance of public or private bodies and contributes to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals of creating a safe, poverty-free world by 2015."
"Freedom of the media is essential to access to knowledge and to transparency and it must be entirely independent."
"It makes a great contribution to combating ignorance, that ancient scourge of humanity, and it prevents corruption."
"Although I regret that the issue of the responsibility of authors, holders, users and distributors of information has not been better incorporated, I welcome this report’s significant contribution to freedom, peace and democracy in the world."
"In his report, the rapporteur discusses the important role played by the media in a country’s development."
"A democracy requires freedom of expression and of the press. Good access to the media for all groups in society is also required if a society is to function well."
"There are, however, some elements in the report to which we are strongly opposed."
"Clearly, we remain solidly behind our view that aid should not be managed at Community level."
"It is a matter for the Member States."
"Moreover, the EU should likewise not be carrying out information campaigns within the Member States."
"On the whole, however, we believe that the content of the report is sound."
"We have thus voted in favour of the report in today’s vote."
". I should like to comment on the Mavrommatis report, on which we voted without holding a debate beforehand."
"Although it offers a series of indisputably interesting ideas and conclusions, the report contains a great deal of empty, superfluous waffle that not only fails to reflect what is actually happening in EU Member States but also fails to contribute towards solving the problems that the Union should be addressing in this area."
"I should also like to highlight the fact that in some Member States there are no media that one might remotely call independent or professional."
"The media in those countries are categorically not a ‘vital and fundamental process for human development’, to quote the words of the report."
"In the Czech Republic, for example, the media are merely components of the market and clearly an instrument of political manipulation used to misinform the public."
"It is no secret that the key media in the Czech Republic belong to foreign concerns and that the regional press belongs to a German publishing company."
"One characteristic feature of this state of affairs is the marginalisation of, in the main, left-wing opinions, the treatment of whole sections of the population as criminals and pariahs, and the downgrading of the role of journalists to that of mere hired hands, who are forced unquestioningly to respect and defend the editor’s political platform."
"There are no restrictions applying to editors in respect of the concentration of media power."
"The empty lip–service that is paid to ethics and humanity is clearly deeply naive and tantamount to turning a blind eye to the real problems facing the media sector in the EU."
"– I supported the Beazley report on support for initiatives to complement national school curricula providing appropriate support measures to include the European dimension."
"It is clear that the inclusion of European history, shared cultural heritage and a grasp of European current affairs must go hand in hand with the development of other areas such as support for multilingualism."
"I welcome the fact that Mr Beazley mentioned the education portal European School net and its activities."
"I should also like to highlight the eTwinning project, which is charged with linking up educational institutions from different European countries in order to set up joint projects."
"Over 17 000 European schools have signed up to eTwinning."
"This own-initiative report is a good way to help Member States incorporate European topics into their education systems."
"I voted in favour of the excellent report by Mr Beazley on initiatives to complement school curricula providing appropriate support measures to include the European Dimension."
"In terms of European construction, everybody knows how crucial it is to instil a European culture amongst the citizens, particularly young people: it is essential to the success of the European project in terms of creating a humanist civilisation."
"In addition to learning languages, the history and geography of the European Union should, together with the arts and citizenship, be disciplines whose European dimension should be brought to the fore."
"I entirely agree with this report’s suggestions, particularly on involving teachers with incorporating the European dimension into education."
"I believe that there should be a similar process for universities and for lifelong learning."
". Whereas, on the one hand, we accept that there are differences between and within the Member States as regards the inclusion of the European dimension in education, and that, given the crucial importance of languages, the COMENIUS and LINGUA programmes should be awarded more substantial Community funding, we disagree, on the other hand, that there is a single vision of so-called European history and values."
"Each country has its particular characteristics and each people its own history, and yet even this can be viewed from different angles depending on one's perspective."
"We feel that Europe’s richness comes from its diversity of its cultures and languages, and this is something that must be preserved."
"Any standardisation must be avoided."
"Accordingly, although the report highlights some positive points as regards language and other skills, following up previous reports and existing Community programmes, we are opposed to any attempt at standardisation to which it might lead."
"Hence our abstention."
"The June List has previously pointed out in the European Parliament – and now does so again – that the Member States have sole responsibility for the organisation of teaching and the content of education systems."
"The European Parliament has previously stated that, amongst other things, it wishes to get involved in language teaching and the adjustment of education systems to areas such as new technology and digitalisation."
"Now it is the European dimension that is to find its way into curriculums."
"How is the European dimension in the common history and cultural heritage of Europe to be defined, however?"
"And by whom?"
"We must act in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"It is for the Member States themselves to advocate democracy and tolerance in Europe when devising their school curriculums and addressing their citizens."
"These matters must not be regulated at EU level."
"We have therefore voted against this report."
"This own-initiative report does not seek to interfere with national competences regarding education."
"Essentially, this report seeks to ask for clarification as to what is the 'European dimension'."
"There are a number of programmes that exist for teacher exchanges and for students such as the ERASMUS/SOCRATES programme."
"However, in the UK there are large numbers of students who are not aware of these opportunities and the UK is falling behind other countries in sending students abroad."
"Since the Labour government made GCSE languages non-compulsory, the number of students studying French and German this year alone was 14% less than in the previous year."
"Due to the language of the oral amendment which is ambiguous, British Conservatives were not able to accept this report in its entirety."
". Our support for the Beazley report reflects our desire to see a strong emphasis on the teaching of languages to inculcate a culture of multilingualism within our education systems in Ireland."
"We also believe that all citizens should have access to detailed and unbiased information about the European Union and how it affects their lives."
"Sinn Féin's support of the Beazley report (A6-0267/2006) 'The European Dimension of school teaching materials' should not be viewed as an endorsement of an increased role for the European Union in the education system of Member States."
"Education is a responsibility for each Member State and should remain so."
"The debate on the European dimension in schools could easily pass by unnoticed. Yet this is a debate that raises some fundamental issues."
"We must not forget that any decisions we take in the area of education will have a decisive impact on future generations, and on their lives and their worldview."
"I therefore feel that Mr Beazley’s comments on language skills are extremely apt, and would reiterate that the European Indicator of Language Competence must not give the wrong idea: to foster the widespread learning of just a few European languages would be counterproductive."
"It is vital that we promote other European languages outside Europe. This is a treasure trove of knowledge that the whole of Europe should be promoting."
"In this regard, we should be following the example of certain countries such as Austria, Spain, Portugal and Slovenia. The European dimension has a well-established place in the education systems of these countries, and people are encouraged to learn European languages."
"The European dimension in schools must not be neglected, especially in view of Europe's place in the world, the new challenges of economic growth that we face and the objectives of policies on cooperation with the rest of the world."
". I congratulate our rapporteur on his initiative."
"Education is and must remain a Member State competence."
"Indeed, we in Scotland control our own education system and have for centuries."
"However, our rapporteur makes the very fair point that often our youngsters leave school ill-equipped to participate as citizens, and often know little about the EU or other governments which work for them."
"The steps set out in this report make interesting homework for teachers across the EU."
". While I support initiatives to enhance the study of foreign languages, to improve knowledge of the culture and history of the many European countries and to stimulate genuine debate about the nature of the EU, including its many fundamental flaws, I am strongly opposed to measures designed to inculcate support for the EU project of political integration and to construct some false identity of 'European' citizenship."
"The report confuses these various aspects."
"I therefore abstained."
"– Mr President, it is no doubt true that clean air is a crucial issue for all of us, and we also have to bear in mind the certainty of the expense resulting from poor air quality in Europe being higher than the implementation costs incurred by business and industry, but the derogations and potential extensions contained in the compromise document are too complex and likely to present serious administrative problems, and it is for that reason that the delegation of the Austrian People’s Party has largely rejected these compromises."
"They also need to be considered in the light of ‘better regulation’, something that they cannot be said to achieve."
"It is for that reason that the whole package was largely worthy of rejection; we would prefer the Council position."
"– My vote with regard to the Krahmer and Corbey reports was in favour of higher levels for the quality of air and for stricter controls in this area."
"The main motive for my decision is the way Maltese and Gozitan citizens are at present being treated by the country’s authorities."
"We are in a situation where not only are European standards not being respected, but people are not even being given the information they have a right to if they are to protect their health and the environment."
"A concrete example of this was the fact that it was only after an intervention on my part that the authorities publicly admitted that European directives regarding emissions from the country’s power-stations were being breached."
"Moreover, we have reached the stage where the equipment which gauges pollution from the Marsa and Delimara power stations has not been functional for months after it was reportedly hit by lightning."
"The Maltese daily yesterday revealed that we are still not taking adequate measures, given that the new apparatus has not been purchased yet."
"This is not acceptable and it is incumbent on the responsible authorities and the European Commission to follow this breach more closely."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Krahmer on the draft legislative resolution, at first reading, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe."
"This proposed directive is going to replace five different legal instruments and contribute to the ‘better lawmaking’ process, and that is a very positive step."
"Combating atmospheric pollution is a duty we owe to future generations and, in view of recent developments in science and health issues, it is perfectly natural to revise and simplify the current texts."
"We must welcome the efforts of transport manufacturers and firms that have applied rules that are sufficiently strict to meet the challenges facing us; not least the health of our fellow citizens."
"We must ensure that the Member States transpose the rules and apply them rigorously."
"We support common minimum standards for air pollution."
"The Directive has a solid enough legal basis in Articles 175 and 176, which state that the Member States may retain or adopt provisions with a view to ensuring more extensive protection."
"However, Article 176 also states that such protection must be notified to the Commission, and must not be in contravention of the treaties."
"The limit values for air pollution may be in conflict with the internal market, for which reason we do not believe that a directive with Articles 175 and 176 as its legal basis is of itself a sufficient guarantee of the ability of the Member States to retain or adopt provisions with a view to attaining higher levels of protection."
"We are nonetheless voting ‘yes’, as we find common minimum standards desirable, and we shall therefore be putting forward proposals during the second reading in Parliament providing a legal basis in the directive to safeguard the right of the Member States to adopt more stringent provisions and to make it clear that they have this right."
". – Clean air for the citizens, their health and their quality of life is a good intention."
"Unfortunately, the report which we have just adopted is not up to the task."
"This text falls short of World Health Organisation recommendations and lacks the necessary urgency."
"PM2.5 are the finest particles and the ones most dangerous to the body; that is why the limit should not be more than 12 micrograms."
"Moreover, the implementation periods, extending as they do to 2015, do not reflect the seriousness of the problem and it is unacceptable that there should also be exemptions."
"I also deplore the fact that this first reading was the direct result of compromise between the political groups, preventing Parliament from working properly and locking us into a position that falls far short of our political objectives."
"Lastly, this report does not reflect the ambitions we have nevertheless clearly expressed in environmental matters, both in the international arena and to the European public."
". The high level of air pollution in particular in urban regions and centres in the EU with high population density is, among other factors, responsible for countless respiratory diseases and for causing serious damage to ecosystems."
"Most at risk are children, the elderly and people living in the most populous cities or close to busy roads."
"The pollution limit values put forward in the Commission’s first proposal were a step backward in relation to what was agreed in 1999, that is to say, in Directive 1999/30/EC."
"In this regard, I particularly wish to highlight fine particulate matter limits (PM2.5), which are very high and which exceed those set by the World Health Organisation."
"The proposals tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left were unfortunately rejected in the debate in Parliament."
"Accordingly, the document that has just been adopted is limited in scope, although it does contain some welcome proposals aimed at striking a degree of balance as regards combating pollution, albeit in watered-down form."
"Hence our abstention."
"I abstained on the Krahmer report, the main parts of which are impossible for ordinary mortals to understand, including the legislature that is supposed to make the law."
"If Parliament wants to commit itself to ambient air quality, it should be content to set the broad principles and the general framework, leaving it to the experts to set the limits."
". Ambient air quality is a vital factor in the health and quality of life of Europe’s citizens."
"As part of the drive to simplify environmental legislation, it brings five of the existing provisions on air quality under one single directive. It also proposes more ambitious targets than the existing provisions."
"We therefore endorse the introduction of new objectives for PM10 and, above all, the setting of target values for PM2.5, which is considered the most harmful particle matter to human health, but which is yet to be covered by European-level legislation."
"We tabled a number of amendments introducing measures such as a five-yearly review of the Directive in order that the most up-to-date scientific findings can be taken on board, air quality guarantees, the exclusion of certain areas that we do not consider relevant because they have little public access or are already subject to proper checks, and, lastly, the simplification of roadside measuring criteria."
"The Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs support the Krahmer report, with the above amendments."
". The high number of respiratory diseases and of human lives lost due to a high level of air pollution demonstrates the urgent and pressing need for another Community legislative measure on health protection that will further limit emissions that are harmful to humans."
"The abnormally high percentages of birth defects in some industrial regions of the European Union are of particular concern."
"The case of the Sicilian petrochemicals plants is typical: of the 13 000 babies born between 1992 and 2002, almost 1 000 have heart, limb and digestive tract defects, while the mortality rate among males with stomach cancer is 57% higher than the Italian national average."
"In some urban areas, too, such as in the city of Messina, which absorbs traffic day and night in the form of vehicles leaving Sicily bound for the European continent and vice versa, the situation has become unbearable."
"The Union for Europe of the Nations Group’s position in favour of the Krahmer report is a further incentive for the fight against air pollution in Europe to be stepped up in the years to come."
". – Air pollution is a major public health concern."
"For example, the fine particles given off by some human activities are thought to shorten European life expectancy by around nine months."
"In Belgium alone, nearly 13 000 people die prematurely every year as a result of particles given off by diesel engines in particular."
"All these respiratory diseases can be avoided and the legislators ought to send out a simple message: clean air for Europe necessarily means stringent pollution standards."
"That is not the message the European Parliament has sent out today by adopting Holger Krahmer’s report on the CAFE directive."
"I deplore the fact that in a matter of such importance to the public, the impact of pollution on human health, my fellow Members have lacked ambition, seeking in particular not to hit certain industries."
"I still hope that the European Parliament will rectify the matter at second reading, be more receptive to the arguments of environmental health experts and avoid the pitfall of setting standards that are not as strict as those in force today."
"With this vote, California has never seemed so far away."
". It is positively scandalous that today sees Parliament considerably weakening existing air quality regulations."
"For the first time, this House is even adopting a weaker position than the Council."
"Despite this, there is sufficient scientific evidence to suggest that fine dust particles in air pollution account for some 3.6 million lost life years, which translates into 348 000 premature deaths."
"By 2020, air pollution caused by ozone and fine dust will cost Europe EUR 189 to 609 billion annually!"
"This House’s position is considerably less ambitious than the recommendations issued by the World Health Organisation, and those levels proved attainable in large cities in industrialised countries."
"What is worse, Parliament is offering Member States the opportunity of extending the number of calendar days during which the limit value for PM10 dust particles per calendar year can be exceeded from 35 days to 55, which is tantamount to burying your head in the sand."
"The USA, by issuing an annual limit value of 15 µg/m3 for PM2.5 since 1997, has demonstrated that a stricter approach is feasible."
"The limit must be attained by 2010 at the latest."
"The State of California, incidentally, is taking matters even further, for a limit value of 12 µg/m3 has been in force there since 2003."
"The European Parliament stands by its promise to attain 20 µg/m3 by ... 2015!"
"If the Council does not offer enough in the way of counterweight against this weakening measure, the Commission will have no choice but to withdraw the proposal."
". British Conservatives note with approval the Court of Auditors' observation that progress has been made with regard to the integrity of the EU accounts."
"We are dismayed to note, however, that the auditors have indicated that there are continuing weaknesses in supervisory and control systems and we support the rapporteur's opinion that those weaknesses should be addressed as a matter of utmost priority."
"With regard to the European Parliament's lease of the Strasbourg parliament buildings, we acknowledge and approve the fact that the report states that the parliament authority behaved correctly but that the City of Strasbourg had failed to act in good faith."
"However, we believe that the continued occupancy of two seats by the European Parliament represents poor value for money to the European taxpayer and, therefore, we can not support any proposal to purchase the Strasbourg parliament buildings."
"For these reasons the British Conservatives have abstained on the final vote on the Ferber report."
"I voted in favour of discharge, but I abstained on the resolution because the Committee on Budgetary Control insists on mixing issues that are real with those that are not."
"Parliament cannot change a seat established by treaty simply by adopting a resolution."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control has got it all wrong on the question of the rents paid and the purchase price of the buildings in Strasbourg."
"In a market economy, it is impossible to speak of a fair rent because all rents and all purchase prices are negotiated between the owner and the lessee or the purchaser."
"Even if the way Strasbourg behaved may be considered discourteous, there was no illegality or misappropriation."
"That is precisely what some Members and some of the media have claimed, obviously without a shadow of evidence."
"I wish to disassociate myself from these unsavoury individuals."
"The June List is of the opinion that discharge should not be granted to the President for the 2004 financial year. There are two main reasons for this."
"The first of these is that we believe the leadership of the European Parliament is just as responsible as the city of Strasbourg for the fact that, for years, too much rent has been paid for the premises in Strasbourg."
"This has cost EU taxpayers large amounts of money, and Parliament should, in this case, take a strong line to ensure that the excess rent is repaid."
"Since, as things stand, there is still a lack of information as regards the size of the excess payments (see paragraph 19 dash five of the draft report), we also believe that we have still not got to the bottom of this matter."
"The second reason is that we believe that the European Parliament as an institution should not be made responsible for the shortfall in the MEPs’ additional pension scheme."
"The pension rights accruing to MEPs must be linked to the investment performance of their pension fund."
"That is how it works for ordinary citizens throughout the EU, and MEPs ought not to be given a special luxury perk in this respect."
". The vote on the report on the discharge of the budget for 2004 (European Parliament) was postponed in order to look into the circumstances surrounding the lease of the Strasbourg building."
"Subsequently, the European Parliament has paid the City of Strasbourg up to EUR 60 million in additional payments, and there is no possibility of compensation for the losses it has suffered."
"In addition, a lack of honesty, transparency and decisiveness has been noted."
"Despite these facts, we should make a decision on purchasing the Strasbourg building."
"The FDP in the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is wrong for Parliament to purchase the building in Strasbourg, because it would be irresponsible for it to tie itself to Strasbourg for the long term."
"We have therefore rejected the corresponding amendments."
"The FDP supports the establishment of the European Technology Institute in Strasbourg, and advocates a single seat for Parliament in Brussels."
". This report is about more than rubberstamping the bill pertaining to the 2004 financial year."
"Without Amendment 9, it also gives this House’s Bureau licence to spend the reserve on the purchase of buildings in Strasbourg."
"We have nothing against the calculation that shows that a purchase will prove more beneficial in the long run than extending the rental agreement."
"We would vote in favour if that were the only issue involved."
"More importantly, it makes a significant contribution to our being able to carry on the monthly part-sessions in Strasbourg in a sustainable manner."
"These are now setting us back EUR 200 000 000 or more annually."
"In September 1999, the Dutch Parliament unanimously spoke out against the European Parliament continuing to sit in two different cities."
"As a result, the Dutch representatives across all EU bodies were urged to put an end to this practice at the earliest opportunity."
"That reflects what is being said in the Dutch media and the opinion which the public has held on this matter for years."
"Whilst the Netherlands considers the purchase of buildings in Strasbourg as one of this House’s key decisions, the issue, that is concealed in the purchase authorisation, is not addressed separately after this item on the agenda."
"That is why we will be voting against."
"The chief virtue of the Ferber report is that it ends an argument that has gone on for only too long."
"That is why I am voting in favour of discharge."
"I am not happy about a number of things it says, however."
"While it is settled that the City of Strasbourg has not committed any legal irregularity, the charge of discourtesy is too convenient an excuse for some Members who simply want to take advantage of the occasion to raise the question of the seat again."
"Having followed the matter of the buildings in every detail, it is clear to me that it has been dominated by bad faith."
"When the European Parliament, whose Members were inadequately informed about a complex legal arrangement, says it was not in the picture about the subletting of the buildings, that is quite simply untrue."
"It was never the City of Strasbourg’s intention to ‘fleece’ this Assembly."
"Finally, the proposed purchase of the three buildings is good news for the European taxpayer."
"I am sad to note that the Members’ pension fund has been the subject of unjustified attacks on the principle of ‘slander as much as you like, there will always be something left’."
"We have today chosen to vote in favour of Mr Ferber’s report on the discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004."
"It has not been possible to confirm that any unlawful activities have taken place in connection with the renting of two of the buildings used by the European Parliament in Strasbourg."
"At the same time, it seems clear that the principle of ‘sound financial management’, as defined in the Financial Regulation, has not been fully respected."
"To buy the current buildings is a good business deal in the long term, from a strictly financial point of view."
"Despite this, we believe that, given the current situation, it would be desirable to delay such a decision, especially in the light of the fact that Parliament’s twin seats are a much-debated topic."
"One million EU citizens have signed the citizens’ initiative aimed at ending the travelling circus between Brussels and Strasbourg."
"We wholeheartedly support the call for Parliament to have a single site, namely Brussels."
"The report also deals with important issues such as MEPs’ allowances, secretarial allowances and the voluntary pension scheme."
"We have chosen not to join the pension scheme."
"In our opinion, it is unreasonable for European taxpayers to have to help fund a scheme completely regardless of whether it yields profits or not."
"We can only be delighted at the signing of the framework agreement that will allow Parliament to buy the WIC, SDM and IPE3 buildings outright for the sum of EUR 143 125 million."
"All the same, it will be hard for that agreement to dispel the suspicion and loss of confidence that have marred relations between Strasbourg and Parliament."
"There are several lessons to be drawn."
"First of all, there must be no property transactions involving several players, because that entails highly complex legal and financial arrangements which are contrary to the principles of transparency."
"Likewise, Parliament’s property policy, and that of all the European institutions, should be thoroughly reviewed and a European Buildings Authority created with clearly defined tasks and powers."
"So far as the current debate about a single seat is concerned, it should be pointed out that the relevant reference is still Protocol 12 to the Treaty of Amsterdam and that Parliament therefore has no competence in the matter."
"Finally, it seems to me essential that the use of the secretarial assistance allowance should be more transparent and in particular that a statute for our staff should be proposed quickly to regulate working conditions and tax and social security matters."
"Social Europe starts with us."
". The issue of where the seats of the institutions are located is not merely a geographical, logistical or economic issue."
"When a particular city is chosen as the seat of a Community institution, there are always political factors involved, too, which is totally justified, although it does not follow that any political decision is valid, irrespective of its economic or logistical rationale."
"In the case of the European Parliament, the choice of Strasbourg was based on historical factors, but nowadays, in terms of economics and practicality, it is no longer viable."
"Although this is not the issue at hand, it is worth bearing it in mind."
"One might have expected that the City of Strasbourg would pull out all the stops to help Parliament to settle in the city, even by bearing some of the costs, as the rules of hospitality in such circumstances often dictate."
"However, what we find – or rather, suspect, given that the authorities in question are not helping to clarify matters completely – is that having Parliament in Strasbourg is just a piece of real estate business from which the authorities earn a profit they do not deserve."
"The lack of good faith, decent hospitality and fairness that this reveals is something we should condemn outright and should be taken into account when decisions are taken as to where Parliament should be located."
". I voted against the suggestion that the European Institute of Technology should be sited in Strasbourg, because I think this is a silly idea."
"The EIT proposals are ongoing from the Commission, and worthy of serious consideration, they should not be used as an excuse for us to solve our own dilemma getting out of Strasbourg."
"The Parliament should have one site, in Brussels, and the EIT idea should progress further."
"The two are distinct issues and it is irresponsible to attempt to link them in this way."
". The petition of one million signatures to have one seat for the European Parliament in Brussels must be welcomed."
"As it is the only parliament in the world which has no say over where it sits, the Council of Ministers must, once and for all, put an end to this situation."
"The people of Europe have spoken."
"Their voice must be recognised."
"The European Parliament must have one home and that should be in Brussels."
"On a separate issue, I would like to put on the record my opposition to the second pension scheme."
"As Amendment 5 was rejected, I cannot back the report and will have to vote against it."
". Given that the report describes this Parliament as “the democratic representative body in the EU”, let everyone be clear about just how little it deserves that description."
"We do not have debates in this institution, but tightly controlled and orchestrated speaking time, without the opportunity for reply."
"We simply go through the motions in what is a pale shadow of a parliament."
"There can be no better example of this than the one million-signature petition calling for an end to the utterly pointless and grotesquely expensive monthly pilgrimage to Strasbourg."
"Ignoring this entreaty from the people we are supposed to represent, this Parliament is seriously considering purchasing these buildings and making this bizarre arrangement permanent."
"It is all very well for this report to question the City of Strasbourg’s ‘good faith’, but the reality is that this city worked out the best deal it could get for itself."
"This Parliament tamely signed it, without bothering to verify the terms or attempting to negotiate more favourable conditions."
"In other words, they saw us coming!"
"We voted in favour of the Ferber report today, even though it forms a basis for the purchase of the Parliament building in Strasbourg. However, our approval does not constitute a prior decision regarding the seat of the European Parliament."
"Along with more than a million other Europeans, we have supported the OneSeat.eu initiative, and, together with the citizens, we will also continue to advocate relocating Parliament's activities from Strasbourg to Brussels."
"There is every reason to criticise some of the European Parliament’s activities."
"Nonetheless, it has not been possible to prove that any unlawful actions have taken place."
"MEPs’ voluntary pension schemes are a form of supplementary pension insurance in addition to the basic MEPs’ pension."
"Under this system, European taxpayers have to pay for two thirds of all contributions (currently EUR 2 088 per month per MEP who has chosen to join this scheme)."
"The remaining third has until now been paid from MEPs’ secretarial allowance, despite the fact that the Court of Auditors criticised this arrangement as long ago as 1999, stating that contributions should be made on an entirely private basis in order to prevent accusations of ‘public funds being used for private pension contributions’."
"This remark may in itself be considered peculiar, since the system is based on two thirds of all contributions being made from the EU budget."
"I believe that the whole system should be phased out as soon as possible."
"Moreover, I have voted in favour of those amendments that will prevent Parliament from buying the parliament building in Strasbourg."
"In the short term, purchase of the building would lead to financial savings, but, in such a case, the aim would have to be to fund the purchase by selling the parliament building in Brussels."
"The most important thing is for the seat of the EU to be restricted to one site."
"– Mr President, study abroad and distance learning are becoming increasingly popular, not least thanks to millions of Euro worth of EU subsidies."
"On the one hand, this is of great benefit to the students themselves, who gain the opportunity to develop their personal skills in addition to obtaining a specialist qualification, but, on the other hand, domestic universities have increasing numbers of foreign students."
"However, I find it quite astounding that, in Austria for example, despite the low percentage of the population with degrees, they form such a high proportion of the unemployed."
"In this connection, it would be worth considering whether we should provide greater support for practical internships abroad, and also extend opportunities for in-service training and distance learning."
"That is why I voted in favour of the Prets report."
"– I backed the report on transnational mobility because of the bearing this activity has on the skills and competences acquired by students, and also because it is an important precondition for the successful implementation of these skills and competences in the workplace."
"I welcome the fact that the report includes principles that, if properly implemented, will enhance the effectiveness of all kinds of organised mobility in the area of education."
"Through the Europass, educational institutions and employers will obtain transparent information on the progress and quality of student work experience and specialist practice."
"The report is a welcome contribution to further support for general and specialist education."
". Given the significance of Mrs Prets' report concerning transnational mobility within the Community for education and training purposes, the British Conservative delegation of the EPP-ED Group will vote in favour of the report."
"However, the delegation maintains its opposition to the wording 'political integration' referred to in Amendment 3 to Recital 1a (new), as this implies a constitutional settlement in the EU, which does not reflect the current position and which has not received the assent of the 25 Member States."
". I voted in favour of the Prets report (A6-0255/2006) on the European Charter for Mobility because I am a strong advocate of adopting measures aimed at delivering a significant increase in mobility, which is an integral part of European citizenship."
"The European Charter for Mobility should help to raise the overall quality levels of European mobility, develop recognition of periods dedicated to education or vocational training and the recognition of titles, qualifications and social security benefits, and establish mutual trust so as to improve and strengthen cooperation among the authorities, the organisations and all the stakeholders in mobility."
"The June List is strongly in favour of increased mobility in Europe, particularly within the education and training sector."
"There are always questions to be asked, however, when officialdom gets hold of a good cause."
"We are voting in favour of the compromise, but we object to Amendment 47."
"This amendment makes the following addition: ‘The Charter, in the respective languages of the recipients, should be furnished to all students and persons undergoing training by the authorities, organisations and other stakeholders involved in mobility in countries of origin and host countries, and should be treated as a basic reference framework.’"
"We believe that it is the responsibility of the individual Member States to perform the tasks they have undertaken to perform."
". I wish to congratulate Mrs Prets on her timely report on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on transnational mobility within the Community for education and training purposes: European Quality Charter for Mobility, to which I lend my full backing."
"I particularly welcome the amendments aimed at encouraging the public authorities in Europe to implement measures to improve mobility in Europe and facilitate the mobility of researchers, students and teachers in the EU."
"Mobility in education and vocational training will, above all, help people to feel a sense of belonging to Europe and thus to develop a European awareness. Furthermore, it will provide a boost for European citizenship and for the creation of a society based on knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurship."
". When Europe's citizens take to an EU project, it is a sign of the project’s success."
"This has clearly been the case with the programmes aimed at fostering mobility among students."
"So many have joined up that people are already referring to the ‘Erasmus generation’, and numbers continue to grow year on year."
"Indeed, it is this kind of success that makes one believe in the notion of European citizenship."
"That being said, the EU’s political initiative was quickly overtaken by the success of Community programmes."
"It is now necessary to make up for lost time and adopt a series of measures aimed at removing the last remaining (legal, administrative and financial) obstacles, thereby deriving the maximum benefit from mobility in education and training."
"I welcome this report because it advocates the adoption of a European Quality Charter for Mobility, which places the accent not just on increasing mobility but on improving its quality, and, in so doing, developing human resources to the full."
"There is no doubt that any improvement in mobility in education and training will help achieve a knowledge-based economy conducive to creating jobs and sustainable development, which are the cornerstones of the Lisbon Strategy."
"– Mr President, I abstained on the Trüpel report, because the acquisition of so-called key competences presupposes basic skills such as reading, writing, arithmetic and logical, critical thinking."
"As the PISA study shows, though, we have problems in this area."
"A high proportion of foreigners in school classes causes major problems in the acquisition of these basic skills."
"If we do not soon lay down upper limits for the proportion of foreigners in classes, then those classes will not only continue to suffer from preconditioned conflicts between the various groups and cultures, but also find it increasingly difficult to acquire key competences."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Trüpel on the proposal for a recommendation, at first reading, of the European Parliament and of the Council on key competences for lifelong learning."
"It is crucial to the European citizens that, through training, they may have a reasonable guarantee of employability in the knowledge-based society defined in the Lisbon Strategy."
"I am pleased to note that the spirit of enterprise is one of the eight key competences that all Europeans should have available to them."
"Everybody should be aware that, while qualifications are necessary, they are no longer sufficient and ‘entrepreneurship’ must be instilled."
"That will be a considerable asset for those people who acquire it as a result of the Member States’ application of this recommendation."
". Given the significance of Mrs Trüpel's report concerning key competences for lifelong learning, the British Conservative delegation of the PPE-DE Group will vote in favour of the report."
"However, notwithstanding its support overall for the report, with reference to Amendment 1 to Recital 4, the delegation does not agree that the setting of percentage targets for employment levels is an effective exercise in helping to achieve increased employment rates, but is aware that this amendment is merely a restatement of the European Council's position."
". I wish to congratulate Mrs Trüpel on her report on a proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on key competences for lifelong learning, to which I lend my support."
"I particularly welcome the reference to the need to increase investment in education and training."
"I also feel it is very important, in this regard, to offer Europe's citizens the tools needed to adapt to the kind of labour market that is characteristic of a knowledge-based society."
". Globalisation is increasingly confronting the EU with new challenges, which require that all European citizens constantly improve their knowledge and skills, as well as broader competences, both in their private lives and in their public and professional lives."
"The need for access to the key competences that constitute the basis of personal development, social inclusion, active citizenship and employment is dictated by the growth of the knowledge-based society in the context of the Lisbon Process and is associated with labour market placement."
"For these reasons I have voted for the Trüpel report, including the Commission's recommendations, as it constitutes a European reference instrument for key competences and suggests ways of ensuring access for all European citizens to these competences, by way of lifelong learning."
"This document makes an important contribution to the attainment of the Lisbon Strategy goals for growth and employment and, in particular, the implementation of the Education and Training 2010 work programme."
". Coming, as I do, from a country in which there are still high levels of illiteracy and long-term unemployment, and in which 50% of pupils do not finish secondary education, I supported this report, which puts lifelong learning high on the agenda in the reform of labour markets."
"The pressure of globalisation and new technologies has clearly highlighted a number of gaps in a range of key skills, which make it more difficult for workers to adapt to increasingly flexible labour markets."
"With the adoption of a European reference framework, this becomes both an upstream action – insofar as it supports educating and training young people to give them the key knowledge they need to start their working lives – and a downstream action, developing and updating the key skills of workers by means of lifelong learning."
"The action is thus aimed both at acquiring the skills and at developing and subsequently updating those skills."
"This initiative forms part of the Lisbon Strategy objectives of investing in growth and employment, and is to be funded by the new generation of Community programmes (2007-2013), such as the European Social Fund, of which lifelong learning is one of the priorities."
"I welcome this report as it promotes a modern social policy, taking account of the new realities of the society in which we live and work."
"– Mr President, I support the strategy elaborated by the rapporteur, but I would make two criticisms: first of all, the European strategy on air pollution has no mandatory targets, and it should do; and secondly, the Community should allow the Member States and regions to decide for themselves how to achieve those targets."
"This freedom of choice is restricted by a huge number of Community provisions: think, for example, of the Infrastructure Costs Directive, which does not allow tolls to be charged for heavy road vehicles in areas where there is serious environmental and air pollution."
"In her report, the rapporteur discusses the Commission’s thematic strategy on air pollution."
"The June List believes that cross-border environmental problems represent an issue that should be dealt with at Community level."
"Air pollution is an example of just such a problem."
"Paragraph 25 calls on the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council to strike an interinstitutional agreement in which they express their dedication to the air quality targets."
"The June List clearly also wishes to see better legislation, but we believe that this will be difficult to achieve if the legislature and the executive power have agreed in advance which regulations are going to apply in the future."
"We have therefore voted against the report in today’s vote."
"– Mr President, two-thirds of the population of my country, Hungary, live in cities."
"They are the ones who are most exposed to environmental damage caused by industry and transport."
"This in itself is sufficient reason for us to make special efforts to improve the urban environment."
"The situation in Budapest is particularly bad, and therefore I considered it important to support this report, although it contains several objectionable elements."
"Mr Hegyi expects EU standards in quite a few areas which fall exclusively within the sphere of competence of the Member States or of local authorities."
"I understand his reasons since, like me, he lives in Budapest, where nothing has been done in recent years to improve the quality of the environment."
"EU requirements can indeed serve as important incentives, and their observance needs to be monitored strictly."
"We cannot, however, expect the Union to solve the environmental problems of European cities with standards outlining detailed, specific programmes."
"This is the task of territorial local authorities, and Strasbourg or Brussels cannot compensate for their failures."
". I voted in favour of the Hegyi report (A6-0233/2006) on the thematic strategy on the urban environment, because it is vital to boost the overall environmental performance of cities in Europe by reducing bureaucracy, by enhancing the efficiency of environmental policy implementation, and by encouraging long-term environmental planning."
"Some 80% of Europe’s citizens live in urban areas, but their needs and interests are often under-represented in the Union’s funds, projects, initiatives and strategies."
"Consequently, with a view to raising the quality of life of Europe’s city-dwellers, Community law needs to go further, by adopting sustainable urban management and transport plans."
". The report that has just been adopted in Parliament has some positive points that we support; for example, the more widespread use of more environmentally-friendly transport, encouragement to use public transport, reduction in the density of construction, more green spaces in urban areas, the renovation of run-down buildings and, more importantly, of historic centres, and better environmental performance of buildings in terms of insulation and the use of renewable energy sources."
"It is also important, as the report says, to promote the exchange of best practice at Community level as regards sustainable urban management strategy and planning, and the increased involvement of the citizens in public debates at the planning stage."
"Nevertheless, all of this presupposes that increased Community funding has been granted, which unfortunately is not the case."
"Far from it, in fact; the EU has been introducing more obligations and requirements without creating the appropriate financial resources, which may exacerbate the inequalities between the wealthiest countries and regions and other areas that lag behind."
"."
"Accessibility is a key factor in sustainable development, and, as such, transport is at the core of any debate on urban policy."
"Given that there are a number of ideas aimed at solving environmental issues and the congestion that our cities suffer are beset with, I feel that we should be channelling our efforts into addressing the impact on public health and the quality of life, in terms of socio-economic dynamism."
"The idea of sustainable urban transport plans is undoubtedly important, yet we must not overlook the need to use this instrument flexibly and in a way that is appropriate to the specific characteristics of each city."
"The use of environmentally-friendly means of transport and technologies is a key factor in achieving a cleaner environment. It will only become widespread, however, if local and national authorities exchange experiences and good practice."
"It therefore strikes me as clear that in order to foster an integrated approach to urban policy, it is crucial to promote private-public partnerships and to effectively manage existing Community instruments to support urban policy."
"Only with measures that are appropriate to the actual situation in each Member State will we be able to deliver a sustainable future for our cities and the harmonious growth of our societies."
"I am voting in favour of this report despite the fact that it contains negative points such as, for example, green areas per capita and how music from domestic sources is to be reduced in the urban environment, these clearly being local issues that should be decided at local level."
"The positives within the report, such as congestion charging, reduced car use and local sustainability plans outweigh the negatives, however, and conservative governments may very well need a push from the EU when it comes to such matters."
"That being said, the content of the report ought to remain advisory in nature and not give rise to comprehensive legislation."
". As the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the report on the thematic strategy on the urban environment, I called on the members of my group to abstain from the final vote today."
"The report tries to destroy the subsidiarity principle."
"Nevertheless, I considered it unjustified to completely reject the report, because the majority of it describes existing regulations, calls for the sharing of experience between cities and simply calls on the European Commission to issue guidelines."
"Particularly in the new Member States, it is absolutely vital to improve the urban environment by means of such measures."
". I abstained from the vote on the report on the thematic strategy on the urban environment."
"The report tries to destroy the subsidiarity principle."
"Nevertheless, I considered it unjustified to completely reject the report, because the majority of it describes existing regulations, calls for the sharing of experience between cities and simply calls on the European Commission to issue guidelines."
"Particularly in the new Member States, it is absolutely vital to improve the urban environment by means of such measures."
"I voted against this report, not because I wish to denigrate Mr Hegy's work, but because subsidiarity is being treated with contempt and the EU and its institutions are interfering in national matters."
"I do not think that this is justified."
"This tendency for Europe to continually interfere in the daily lives of its citizens, even when it is not necessary, is one of the primary reasons why people are becoming so disenchanted with Europe."
". Given the importance to people seeking to move to other countries of mutual recognition of qualifications between the different EU Member States, a European Qualifications Framework could prove beneficial."
"I share the report’s view that the setting of prescriptive criteria for learning pathways or for the duration and location of education and training courses must be rejected."
"We also welcome the idea that the organisation and validation of lifelong learning are a matter for the Member States and cannot easily be brought within the purview of the EQF."
"Yet we must focus on the form in which the EQF is developed, the foundations on which it is based and the objectives that we are seeking to attain."
"In this regard, the report contains some contradictions, for example, the attempts to bring the EQF into line with the so-called Bologna process and the so-called Lisbon Strategy, which as we know, is aimed primarily at pandering to the interests of the economic and financial groups."
"Hence our abstention."
". I support this report because I firmly believe that the creation of a European Qualifications Framework (EQF) will make a contribution towards the employability and geographical mobility of the workforce in the EU."
"I welcome a European approach such as this because it meets the fresh challenges posed by a knowledge-based society head-on and seeks to address the new requirements of the European labour market. The underlying philosophy of the EQF is, after all, to promote the competitiveness of the European economy and social cohesion, in line with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"I warmly welcome initiatives that will bring to the top of the agenda the citizens’ ability to gain employment, by encouraging professional mobility by means of the recognition, comparability and transferability of professional qualifications in the Community area."
"I regret, however, that this initiative does not sufficiently reflect what is actually happening in the labour market and overlooks the importance of vocational training, focusing, instead, mainly on academic training."
"The next item is the Commission Communication on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"."
"Mr President, the Commission has just adopted its final report on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"Our conclusion is that both countries are in a position to take on the rights and obligations of European Union membership on 1 January 2007."
"The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will mark an historic achievement: the completion of the fifth enlargement of the European Union, which further pursues the reunification of our European family."
"On this occasion, I would like to congratulate the peoples and authorities of Bulgaria and Romania for all the efforts they have produced in order to fulfil the conditions for accession to the European Union."
"I would also like to thank you, honourable Members, for the constructive role played by Parliament."
"The European Parliament has always been a staunch champion of the political, economic and cultural benefits of enlargement."
"Your support has helped to spread peace, stability and prosperity in Europe."
"The most recent enlargement, like others before it, has proved to be a great success."
"It has confirmed that the enlargement of the Union, if carefully managed, produces a win-win situation for both the existing and the acceding Member States."
"Enlargement stimulates economic growth and social cohesion and reinforces the role and influence of the European Union in the world."
"The readiness of Bulgaria and Romania is a direct result of the sustained progress both countries have achieved over the last few years and particularly since our last report in May."
"The Commission takes its responsibility as guardian of the treaties very seriously."
"First and foremost, we must protect the functioning of the European Union."
"This endorsement of the 2007 accession date for Bulgaria and Romania is based on a rigorous, fair and objective assessment, as Commissioner Rehn will explain in detail in a few moments."
"Bulgaria and Romania have found the right answer to our strict conditionality by addressing the areas we highlighted in May."
"In doing so, they have achieved considerable progress."
"However, today’s report also outlines some areas where both countries need to achieve further progress by sustaining the current reform drive until accession and beyond."
"The Commission has drawn up a number of measures to accompany the accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"In particular, the Commission will set up a mechanism for cooperation and verification of progress in the areas of judicial reform, the fight against corruption and organised crime."
"The mechanism contains specific benchmarks that have to be met."
"The Commission will report regularly to Parliament and to the Council on the progress achieved."
"On that basis, the Commission may, if necessary, invoke the safeguard measures set out in the Accession Treaty."
"The Commission has further accompanying measures at its disposal, which will ensure the proper functioning of the Union up to and beyond the accession of both countries."
"European Union rules provide us with a comprehensive set of measures that allow us to combat potential risks in acceding and in current Member States and to address concerns such as food safety or the management of European taxpayers’ money."
"The rigorous application of these accompanying measures underlines the emphasis we have placed on conditionality throughout the accession preparations for those countries."
"We are therefore convinced that, once again, enlargement will proceed smoothly in a way that will strengthen, not compromise, the functioning of the European Union."
"It is important to ensure that, as we enlarge, we are still able to function efficiently."
"I should like to use this opportunity to state my position concerning future enlargements."
"After the completion of this fifth enlargement, with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, I believe that an institutional settlement should precede any future enlargement."
"This is the way to ensure that our enlarged Union will function in an efficient and harmonious way."
"In any case, the Nice Treaty already requires us to adapt our institutional set-up following the accession of the 27th member."
"Last June’s European Council conclusions have set the course for that institutional settlement and I hope that by the end of 2008 we will succeed."
"In following that timetable, we will respect our commitments towards countries for which we have opened up the possibility of accession and fulfil our strategic goal of consolidating peace, democracy and prosperity on our continent."
"We are looking forward to Bulgaria and Romania’s historic achievement of European Union membership in 2007."
"I expect both to contribute energetically to the process of European integration."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to join President Barroso in congratulating Bulgaria and Romania on their historic achievement."
"Over the past months, both countries have demonstrated their readiness to join the European Union."
"The key to this success was a combination of substantial Bulgarian and Romanian efforts with the strong encouragement and support of the Union."
"Let me also join President Barroso in thanking the European Parliament for its continuous support for the gradual and carefully managed accession process to the Union."
"The Commission’s assessment is based on an even more rigorous system of conditionality than the one applied in the past."
"Over the past two years in particular, Bulgaria and Romania have responded strongly to our system of conditionality."
"This has resulted in a remarkable transformation, with reforms in several sectors peaking over the past three to four months."
"Thus, the strategy we devised together last May has worked well, to the benefit of Europe, Bulgaria and Romania."
"Today’s report focuses on those areas which required further progress in May."
"The majority of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s overall preparations had already been completed by that time."
"In terms of the political criteria, Bulgaria has continued the reform of the judiciary."
"The legal framework has improved, for instance, through the adoption of rules that establish objective procedures for the appointment and evaluation of magistrates, which is very important for the independence of the court systems."
"The ongoing preparations of constitutional reform in that regard are also very welcome."
"Efforts to combat corruption have resulted in more officials having to declare their personal assets and in the establishment of internal fraud inspectorates."
"The Prosecutor General has continued to be proactive in terms of requests for lifting the immunity of members of parliament."
"In the fight against organised crime, more specialists have been recruited and some successful actions have been registered against criminal networks."
"However, at the moment the number of successful prosecutions is still low and the implementation record still needs to be improved."
"Romania has made further progress in reforming its justice system and the results are tangible and positive."
"The interpretation and application of the law is being further harmonised and staffing levels in the judicial system are increasing."
"There has been definite and tangible progress in the fight against corruption."
"Criminal liability has been broadened to legal persons and rules on financing for political parties have been tightened."
"This has led to further non-partisan investigations and indictments of high-level corruption."
"The report outlines a limited number of areas where we need to see further progress in the months leading up to accession and beyond."
"Therefore, this report also spells out accompanying measures which the Commission will initiate upon accession, unless the remaining concerns have been remedied."
"The Commission will set up a mechanism for cooperation and verification of progress in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime."
"For this purpose, as President Barroso said, benchmarks have been established which refer to the particular circumstances of each country."
"The mechanism allows the Commission to help the countries to continue the reforms with vigour and rigour, and to verify that the expected progress is taking place on the ground."
"The Commission will also ask both Bulgaria and Romania to report bi-annually on progress in addressing these specific benchmarks until they have been met."
"The first report should be submitted by the end of March 2007."
"We will then report to the European Parliament and to the Council by June 2007."
"The Commission will also apply the safeguard measures of the Accession Treaty if either country fails to address the benchmarks adequately."
"The report also underlines that EU rules contain the necessary guarantees for the proper management of EU agricultural and structural funds."
"The new regulation on structural funds provides the mechanisms to ensure that these funds, which are of course EU-taxpayers’ money, are spent properly."
"Payments can be interrupted, suspended or cancelled, if the Commission suspects or detects cases of irregularities or fraud, including corrupt practices."
"Moreoverfurther to this range of safeguard measures for the EU funds, financial corrections can take place if individual or systemic irregularities are found in the regular financial controls."
"There is still a risk that preparations for the management of agricultural funds may not have been completed by the time of accession."
"As a precaution, we have adopted specific provisions to ensure the proper management of these funds by Bulgaria and Romania."
"This gives both countries time to complete preparations in 2007."
"At the same time, failure to do so will enable the Commission to reduce the payments in 2007."
"Of course, we hope that we will not have to resort to this mechanism, which should be seen as an incentive for both Bulgaria and Romania."
"As to the third safeguard measure, food safety, some measures are currently in place because of animal diseases."
"These will be maintained after accession."
"Restrictions may also need to be applied upon accession on the use of certain animal by-products."
"Non-compliant food establishments in the milk, meat and fish sectors will be denied access to the internal market, but will be allowed to produce for the national market bearing a specific label."
"After three years, they will have to comply with EU rules or close down."
"I have outlined the sufficient guarantees offered by the and the Accession Treaty."
"I am therefore confident that Bulgaria and Romania will enrich the Union without compromising the proper functioning of EU policies and institutions."
"The interests of the EU and our citizens can be assured and EU taxpayers’ money protected."
"Overall, Bulgaria and Romania should be commended for their far-reaching efforts and achievements to adapt their legislation and administration to the laws and rules of the European Union."
"On the basis of the progress made, our report shows that both countries will be ready to join the Union in 2007."
"The suggested accompanying measures will ensure the continuity and irreversibility of the reforms in the two countries."
"I trust that we can count on your support for facilitating a swift and successful ratification of the Accession Treaty in the remaining Member States."
"Bulgaria and Romania have undertaken remarkable efforts to join us in the European Union and they deserve our congratulations and a very warm welcome."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Bulgaria and Romania are an essential part of the fifth enlargement of the European Union."
"It is well known that it has been our aim to welcome both countries as Member States on 1 January 2007."
"In this respect, the communication from the Commission can be greeted with satisfaction."
"During the entire enlargement process, the views of the European Parliament on how well prepared Bulgaria and Romania are to join the Union have been taken into consideration."
"On behalf of the Presidency, I wish to thank the European Parliament for its considerable input with regard to both countries’ accession to the Union."
"The European Union has closely followed the progress that both countries have made in finally adopting reforms and meeting their membership obligations under the Treaty of Accession."
"While the European Council that met in June commended Bulgaria and Romania on the reform measures they had recently implemented, it appealed to both countries to make even more of an effort to solve, decisively and without delay, the problems still remaining, which were mentioned in the Commission’s last progress report produced in May."
"The Finnish Presidency has encouraged both countries to deal with unsolved issues."
"These include in particular the reform of the judiciary, organised crime, corruption and administrative initiatives in several key areas."
"The meetings of the Association Council have been an opportunity to evaluate the progress made with respect to the and have clearly demonstrated that the reforms that are needed must be finally adopted and implemented immediately."
"The meetings of the parliamentary joint committees have also had a key role in this work."
"The Presidency notes the recommendations in the Commission’s reports."
"We would like to commend both Bulgaria and Romania on their endeavours to fulfil the demands of accession."
"Bulgaria and Romania should now address all outstanding problems without delay."
"I know that these countries are already trying to resolve these problems."
"The Council notes the Commission’s plans regarding protective measures and stepped-up monitoring that may be introduced on the basis of Articles 37 and 38 of the Accession Treaty, should there be insufficient progress in these areas."
"The Council now proposes to undertake a thorough examination of the Commission’s communication and recommendations and a comprehensive assessment of the main issues."
"In undertaking these tasks, the Council will of course also take account of the views expressed by the European Parliament."
"The Accession Treaty’s ratification process itself is now well underway, and we trust that it will be completed on time."
"Mr President, although the Union’s future enlargement has more to do with the next topic on the agenda, I would like to say here that the European Council confirmed in June 2006 that it would adhere to existing commitments."
"The Finnish Presidency will act on the basis of these decisions."
". – Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner Rehn, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes the Commission's proposal that Bulgaria and Romania should join the European Union on 1 January 2007."
"Bulgaria and Romania are two major nations with a European culture, and on accession they will become members of our European family."
"Our group – like the others – already has national Members from Bulgaria and Romania: the Bulgarians are represented by Mrs Cappone, and the Romanians by Mr Marinescu, and over the past few months we have developed a good level of cooperation."
"On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I should like to express our appreciation to both Bulgaria and Romania – to the governments, but in particular to the people in both countries – for the huge efforts they have made since the fall of Communism."
"When a country was ruled by Communism for forty or fifty years, when there was no rule of law, no administration governed by it and no independent judiciary – when we look at all these facts, we can see just how much work both populations, just like those of the other former Communist countries, had to do."
"When we in so-called 'old' Europe take a critical view of these countries, I sometimes wish that we would remember, and express our recognition of, the huge achievements of their people."
"All in all, we consider the proposal that you have submitted, Mr Barroso and Mr Rehn – and I would particularly like to thank Mr Rehn for his very honest efforts over recent years – to be a balanced one."
"On the one hand, membership is planned for 1 January 2007, but on the other hand we must not lose sight of the fact that there is still much work to be done."
"It would be irresponsible, not only with respect to the people of the current European Union but also with respect to Bulgaria and Romania, to gloss over all the work that still needs to be done."
"Both Mr Barroso and Mr Rehn stated that there were still major deficits in the use of European money, that there was a risk of corruption and that there were still major problems in the fight against organised crime and with internal security."
"Indeed, Commissioner Rehn specifically said that the implementation of criminal prosecutions needs to be improved."
"In other words, the laws are in place, but they still need to be enforced."
"Serious breaches of the law must also be pursued through the courts, and those responsible must be held to account."
"We will be reminded of this by the fact, amongst other things, that both countries will have to present a progress report in six months' time."
"Commissioner Rehn was, in my view, very wise to say that the 'safeguard clauses' – which could also be described as transitional provisions – will hopefully not need to be invoked."
"Whether or not they are invoked depends on the progress made in the reforms."
"If these reforms, which must be continued with full commitment after 1 January 2007, are not made, then the safeguard clauses will come into effect."
"We must bear this in mind at all times."
"To the people of Bulgaria and Romania I have to say, in the midst of all the joy at accession, that the European Union you are joining on 1 January 2007 is not some kind of heaven on earth."
"We have seen in other countries how, once they have become Members of the European Union, their enthusiasm has waned considerably."
"Of course, you do not have to be enthusiastic about Europe, but you should always stand by it, and we must all be aware that we in the European Union can only have a shared future in the 21st century as a Union based on shared values that is capable of taking action."
"I hope that this awareness will never be lost in the two countries that are now joining, Bulgaria and Romania, or in the other countries of the European Union."
"Mr Barroso quite rightly spoke of the institutional consolidation of the European Union that must precede each enlargement."
"On behalf of the European People's Party element of our group, I would like to say 'yes' to institutional consolidation, but we have great ambitions in this field."
"We want the principles and substance of the constitutional treaty, including its values, to become a legal and therefore political reality."
"That is the main agenda for the months and years ahead of us, so let us work together to that end."
"In this spirit, we would like to extend a warm welcome to Bulgaria and Romania."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when people in my electoral district ask me why I support the accession of Bulgaria and Romania despite the fact that there are so many problems, that we have not yet been able to cope with the previous enlargement, that the Constitution has not been adopted, that there are so many unresolved issues in the countries themselves, I do not try to respond by referring to the various problems."
"That is the job of Commissioner Rehn, and he has done it today."
"There are still several issues that need to be resolved in Bulgaria and Romania."
"Several problems need to be described that require the governments to work towards a solution, and to convince the people that reforms are needed."
"All of this is being done and all of it is necessary."
"The shortcomings must be remedied."
"This is not the time or the place to discuss the various problems, however."
"The accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU on 1 January 2007 will continue the integration in Europe that is unparalleled in the world."
"Our grandfathers and grandmothers were proud of Western European integration."
"Why can we not be proud of the pan-European integration we are furthering with today’s debate?"
"Bulgaria and Romania are part of Europe, and I agree with Mr Poettering when he says that we should welcome them."
"On behalf of my group, I say ‘yes, they are welcome’."
"What is at stake is nothing less than putting an end to the division of our continent that ran counter to its historical development, and became bitter reality after the Second World War."
"I was born in Western Europe."
"I was born in a country that was divided, and that was overjoyed when it managed to restore its unity: and rightly so, as Germany had deserved it."
"What Germany deserved, the whole continent has deserved."
"The men and women who fought against the communist dictatorships in Bulgaria and Romania, the people there who, over the last sixteen years, have had to go through a process of transformation harder than the burdens faced by people in Western Europe in recent years: for all of this, these two countries have deserved to be rewarded with a welcome into the EU."
"After all, what problems would become easier if they remained outside?"
"Which of our concerns would be easier to solve if they did not join?"
"The answer is that nothing would be better if we left them outside."
"The reverse is true: the uncertainty in these countries and the whole Black Sea region would increase if we did not let them join."
"For this reason, it is also common sense to welcome them into our ranks."
"Everything that has been achieved in European history, that has had to be fought for, has been achieved in the face of scepticism."
"I am fairly sure that there was no standing ovation in store for the Heads of State or Government of Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France when, in 1950–52, they told their people of the need to include Germany in the European Coal and Steel Community, as it was then."
"There were very many people who said: Germany has just destroyed our country twice, and now we are supposed to welcome it into our Community?"
"Now we are supposed to give it money?"
"Yet the Heads of State or Government firmly believed that Germany’s integration into the European Community would bring peace and economic growth, and that integration would help to overcome the hatred and enmity – and it has."
"What we are doing now is no different."
"The people of all our countries are asking whether we are taking on too much, whether we are spending too much money on this, whether this is costing too much, whether all of this is too uncertain."
"We can only reply that our goal is to increase economic strength and social cohesion, and to export the integration of culture and peoples as a peace-building project."
"It is to extend what was realised internally in the old Europe to those countries that have been unable to benefit from it before now."
"All this cannot be achieved by signing a treaty, but must be fought and worked for – and we have to start somewhere."
"This also means having the courage to speak out in the face of all the scepticism and opposition and say that European integration is the right course to take in Eastern as well as Western Europe, because this integration brings peace, economic growth and greater scope for economic development in the internal market."
"Every country we welcome into the EU enriches our internal market."
"It creates social cohesion, and it helps Europe attain the proportions it needs as an economic area to withstand intercontinental competition in the long run."
"On the whole, there are plenty of small things we could find fault with: such and such a thing has not been put right, more reform is needed here, administrative reform is needed there, judicial, police and agricultural reforms elsewhere."
"All of this is true and it all needs to be done, but this does not change the fact that Bulgaria and Romania should be welcomed among us, as we need them."
"."
"Mr President, there is a Romanian proverb: ."
"It means where there are two or more, we are stronger."
"Well, there are two: Bulgaria and Romania recognise that they will be stronger in the European Union and the European Union will be stronger with Romania and Bulgaria."
"Size matters."
"With the supranational challenges we face in today’s world, the more countries that share our values and practise good government and democracy within our Union, the more able we will be to promote those values beyond it."
"So I salute the people of Romania and Bulgaria."
"I salute their governments, in which Liberals and Democrats are proud to play an important role."
"I salute, in particular, Meglena Kuneva and Anca Boagiu, who have conducted the detailed negotiations on behalf of their countries like a pair of swans, apparently gliding serenely across the surface of the water but with their feet paddling away ten to the dozen underneath."
"I express my thanks to the European Commission, and in particular to Commissioner Rehn, for a difficult task imaginatively tackled and accomplished appropriately under a Finnish Presidency."
"We all recognise that there is unfinished business."
"The European Union is a moving target with the constantly evolving."
"Bulgaria and Romania are developing themselves."
"We know that democracies are sometimes run by crisis management: often problems are often not solved until they have to be solved."
"We acknowledge that there is only a certain elasticity in the management of public affairs."
"Moreover, we recognise that there is a need, as in previous enlargements, for transition periods and safeguard clauses."
"I urge the governments and people of both countries to continue their reforms, but to those who doubt their readiness I ask, would they be better off and would we be better off with them outside?"
"Should we say ‘no’ or ‘not yet’?"
"As the American commentator Mencken once said, that ‘For every complex problem there is an answer which is clear, simple and wrong.’"
"Leaving them outside the Union would be the wrong answer."
"I am pleased, however, that the Commission draws attention in its report to the need for greater efforts in the fight against crime and the need for more serious efforts in improving the situation of the Roma people in both the countries joining us. The rule of law and social inclusion are fundaments of our Union."
"More action needs to be taken by the governments of both countries and the Commission needs to monitor that action on our behalf."
"What matters to the health of a society is less what it possesses than the direction in which its face is set."
"It seems to me that the direction of both countries is the right one."
"To quote from the hymn to St Cyril and St Methodius: ‘March ahead, oh revived people, to your future march ahead, forge your destiny of glory ...’."
"Forge it with us."
"There is work to be done in Romania and Bulgaria to make the European Union a reality."
"We build the European Union together."
"It will never be built purely from the top down."
"It must be built from the ground up."
"That was perhaps summed up by the Romanian writer Adrian Marino, when he wrote: – ‘We must bring Europe into our homes’."
"But there is work to be done in the European Union, too, to convince our citizens that the cost they are paying for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is not a net negative."
"To explain to them, as the Špidla report showed us, that those countries which welcome new countries as partners gain economic benefits."
"To point out to them that unless we let low-cost labour come to where the investment is, then the investment will go to where the low-cost labour is."
"It is a win-win calculation in bringing new countries such as Romania and Bulgaria into the Union."
"We will all be winners."
"There are some who ask whether this will be the last enlargement."
"I believe that our Member States will be obliged to sort out Europe’s constitutional challenges before new countries are taken in."
"I hope that is what the Commission President meant when he said that this might be the last enlargement."
"We owe our citizens and the citizens of these two future Member States the duty of sorting our Europe’s constitution before we take in further countries."
"In conclusion, let us welcome Romania and Bulgaria today, not in a spirit of triumph but in a spirit of satisfaction with work well accomplished."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, seldom have I seen a more hypocritical debate in this Parliament than the one we are holding today."
"Firstly, this Parliament has nothing more to say in any case."
"We decided to say yes a year ago."
"Well, you can say to me: ‘they have delivered us 150 pages’."
"For my part, I can assure you that with the 100 pages we have here you would have said no a year ago, but you have to say yes today because you said yes in any case."
"This Parliament’s hands are therefore tied and it is happy for them to be."
"Well done, the ball is in your court!"
"Secondly, Mr Barroso has just said something extraordinary: ‘an institutional settlement should precede any future enlargement!’"
"We said that when there were ten of us."
"We said it when there were fifteen!"
"We said it at 17, we said it at 25, we are saying it at 27 and I am sure that when there are 30, 35, 40 or even 45 Member States we will be saying it will be the last time, and we will all be dead and it will be the last time, next year in Jerusalem."
"I have had enough!"
"I have had enough of hearing such lies because, with Mr Schultz’s arguments, with Mr Watson’s poetic arguments, how will you be able to say no to the Balkans?"
"You have talked of peace, but it is obvious that the Balkans have a future in the European Union, it is obvious that Romania and Bulgaria have a future in the European Union."
"They must become European."
"The problem is: how?"
"On what terms, how quickly and in what way?"
"Poetry will not organise everyday politics, not poetry, and today I ask you one thing: to be serious."
"I say to you in all seriousness, if this report had been for Turkey, you would all have said no!"
"Whereas the arguments about peace, the future, the market, my grandmother, my grandfather would have been the same, but no ... because you have a very simple ideological bias, and one that is right: the European Union must enlarge."
"There is a funnel effect."
"The Commission and the Council decide, the Council decides, the Commission follows, Parliament does its yes man act, you get the funnel and everything slides, slides, slides and in it goes."
"No one can do anything any more because when you have a funnel effect you can no longer stop it ... and you have no way of raising political problems."
"Just read: so far as the media are concerned, the conditions of fairness are not guaranteed, but it does not matter, it will come."
"In one case the judiciary is not independent, but it does not matter, it will come; the machinery for protecting minorities is not yet in place, but it does not matter, it will come."
"When and how will it come?"
"How can you know it will come?"
"The fact is, have got problems."
"Moreover, for the problems of immigration the Council is incapable of getting the justice and law policy through, of getting it through in the first pillar."
"Unanimity is not required."
"It will be much easier with 27!"
"You will see, it will be much easier to get everything through with unanimity."
"The German Government promises us it will all be sorted out with the Constitution."
"But how?"
"How will you get this Constitution approved in the 27 Member States?"
"No one knows, absolutely no one; but you will see what you will see."
"For my part, I think we are hypocrites."
"Yes, Romania and Bulgaria have a European perspective."
"Yes, the Balkans, but as for us, we are incapable of making Europe a real Europe, and the worst thing, and I will finish with this, is that with enlargement as we are doing it we are heading towards a renationalisation of how States think, of politics and of practices."
"You saw that in the last Council; well, I say to you we are impotent, but as Parliament we are proud to be!"
"."
"Mr President, in 2004, Romania and Bulgaria were considered less ready than the ten states that joined at the time."
"There was no doubt that, given time, they would be treated as equal to them."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has always backed them in their endeavour, being guided by the principle that those countries should not in the first place be assessed in terms of privatisations, cutbacks, good relations with internationally active large enterprises or of their NATO membership."
"Instead, our focus is on human rights, good democratic governance and good environmental policy."
"In 2005, I voted to support, in principle, the future accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"The question then remained as to when and how this enlargement could be achieved effectively."
"This House has insisted on Romania having the right to defer, whilst for Bulgaria, the application of that possibility was left entirely in the hands of the Council."
"That happened at a time when the disquiet surrounding shortcomings in Romania was at its peak and it was expected that Bulgaria would yield the least problems."
"Since then, in fact, it has been Bulgaria that has been the cause of increasing disquiet."
"In both countries, the plight of the Roma people is worse than in most of the other states that have recently joined us."
"In a number of cases, the places they have called home for a long time have been declared illegal and they have been driven away."
"The people belonging to the Hungarian minority in Romania or the Turkish minority in Bulgaria also have problems to contend with, even though those to a lesser degree than in the recent past."
"The government is no longer intentionally putting those people at a disadvantage, but there is an attitude of apathy in respect of the discrimination by ultra-nationalists against those groups."
"Nor, indeed, has anti-Semitism yet ceased to be a problem."
"During previous debates on this topic, my group tabled proposals for improvements, among others, further to the illegal payments that are demanded from EU residents of Turkish origin passing through Romania."
"It is unfortunate that a majority could not be found in this House to back these demands, although a majority did express concern about the use of a dangerous toxin in mining preparations in Rosia Montana."
"In a communication issued by Romania on 23 September, it was reported that an environmental impact report had been launched and that its neighbour Hungary is being consulted in respect of the risks concerning toxic waste water moving in its direction."
"Since there is no outcome as yet, we will be unable, unfortunately, to incorporate it in this House’s final verdict on Romania’s membership on 11 October."
"My group fears that, after accession, many problems will still need solving, and that in the event of any mishaps, a further enlargement of the European Union will be seen as ever more controversial by public opinion in the current Member States."
"Despite this, it looks like a majority of my group will, following preparatory discussions, be voting in favour of accession on 1 January 2007, an important argument in favour being that other Member States have joined before despite their unresolved problems, and that a year’s delay will not yield any significant improvements."
"Finally, I should share with you that the Dutch Socialist Party, to which I belong, has been led by these many problems to join, in the Dutch Parliament, with the Christian Democrats in speaking out against 2007 as an accession date."
"We think that a host of problems have yet to be resolved, but the real vote will be on 11 October."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome President Barroso, Commissioner Rehn and President-in-Office Lehtomäki and join with my colleagues in welcoming the very sensible decision on Romanian and Bulgarian accession on 1 January 2007."
"Despite all the difficulties, what has actually been achieved in both those countries in the last 12 to 13 years is phenomenal: the change of culture, the change of attitude, the willingness to engage, the openness and transparency."
"The enormous sea change in legislation alone to comply with the is something that no existing Member State could achieve in such a short time."
"We can speak about the theoretical importance of this enlargement and the abstract and political arguments."
"But the most important argument of all is for the 7.5 million people in Bulgaria and the 22 million people in Romania to be given the same opportunities that all of us in the European Union have today, which we got when we were weaker or smaller countries or poorer economies with less developed judiciaries or economic and educational spheres."
"Of course, there is more work to be done."
"Ongoing reforms are needed; constant vigilance is necessary against the ability of mankind to interfere with, interrupt or corrode public life."
"That is why the safeguard clauses are there. But let us celebrate what has been achieved so far."
"I have only one small query and that concerns the ongoing difficulties in both countries with abandoned and orphaned children and children and young people with disabilities."
"They still do not get the levels of support, independence and protection they need."
"Many years ago, a greater Irishman than I am said, ‘Nobody or no group has the right to put a stop on the march of a nation’."
"We do not have the right to stop the reunification of Europe to correct the mistakes of history."
"Like all good families, we should encourage those within our family who are trying to achieve more to pursue common ideals, goals and standards."
"We should welcome Romania and Bulgaria, congratulate their officials, their governments and their people for what they have achieved so far, remember the horrors that they have come through and look forward to the bright future that lies ahead for them and for us."
"– Mr President, those of us from the post-Communist countries that are now Members of the Union suddenly find ourselves facing the kind of temptation that has all too often proved irresistible to the original, old, advanced – call them what you will – western countries."
"We are inside the ramparts, able to look down patronisingly on the newcomers trying to get inside the EU castle of which they have been dreaming."
"We peer at them and lecture them."
"Luckily, we in the Czech Republic have very recent direct experience of this degrading, patronising behaviour and of having to face a constant stream of pointless new conditions and quotas, as well as one-sided restrictions."
"For this reason, we are able to express our solidarity with both of these countries."
"We also know that many of the problems that beset Romania and Bulgaria are not of their own making, but the result of half a century over which, like us, they were deprived of natural development, of market economics and of free, representative democracy."
"Like us, they were handed to the wrong half of Europe by the decision of the post-war powers, and the people of both countries went through hell under the Communist dictatorship."
"We believe that this is why we in the Czech Republic have resisted the temptation to impose more humiliating restrictions on them concerning movement, employment and services."
"This is clearly what the protectionist western EU Member States are seeking."
"I believe that our relationship with them will be the same as we expected from the 15 western countries when we became fully-fledged Member States."
"We are still second-class Member States, and I feel that, for this reason, we will not turn the two new countries into third-class Member States."
"All the less so for the fact that while the EU is lecturing Romania and Bulgaria, two countries with European traditions, culture and values, it is at the same time playing a dangerous game over the accession of Turkey, turning a blind eye to Turkey’s attitude to minorities, to democracy, to the plurality of faiths, to women's rights and to its own brutal history."
"I believe that these two most European of countries, Romania and Bulgaria will soon become fully-fledged EU Member States alongside the rest of us."
"I am very glad that both the Bulgarian and Romanian governments, on the one hand, and the European Union on the other, have reached a consensus following constructive negotiations on the conditions for Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession to the EU."
"As an MEP representing Slovakia, a country that joined the EU just two years ago, I am pleased that on 1 January 2007 Rumania and Bulgaria will become members of the European Union, and I fully support their accession."
"It is also my wish that no one in the Union will regard these new Member States as inferior, and that their sound economies and democratic institutions will continue to show robust growth."
"Regarding the shortcomings that have often been mentioned in connection with these countries, I would like to focus on Romania’s new legislation banning international adoptions."
"International adoption is both a global and ethical issue."
"Trafficking in children under the mistaken notion that this is in the interests of the children is unacceptable in the European Union."
"A state which trafficks in its own citizens, who represent its future potential, is playing into the hands of organised international crime."
"Such a state must revise its priorities, and should do so not only on paper but in actual fact."
"It should think hard about the means for achieving these goals."
"The selling of children amounts to a counterproductive waste of a country’s potential, undermining the very meaning of family support."
"As a full member of the European Union with all of the rights that ensue from such membership, Romania should be in a position to take care of its citizens from the cradle to the grave, as the Romanian Prime Minister put it last week."
"It is necessary to improve social work and to train qualified professional staff for adoption counselling in Romania, as well as simplifying adoption within the country."
"Despite several well-known problems concerning the implementation of this law, I consider its enactment to be a very welcome step in the right direction."
"This law can undoubtedly be regarded as complying fully with the standards for European legislation."
"Our Romanian and Bulgarian friends are warmly welcome here!"
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, a long period of discussion is slowly coming to an end in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on these two countries, whose accession to the EU we have supported from the outset."
"We should bear in mind that we had concerns about many accessions, yet all of them turned out to be political and economic successes."
"They turned into a win-win situation."
"There are also several transitional rules for the benefit of both sides, to enable accession to take place without great controversy from the point of view of the EU. Examples are rules concerning the free movement of workers, and the fact that border controls on persons have not yet been lifted, since these countries are not yet members of Schengen."
"Whilst welcoming the new States, however, we must make it clear that each enlargement only works if the rules are observed."
"The Commission’s statement today that benchmarking and monitoring processes are in place to resolve the issues of legal systems, corruption, money laundering and organised crime, is very important."
"We shall then have to wait and see whether, if the need arises, these are actually used."
"The same goes for the legal conditions and controls for the Structural Funds and agricultural funds, and also for the opening of the foodstuffs markets."
"The Commission bears a great deal of responsibility at this time, because only if this works and the Commission makes credible use of its mechanisms will the future of the EU be assured, and only then can we think about future enlargements, too."
"It is extremely important that we welcome these countries, but also that both sides comply with the rules, so that we are not faced with serious problems at the end of the day as a result of failure to do so."
"For this reason, I shall be monitoring very closely the way in which the Commission makes use of the possibilities it has mentioned today in practice."
"The last thing I want to say is that the Constitutional Treaty was drawn up for the Union of 25, or rather of 27 following this enlargement to include countries that suffered so unspeakably under Communism."
"It is not the size of the EU that will enable it to play a role in this world, however, but only its inner strength."
"Size is not an indication of strength."
"I should like to remind the House at this juncture, therefore, that the EU has not yet done its homework."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner Rehn and the staff of DG Enlargement, in particular Timo Summa and Mrs Bridget Czarnota, deserve our thanks for the very professional and dedicated manner in which they have conducted their work in regard to Bulgaria over many months and years."
"There is no doubt that Bulgaria and Romania have been subject to a degree of scrutiny probably unparalleled in EU history."
"The reasons for this are not just related to the countries concerned but are also a reflection of the growing scepticism about enlargement in certain political quarters."
"This is a pity."
"Enlargement is, I hope, a vehicle for reform and change in the European Union."
"I very much welcome the Commission’s confirmation that Bulgarian accession should take place on 1 January 2007."
"Postponement would have served no useful purpose."
"At the same time, we are under no illusions that much remains to be done."
"Continuing reform is needed in Bulgaria, not just because of EU accession but for the sake of Bulgaria and its people."
"The key word now is ‘transparency’ in every sector, whether it is public procurement, the appointment of officials and magistrates or whether it concerns the reasons why a particular investigation is suddenly stopped dead in its tracks."
"Citizens need to have confidence that those in authority are acting openly for them and in their best interests."
"Of course, many measures are still being put in place by the Bulgarian authorities."
"I particularly welcome the recent announcement that the services of the Dutch former Prosecutor General have been enlisted to assist Bulgaria’s own excellent Prosecutor General and I would encourage other countries to come forward with similar assistance."
"On the subject of migration of workers, many of our countries, not least the United Kingdom, have seen the consequences of a decade and more of failed and catastrophic immigration policies, largely unrelated to the European Union."
"It is a pity that Bulgaria and Romania may now suffer the consequences of this."
"It has been a colossal task for Bulgaria to recover from the effects of 50 years of communism."
"Now we see a stable democracy, a buoyant economy, 5% growth, record foreign direct investment, a factor of regional stability and a contributor to NATO."
"Well done Bulgaria – and welcome!"
"."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of Mr Moscovici, our rapporteur for Romania, who is, unfortunately, unable to be here at this important moment in time."
"Allow me to start by extending warm congratulations to both countries on the conclusions which the Commission presented today on Romania's and Bulgaria's accession date."
"I should like to extend a warm welcome to both countries, but to Romania in particular."
"After everything that has happened, that country’s history, 50 years of dictatorship, 15 years of hard work, it is now being rewarded by the European Union in the shape of membership."
"My group has been consistently in favour of both Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession."
"It is the different governments, not just the current ones but also previous ones, that have generated the dynamism in Romania which has, in turn, led to the Commission reaching its conclusion."
"It is an enormous achievement on the part of both countries, and an historic day in Bucharest and Sofia, in Bulgaria and Romania."
"I am also pleased with the President of the Commission’s remark that on the basis of permanent progress those two countries have made, it can now be decided against using this delay option, but simply to make a start on 1 January of next year."
"The Commission has indicated that there is plenty of scopefor it to cooperate with these two new Member States in ensuring that the outstanding issues will be carefully resolved in the next few years in a process of verification and cooperation between it and them, on the basis of clear and precisely formulated goals to which both the Commission and the two governments will commit themselves."
"The treaty provides plenty of guarantees that the Commission will be able to ensure that the EU’s interests will be protected in that process."
"A year’s delay would probably have meant that both sides would no longer make the effort and it would lead to automatic membership of some sort."
"Instead, the progress and dynamism present in both countries is now being drawn on in order to get what is left of the accession process out of the way in a thorough manner and to clear the desks as quickly as possible."
"In short, congratulations, and thanks, to the Commission, thanks to Commissioner Rehn for all the work he has done over the last few years and congratulations once again to Romania and Bulgaria."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"– The next item is the report by Camiel Eurlings, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on Turkey's progress towards accession [2006/2118(INI)] (A6-0269/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, we are bringing to the final debate this report on Turkey at a special moment."
"This report is preceding the European Commission’s progress report, and therefore provides a unique opportunity to influence and enrich the stance of the European Commission."
"This does not mean, however, that there would be so much need to influence the Commission on this point, because the report as I have presented it to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and as I present it now here in this sitting, has been prepared in very good cooperation with the European Commission and with Commissioner Rehn himself."
"I also think of Mr Rehn’s words when I presented the report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, words of welcome which were very clear."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the report by a large majority: 54 votes to 6."
"The report has been described as fair but tough: fair because it is based on facts and is constructive; tough because, unfortunately, there is reason for criticism of at least a strong push from Parliament."
"The basic conclusion of the report is that we, as the European Parliament, regret that there is a slowdown in reforms."
"We had expected at the start of the negotiations in 2004, when we made a decision, that the impressive reforms of 2002-2004 would continue."
"Unfortunately they have slowed down."
"That is not to say that nothing has happened."
"I compliment the Turkish politicians on their ninth package of legislative reforms and the many proposals that were adopted by Parliament."
"I also compliment the Turkish officials for their professional work in the negotiations so that the first chapter could be provisionally closed."
"So why then is there criticism?"
"Because we would have liked to have seen more progress in the mainstream of further political reforms."
"I will mention a few vital areas."
"Firstly, on freedom of expression, we as a Parliament have already criticised some parts of the new penal code."
"Although it was a big improvement, some articles raised doubts – Article 301, first and foremost."
"Some people have been set free."
"However, the reconfirmation of the sentence of Mr Hrant Dink proves, as Ali Birand, the famous journalist, also stated so clearly, that Article 301 has to be changed or repealed."
"I ask the Turkish Government and the Turkish people to see the need for this."
"It is important for the freedom of the Turkish people, it is important for the image of Turkey in Europe and the wider world."
"Second, a lot needs to be done as regards freedom of religion."
"I was in Turkey a few weeks ago."
"Until recently, monasteries and churches have been taken away, and the new proposed law on foundation, as the Commissioner said, is not good enough."
"So please let this stop."
"Give back the properties to the religious minorities and change the proposal of the law on foundation so that if they cannot be given back, then at least there is a good compensation for the minority churches."
"Also, the training of clergy must resume."
"Since 1971 seminaries are closed, and for a country that wants to be European, it is very important that it should be as easy to build a Christian church in Turkey as it is to build a Turkish mosque in the rest of the European Union."
"We said we want priority for these reforms because that is the European spirit."
"We ask it as a Parliament, and Turkey signed, in the revised accession partnership, a commitment to achieve the short-term priorities before the end of 2007, and then we as a Parliament asked Turkey to do what was agreed."
"A third situation that worries us is the situation in the south-east."
"We strongly condemn the PKK and any terrorism."
"We strongly condemn it – there is never any excuse for terrorism; but at the same time we ask Turkey to try to find peaceful interlocutors, try to find a political way and invest in the social and economic development of the south-east."
"A last major point: Cyprus."
"It was agreed at the start of negotiations that there would be no formal recognition ceremony by Turkey of Cyprus but that there would be an Ankara Protocol as a kind of normalisation of relations."
"The protocol was signed, the Council asked for it to be implemented before the end of 2006, and it is now a matter of credibility – also for the credibility of our institutions – that Turkey fulfils its commitments and implements a protocol before the end of 2006."
"As a Parliament, we also make it very clear that we want to see more efforts in the northern part of the island in terms of trade regulation."
"But once again, Turkey cannot just sign up to this: it should do what it promised to do."
"I shall finish with one last point – I shall try to make it short."
"There was a vast majority in the committee for the basic line of the report and I thank the Members for it because with it we are giving an important signal."
"There was unease, however, because of an amendment on the Armenian genocide."
"Allow me in two sentences to make my position clear."
"In paragraph 50 of the report, as rapporteur I tried to put forward a position that is both strong but also realistic."
"It says that recognition as such is formally not a criterion, but for a country on its road to Europe it is indispensable to come to terms with its past and therefore we want committees, research, open discussion."
"I think that is a line that is strong but fair and beyond criticism."
"I know that, with an amendment from Mrs De Keyser, another text has been voted in as well."
"It is of course the responsibility of every Member of Parliament to vote as he or she pleases, but if you ask for my opinion, the text in paragraph 50 is the best text and the one that takes us the furthest."
"I have been speaking for too long."
"I want to thank Members once again for their support up till now and I just want to say that I hope, as the rapporteur for Turkish accession, that this signal – a tough but fair signal – will be perceived by Turkish politicians and the Turkish public as an encouragement to restart the reform process, to vigorously support those people who want it, so that I as rapporteur can be more positive in my next report than I have been here today."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Finnish Presidency, I wish to thank the European Parliament, and particularly Camiel Eurlings, for what is a comprehensive report on Turkey’s progress in the accession process."
"Every debate is a good opportunity for us to get to know more about Turkey’s accession process, to inspire both the citizens of the EU countries and Turkey to take an active part in this process, and to support the Turkish Government in its accession goals."
"Finland, the country holding the Presidency of the Council, will naturally take into consideration the views expressed by the European Parliament."
"In early November, the Commission will be bringing out its annual report on Turkey’s progress in the negotiations on its accession."
"The European Council will examine this report very carefully."
"In today’s debate, I would like to focus attention on a few points in those negotiations."
"The Presidency shares the European Parliament’s concern regarding the reform process in Turkey."
"Turkey must accelerate the implementation of political reforms and the reform process generally."
"Full and effective implementation is vital to ensuring that the reforms are permanent and ongoing."
"We need concrete results."
"We share Parliament’s concern regarding the slow progress that Turkey has made in the crucially important areas of fundamental freedoms and human rights."
"Although the situation in Turkey has improved compared with five years ago, the country needs to continue making tangible reforms, especially in the areas of freedom of expression, freedom of religion, cultural rights, women’s rights and action against torture and ill treatment."
"Most of these issues have been described as priorities in the Revised Accession Partnership, and Turkey must implement the appropriate action without delay."
"At present, the Presidency is awaiting the adoption of the Ninth Reform package regarding Turkish law, whose purpose it is to provide answers to some of the problems that I have just mentioned."
"The new laws must be fully compatible with EU standards."
"The Council expects immediate action from Turkey on the matter of freedom of expression in particular, in order to avoid in future the kind of legal action that has been brought against people who have expressed non-violent opinions."
"As regards religious freedom, we expect legislation on the rights of the non-Muslim minorities to be fully implemented without delay, in accordance with European standards."
"Like Parliament, we are concerned about the situation in South-East Turkey."
"The Presidency has condemned the recent bomb attacks in various places in Turkey, and regards them as senseless terrorist acts."
"Terrorist acts can never be justified."
"This is a multi-agency issue which we are following carefully as part of the reform process."
"Turkey quickly needs to evolve a comprehensive approach in order to reduce regional inequality."
"The aim here should be for Turkey to provide better opportunities for all its citizens, including the Kurds, and to strengthen the country’s economic, social and cultural potential."
"In addition to the Copenhagen criteria, Turkey’s progress in the accession process is being judged within the context of the requirements of the Negotiating Framework, which include the implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement."
"Progress here is essential for continuing the talks."
"Turkey must apply the Protocol fully to all the Member States of the European Union and remove obstacles to the free movement of goods, including transport restrictions."
"The initiation of talks fundamentally connected with this issue will depend on how Turkey discharges its contractual obligations towards the Member States."
"If it were to neglect these, this would have an overall impact on the progress of talks."
"Progress is being monitored with regard to all the essential issues which were mentioned in the declaration of 21 September 2005 by the European Community and the Member States."
"A spirit of enterprise and determination will need to continue if the European Union’s standards and membership requirements are to be met."
"This determination is not just required of the applicant country, but also of the Union itself."
"This is why I want to say very clearly that Turkey’s accession process is very important to us and the Finnish Presidency will do all it can to ensure that progress can be made in negotiations."
"The Union supports Turkey in its aspirations to membership, but progress in the accession negotiations obviously depends very largely on Turkey’s own actions."
"The accession process will continue while Turkey continues its process of reform and discharges its obligations accordingly."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I am sorry but, unusually in my case, I have to leave halfway through this debate, because I have a press conference with European Commission President Barroso at 4 p.m., 10 minutes from now, which I have to attend."
"Straight after that we are both leaving for Sofia, in Bulgaria, and Bucharest, in Romania, to communicate today’s decision and the content of Parliament’s debate to these two future EU Member States."
"I regret that I have to serve two masters, but the last debate overran slightly and I am afraid that I have no alternative."
"Mr President, in the previous debate Mrs Lehtomäki made a statement on behalf of the Council on the future of enlargement."
"Like President Barroso, I welcome the statement and reiterate the Commission’s commitment and our policy of a consolidated enlargement agenda, which covers south-eastern Europe apart from Bulgaria and Romania."
"It covers Turkey and Croatia and the other countries of the western Balkans."
"We are cautious about any new commitments, but we stick to our existing commitments to the countries of south-eastern Europe. They have the prospect of joining the European Union once they meet the conditions, as promised for the countries of the western Balkans at the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003."
"While we prepare internally for a new institutional settlement, the gradual and carefully-managed accession process continues with these countries of south-eastern Europe."
"We cannot take a sabbatical from our responsibilities for peace, stability, liberty and democracy."
"We expect the EU Member States to be able to agree on a new institutional settlement in 2008; hence the new institutional settlement should have been born by the time the next member is likely to join."
"If Croatia, which is likely to be the next new member, pursues reforms with rigour and results, it should be ready to join the Union around the end of this decade."
"Let me thank Mr Eurlings for his report, which includes useful elements for the assessment of Turkey’s progress towards accession."
"I also thank the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee for their contributions."
"Turkey’s accession is a matter of constant debate."
"It is true that the momentum for reform has slowed down in Turkey in the past year."
"However, we should not lose sight of the progress accomplished in the last decade, nor of our commitments towards Turkey."
"The goal of the negotiations started on 3 October 2005 is full EU membership of Turkey, and by its very nature it is an open-ended process with no automatism."
"This commitment stems from a solid understanding that integrating Turkey into the EU is of mutual benefit."
"In its own interest, the European Union needs a democratic, stable and increasingly prosperous Turkey."
"Turkey’s strategic significance was once again illustrated by its decision to take part in the UNIFIL mission in Lebanon."
"In the past twelve months, there has been a lack of progress in the reforms."
"It is important that new initiatives are taken and that tangible progress is still achieved before the Commission presents its report on 8 November."
"First, freedom of expression is the cornerstone of the reforms."
"Journalists, authors, publishers and human rights activists still face judicial proceedings for violations of the notorious Article 301 of the Penal Code on the vague grounds of ‘insulting Turkishness’."
"In July, the final ruling of the Court of Cassation in the case of Hrant Dink established jurisprudence on that notorious Article 301, which violates European standards."
"Thus, despite the acquittal of novelist Elif Shafak last week, freedom of expression remains under threat in Turkey."
"The judicial proceedings have a chilling effect and damage the important work carried out by journalists, intellectuals and activists."
"I have repeatedly expressed my concerns about this, most recently last week to Foreign Minister Gül."
"Frankly, I am rather tired of repeating myself endlessly, but I shall continue to do so until the end of my term, unless this shortcoming is corrected."
"I cannot even imagine a Member State in the European Union which does not respect such a fundamental principle as freedom of expression."
"It is now high time for Turkey to amend the restrictive articles in the penal code and bring them truly into line with the European Convention on Human Rights."
"This matters also as regards the internal debate on Turkey to which the rapporteur, Mr Eurlings, referred."
"An open and constructive exchange of views is needed in Turkey, including the most sensitive issues."
"That is necessary both for the democratic process in Turkey and for facing tomorrow’s challenges, as well as for Turkey’s reconciliation with its neighbours, including Armenia."
"Reconciliation is a principle that is both the origin and the outcome of the European integration process."
"I therefore urge Turkey to continue to take concrete steps in that direction."
"Secondly, with regard to freedom of religion, I fully agree with the rapporteur and the Council on this important matter."
"The Law on Foundations currently debated in the Turkish Grand National Assembly should address the shortcomings."
"Restrictions applied to property rights, management of foundations and training of the clergy must be lifted."
"There are also Muslim minorities that face discrimination."
"The Alevi, a community of 15 to 20 million people, face legal restrictions on establishing places of worship and receive no financial support from the State religious authority."
"In the south-east, the spiral of violence undermines positive developments witnessed since emergency rule was lifted some years ago."
"Terrorism is our common enemy."
"Turkey and the EU unequivocally condemn the PKK, and I deeply deplore the loss of innocent lives in the attacks that have taken place throughout the year in Turkey."
"However, a policy based merely on security considerations is not sufficient to address the problems of the region."
"The south-east faces an aggravated socio-economic situation, due not only to security threats but also to high unemployment and poverty."
"We expect Turkey soon to adopt a comprehensive strategy targeting all the needs of this region: economic, social and cultural."
"Let me turn to the obligations which Turkey needs to respect."
"We expect Turkey to implement fully the Additional Protocol of the Ankara Agreement."
"That means that Turkey should remove obstacles to the free movement of goods, including those on means of transport, which are in breach of the Association Agreement."
"Hence Turkey should open its ports to vessels under flags of all Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus."
"As set out in the Negotiating Framework, progress in the negotiations also depends on Turkey meeting its obligations."
"Let me reiterate that Turkey’s obligations under the Ankara Protocol are not linked to the ending of economic isolation of the Turkish-Cypriot community."
"The draft report rightly calls on the Council to make renewed efforts to reach an agreement on the trade facilitation regulation concerning the northern part of Cyprus."
"The Commission fully supports the serious efforts of the Finnish Presidency to overcome the stalemate on the trade regulation, thus helping the Council and the EU Member States to live up to their commitments."
"It is also appropriate to underline the continuation of the constructive commitment by Turkey in finding a comprehensive settlement on the Cyprus question, acceptable to both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, based upon the principles on which the EU was founded."
"To conclude, it is in our mutual interest for Turkey to pursue its democratic, societal and economic transformation with the goal of joining the EU."
"If Turkey succeeds, with our consistent support, it can become an ever-sturdier bridge between civilisations, at a moment when the relationship between Europe and Islam is the greatest challenge of our time."
"Turkey is an important benchmark in this regard and it matters for our own future and for the future of our children and grandchildren."
"While the Commission is prepared to support Turkey through the process, it is ultimately up to Turkey to carry it forward."
"The extraordinary parliamentary session convened last week to accelerate the adoption of the ninth reform package is a welcome step in the right direction."
"Yet a more resolute reform process is needed for Turkey to progress on the path to EU accession."
"In this process, we should remember that – as Prime Minister Erdogan suggested – the Copenhagen criteria should be called the Ankara criteria, since they are there, in the first place, for the sake of Turkish citizens and their rights, not merely to please the EU."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Eurlings for his hard work; it has not always been plain sailing."
"Unfortunately, the report as it now stands has, on account of the opponents of Turkish accession to the EU, become a cause for disappointment for many of us, including reform-minded Turks, those Europeans who want Turkey as an ally, and not least women in Turkey."
"As rapporteur for women’s rights, I have seen that Turkey is definitely making headway in the area of women’s rights, partly as a result of pressure from the EU in general and the European Parliament, in particular."
"The enlargement strategy is effective in encouraging reforms in candidate states, but it only works if those reforms are also recognised."
"As Mr Eurlings’ party in the Netherlands likes to put it, ‘we need sweet after sour’, in other words we need light after dark."
"The Eurlings report fails to recognise Turkey’s achievements to date."
"It is negative, not only in terms of substance, but also in its tone."
"That is a sure-fire way of sabotaging reforms in Turkey by undermining public support for them and by equipping Turkish eurosceptics with a powerful weapon for the forthcoming elections in Turkey."
"What we really want, surely, is for that criticism to be translated into action, for that will benefit everyone."
"We could turn things on its head and mention reforms that have been successful, acquaint ourselves with the first steps that Turkey has taken in order to come to terms with its past and promote further attempts, but I urge you to remove acknowledgement of genocides as a condition for membership, for that does not form part of the Copenhagen criteria and has, in all fairness, never been put to any of the other Member States."
"All references to a privileged partnership should be deleted, for the objective of the negotiations is that a reformed Turkey should become a Member State."
"If these changes are made, we can keep the Turks in Europe, welcoming this secular state with its Muslim people as our ally in the fight against terrorism and extremism."
"If we fail to implement these changes, we will leave reformers in Turkey, millions of men and women, simply out in the cold."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know if the previous speech represented a personal opinion or the opinion of the committee responsible."
"I should like to extend the warmest of thanks to Mr Eurlings for the very well-balanced report he has presented."
"A good deal of the criticism expressed by one or other group today has been raised by members of the group for the first time in this report."
"This, too, should not be forgotten, for example in connection with the issue of the media."
"It is important to establish that the negotiations are under way and that both sides need to contribute constructively to these."
"We agree that the prospect of EU membership should be extended to Turkey, but we need to make it clear – as the Commissioner also said – that the pace of the reform process has slowed since 3 October."
"It is right and necessary to point this out, and to do so on the basis of a number of specific questions relating to human rights, minority rights and freedom of expression and religion."
"It is also important to make it clear that these are the preconditions for progress."
"Parliament stated in a decision at the start of negotiations that the political criteria should be met at the start of negotiations and not at the end."
"A number of things about this debate are bothering me – this is almost a problem of mentality – for example, that it is not permitted to mention facts in case this is taken as a criticism or misinterpreted in Turkey."
"Such negotiations cannot be conducted unless the facts are indeed mentioned."
"Only then can we make progress."
"After all, our job is to take our citizens with us on this path."
"If the conditions are not met and the facts are not clearly stated, we have a problem."
"Only those who meet all the criteria, including the political criteria and the preconditions for the negotiations, can join the EU."
"This means that implementation of the Ankara Protocol must be set in motion once and for all, an endeavour that has failed up to now."
"The Cyprus issue must be resolved this year, as stipulated, and cannot be postponed further, as to do so would mean no one taking us seriously any more."
"Incidentally, it must also be stated that the EU’s capacity to cope with enlargement is of vital significance."
"This also means that the financial perspectives under the negotiating mandate do not permit negotiations on the chapters with financial implications any earlier than 2013."
"That, too, should be made clear, as these provisions in the negotiating mandate show that the EU currently lacks the capacity to cope with enlargement in view of its financial possibilities."
"."
"Mr President, today finds us debating a topic that concerns us all, namely negotiations with Turkey and Turkey’s future in relation to the European Union."
"Turkey is a key partner in a crucial region."
"It is, now more than ever, evident that we must tie Turkey to the European Union and that we must support the reformers in that country."
"Turkey has committed itself to an operation by the United Nations Force in Lebanon."
"In that respect, we must assist Turkey to play a positive and constructive role in that region."
"We need a partner there as a matter of priority."
"The negotiation process is the best way of developing a better and stronger relationship with Turkey, and, while we know that the negotiations will take some time, we remain of the opinion that a critical, yet constructive, dialogue is the best way of bringing that process to a successful conclusion."
"Consequently, this House’s reports must be balanced and should not lose sight of the end goal, namely membership."
"We must build on the progress that has been made in recent years, whilst acknowledging that delays have hampered that progress."
"Our group has tried, by means of a series of amendments, to make the report more balanced in a number of areas and, in response to what Mr Brok said, our group should not, of course, automatically accept what the Committee on Foreign Affairs produces."
"The process is not served by speculation about alternative forms of association; that is our permanent objection to Article 71 in the report."
"We should leave you in no doubt about that."
"The negotiations are being held with a view to full membership."
"That is, fortunately, something that is clearly formulated in the Eurlings report, on which we are agreed, and I am in no doubt as to Mr Eurlings’ intentions in that respect."
"What is clear, though – and I share Mr Brok's view on this – is that the present institutional frameworks will be unable to cope with the accession of new Member States following the accession of the two we have been discussing today."
"That too has, fortunately, been clearly spelled out in the Eurlings report: without the necessary reforms in the framework of the institutional process, we will not accept any further decisions about enlargement."
"I will now turn to the two key points in the report."
"First of all, with regard to the Armenian genocide, I share the view which Mr Eurlings has adopted in this respect."
"After all, the compromise that we had struck in the negotiations is namely exactly what we need. It is an appeal to the Turkish Government to recognise this genocide, and to have a good internal debate in Turkey, but without stipulating this as a condition for EU membership."
"I hope that tomorrow, we will manage to remove this section from the report."
"This whole issue does not, strictly speaking, form part of the Copenhagen criteria, and that is how it should stay."
"Finally, as for Cyprus, we agree that the Ankara Protocol needs ratifying."
"At the same time, we also think that we should do something to help the Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus more."
"This evening, our group will again be discussing the voting list and, on that basis and on the basis of tomorrow’s vote, we will pass our final judgment."
"."
"Mr President, I certainly agree with Mrs Bozkurt and Mr Wiersma that the resolution at present gets the balance wrong."
"Parliament’s special role inside the accession process is surely to promote the growth of parliamentary democracy in Turkey."
"Our criticism should be constructive, designed to encourage Turkey’s path to modernisation and not to block it."
"We are correct to stress the existing impediments to freedom of expression, but we should not put up spurious blocks to the continuation of the process that we have started."
"We must pace the reaction, try to be consistent and, above all, be fair, especially on Cyprus and Armenia."
"Turkey’s candidature is a defining moment for the Union."
"Should there be a train crash in Cyprus there would be two trains involved."
"One of them carries the efforts of Turkey to create a viable form of European Islam, where the Prophet meets the Enlightenment."
"The success of that mission will drag both Islam and Christianity far away from the terrible certainties of the 14th century."
"The second train carries European efforts to develop a strong common foreign security and defence policy, a task towards which Turkey will make an extraordinary contribution."
"Perhaps the involvement of Turkey’s troops under French command in Lebanon will prove to be a turning point in the life of CFSP and a welcome sign of things to come."
"Membership for Turkey will be a two-way process."
"."
"Mr President, I have a big problem with the Eurlings report as it stands."
"I am not talking about the many critical paragraphs in which the Turkish Government is urged to do more and to implement reforms more quickly."
"An appeal has been made, with good reason, to the Turkish Government to remove the infamous Article 301, which has led to dozens of trials involving writers and journalists, from the criminal law as quickly as possible."
"The problem I have with the report is the few paragraphs where the report is losing total control, particularly the paragraph in which the recognition of the Armenian genocide is considered as some sort of condition for accession, and the Cyprus paragraphs, in which Turkey appears to be the only guilty party."
"The original report, as submitted by the rapporteur, was critical, yet fair, and we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs have managed to reach sound agreements during our discussions, which means that the report can be improved with many amendments."
"Where we went wrong is that in the closing stages of those discussions, clauses were added to the report by means of all kinds of oral amendments, which brought imbalance to a previously balanced report."
"Whilst this may have been a huge success for a number of lobby groups, this has considerably changed the report for the worse."
"What we want, what my group wants by tabling a number of amendments, is actually to return to the original Eurlings report, which was, in our view, both critical and fair."
"I am therefore pleased to hear and also read in the interviews with the rapporteur in the Turkish press that he, on the basis that ‘a fault confessed is half redressed’, is prepared to support the attempts to restore the report to its original form."
"I will therefore be counting on his support during tomorrow’s votes."
"Why is it so important that the report should be critical and, at the same time, fair?"
"I very much want the European Parliament to continue to play a role in the reform debate in Turkey by supporting those groups and those people who, day in and day out, are fighting for the same things that we are."
"It is those very people who in the last few weeks have come up to us and told us that this report, in its current form, is of no use to them."
"It is only benefiting those in Turkey who are opposed to reforms, and I do not want to see Parliament helping those people who do not want Turkey to move forward."
"If that report does not change, if that report stays in it current form, then that means that we are taking ourselves out of the equation, because then all the valid points made in the report will no longer be taken seriously, and that is not how I see Parliament’s role."
"That is why the changes are necessary, and I am counting on your support and on that of the rapporteur."
"I really hope that the majority of this House is prepared to choose this path: constructive, critical, yet fair, rather than the of the report as it currently stands."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has voted in favour of opening negotiations with Turkey, but we believe that those negotiations must centre on respect for human rights and democracy, and that such respect must be indissolubly linked to the political and diplomatic solution to the Kurdish question."
"Last week, I took part in the Subcommittee on Human Rights’ visit to Turkey, and I have come back with a very different impression to the one I had hoped for."
"In particular, we found a tragic situation in Turkish Kurdistan, that is, it was a completely militarised zone."
"It is one thing for us all to condemn terrorism, but it is quite something else to regard an entire population as terrorists, to imprison minors merely for giving the V-sign, to persist with the logic of torture and to dismiss those judges who, for example, investigate police officers held responsible for an attack."
"We, as Parliament, must support the DTP’s call for a ceasefire and we must call on the PKK to respond positively to that appeal."
"We must call on the Turkish Government to begin immediate talks with the DTP with the aim of reaching a political solution, as there is no other possible alternative."
"However, the problems do not just concern the Kurdish issue: we were all delighted with the solution reached regarding Elif Shafak, just as we were previously with the one regarding Orhan Pamuk, but there is a danger that this is window dressing just for the West: there are at least another 80 writers and journalists who are standing trial under Article 301."
"At the same time, the Turkish Parliament has approved the anti-terrorism law in its original wording, despite opposition not only from Europe, but also from the United Nations."
"Furthermore, we have been able to ascertain that, in Hakkari Province, which is also in the Kurdish area, 7 000 out of the 250 000 people living there are village guardians, and so we have a situation where a police force – the disbandment of which the European Union has been requesting for some time – is directly answerable to the government."
"The commitment that we are asking Parliament, the Commission and the Council to make is to continue down the road of holding talks with Turkey, but with a focus on human rights and not just on ideological debates or economic interests."
"We believe that the future can bring a Europe that is multi-ethnic and multi-faith, but there must always be respect for everyone’s human rights."
"– (PL) Mr President, it is true that the tone of the report on Turkey is cool in many places but that is what makes it honest."
"For over 40 years, this country, which is applying for European Union membership, has had an antagonistic attitude towards its neighbours, which include European Union Member States."
"It is also our right and obligation not only to demand explanations for past injustices, but also to demand that Turkey address the deteriorating situation involving infringements of the human rights of the Christian minority in Turkey."
"This minority can only depend on us to take up its cause."
"In this context, one cannot fail to mention the scandalous statements made by representatives of the Turkish Government in relation to the lecture given by Pope Benedict XVI in Regensburg."
"By pandering to the extreme sections of Muslim public opinion, this government has taken two steps backwards."
"In spite of this, we should not turn our backs on Turkey."
"However, I am sure that forms of cooperation other than membership can bear economic and political fruit."
"It should also be stressed that significant imbalances remain in our attitude towards future enlargements."
"Significant progress has been made in the political process towards Turkey’s membership of the European Union, whereas the process towards Ukraine’s membership has been put on hold, although it is not Ukraine that loses 250 cases at the Court of Human Rights each year."
"It is not Ukrainians who apply to us for asylum in their droves."
"It is not Ukraine that perpetuates tensions with its neighbours as a result of current and past conflicts."
"As long as this imbalance in political relations remains, Ukraine will remain confined to the straitjacket thrust upon it 60 years ago as a result of the decrees passed by Stalin's Communist Russia."
"."
"Mr President, the report that Mr Eurlings has written is an informative one, and prompts two questions to the Council and Commission, concerning the phenomenon of the so-called ‘deep state’ () and the complete lack of freedom of religion in the Republic of Turkey."
"Anti-European forces in Turkey are teaming up in intransparent state structures, nationalistic circles in the army, police, gendarmerie and security services."
"To what extent do those forces, summed up under the heading of ‘deep state’, hamper the present accession negotiations?"
"There are persistent speculations to the effect that this self-same ominous ‘deep state’ is linked to the killing of the Italian priest Andrea Santoro in Trabzon in February of this year, and that brings me to the altogether humiliating position of the Christian Church in Turkey, the clergy and lay members of which are considered to be foreigners."
"In fact, contact between churches and government is made via the Foreign Affairs Ministry."
"I should like the Council and Commission to take action on this score."
"Or does the fear of Islamic mobilisation in Turkey make you reluctant to insist on full freedom of religion in the land of Atatürk?"
"– Mr President, we are now paying the price for the fact that, in Turkey’s case, the Commission has been turning not just one, but often two blind eyes."
"Turkey’s reforms need only exist on paper for us to celebrate supposed progress."
"For example, the implementation of an obligation to adopt international human rights conventions that has been incumbent on Turkey for more than 50 years by virtue of its membership of the Council of Europe was celebrated as a great success in 2004."
"In 1999, the European Council decided that the Copenhagen criteria had to be met before the start of negotiations."
"In addition, further political conditions have been laid down in connection with the Greece/Cyprus conflict."
"As if it were not enough that the Commission has been very generous in its interpretation with regard to Turkey thus far, now the deadline for the recognition of Cyprus is to be extended once again, in the vague hope that Turkey may yet meet it."
"Turkey is dismissing the demand that has now been made for it to actually meet the criteria as politically motivated and unrealistic, and seems to regard Parliament’s decision as non-binding."
"As is typical of Turkey, it is even asking MEPs to kindly show political sense and thus to continue to paper over the cracks."
"Reality looks rather different, however, namely that Turkey is simply still not ready to join Europe."
"There is no real recognition of Cyprus, no real sense of any wrongdoing with regard to the Armenian genocide and no real willingness to treat the Kurdish people properly."
"There can be only one answer to this – which, incidentally, citizens across Europe have been giving for a long time – we should give every possible support to the forces for reform in Turkey, but say a clear ‘no’ to the accession of Turkey to the EU."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to focus above all on one aspect of Mr Eurlings’s report: the dialogue between religions."
"This is a subject currently under the spotlight throughout the world on account of recent events, the polemics that have arisen, the attention given to Pope Benedict XVI’s words in Germany and the reactions in the Islamic world."
"A very important meeting took place yesterday, which demonstrated how important a constructive and positive dialogue between representatives of different religions – between Christians and Muslims – is for all of us."
"The meeting was based on the principle of reciprocity, according to which both sides have the right to uphold their own ideas, to defend their own values and to be able to manifest their own faith; this applies to Muslims in areas where Christians are in the majority, and to Christians where Muslims are in the majority."
"The Turkish ambassador was also present yesterday at Castel Gandolfo for a meeting with the Pope."
"They spoke at length about these issues, and therefore I believe that Benedict XVI's forthcoming visit to Turkey will be fundamentally important."
"It will be an important trip because, in my view, it will encourage dialogue between Christians and Muslims, between the Muslim majority and the Christian – Catholic, Protestant or Orthodox – minority living in Turkey."
"That is why, with Mr Eurlings and Mr Tannock, we have tabled an amendment and are putting it before the whole Chamber, including the other political groups. Its aim is to encourage dialogue between Christians and Muslims, between Christianity and Islam, through a strong message from this Parliament."
"Let us exclude extremism, let us isolate fundamentalists, and let us hold a dialogue with those who truly want to build peace in the Middle East and Africa."
"To conclude, helping the reforms and encouraging dialogue between Christians and Muslims are in Turkey’s own interests."
"The progress that that country is making on its journey towards the European Union can be measured principally by the results achieved in the dialogue between religions, in respect for minority rights, and in respect for the civil rights of everyone living in Turkey."
"– Mr President, I should like to endorse what Mr Tajani said."
"We certainly agree with him on the great importance of interreligious dialogue, especially between Christian religions and Islam."
"It was for this very reason that we objected to the Pope’s statements."
"Nevertheless, I appreciate both his apology for the statement in question and the initiative agreed yesterday with the ambassadors of Islamic countries to revive this dialogue."
"It is for this reason, in particular, that it is so important to us that Turkey have the prospect of membership – have a path towards EU membership – as this is a means of lending support to this dialogue."
"Turkey is also important to us as a strategic partner in the Middle East peace process, which can undoubtedly be promoted appropriately by means of Turkey’s path towards EU membership."
"Nevertheless – and on this point I agree wholeheartedly with the rapporteur, Mr Eurlings, to whom I am obliged for his efforts – we must give criticism where criticism is due."
"Years ago, I myself was a Parliament rapporteur."
"I am delighted that the process has been continued, that we are negotiating with Turkey, that some changes have indeed been made in that country."
"On the other hand, however, I am disappointed that Turkey has made insufficient progress on a good few issues."
"One example is freedom of expression: although many authors are acquitted, the scandal is that they are prosecuted for their opinions in the first place."
"That is unacceptable and must be prevented."
"Regarding the Kurdish question, as has already been said, no one in this House has any sympathy for terrorism, and the PKK should declare its lasting support for the peace process once and for all."
"The Government must do its part to promote peace, however – economically, socially and politically."
"It must detach itself from those forces – the military and the security apparatus – that do not want peaceful dialogue – particularly with regard to the Kurdish question."
"In this respect – even though there are a few more things we should like to change – the rapporteur has certainly been at pains to make it clear that we do want Turkey to take the path towards EU membership, but that is why we shall not dispense with our legitimate demands – including in Turkey’s interests – as the greatest beneficiary of the process of reform is not the EU, but Turkey itself."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a mystery about the Eurlings report."
"But it is not the one people say."
"It is not the harshness or hardening of the report."
"In fact, when you read this report you find that it repeats what we have, quite rightly, always said."
"It says that human rights and freedom of expression are not adequately respected in Turkey."
"It says that religious minorities do not have the right to own property, to publish and to teach that they have everywhere in the European Union."
"It says that when you join a club the least you can do is to shake hands with all the members and not to behave in a warlike manner towards any of them."
"Finally, it says that there has been an Armenian genocide and that nothing will be built without acknowledging that genocide, and there is nothing new in that."
"We said it in 2004, we asked for acknowledgement of the genocide in 2004 and in 2005 we said it had to be a precondition."
"Failure to adopt paragraph 49 would be a climb-down on Parliament’s part."
"The real mystery, however, the real mystery of the Eurlings report is its consistency."
"Here is an institution that continues, several years later, to say what it said before."
"In the climate of general degeneration of which Daniel Cohn-Bendit spoke so critically a few moments ago, that is a strange thing."
"It is strange that here and now we should be saying that what we said yesterday must remain at the centre of our concerns."
"The mystery of the Eurlings report is that we find, for the first time in the history of negotiations, that we have a State that regresses before accession and not afterwards and that tells us accession must be on its terms and not ours."
"The mystery of the Eurlings report is that, unlike the Commission in its report on Bulgaria and Romania, this institution has decided to tell the truth, to tell it as it is, to speak the facts, and while I know - Guy Béart said it some time ago – that the first person to tell the truth must be executed, I hope that will not be the case with Mr Eurlings and his report, which I wholeheartedly support."
"– Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur for his endeavours to capture the mood in this House and form it into a majority."
"Nevertheless, I believe that the decision by the Committee on Foreign Affairs tends to be the enemy of the good."
"I should like to demonstrate this using two examples."
"The first is the point that my fellow Member has just raised towards the end of his speech: the Armenian question."
"I attended and spoke at the conference on the Armenian question in Istanbul that many are now describing as ‘historic’."
"It was the first conference of its kind, discussing all questions on this subject – including ones by the harshest critics – in Istanbul."
"The participants in this conference, from Taner Akçam to Halil Berktay to Hrant Dink – who is currently fighting a running battle with Article 301 – all asked me to tell this House explicitly that anyone wishing to assist the debate in Turkey should not make recognition of the genocide a precondition for membership of the EU."
"For this reason, I should like to make the following appeal to my fellow Members: anyone wishing to help the debate continue, anyone wishing to make a contribution to change in Turkey, should listen to the voices of the opposition in the country."
"I want to see the border between Turkey and Armenia resemble the border between Germany and France one day, but this will require our help."
"My second point is that, on the Cyprus issue, too, we all agree that Turkey must keep its side of the bargain and implement the Ankara Protocol."
"There is also a political aspect to the obligations, however, and this concerns the fact that the people in the north of the island of Cyprus, the Turkish Cypriots, are waiting for us to keep our side of the bargain and put an end to the economic and educational isolation of the people living in the north of the island."
"Turkey must implement the Ankara Protocol, but we must also help put an end to the isolation of the people of Turkish origin in the north of Cyprus."
"– Mr President, in order to proceed smoothly on its road towards accession, Turkey needs to do the same as the previous candidate countries and comply with its contractual obligations, such as opening up its ports and airports to Cyprus's ships and aircraft and lifting its veto on Cyprus's participation in international organisations and multilateral treaties."
"Its continuing refusal to do all this constitutes clear infringement of the association agreement, of customs union and of the additional protocol, which are its contractual obligations towards the European Union."
"As such, Turkey is wrong to link them with the Cyprus problem."
"Nonetheless, the proposal by the Cypriot government for common use of the port of Famagusta under the aegis of the United Nations, with simultaneous monitoring by the European Commission, combined with the return of the fenced off area of Famagusta to its legitimate residents, may help to overcome the present impasse."
"We, the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus, are working for the resolution of the Cyprus problem and for respect for the human rights of all Cypriots, both Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. We are not seeking to put obstacles along Turkey's path towards accession."
"At the same time, however, we cannot condone infringement of Turkey's contractual obligations towards the European Union at Cyprus's expense or accept the lack of respect for human rights of all the inhabitants of Turkey and the refusal to acknowledge the genocide of the Armenians."
"To conclude, we cannot understand the thinking behind the amendments which aim to absolve Turkey of its obligations."
"This sort of thinking is unnecessary and will lead us into unwanted complications."
"Thank you, Mr President, the name is the European Union."
"Mr Erdogan, do you perhaps have a map?"
"That is how easy it is to answer the question of whether Turkey should be accepted into the EU."
"Turkey is not a European country, and as such Turkey cannot be a member of the European Union."
"The Heads of State or Government of the EU have promised Turkey that it can, on certain conditions, become an EU member, but those Heads of State or Government do not have the backing of their peoples in so doing."
"Two thirds of European citizens do not want Turkey to become a member, and the Heads of State or Government will ultimately be compelled to defer to their wishes if they wish to maintain the trust of their electorates."
"Mr Eurling’s report is an excellent illustration of how the citizens of the EU base their opinions on facts and not feelings."
"I would like to recommend voting in favour of the report, regardless of the fact that some of the wordings in it can be construed as meaning that we regard Turkey’s accession as an objective, albeit one still far from being realised."
"The government of Turkey has demonstrated again and again that it does not recognise European values, whilst at the same time demanding that we should respect unacceptable Turkish and Islamic values."
"We saw this in the case of the famous Danish cartoons of Mohammed in the newspaper and also in the Turkish outcry against Pope Benedict’s speech in Regensburg."
"Turkey illegally occupies Northern Cyprus and believes that it can force the EU to accept this situation."
"Turkey wishes to stifle Europe’s freedom, our freedom of speech, and membership would mean the formation of a parallel society opposed to European culture."
"It is time to speak the truth."
"– Mr President, Europe has a long history of relations with Turkey."
"Unfortunately, this history consists almost entirely of painful events and acts of injustice."
"It is a history of constant invasions, wars, massacres and the occupation of central and southern Europe."
"These were the events experienced by Europeans for centuries."
"Today, little has changed and Turkey continues to threaten its neighbours."
"Turkey is still enforcing an illegal embargo on Armenia and threatening Greece, questioning Greece's right to define the limits of its own territorial waters."
"It is still discriminating against the Kurds and refuses to acknowledge the full independence of Cyprus, which is a Member State of the European Union."
"This situation is preposterous."
"Turkey poses a threat to stability in this region and we, seemingly blind to this fact, are engaged in negotiations with that country with a view to it achieving membership of the European Union."
"Turkey also fails to respect values that we view as inalienable."
"It violates and infringes human rights and freedoms and restricts access to them."
"It persecutes political opposition groups, including the family of Leyla Zana, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament."
"Turkey also restricts religious freedom, and this led to the killing of an Italian missionary."
"This is the whole truth about Turkey."
"I do not agree that Turkey can play the role of a bridge between Europe and the Muslim world."
"On the contrary, I think that Turkey could become a gateway for terrorism."
"Turkey is part of a world that is alien to us in terms of its culture and traditions."
"We have to acknowledge this fact and ask ourselves: , Europe?"
"Should the Union be European or Eurasian?"
"Accepting Turkey into the European Union will set a dangerous precedent that will spell the end of Europe as we know it today."
"Accession negotiations with Turkey should cease as soon as possible."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr Erdogan, has strongly criticised the speech made by the Pope at Regensburg University, a speech based on religion with a grounding in theology, not politics."
"The fact that it was the Prime Minister and not a Turkish religious spokesman who criticised the Pope shows that the sacred and the secular – politics and religion – are still unacceptably mixed together in that country."
"The separation to which we are accustomed in our European Union does not exist there."
"This mix-up is a further reason why Turkey should not join the European Union, even though the main reason will never be eliminated, which is that Turkey must not join the European Union because it is not geographically in Europe."
"– Mr President, may I start by congratulating Mr Eurlings on his excellent work and on his report."
"I shall, of course, take this opportunity to repeat that we are in favour of Turkey's European prospects."
"In essence, the Eurlings report is not only a warning, a message to Turkey about the steps it must take and the obligations it must honour in order to continue on its path towards Europe."
"It is also, at the same time, confirmation of the principles upon which the European Union was built, principles from which we have an obligation not to deviate because, when Mr Eurlings speaks of respect for human rights and for minority rights, he is reiterating a European principle."
"The same applies when he speaks of institutional reforms, the same applies when he speaks of a peaceful resolution to differences and the same applies when he calls for the signature of the Ankara protocol to be honoured and for this protocol to be applied immediately."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every country, every nation that forgets or does not come to terms with its history, will at some point have problems."
"Thus, paragraph 50 referring to the tragic history of the Armenians, the Greeks of Pontos and the Assyrians, does precisely that."
"It calls on Turkey to do so."
"This paragraph is the outcome of broad agreement and must remain as it stands."
"Consequently, it must not be changed in one direction or another with amendments that have been tabled."
"Finally, I wish to remind all those who consider the report to be excessively strict, that there are in Turkey democratic citizens who want a modern Turkey, a developed and progressive Turkey which looks towards Europe and who are fighting for that against the well-known establishment."
"They need a message which we shall give them by voting for the Eurlings report."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the assessment of Turkey’s progress in the EU accession process should focus more on the content of the assessments relating specifically to the Copenhagen criteria and the dossiers relating to the ."
"I shall avoid introducing distractions – new criteria that do not help a process that is already in itself difficult and requires us to be transparent, consistent and objective."
"In that respect, I agree with paragraph 50, as proposed by the rapporteur, on the Armenian genocide issue."
"This country plays a crucial role in a geopolitical area that runs from the Mashreq to South-East Asia and the Caucasus."
"That leads us to support the efforts of all those who are working for a democratic, peaceful Turkey."
"Having said that, we must be strict in our judgments and demand that the Turkish Government, together with all its state machinery and institutions and Turkish society, make a serious commitment to those areas in which progress has to be more significant and constant."
"Those areas include civil, political and social rights, freedom of expression and, particularly, the rights of minorities, primarily those of the Kurdish minority and of women, who are in fact in the majority."
"We hope for a firm condemnation of terrorism and the implementation of the Ankara protocol by the agreed deadlines."
"To conclude, let us try to keep to the point and to be credible and effective in continuing to positively influence internal developments in this country and its external role in establishing peace and stability in an explosive region where the most serious threats to peace are concentrated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who have voted for opening negotiations with Turkey have already, on several occasions, explained the good reasons for achieving its accession in the near future, so there is no need for me to repeat them."
"This annual debate on progress made is, however, a gauge that specifically records the reforms that have been achieved and the mood of public opinion, and I think we can all see that there has been increasing coolness on both fronts in recent times."
"We are against arranged marriages: to get married you have to know each other and love each other, and that applies to Turkey’s ambitious goal as well."
"The Turkish Government must therefore work harder at its reforms and at spreading the message within its own society."
"The report is very stringent in this respect, but it is only fair and right that the negotiations should be stringent and fair."
"There is growing scepticism in Europe, however, about further enlargement after Bulgaria and Romania if the rules are not changed."
"This scepticism is also likely to involve the Western Balkans."
"We must therefore not stop enlargement but rather promote reform of the rules."
"The question about Turkey is, in fact, also a question about ourselves and what we want to be."
"Mr President, last week, together with other colleagues from the Subcommittee on Human Rights, I was in Akari province in the extreme south-east of Turkey, just a few mountain peaks away from Iraq and Iran."
"In that region we met parents, desperate parents powerless to stop their young sons leaving for the mountains."
"We were told that more than 200 young men have joined the armed bands of the PKK in the last few weeks."
"We also met young girls fighting against family feudalism, fighting against economic and social isolation and everyday violence."
"Many spoke of young girls committing suicide."
"It was not hope, let alone enthusiasm for the future, that we found in Akari and elsewhere."
"There are many extremely precise facts bearing witness to the violence of the security forces, including against farmers, but also to extra-judicial arrests and the torture of young people as in Diyarbakir this year."
"The forced resignation of the public prosecutor of Van for demonstrating the responsibility of army members for the Semdinli bombing was also very traumatic."
"Quite apart from the dirty war exploits it reveals, the frustration of the independence of the judiciary is unacceptable."
"Everyone says, everyone knows, there is no military answer to the Kurdish question, and yet, with its checkpoints, tanks, soldiers and armed assaults it is the only one that seems effective."
"The PKK must call a unilateral ceasefire."
"If that call is heeded and kept, as we hope, it will have to be followed by a wide-ranging political proposal."
"The attention and support of the European Union will be crucial."
"The deteriorating situation in the south-east is affecting the human rights situation in the country as a whole."
"The anti-terrorist legislation was unanimously criticised by the non-government people we spoke to."
"It does not comply with international law."
"It may even cancel out some of the progress made in the latest legislative reforms."
"The situation in the south-east is also rekindling a nationalism that is clearly and sometimes violently opposed to democratic aspirations."
"The writer Magden Perihan talks about a forest fire."
"She speaks of hooligan lawyers."
"Immediate action is required, in particular the abolition of Article 301 of the penal code, bringing anti-terrorist legislation into line with international law, the fight against impunity – in 2005 only 2 out of 305 accused policemen were sentenced – the compensation law must be put into effect – 2 000 cases out of 3 000 have been processed in Akari province – and, lastly, the 10% national voting threshold must be abolished, since it prevents popular democratic expression."
"– Mr President, we members of the Greek Communist Party will be voting against the Eurlings report."
"Firstly, because we are against the accession of Turkey to the European Union for the same reasons that we were against the accession of Greece, not for cultural reasons."
"Secondly, because this report – like others before it – are like rubber."
"They adapt every time depending on the objections in the European Union, sometimes appearing to be stricter and sometimes more lenient."
"Thirdly, because on serious points at issue concerning Turkey's stand on issues of international law, the report is no more than a wish list, repeating the same wishes without, however, proposing any specific measures, such as to deal with the presence of 40 000 Turkish occupying troops in Cyprus and the fact that Turkey is provocatively ignoring UN decisions and resolutions, culminating in the refusal to recognise the Republic of Cyprus."
"We therefore ask: between the previous report and now, has anything specific been done in these sectors?"
"No, Turkey continues to provocatively ignore all these decisions and you continue along exactly the same lines."
"Fourthly, because we radically disagree with the indirect reference to paragraph 51 on border difficulties between Greece and Turkey and with the Helsinki conclusions referring them to the International Court ..."
"Mr President, let me say at the outset that, as a member of the European Parliament’s High Level Contact Group for relations with Northern Cyprus, I am clearly aware of the sense of isolation the Turkish Cypriots feel in light of the rejection of the Annan Plan."
"In fact, I believe that the European Union, together with the United Nations, should continue to work to build peace and reconciliation on the island of Cyprus."
"However, Turkey too has serious obligations."
"For example, Turkey must open its ports and airports to Cypriot ships and aeroplanes."
"This is an obligation that Turkey will have to honour in accordance with the accession negotiations."
"I also feel that Turkey must consider repealing clause 301 of its Penal Code, which is being used to charge dozens of Turkish writers with insulting Turkishness."
"It is clear that significant efforts are needed in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey."
"These are serious issues."
"In conclusion, I must stress that they have to be effectively addressed by the Turkish Government sooner rather than later, because these policy matters are an intrinsic element of accession negotiations."
"Mr President, why on earth does Turkey want to join the European Union in the first place?"
"Perhaps it wants to join the mass ranks of the parasite nations that already live off the backs of the British and German taxpayers."
"Perhaps it sees an opportunity to export some of its unemployed and criminals to Britain."
"But the Turks should think about the impact on their own society."
"Only yesterday, the Turkish Army Chief of Staff, General İlker Başbuğ, warned of the dangers posed by Islamist extremists politicising religion, and pledged that the Turkish army would protect the secular nature of the Turkish Republic."
"But in the past the Turks have not had to contend with the European Union."
"They may find that their Islamist extremists are able to exploit the EU’s non-discrimination, equality and human rights legislation to their advantage."
"Perhaps the Turks will have to learn the hard way that membership of the European Union means losing control of your own destiny."
"Mr President, the commencement of negotiations with Turkey was an historic mistake, for the European Union, as the name suggests, is a European project."
"Now we have to stand by idly and watch the whole thing go wrong."
"Turkey is an Islamic country with a predominantly authoritarian and patriarchal culture."
"The best thing for the EU to do is to demonstrate who is the boss in the negotiation process, but the fact is that, for the moment, the opposite appears to be the case."
"Turkey refuses to observe its obligations in respect of Cyprus and even dares demand that Europe should break through the so-called isolation of the occupied part of Cyprus."
"Turkey is calling the shots."
"The Commission and Council have given the European electorate to believe that the negotiations can be suspended at any time if Turkey fails to cooperate."
"They are now wriggling every which way not to have to act."
"First, they tried to get the European Court of Justice to pronounce judgment on the issue of Cyprus; now they want to organise the negotiations in such a way as to ensure that the sensitive chapters do not feature until the end."
"All this is being done in order to play for time and to be able to say afterwards that there is no turning back."
"Where is the EU’s credibility in all of this?"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is excellent."
"We endorse it, because it marks a turning point in terms of Parliament’s becoming aware of the reality of the relations between Turkey and the European Union."
"The report is the most critical of all those that have been produced in this House over the last few decades."
"In particular, it includes three points that are of decisive importance to us: the reference to the European Union’s absorption capacity as a criterion; the crucial need for Turkey to treat Cyprus, a full member of the European Union, normally; and the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite for accession."
"I must point out to my fellow French Members from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament that that was part of their programme for the 2004 European elections."
"The adoption of this report – and we do want to see it adopted – must have political consequences."
"I would begin by asking the Commission to stop playing hide-and-seek and to produce, on 8 November, an authentic report and not a children’s story, as it is wont to do in this area."
"I would ask the Council of Ministers to take a clear-sighted and courageous approach to the situation and to think about breaking off negotiations, as they make no sense these days to the average person."
"Aside from the case of Turkey, it is the entire enlargement process that is at stake."
"From now on, no further enlargement should be embarked on until we have provided the European Union with effective decision-making mechanisms and with a sufficient budget."
"Pressing on in a state of illusion and hypocrisy would compromise the European project, that is to say the construction of a political union, and would further widen the gap between the common sense of the people and the blindness of the leaders."
"– Mr President, it has been said that the Socialist Party in the European Parliament has done a u-turn regarding its position on Turkey."
"Let me remind you of our position, which has been clear since the start."
"Our long-term aim is to have Turkey join because we believe – and this is a genuine political project – in a Europe that is multicultural, secular but multi-faith, peaceful and open to the rest of the world."
"While we, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, have sent out clear signals to Turkey regarding, in particular, human rights, women’s rights, minority rights and the recognition of Cyprus, we have done so in the same constructive spirit."
"We have done so in order to give concrete expression to a fledgling Europe that will not be the Europe that Mr Sarkozy, Mrs Merkel or probably the Pope want."
"The challenge is immense and it has already come up against a problem in the shape of the Eurlings report, the new draft of which is unbalanced."
"This report rightly stresses that the democratic process currently under way in Turkey is not progressing as quickly as we had hoped, but it overlooks some crucial progress made by Turkey, particularly in the area of foreign affairs."
"I am thinking of its role in UNIFIL and also of the fact that it stayed out of the war in Iraq."
"The aim of the amendments tabled by the PSE Group was thus to make some adjustments or, in other words, to soften the tone."
"On the subject of Armenia now, Mr Eurlings heckled me just now, and I should like to make myself very clear."
"Parliament has recognised the Armenian genocide, and there will never be any revisionism in this Chamber."
"We have a duty to remember the one and a half million Armenians who were massacred in 1915, that is to say before the Turkish Republic under Atatürk was born."
"We have a duty to remember not only in Europe, but also worldwide, and that is why we have asked for the UN not to delay in sending a committee of international experts on this matter to Turkey."
"Yet, to use this tragedy, as some people are doing, in order to thwart Turkey’s candidature, or to half-open the door to a vulgar form of Islamophobia, is a trap that we do not wish to fall into."
"That is why, after some very difficult debates, after – I can assure you – some highly sensitive negotiations within my group, we have taken the line that you have heard on various occasions and that I will make my own."
"I can assure you that it is a difficult line: we will not demand the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite, but, ladies and gentlemen, it is nonetheless quite clear that, when the time comes to review the situation prior to accession, this sensitive point will weigh very heavily in the balance, and Turkey knows it."
"For the time being, we expect Turkey to fulfil this duty to remember, to consolidate its stabilising role in the Middle East and to make progress in relation to …"
"Mr President, our European Union exists because it is firmly based on strict adherence to our European principles and values."
"Those principles and values are not negotiable and that must be clearly understood by all those who belong to the EU and by those wishing to join."
"Turkey is welcome to join our Union and I very much hope that it does, but it must accept and abide by our European principles and values."
"It is Turkey that must achieve the required accession changes, not us, and we must be honest in making our position clear to Turkey."
"We should not try to trick Turkey into joining the EU."
"Turkey must do so only if it really wants to and in full awareness of exactly what is demanded of it."
"The Eurlings report makes that clear, firmly and honestly."
"The Eurlings report is the result of much discussion and debate and many compromise amendments have been voted in by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, finally achieving a much-desired balance."
"Please support it and resist attempts to introduce any amendments on key issues at this stage, which is likely to cause more harm than good."
"Let me remind some of my colleagues that we will bring about reforms in Turkey by telling the Turkish people the truth and not hiding the truth from them."
"The June List’s representatives in the European Parliament voted against the proposal to begin accession negotiations with Turkey."
"Our ‘no’ vote was motivated neither by a belief that Turkey is located outside Europe nor by the fact that it is a Muslim country."
"We pointed out that Turkey still has a long way to go before it meets the requirements we set for membership of the EU."
"We also expressed our fears that commencing negotiations would reduce the pressure on Turkey to establish a democratic state under the rule of law with full human rights for women, Kurds, Christians, trade unions and writers."
"This has proven to be the case."
"Earlier promising developments have come to a halt and, in some areas, have been replaced by retrograde steps."
"We now find ourselves in a shameful situation in which the EU is beginning to set requirements for the design of the electoral system and a new constitution in the sovereign state of Turkey."
"That is not the EU’s job."
"It is up to Turkey to choose how to meet the EU’s requirements."
"It is up to Turkey to choose its own solutions."
"The accession negotiations should be put on hold while we await adequate reforms."
"– Mr President, our discussion on the subject of Turkey is obviously far more critical and therefore significantly more open than on previous occasions."
"However, we should remember that we ought to ask ourselves where our fundamental interests lie."
"On the basis of all the key membership criteria, which do not need to be reiterated, Turkey is not fit to be a member of the European Union."
"We have mentioned the question of Cyprus, human and civil rights, religion and the Armenian community."
"However the European Union’s fundamental interest lies in countries such as Turkey or Ukraine moving closer to it."
"In this respect, the European Union has not been entirely honest."
"We have not stated openly that the accession of countries such as Turkey will, in fact, put an end to certain European Union policies, notably its economic, structural and agricultural policies."
"We should state openly what effects the accession of these large countries would have on the European Union, given that this slight dishonesty is not lost on our partners, including Turkey."
"– Mr President, Turkey is not a European country."
"Its accession would overstretch, overstrain, weaken, perhaps even endanger the EU."
"Anyone who says so exposes himself to the accusation of refusing to support the process of reform and push the criteria through."
"Yet even a privileged partnership requires that the Copenhagen criteria be met and the reforms be driven forward, particularly in the interests of the Turkish population itself."
"We must ask ourselves critical questions."
"Those who want Turkey to have full membership are perhaps looking for a different Turkey, but will find only a different EU – a free-trade area garnished with political elements. As far as Turkey itself is concerned, we must ask ourselves the following questions."
"Is secularism really compatible with democracy if it is just a minority, an elite project? Is freedom of religion really compatible with state-controlled Islam in the guise of secularism?"
"Are minority rights really compatible with Kemalism, which is a kind of Turkish Jacobinism?"
"These are all serious, well-founded questions that we need to ask ourselves. We must stop running down a blind alley at whose end may lie a rejection of Turkey’s accession by the Member States and peoples of the EU, with dire consequences for Turkey’s inner stability."
"We owe it to Turkey – particularly because it is an important partner – to be honest and to draw up decent criteria for a sound, tailor-made partnership that accords with the interests of both Turkey and the EU, instead of constantly painting our own picture of Turkey, which bears not the slightest resemblance to reality."
"For this reason, we must take care not to fall below the line taken in the Eurlings report, which I rejected in committee as I did not believe it went far enough."
"This line should represent our consensus, however, otherwise the signal sent to Turkey would be disastrous."
"– Mr President, in December 2004, with 402 votes in favour, this Parliament took a clear decision to open accession negotiations with Turkey."
"This sent out a clear signal."
"Today we are debating the report on Turkey’s progress towards accession, a report whose intention should actually be constructive monitoring of negotiations with Turkey and of its accession process."
"It strikes me, however, that this Eurlings report tends to lose sight of our objective – Turkey’s membership of the EU."
"I ask myself what we want, therefore."
"Is it for Turkey to continue on its reform path – in which case we should treat it fairly – or are we saying that whatever it does it will never become a member of the EU?"
"Our Turkish partners are confronted with an assortment of bad examples."
"The progress achieved and good examples are almost completely ignored."
"This is not fair treatment."
"It is true that Turkey needs to do further work on its process of reform."
"It is also true that it needs to comply with its obligations under the Ankara Protocol: human rights, democracy and protection of minorities are preconditions for EU accession."
"If Turkey meets the criteria already laid down and continues to drive forward its process of reform, we, too, must hold to the goal of EU membership."
"That should be upheld in our report."
"I would consider this a very clear signal."
"If the rapporteur or Parliament disagrees, that must be stated in a report on Turkey, otherwise half-truths such as these will diminish Parliament’s credibility."
"We took a decision in Strasbourg in October 2005 to open accession negotiations with Turkey, and we must hold to it today."
"I have always said that Turkey was not yet ready for accession, but was ready to start negotiations."
"Europe should show understanding and solidarity in acknowledging and supporting this."
"– Mr President, I am really surprised at this discussion."
"Anyone would think that there had been only a very narrow majority in favour of the Eurlings report in committee."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament endorsed the report, however."
"It was adopted in committee with 54 votes in favour."
"The same Socialist Group – Mrs De Keyser, Mr Wiersma, both highly respected Members – is now completely opposing what it supported recently in committee."
"That surprises me greatly."
"I should like to say to Mrs De Keyser that this is not what I understand by ‘clarity’."
"We must ask ourselves some critical questions, the most important of which is whether we have taken the people with us on this enlargement tour, this negotiating tour of Turkey."
"The answer is a clear ‘no’."
"The people are very critical of it."
"I am addressing this explicitly to the Commission and the Council, too."
"Where do we think this discussion on the EU’s capacity to cope with enlargement has come from?"
"Where do we think this change of attitude in Parliament has come from?"
"All of us here discuss this issue with citizens fairly frequently, and we sense the scepticism, reticence, and in some cases even large-scale rejection of Turkey’s accession."
"This is also the reason for my warning to the Council and Commission that no new commitments should be made, no new prospects extended, until the EU has been reformed."
"We all agree on one thing: we need institutional progress."
"I should like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
"– Mr President, problems cannot be solved unless they are addressed."
"Glossing over the issue never does any good."
"Mr Eurlings describes very precisely the aspects connected with Turkey that run contrary to the spirit of Europe."
"I should like to thank him for his report."
"In fact, virtually no progress has been made there in almost all the politically relevant fields – and in some cases the situation has even deteriorated."
"Not a single one of the political Copenhagen criteria has been met to date."
"Nevertheless, against all the rules, negotiations were opened."
"What we feared last year has come true."
"By opening accession negotiations, we have let go of one of the last means of exerting pressure to force reform."
"The process of reform has petered out."
"Either governmental bodies have failed to implement at all or failed to implement properly reforms that had already been decided on, or – as happened recently – such reforms have been withdrawn by parliamentary decisions."
"For example, the Turkish Parliament adopted the new Anti-Terror Law despite vehement protests from the Commission, resulting in a further curtailment of the already limited freedom of expression and of the press."
"The Prime Minister of Turkey is using the EU process for his own ends and attempting to Islamise the country by stealth."
"By doing so, he is playing into the hands of the nationalists, who vehemently oppose Europeanisation."
"Does Prime Minister Erdoğan even want the country to join the EU?"
"At all events, his refusal to recognise Cyprus underlines the fact that he does not accept the EU."
"Is this kind of candidate acceptable?"
"Cyprus is a litmus test."
"If Turkish politicians do not give way on this, the negotiations must be discontinued."
"Turkey is now under obligation – without any ifs and buts and without imposing any new conditions or demands."
"The Commission must make this a mission, and the Council of Ministers, too, must demand the fulfilment of and enforce Turkey’s obligation at long last."
"Anything else would be unfair to the Turkish people, who are pinning their hopes on us."
"It is only our pressure that will effect change."
"If we Europeans fall down again, we shall be forever a laughing stock that no one can take seriously."
"Then nothing will change in that country."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be a serious mistake in Euro-Turkish relations for us either to play down the significant progress which has been achieved by exaggerating the bad things about Turkey or to paint an idyllic picture by concealing the truth."
"There are forces in Europe following one opinion or the other for reasons of their own."
"However, with post-enlargement fatigue and the institutional crisis in the European Union, we do not need to add contradictory messages to Turkey."
"It is time for our message to be clear and in keeping with the decisions adopted."
"We need to welcome the ninth reform package adopted by the Turkish Government as a positive element."
"However, if we look at it in essence, it does not meet European specifications."
"In fact, the statement by the deputy prime minister of the Turkish government, Mr Mehmet Ali Sahin, in the Turkish Daily News, that his government does not intend to allow the Halki Seminary to reopen is a cause of anxiety and concern."
"The demands of the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul and the demands of the Greek minority in Imbros and Tenedos remain unresolved, I fear."
"As Commissioner Rehn said earlier, the principle of international law must be respected."
"This of course applies to Turkey, but it also applies to the European Union."
"We need to remain constant in our support for Turkey's strategic objective of accession to the European Union."
"At the same time, however, Turkey should immediately ratify and apply the Additional Protocol by the deadline in question."
"The road to Europe may guarantee the stability and development of Turkey."
"However, Turkey will need to overcome past phobias and syndromes."
"The syndrome of the Treaty of Sèvres."
"That is why I believe that reconciling with history must not be a source of insecurity and risk."
"It is an indicator of the democratic maturity and self-confidence of a country."
"The call for the traumatic history of clashes with the Armenians and the Greeks of Pontos to be acknowledged should not have a destabilising effect for the national stereotypes of Turkey."
"Our specific amendment does not impose new preconditions on Turkey."
"We are against the acknowledgement of the genocide of the Armenians and the Greeks of Pontos as a political prerequisite."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report and this debate are, in my view, a sign that Europe is closing in on itself."
"Some Members are at least brave enough to say it more openly: they regard Europe as a religious entity and area, which means that political Europe is dead."
"I thought, instead, that the dream – the inspiration, the creation and the dream of a federalist Europe – was precisely to expand the area subject to the rule of law and democracy."
"That is the great offer that we should be making to Turkey and, just at a time when Islamic fundamentalism is rising throughout the world, we should insist on it and put it in practice in a report to speed up the accession process."
"In that case the criticisms, including the severest ones, might make sense."
"In fact, different solutions are obviously presenting themselves here: not Turkey’s full, political accession, but rather enhanced cooperation agreements, all things that in themselves do not have the strength of the political message or of full accession."
"If we follow that path – which, unfortunately, was also suggested by President Barroso in his statement yesterday – we shall bear the responsibility not only for pushing Turkey away, but also for pushing away political Europe."
"Mr President, the stated EU position and that of my party is to support Turkish EU membership."
"But nevertheless, no one can under-estimate the challenges it poses in terms of Turkey’s absorption into the EU, with its very large population and hence the political influence it will gain by joining the EU, its relative poverty and therefore demands on the structural funds, as well as its distinct and separate cultural and religious identity."
"Given the current discussion on large-scale immigration, and in particular the challenges faced by integrating the existing Muslim minorities in our countries, a major concern inevitably will be unrestricted freedom of movement of Turkish workers."
"Turkey’s membership of the Organization of the Islamic Conference countries will certainly complicate the CFSP."
"Recent Marshall Fund of Germany polls in Turkey have shown it to be the most anti-American and anti-Israeli country amongst EU and candidate countries; but more worrying in my view is large Turkish support for theocratic Iran."
"Turkey will of course have to abide by all the economic, political and human rights clauses of the Copenhagen criteria before joining, and there are clear examples of continuing discrimination against Christian minority rights, including the Greek Orthodox and Syriacs, and ongoing impediments to free speech, such as Article 301 of the Penal Code prohibiting insulting Turkishness."
"In my view, failure by Turkey to come to terms with its past, including the 1915 Armenian genocide and the blockade of the Republic of Armenia, is deeply regrettable."
"But non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus, where Turkey continues to station troops since the 1974 invasion, and the failure to implement the Ankara Agreement on the enlarged customs union to allow Cypriot ships to dock at Turkish ports, is currently a critical issue before the European Union."
"Neither is it true that torture has completely stopped, in spite of it being banned by the State; it is still allegedly being used against Kurdish insurgents, and we have heard about that from Mrs Flautre."
"We can therefore be sure that EU accession negotiations will be very lengthy, and I for one fully support the Eurlings report."
"I would like to thank Mr Eurlings for his report."
"We in the Swedish Social Democratic group are in favour of Turkish membership once the criteria we have had for everyone else have been met."
"We should not set higher requirements for Turkey or subject it to special treatment, as has been suggested in this debate today."
"Right now, it is the EU that is the guarantor of progress in Turkey, not only through the encouragement we provide, but also through our demands in relation to issues such as human rights."
"A former MEP, now a Social Democrat member of the Swedish Parliament, has written to the Turkish ambassador in connection with the fact that 1 200 children’s books by Swedish children’s authors, used by Swedish schools and funded by the Swedish International Development Agency, Sida, and the Olof Palme Center, were stopped by Turkish customs."
"I find this unfathomable and I have therefore put a question to the Council in this regard."
"I support democratisation in Turkey and problems such as this one need to be solved."
"I share the critical views on the report expressed by the other speakers from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"Let us encourage progress and solve the problems but stand firm on the fact that we in the EU wish to see Turkey as a member when the time is right and the democratic deficit has been rectified."
"Mr President, Commissioner Rehn speaking to the Committee on Foreign Affairs said, inter alia, that the momentum on reforms has been lost, the Penal Code punishing the expression of opinion remains in place, there are reports of interference by the military in the judiciary, there are restrictions on the property rights of non-Muslim religious foundations and the human rights record in south-eastern Turkey has deteriorated."
"That is the essence of the matter and of the Eurlings report."
"Some Groups wish to table amendments to redress the situation."
"How?"
"By introducing a dozen amendments against Cyprus, in the view that this is the way to redress the balance."
"Are we helping Turkey if we encourage it not to extend the Protocol by introducing conditional linkages?"
"Are we helping Turkey if we delete the paragraph asking for the withdrawal of Turkish troops?"
"Can you imagine what would happen if Turkey voluntarily withdrew some troops from Cyprus and how much it would be in Turkey’s favour?"
"Or what would happen if we were to delete the paragraph asking Turkey not to veto the participation of Cyprus in international organisations and so forth?"
"Furthermore, we are restricting the two leaders in Cyprus, who have already agreed on working methods in the search of a solution, by indicating to them the basis of talks which neither of them has raised as a precondition."
"Does that help Turkey?"
"I do not think so."
"Finally, as regards our moral duty towards the Armenian community in Europe, we must demand recognition of the Armenian genocide."
"– Mr President, failure to integrate Turkey into the European Union will deepen the mistrust between the West and the Muslim world, strengthen fundamentalist tendencies and revive the doomsday prophecies predicting a clash of civilisations."
"Turkey should carry out the necessary reforms and face up to its own past in the same way as other European countries have done and continue to do."
"However, the European Parliament cannot set accession criteria for Turkey that are based on historical and moral factors if such criteria were not applied to other countries applying for European Union membership."
"We are burdened by a particular political responsibility."
"I would like to draw your attention to the latest public opinion polls and surveys of the views of the European elite carried out by ."
"According to these polls, ‘Turkey has cooled toward the United States and Europe but warmed toward Iran’."
"At the same time, ‘these trends are not reflected in the more critical attitudes in Turkey’s younger generation which has the most positive attitude towards both’."
"Let us not waste this pro-European potential!"
"Mr President, I spent last week in Turkey with members of the Human Rights Subcommittee."
"We were there to evaluate progress on human rights issues and the effects of reforms on the ground."
"On balance, Mr Eurlings has done an exceptional job in producing a tough but fair report on the story of Turkish accession so far."
"On the Armenian issue, I believe that it should be mentioned in the report, but it should not be introduced as a new precondition for membership, as we should remain committed to the original criteria if we are to stay credible."
"I am supportive of the principle of Turkish accession, but recognise that it will be a long, hard road."
"We need to send a clear message with this report that, while EU membership is achievable, it will require significant and sustained commitment to reform."
"The two human rights concerns on which I wish to focus briefly are freedom of expression and the ongoing Kurdish issue, which needs a new approach."
"On freedom of expression, despite reform packages – and we are now on the ninth – journalists and writers are not free to comment openly and critically on Turkey or its government members."
"Article 301 of the penal code remains in place to punish those responsible for ‘a public denigration of Turkishness or State authorities’."
"Prison terms of up to three years can be imposed."
"Up to 60 such cases are currently being brought against writers by the State Prosecutor."
"Despite the high profile case of novelist Elif Shafak, which was thrown out of court last week, self-censorship will continue to be forced upon the press until Article 301 is done away with entirely."
"On the Kurdish issue, a guerrilla war using terrorism continues in the south-east – a Kurdish area of Turkey – and must be condemned."
"PKK terrorism and the massive military response in the south-east are inflicting real hardship on the region and its population."
"A new approach is required that uses diplomacy and politics instead of force."
"Mr President, a year ago Labour MEPs warmly welcomed the opening of accession talks."
"We look forward to eventual Turkish membership of the EU."
"We understand that, now that the active phase of negotiations has started, Parliament needs to be frank about progress in its reports."
"There are serious problems, in particular with preserving freedom of expression."
"Further reform of security services and the judicial system and further progress in implementing new human rights legislation are essential."
"However, our criticisms must always be balanced, fair and honest, recognising achievements as well as shortcomings."
"The prospect of EU membership has already empowered modernisers and human rights defenders in Turkey to push for the necessary changes."
"We must give them our wholehearted support."
"We must not establish new preconditions for membership that were not applicable to other potential members and we must remain clear that negotiations are for full membership and that that is our only goal."
"An EU with Turkey as a Member State will entrench values of multiculturalism and understanding between different religions and therefore strengthen all communities."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Camiel Eurlings."
"He has done some excellent work and has drafted what is actually quite a bold report, which in its own way suggests that enlargement is taking place much too quickly."
"There is still so much to be done with regard to Turkey that we cannot even contemplate the idea of its membership in 10 years’ time."
"I was delighted to read in this morning’s newspaper that European Commission President Barroso has stated that it was unwise to continue enlargement before we had dealt with the matter of the Constitution."
"I totally agree with him."
"We cannot push for enlargement on such a large scale as would be the case with Turkey and at the same time see through the question of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"We should be listening a lot more carefully to public opinion and to the ideas of the people."
"When we recall what happened in the French and Dutch referendums, it would be better to take account of what the people think about this issue."
"We should also think about how far and how fast the EU can expand."
"If our citizens do not receive a reply to the question of how quickly enlargement is to take place, they will not be able to put their trust in the current EU."
"It is a pity that Commissioner Rehn has left."
"I would have asked him what Plan B is if rapid progress is made and Turkey is about to join the Union in some 10 years’ time and they have a referendum in France, for example."
"If the people say no, we will not be able to endorse Turkish membership."
"What is the plan, and how should we then proceed so as not to disappoint the Turks and stop the entire project collapsing because again there could unexpectedly be a NO vote in a referendum?"
"Perhaps, however, we will have the answer to this later on."
"– Mr President, the accession negotiations under way with Turkey should continue."
"Turkey should be treated in the same way as any country we have negotiated with in the past."
"The process of harmonising Turkish and European law will help Turkey to modernise and liberalise its economy and to move closer to the fundamental values on which the European Union is based."
"Turkey is a country that has taken on the incredibly difficult task of separating Islam from the structures of government."
"This Muslim country’s secular nature is worth fostering and is something that we should offer particular support to in a world where the extreme and fanatical face of Islam is manifesting itself with increasing frequency."
"Nevertheless, Turkey needs to know that it cannot count on receiving special treatment."
"Ankara cannot expect the Union to lower its standards or water down its laws and requirements based on the European treaties."
"I would particularly like to draw your attention to the issue of civil rights and liberties."
"It is not enough simply to change laws and legal provisions."
"The civil service and the judiciary need to pay constant attention to civil liberties, freedom of speech and religious freedom."
"Progress in this field will be judged on the basis of hard facts."
"Ankara must understand this and must not be offended by the fact that we will be asking questions, assessing the situation and checking that the rights of the Kurdish minority are respected, and that they enjoy the same rights as all other ethnic minorities in the European Union."
"These rights include being able to have their own Kurdish language schools at every stage of the education system, starting with nursery education."
"New anti-terrorist legislation must not be used to restrict civil liberties and discriminate against minorities."
"The European Union will also examine the freedoms enjoyed by Christians, who are still unable to reopen a seminary shut down years ago."
"If Christian schools are not allowed to operate freely, it will be impossible for Turkey to become a member of the European Union."
"Finally, although we may be discussing Turkey, let us not forget that it is equally important for Europe to open association negotiations with Ukraine in the future."
"– Mr President, as this debate draws to a close, I should like to remind the House once more that Mr Eurlings has presented a good, constructive report, even if it has not been seen that way and has been criticised in Turkey."
"The fact that the outcome of negotiations is open and that they could – and should, in my opinion – result in alternatives to full membership is nothing new, but rather the subject of discussion in the Council and Parliament."
"I would contradict expressly Commissioner Rehn’s statement here in his opening speech that he expects the conclusion of negotiations, and accession, by the end of the decade."
"That leaves less than four years."
"No one who wants to see Turkey become a full member is saying that it can join in its present condition – it has to make fundamental changes."
"Turkey must recognise and respect human rights, freedom of religion and minority rights."
"It must resolve the Armenian issue and actively recognise Cyprus."
"Does anyone in Turkey really believe that Turkey could join the EU whilst failing to recognise another full member?"
"An insider said recently that Cyprus would be recognised only when Turkey became a full member or voluntarily broke off the negotiations."
"If the EU, including the Commission, tolerates that, it will mean letting go of all our chances of holding Europe together."
"On the subject of freedom of religion, it is remarkable that the Turkish authorities – the deputy party leader, the highest representative of the religious authority, a State official – judged the Pope’s speech before even reading it."
"Pope Benedict XVI was compared with Hitler and Mussolini – an outrageous episode that shows and documents the intolerance and Islamism in the minds of the people with whom we are negotiating."
"In view of the burgeoning nationalism and the uncompromising attitude of the Erdoğan Government, I have considerable doubts as to the political will to actually cede sovereignty to the EU."
"That is why the Eurlings report is right and necessary."
"Turkey should see the advice and requirements as an opportunity rather than a threat."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this thorough and commendable debate has very clearly brought up the challenges and problems associated with Turkey’s accession negotiations."
"In addition, however, Turkey’s immensely important strategic role for the European Union has been made clear."
"In our role as the country holding the presidency, we will promote the talks on membership in accordance with the general principles of enlargement."
"These include the uniform treatment of applicant countries and progress based on their own merits."
"It is worth saying once again that the European Council confirmed in summer 2006 that it would adhere to existing commitments regarding enlargement, and the work continues on this basis."
"There are many challenges facing Turkey, but obviously the talks on membership support the continuation of Turkey’s reform process, and that is in the interests of everyone."
"One of the key issues is that Turkey should ratify and implement the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement."
"At present we are working hard to find a solution which on the one hand would allow direct trade between the European Union and North Cyprus, and on the other would ensure that Turkey also opened its ports to Cypriot vessels."
"At the same time as the accession negotiations are taking place, it is also important to find a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus question within the framework of the United Nations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for this worthy, dynamic debate."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the work he has done."
"It is obviously an important contribution."
"It is an extremely interesting assessment that will undoubtedly help to sustain the Commission report of 8 November."
"Even though we do not necessarily agree on everything contained in the report, I believe that it is important for Parliament to take up this issue and to clarify our own point of view by means of its contribution."
"The debate that has just taken place has, I believe, well and truly brought to light the issues involved in Turkey’s accession process, which began almost one year ago."
"The Commission will, of course, take account of this debate when it presents its own report on 8 November."
"That report will, as always, be rigorous, objective and uncompromising."
"It will be based on a wide range of information sources, including both official government data and the analyses of Turkish and other non-governmental organisations, or even of large international institutions."
"It will also take into account the reports drafted by the committees of your Parliament, as well as the Bozkurt report."
"I should like, Mr Toubon, with all of the respect that I owe you and that I have for you, to reassure you."
"This will not be a children’s story. The Commission is not wont, moreover, to do what you are suddenly accusing it of."
"Nor indeed is its aim, even if it were to please you, to produce a report that is unilateral and unsubtle or incomplete."
"It is therefore important to always bear in mind the issues involved in this project."
"The decision taken on 3 October 2005 certainly reflects the desire to fulfil our commitments, but it also conveys a powerful mutual interest."
"I heard someone say in this Chamber just now that Turkey had more to gain in this instance than Europe."
"I am not at all convinced about that."
"I believe that Turkey obviously needs Europe in order to continue becoming modern and democratic and supporting the development of its economy, but I believe that Europe also needs Turkey at its side, as a focal point for peace, stability, democracy and prosperity."
"Current events, as someone also said, are enough to demonstrate each day the strategic value of this exercise."
"Whether we are talking about Iran, Iraq, the Middle East in general, the dialogue between civilisations or the energy crisis, Turkey always seems to be a key country, a vital asset to Europe."
"That does not, of course, in any way exempt Turkey from the obligations that any accession candidate must fulfil, and the European Union will make sure of that."
"In doing so, it will not set itself up, either, as a teacher who tyrannically delivers his lessons."
"Let us remember that it was Turkey that presented itself as a candidate."
"It took that step."
"It therefore agreed to face up to the difficulties of European integration, because it saw in that the key to its own future and to that of its people."
"It is on this account that Turkey must now stay strong in pursuing and strengthening the reform process that it has itself courageously begun."
"We, for our part, are obviously going to continue encouraging it along these lines, and we shall not stop doing so."
"Turkey aspires to join Europe."
"I believe that we should give it its chance; one that must be fair, that stems from clear and transparent rules that are established at the outset and that will not change, either, according to the mood of the day."
"I should like to add something."
"I often have the feeling, and not only in this Chamber, that, when we debate this matter, it is as though we were evaluating Turkey for accession today, when that will actually take place tomorrow."
"It goes without saying that Turkey will not join tomorrow and that the process is likely to last for some time yet."
"This is therefore only an interim evaluation."
"Judgments are made in relation to progress and to advances - which sometimes take too long - and even to setbacks."
"It is quite clear that this is an evolutionary process."
"It is therefore very unfair to take a snapshot in time and just focus on that."
"That is not what accession is about."
"That does not correspond, I might add, to any enlargement process that we have known in the past."
"Why, then, should Turkey be treated any differently?"
"Now I come, before concluding in 20 seconds, to the Armenian issue."
"I should like all the same to point out – and I am very mindful of this point, as is Europe, because it comes under the duty to remember that is part of our legacy of values – that this issue is not, nor has ever been, a condition laid down by the European Council for the opening of negotiations or for accession itself, whether in the case of Turkey or of any other candidate country."
"Imposing this condition today would amount to moving the goalposts and would be very strongly felt in Turkey to be a ploy by the European Union to lay down new conditions with the aim of preventing Turkey’s accession at all costs."
"It is, on the other hand, vital to ensure that freedom of expression, including on sensitive issues that are linked to Turkey’s past, is fully respected in that country."
"The experience of our own countries demonstrates that the debate on the past, however distressing it may be, always comes about as a result of an act of awareness within our societies and rarely, if ever, as a result of an order, of a diktat from outside."
"This entire debate is linked to the principle of reconciliation, which is one of the main driving forces of the European project."
"The Commission has always been clear on this issue."
"Turkey’s relations with Armenia must improve, starting with the establishment of diplomatic relations and the opening up of the land border, which is currently closed."
"The prospect of Turkey’s joining the EU must lead to an improvement in bilateral relations and to reconciliation, including in relation to the past."
"We obviously expect Turkey to treat this issue as an integral part of a free and open public debate in which it must be possible to exchange all points of view."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there you have the response from the Commission and my impressions after having followed this extremely interesting debate."
"I am, of course, going to feed matters back to Mr Rehn, who is more familiar with these issues than I. Be in no doubt whatsoever that your contribution to the report of 8 November will be welcomed."
"Mr President, I just wanted to protest at Commissioner Rehn’s absence from this important debate."
"I find the reason he has given unacceptable."
"I do not think it fair to this House either."
"He could have responded to the many comments that have been made in response to the Eurlings report."
"I can inform you that Mr Rehn had other commitments and could not be present at this sitting."
"Mr Michel, you have the floor again."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to remind Mr Claeys that Commissioner Rehn has already explained in detail that it would be impossible for him to stay."
"Whilst that really was unfortunate for the debate, I have tried to stand in for him by clarifying arguments and answering questions."
"I will, of course, report back to Mr Rehn, and I am convinced that in the next meetings, he will probably be able to come and answer those questions in person."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0429/2006)."
"The following questions have been submitted to the Commission."
"In relation to the European Emissions Trading Scheme 2008-2012, could the Commission comment on the fact that the 30 June 2006 deadline for all Member States to submit their National Allocation Plans and for the Commission to issue a report on the NAPs has passed without these tasks being accomplished?"
"Less than half of all Member States have submitted their NAPs."
"How does the Commission intend to proceed in order to ensure that Phase II of the ETS is up and running in time for 2008?"
"Mr President, by yesterday 13 Member States had officially notified their national allocation plans to the Commission."
"In other words, approximately half the plans are still pending, but it is important to emphasise that the plans notified already represent over 60% of the emission rights approved by the Commission for the first trading period."
"The Member States which have notified their plans are Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden and the United Kingdom."
"The remaining Member States must of course notify their plans."
"Most of these plans – in a preliminary form – are already undergoing public consultation in various Member States such as Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain."
"Several of these Member States have already made significant progress in the relevant consultation procedures and they are expected to notify their plans to the Commission within the next few weeks."
"The Commission attaches great importance to the remaining Member States submitting their plans for the second stage as quickly as possible."
"Letters have already been sent out drawing the attention of the Member States to their obligations."
"If there are further delays, the Commission will examine the possibility of starting infringement proceedings against the Member States which have delayed, on the basis of Article 226 of the Treaty."
"However, according to the information available to it, the Commission estimates that the last Member States will have notified their plans by the end of 2006."
"The Commission has already started to evaluate the national allocation plans notified and intends to take decisions on them in the autumn, in other words by the three-month deadline from completion of the plans laid down in the emissions trading directive."
"This will allow the Commission to take decisions on most of the emission rights market before Christmas and to complete the evaluation procedure by the spring of 2007."
"This will safeguard the smooth and timely start of the second stage of the European Union's trading mechanism in all the Member States for 2008."
"The Commission cannot, of course, decide on the merits of evaluations under way, but will use every political and legal means at its disposal in order to ensure that all the plans are in keeping with the Kyoto commitments and the confirmed data on emissions for 2005, in a bid to safeguard equal terms of competition for companies."
"The whole point of national allocation plans is to ensure that the EU emissions trading schemes deliver the best possible benefits for the climate."
"The lack of transparency in most Member State processes to determine their first NAPs has resulted in legitimate questions and concerns on the validity of the data within the first set of plans."
"In the first year, 2005, the actual carbon dioxide emissions of 21 countries were 44 million tonnes short of the amount of CO2 emissions permits allocated in those 21 countries."
"That resulted in absolutely no downward pressure to reduce emissions and in a very volatile carbon credit market."
"Will you insist that the information and data sources used to set the targets in the second round of NAPs will be publicly available to allow independent verification and to ensure maximum benefit for the climate and fair competition across the single market?"
"."
"The criteria for preparing the National Allocation Plans for the second trading period are described in the directive."
"There are 12 criteria; two are very important."
"The first is whether the Member States are on track to achieve the curtailment target and how the allocations for the emissions trading system, together with other measures, will contribute to the achievement of that target."
"The second is the available publicly-known data regarding the emissions."
"For the second trading period, we have the advantage that we have the actual emissions for 2005, which are as described previously."
"So these two criteria will be very important in making the National Allocation Plans achieve the scarcity that is needed in the market in order to give companies and installations incentives to make the right investment in cutting down carbon dioxide emissions."
"Can the Commissioner comment on the validity and logic of a policy that compels Member States to radically reduce emissions with resulting increases in EU energy prices and lower manufacturing output while, at the same time, we promote trade with and production in China, the world’s greatest polluter, with no enforceable requirements for the suppression of emissions from them."
"I do not object to trade with China, but I do object to the lack of compulsion upon them to reduce their emissions."
"In effect, are we not really trading jobs and emissions ..."
"."
"In our plans for the post-2012 period we consider it very important to bring on board all the big emitters of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases."
"You are quite correct that China is one of the big emitters, but you forget that the biggest emitter is the United States, which emits about 25% of the greenhouse gases in the world."
"China comes second, with about 14%, together with the European Union, but in order to have the equilibrium which is needed regarding the contribution by each country to the battle against climate change, we have to take into account what the United Nations Climate Change Conference states, i.e. that each country should contribute in a common but differentiated way, which means that countries like China, India and other fast-developing countries, which have contributed to a smaller degree historically to the creation of the greenhouse phenomenon and have only a fraction of the per capita income of the developed countries, have to contribute in a different way according to their capabilities and their possibilities, without hindering their economic development and without creating unfair competition with other countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as a result of emission allowance trading, the price of electricity in Europe has generally risen, and furthermore, the price of electricity has risen independently of this, which means that the price of nuclear and hydro-electric energy has risen, resulting in windfall profits for the producers."
"In the Nordic countries, there are common electricity markets, and the price of emission allowances has been passed on directly to the cost of electricity in the Nordic Power Exchange."
"It has also been passed on to the cost of nuclear and hydro-electric energy, and has produced windfall profits for producers in these sectors."
"When the allocations are reorganised, does the Commission intend to do something about these windfall profits that producers make from emissions trading?"
"."
"You are right."
"There are quite a few electricity companies that have windfall profits because they included the cost of free allocations in electricity prices."
"There are, therefore, windfall profits across Europe."
"There are two ways to fight that."
"One is by auctioning some of the allowances instead of allocating them for free."
"That is a possibility for the second trading period."
"Countries can auction approximately 10% of allocations and the proceeds could be used either to promote innovation or to lessen the burden of taxes for labour, for example, or for other purposes."
"The second way is to liberalise the gas and power market in the European Union."
"The European Union is preparing for enlargement of the Schengen area."
"However, fears have been raised that it will not be possible to abolish internal border controls in 2007 because of technical problems relating to the central database for external border protection."
"Can the Commission explain how the preparations for enlargement of the Schengen area are proceeding?"
"When will it in fact be possible for enlargement to take place?"
"How well prepared are the candidate countries to implement the requirements of the Schengen area?"
"."
"Firstly, SIS II is of crucial importance, because it is one precondition, if not the only one, for the enlargement of the Schengen area, which is a true European area for the free movement of people."
"My second point is that enlargement of the Schengen area is a crucial political priority for the European Union and it will remain so."
"I can confirm the Commission’s full commitment and my personal commitment to achieving this goal as soon as possible."
"Some technical problems have emerged in this first phase of the technical implementation of this very complex system which, as you know, will connect the central part here in Strasbourg to all Member States’ national systems."
"There are problems and delays due to some litigation."
"There were technical problems with the preparation of the Strasbourg site, but these problems have now been totally solved in close cooperation with the French authorities."
"A large majority of Member States have requested at least an extra three months in order to test the connections needed between the central system and the national systems."
"My fourth point is that agreement on the legal basis has not yet been reached."
"We are working very hard."
"A few days ago there was a very fruitful trialogue to try to secure an agreement between the rapporteur, the Council Presidency and myself."
"The implementation of national projects has been delayed in all Member States that have asked to join the Schengen area, except one."
"All the experts in all Member States, including the new ones, were and are perfectly aware of the current situation."
"That is why national experts have proposed that there should be a new timetable for the implementation of SIS II."
"Next week the Council of Interior Ministers will probably approve a new timetable for SIS II."
"It will approve a proposal for a new timetable, which will be visible, pragmatic and realistic, and will also decide to establish a task force formed by national experts from the Member States to monitor continuously the national implementation of national systems."
"Following that, there will be a concrete possibility to discuss a realistic timetable."
"On the one hand, it is really a political commitment, but on the other, it is extremely complex from a technical point of view."
"The delay has occurred not because of political problems but because of technical problems, and all the Member States have been made aware of them through their national experts cooperating in the Technical Committee."
"Commissioner, thank you for your reply."
"When the ministers of the interior and justice discussed the Schengen issue last week in Tampere, there were ideas voiced that this is still a political question and that the new system will not be joined by all countries at one time, but rather whenever they are ready."
"The old members will join the system first, and the new ones will then follow."
"I would like to ask you to confirm, or preferably, deny that, which of course would be much more appealing."
"We expect a quick response concerning a realistic agenda and realistic date for the enlargement."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my answer is definitely yes: implementation of the SIS II project is one of the prerequisites for uniting and enlarging the Schengen area."
"I believe that the timetable to be approved by the Council of Ministers next week will set very precise dates for the new Member States to join Schengen."
"As was mentioned previously, there is a second requirement, which is that each of the new Member States must be in a position to adapt its national security and border control measures, as laid down in the Schengen Agreement itself."
"If these two conditions are fulfilled, the date laid down by the Council of Ministers will be a firm date for joining Schengen."
"– Mr President, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks for the commitment the Commissioner has shown in connection with the realisation of Schengen."
"I have two questions."
"It has been discussed that ‘Schengen plus’ is supposedly to be implemented before Schengen II, in a transitional period."
"Is ‘Schengen plus’ a necessary requirement for the implementation of Schengen II?"
"I am thinking here of Slovenia, which has apparently already implemented Schengen II."
"My second question is this. What additional interlinking of files is envisaged with Schengen II?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the possibility of an intermediate solution – in other words Schengen 1+ – was raised by one of the delegations."
"This, in my view, is a solution worthy of serious consideration, so long as it gives us the added value that Schengen 2 will certainly provide."
"I would remind the honourable Members that over a year ago it was the Commission itself that put this idea forward. In other words, why not look for an intermediate solution between Schengen 1 and Schengen 2?"
"Such a solution would in fact be called Schengen 1+."
"At the time, a large majority of Member States rejected this intermediate idea on the grounds that it would not be sufficiently secure, as Schengen 2 would be."
"Now, as you know, the idea has been put forward again by the Portuguese delegation."
"We shall reassess it, but everything depends on the added value it provides."
"The next question is, ‘What is this added value?’"
"Schengen 2 will feature immediate, real-time connection through a central part in Strasbourg, a second part in Salzburg and the national systems, which will be connected with direct exchange of information in much shorter times and with much more secure personal data protection than is the case at the moment."
"This is the main feature that makes me consider Schengen 2 the most advanced proposal yet on the table."
"Commissioner, I would like to ask you about security."
"I am sure that the Commission is very interested in the security and reliability of these Schengen borders but, as you know, the new countries have invested millions of euros in creating this information system and, with the postponement of their entry into the Schengen system, there are some fears that these systems will be outdated and not suited to the new demands."
"."
"This is a very important question."
"Many colleagues and ministers in Tampere raised exactly this point."
"My answer was, and I repeat it here, that I am aware of the impact of delay and possible additional cost."
"That is why I have promised all the ministers to study very carefully the possibility of taking at least partial account of the additional cost of postponing the concrete operation of SIS II."
"For example, I can take the IT scale systems into consideration."
"I have already postponed the possibility of spending money until the end of 2007."
"Why not think about postponing it again, or try to have additional funding for this extra cost?"
"I cannot, for example, co-fund salaries for people in the police, but I will give serious consideration to the security infrastructure."
"I wish to point out that the issue of the enlargement of the Schengen area will be debated at our October plenary session."
"Indeed, we shall have the opportunity to return to the issue in the presence of Mr Frattini."
"Further to the European Court of Justice's ruling of 18 July 2006 in Case C-119/04, will the Commission consider applying for a revision of that ruling on the basis that important information concerning the actual working situation of foreign language assistants in Italy was not made available to the European Court of Justice?"
"."
"Mr President, honourable Members, in its ruling of 18 June 2006 on case C-119/04 the Court of Justice stated that, by the deadline established in the reasoned opinion, the Italian Republic had failed to provide recognition of the rights acquired by former assistant teachers who had become language teachers and specialists, although such recognition was guaranteed to all employees in the country, and had failed to fulfil all of the measures arising from the Commission v Italy ruling of 26 June 2001 in case C 212/99, and had accordingly failed to carry out its obligations under Article 228 of the EC Treaty."
"The Court of Justice decided, however, that there were no grounds for imposing the fine requested by the Commission."
"After examining the events in question, it did not have sufficient information to conclude that the Italian authorities were failing to meet their obligations."
"The Commission would draw the honourable Member’s attention to the fact that the Court of Justice also pointed out that under Law 2/2004, which does not rule out renewing the careers of former assistant teachers of foreign language under enhanced conditions, each of the universities in question might retrospectively renew the careers of these teachers."
"The Court of Justice nevertheless also held that there was still a need to determine whether or not the measures adopted following the lawful approval of the regulation were actually applied."
"The Commission services are currently analysing the substance and impact of this ruling, and the best way to proceed."
"One of the main questions that should be resolved in this regard is whether the acquired rights have been fully recognised and renewed, including the implementation of retrospective payments to those who are entitled to them, as declared by the Italian authorities."
"Would the Commissioner not agree that it is scandalous that no fines were imposed on the Italian authorities by the European Court of Justice, given that it is now almost 20 years since the matter was first brought to the Commission’s attention, and that on each occasion when the Court has decided on this matter, it has found against Italy; and that even today, as I understand it, in La Sapienza University the criteria laid down have still not been complied with?"
"Also, would he not agree that it is extraordinary that the Court can claim that insufficient evidence was provided by the Commission to enable it to make a decision in relation to the imposition of fines?"
"Will the Commissioner undertake to ensure, even at this stage, that the Court’s decision will be reviewed and that the Italian authorities will be obliged ..."
"Mr De Rossa, in its discussion on the case, the Commission held to the view that was stated before the court and on which the court gave its ruling."
"From this perspective we are both formally and substantively involved in the trial in question."
"Accordingly, the Commission is responsible for resolving this matter and for examining whether the ruling has been applied in full, whether it has resulted in retrospective payment and whether careers have been renewed."
"This is what we have to do and this is the direction in which we are heading. How the proposed measures will turn out remains to be seen."
"In my view, the bottom line is that the legal framework of the EU and the European Community must be respected, and this is the way the Commission always works."
"It made its position on the matter very clear during the negotiations."
"I welcome the fact that you will be monitoring whether the ruling is properly applied."
"I think it is now 21 years since this matter was raised by one of my former colleagues, Hugh McMahon, as well as Mr De Rossa."
"I wonder whether we could consider having a birthday party for the question on its 21st anniversary when it comes of age, because it appears to be proceeding exceedingly slowly."
"."
"Mr Ford, throughout this confusing process, the Commission has consistently maintained that the obligation to achieve results arises from the 2001 ruling applying to actual settlement of earnings and to social security contributions owed to former assistant teachers."
"The criteria used in the regulation under law 2/2004 on renewing the careers of teachers were also called into question."
"At the time, of course, the court decided or stated that it had no reasonable grounds on which to establish that the ruling had not yet been applied in full."
"It took into consideration the fact that the Italian universities had informed them that payments, or at least some of the payments, had been made."
"The court did not address the issue that it was the universities that had provided this information and not the assistant teachers."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in this situation, the decision of the court is final, and the Commission must now examine the relevant facts and decide on what action to take next."
"It remains to be seen whether the next step is to reopen the process or some other course of action."
"I can only assure you that the amount of time the process has taken strikes me, personally, as extraordinarily long and I feel that one of the cornerstones, one of the vital components, of legal certainty is that satisfaction ultimately ensues within a reasonable amount of time."
"This does not mean immediately, because some cases are complicated, but within a time frame that can be considered appropriate."
"In its 2007 draft budget the Council is proposing to make substantial savings in administrative expenditure by doing away with Commission posts."
"What effect would these possible cuts have on staffing trends at the Commission and in the agencies over the next few years?"
"."
"The question you asked is very important for the Commission and all the European institutions."
"The proposal we got from the Council consists of two parts: one part relates directly to the 2007 budget and the other relates directly to the seven-year period from 2007 to 2013."
"I should like to elaborate on the consequences in your question for both elements of the proposal that we got from the Council."
"Firstly, with regard to the 2007 budget, the Council has reduced appropriations by EUR 56 million."
"That means that the Commission would not even be able to maintain the current level of staff, while the Council has approved 801 new posts for new members for enlargement."
"However, it refused to grant the corresponding appropriations for paying salaries for those positions."
"It would make recruitment impossible, from either new or old Member States."
"It also will not allow the Commission to replace its staff who will retire during 2007."
"That means that the real labour force will be reduced by about 420 people."
"No recruitment will be taking place at all with this proposal for 2007."
"The question was also about agencies."
"For 2007 the Council also proposed to cut agencies’ appropriations by about EUR 29 million."
"The second part of the proposal consists of reducing posts for the seven-year period."
"The Council’s proposal has two parts."
"Firstly, every second post becoming vacant would be deleted from each institution’s establishment plan."
"I have heard rumours that it is proposed for all three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Secondly, the Commission would have to delete 500 additional posts, justified by the Council by the concentration of programmes and new managerial approaches."
"For the Commission that could cost up to 2000 positions during the seven-year period; for other institutions, such as the Council and Parliament, about 200 positions."
"At the request of the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, in early September I signed the working paper with all the detailed technical explanations and financial figures about that proposal."
"If you like, we could provide you today with that package for your information, in order to study the question in more detail."
"The consequences only for the Commission will be a loss of close to 2000 posts, which means close to four DGs."
"It is also approximately half of the positions that have been given for enlargement during previous years."
"It does not take into account at all the fact that the Commission already started administrative reform on its own premises in 2002 and its ongoing reform."
"It also does not take into account that the European institutions are not national governments and the specific tasks which Parliament and Council perform are different."
"As an example, the European Commission, as a public civil service, is the cheapest public service in the world."
"In our budget all three institutions – the Council, Parliament and the Commission – only take up about 5% of the budget for administrative expenditures, while in most of our Member States they take up four or five times more."
"We cannot agree because the proposal does not take into account the geographical balance."
"We need to keep within the requests of the Council."
"It does not take into account linguistic diversity, which we also need to keep."
"None of these things is taken into account."
"Finally, we evaluated this as an attempt to reopen the debate on the interinstitutional agreement, which we signed just four months ago."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for a very thorough answer."
"I would like to mention that, after the question was submitted, the Commission also gave members of the Committee on Budgets written materials on the subject to help clarify the issue."
"I would like to ask an additional question."
"Can the Commission freely redeploy staff among the different main administrative sections whenever it decides to, without a separate budget decision having to be taken between the budgetary authorities in the Council of Parliament?"
"Can the Commission freely move posts from one Directorate-General to another?"
"."
"We carry out redeployment every year; each year we redeploy approximately 400 people internally."
"But here we are talking about posts without the preparations to pay salaries."
"Inside is part of our so-called productivity gain programme, which was introduced in 2002 as part of the reform."
"If the priorities change, we redeploy internally: that is the normal yearly practice."
"– Commissioner, what measures are intended for taking due account of the new EU Member States when allocating Commission staff posts, and for doing so without increasing administrative expenditure?"
"."
"Yes, in 2003 Parliament and the Council agreed to allocate 3400 new posts for enlargement in the four-year period between 2004 and 2008."
"Each year we have been receiving these posts, together with payments for the salaries."
"This year we have again been offered 801 posts by the Council, without any addition for the salaries."
"We are not magicians and we cannot magically pay for 800 posts from nowhere."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I hope that this question about the Commission’s administration will allow me the opportunity to ask a further question on a subject on which I have been contacted once again in recent years."
"The Commission’s administrative practice continues to display the regrettable feature that payment orders for scientific projects arrive far too late."
"This is especially true when a researcher or scientist comes to Brussels on an invitation from the Commission, for example, to evaluate research and scientific projects."
"Researchers pay for their own travel and hotel costs, make their contribution, and may have to wait several months before the Commission pays the expenses and pays for the work done."
"Today I have discovered that this has sometimes taken five months."
"."
"It mainly concerns the Financial Regulation and the financial implementing rules."
"The Commission has prepared the simplification procedures and they were approved in May."
"This package of new legislation is on the Council’s table and on the Committee on Budgets’ table with Mrs Grässle, who is the rapporteur on this question."
"She can confirm that we took on about 80% of Parliament’s proposals."
"The package is very good, but now much will depend on whether the Finnish Presidency will approve it and on the negotiations between the Council and Parliament, while it remains a Council decision."
"So I very much hope that a lot more simplification will take place from 2007, especially regarding the procedures for paying for these kinds of projects."
"But that is another matter."
"Why is the Commission trying to complete the budgetary adjustments even before the report of the European Court of Auditors on the modernisation of the accounting system is published on 23 October 2006?"
"How many accounts covered by section 1.3.1. of preliminary draft amending budget No 5 to the 2006 budget are included on the list of its own business accounts of which the Commission was unaware, a list forwarded by the Commission on 2 June 2006 in an answer to a written parliamentary question (S-46, Complement to Questions E-4819/05 and H-0212/06)?"
"How much money do the at least 377 unknown accounts contain?"
"How many accounts are covered by the headings ‘bankrupt banks’, ‘cash differences’ and ‘burden of the past’, and what sums are involved?"
"How have the cash differences arisen and was this the result of opening accounts outside the budget?"
"What is meant by ‘burden of the past’, and how did it arise?"
"."
"Within this question there are seven sub-questions, and I would like to be as precise and technical as possible because the questions were very specific and precise from an accounting point of view."
"Your question mainly relates to our manning budget, where we are asking to create a budgetary line which would enable the Commission, where duly justified, to write off items in suspense accounts, and to write off losses which inevitably accrue in an administration manager’s funds in accounts throughout 145 countries, sometimes with a weak banking sector and other political disturbances."
"The creation of this budget line reflects the Commission’s policy of administrative rigour and transparency, to clear up all files, mostly relating to the years before 2000."
"That is mainly because we are now introducing a new accrual-based accounting system which allows us, and compels us, to be more transparent and more rigorous with our accounting system."
"This proposal for a new budgetary line was presented in the amended Budget 5, to the budget line 40, and lists the following five types of operations which we will be looking into."
"The first is adjustments to cover amounts deposited in accounts in banks outside the European Union which have gone bankrupt during the previous year."
"The second is cash differences in imprest accounts."
"The third is settlement on some long-standing operations carried out mainly by delegations and representations under the imprest arrangements abroad."
"The fourth is repayments of principal and/or late payment interest and whether they were set off, and clearance of non-recoverable amounts of VAT."
"Each year, the Commission will include this budgetary line in its PDB proposal, as it is now common practice to write off non-recoverable expenditure and not leave it in suspense accounts indefinitely, which was the practice in the past."
"The definition of a suspense account is that it is not just a bank account, but accounting records, in which the Commission’s annual financial statements are listed outside the EU budget accounts because they correspond to operations which are waiting to be regularised from an accounting point of view, but cannot be attributed by any specific EU budget line for various reasons explained above."
"There is therefore no link with the bank accounts mentioned in my answer of 2 July this year, where the accounts were opened or managed by staff other than the accounting officer, both inside and outside the territory of the European Union."
"As regards the Court of Auditors’ 2005 annual report, this proposal also has no link whatever with that publication, other than the fact that the Court constantly presses the Commission to clear up these suspense accounts."
"It was presented in good time for the suspense account to be cleared up before the end of the present financial year."
"We did this with the amended budget."
"As regards the main types of operation in a number of accounts which you ask about in your question and the amounts of money involved, I can provide some examples today."
"For example, funds lost following bankruptcies amount to about EUR 1.3 million, concerning mainly EUR 1 million in Kazakhstan in 1996."
"Funds lost from burdens of the past, for example, amount presently to EUR 3.5 million from imprest accounts held outside the European Union and only EUR 100 000 from imprest accounts held by representations."
"This is due to many different circumstances where the supporting documents that are needed to justify otherwise regular expenditure cannot be traced, despite long searches."
"All these amounts relate to years before 2000."
"Finally, I just want to say that the creation of this budget line is not only part of the current process to modernise the Commission’s accounting system; it also reflects the Commission policy of administrative rigour and transparency to clear up all old files, which will become common practice from 2006, and we will do it every year."
"Despite the thorough inventory, I want to confirm that no bank accounts were found that have been unknown to the Commission at this stage."
"– I am obliged to the Commissioner for her answer."
"The interpretation disappeared from time to time, as the interpreter could not follow what the Commissioner was saying."
"I have tried to follow the Commissioner and have realised that she has not answered one of my questions, namely the one regarding the 377 extrabudgetary accounts I listed in my question of 2 July."
"This is the second time that the question as to the total sum concerned has gone unanswered."
"To this I would add that there is an account of the Economat supermarket for EUR 7 million."
"I would ask the Commissioner to tell us what these EUR 7 million were spent on."
"."
"I cannot give you an answer at the moment about those specific figures, because that was not made clear in the letter or the oral question."
"We understood the main question concerned the budget amendment proposal, to which we tried to reply."
"If you would like an explanation about specific amounts, we will provide it in writing."
"Internal borders and barriers in the EU are being removed and will have disappeared completely after a few years."
"Ever closer integration between new and old EU Member States is giving rise to a ‘brain drain’ – an exodus of minds and of qualified workers – that is steadily gathering pace."
"The new Member States are losing many of their most dynamic citizens, who obtained a good education and qualifications in their native countries, to the considerably wealthier old Member States."
"The EU would appear to be giving the new Member States support with one, visible hand, in the form of various funds, while taking it away with another, invisible hand by attracting its young specialists."
"I believe that a solution to this problem would be to create a special EU fund to lessen the impact of the brain drain (following the example of the globalisation fund)."
"Countries receiving qualified specialists would have to contribute most to this fund."
"The resources collected could be used to improve the education systems of the countries adversely affected by this phenomenon and to create new jobs in those countries."
"What is the Commission’s view of this or similar suggestions?"
"Does the Commission agree that what is essentially a positive process – the creation of a single labour market – is at the same time causing a serious problem in the form of a brain drain, which needs to be resolved by joint EU efforts as well as by the efforts of all 25 Member States?"
"."
"The Member's question is on the issue of the brain- or skills-drain from Member States that joined the Union on 1 May 2004."
"He suggests that the Commission should create a special new fund to reduce the impact of brain-drain."
"The free movement of persons is one of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by Community law."
"After enlargement in 2004, despite the transitional arrangements for the free movement of workers from eight new countries, the EU saw increased mobility from new Member States."
"However, in the report we published recently on the functioning of the transitional arrangements, the Commission pointed out that flows from the EU-10, the new Member States, had been fairly limited in relation to the overall working-age population and that they are balanced, at least in part, by mobility from the original 15."
"The report shows that migration flows are driven by factors related to supply and demand conditions, both in sending and receiving countries."
"Moreover, and more importantly, as pointed out in the report, rather than seeking permanent employment in another country, a significant percentage of migrant workers stay in the receiving country for a limited period only."
"Consequently, migrant workers often return to their country of origin, which will subsequently profit from the accumulated experiences gained abroad, especially by highly skilled workers."
"In this respect, we can speak about the concept of brain-gain."
"It should also be noted that although the ‘old’ Member States attract talented people from the new Member States, the United States of America proves to be the most popular destination for tertiary students or educated people from the new Member States."
"The problem of brain-drain, insofar as it exists, seems more linked to the salary differential between the country of origin and destination countries than to the quality of the education systems in migrants’ countries of origin."
"The new Member States perform quite well under most indicators in the Education-Training 2010 programme, where we have benchmarks and very concrete objectives."
"The answer to the issue lies in the good use of the significant opportunities that will be provided by the structural funds for the 2007 to 2013 period."
"The structural funds will bring a substantial contribution to the economies of new Member States and, if used well, should provide the means to ensure steady growth and job creation."
"The progressive convergence of the new Member States’ economies with those of older Member States should reduce the existing salary differential and therefore eliminate a major reason for brain-drain."
"The Commission, rather than supporting the creation of a special fund or efforts to regulate migration, would therefore encourage new Member States to use the structural funds effectively."
"The European Social Fund, in particular, will continue to support a comprehensive approach to education and training in the programming period beginning in 2007, namely by supporting measures to develop employability and improve the labour-market relevance of initial and vocational education and training, with a view to encouraging innovation and as part of a knowledge-based economy."
"Commissioner, thank you so much for your thorough response."
"I must admit, however, that it did not really ease my fears."
"The use of the funds is truly a very important issue for the freedom of movement, but the new Members will be ‘bled white’ by giving away their best people to old Members that are far richer."
"I would still like to ask you: do you feel any injustice in the situation as it is?"
"Do you sense any violation of the principle of solidarity?"
"."
"I would not talk about injustice;"
"I would prefer to talk about freedom, which we have, and responsibility, which is the best part of freedom, or the other side of the same coin."
"When we speak about the ‘brain drain’, it is not only the new Member States versus older Member States."
"The same happens in the Union versus most competitive partners in the world."
"When I was in France and Germany they talked about the brain drain to the United States."
"So either we are aware of the problems and the lack of competitiveness, the lack of value placed on knowledge or the lack of respect for knowledge in Europe, and improve conditions for intellectual property for patents on this continent for so many issues connected to innovation and the transfer of knowledge into real life, the real economy, production and services, or we will comment and lament later on, and maybe even more, because time is passing quickly and globalisation is really influencing our lives."
"All our policies, programmes, strategies aim towards this goal."
"I do not want to anticipate developments in the Commission, but in a few weeks’ time we would like to propose, for example, the establishment of a European institute of technology."
"Either we create space for a European dimension in knowledge and the transfer of knowledge and we improve together or, as I said before, we will lose time and momentum."
"I do not want to discuss that at length now, maybe next time I shall say more."
"The Lahti Summit in October should deal with the ten points for improving innovation in Europe."
"The first two points are education and universities and an institute of technology, and then there are others."
"I think that political awareness of the problem is there."
"If there is also the political will to deliver, we can find better answers and better situations in the future."
"We need to work towards that."
"Commissioner, given the announcement on Romania and Bulgaria, could you comment on the indications from the UK and Ireland that they will not be opening up their markets to workers from these two Member States?"
"Would you agree that many of the host countries need a policy of integrating workers from new Member States, to be fair to their needs, and that we need to allow migrant workers with qualifications to progress in the careers for which they are qualified in the host Member States?"
"Thank you not only for the question but also for the encouragement that we should stay open."
"Politically I think Europe is a synonym of openness."
"If that is true, then we usually tend to solve problems."
"If we close, if we isolate ourselves, then problems usually get even bigger in time."
"On internal decisions and the opening of the labour market, this is, of course, the right of Member States."
"The Commission has always argued in favour of openness or at least gradual opening rather than moratoria."
"The report on the second anniversary of enlargement showed that those that opened their markets benefited, which confirms that until now integration in Europe has proved to be a win-win situation."
"Of course it must be carried out under certain rules and criteria and, if that is the case, then benefits will continue to be gained by those who are more open."
"On qualifications and integration, one of the important contributions will come this month from the Commission."
"Last night there was a debate in this House on a European qualifications framework, which should create the basic matrix for comparison and transfer of qualifications between different autonomous national qualification systems or qualification frameworks."
"In this sense the value of the qualifications will be higher because we will make them more readable and transferable and we will empower people to use them more properly."
"This is one of the most important legal and political answers in order to turn our people in the same Union into citizens more than tourists."
"Last year the European Commission adopted the Green Paper on managing economic migration in the European Union, which proposed to compensate the costs of ‘brain drain’ to third countries, meaning developing countries."
"These economic migrants are exactly the same as Lithuanians going to other countries in the European Union, which is referred to as the free movement of persons rather than economic migration."
"Why would not the Commission apply the measures it proposed for third countries to the internal market?"
"We do not encourage or propose a brain drain, but we try to mobilise brains."
"There are many examples of how either we proceed together in order to release the potential which we have in our Member Sates and our universities in the new generation of students and researchers, or we are lost with the lack of growth, the lack of new and better jobs."
"Even in the programmes for which I am responsible, we do not stimulate or motivate third-country nationals to leave their home states, but rather to go back and build up their societies and economies in close partnership with European countries, European institutions or universities."
"Instead of lamenting how little we did to stop the brain drain and for the recuperation of European potential, we should focus on the credible implementation of our next generation of programmes."
"We want to have even more mobility combined, of course, with freedom."
"I am also from a new Member State, and I usually answer that instead of lamenting that more young people go out than come back, we need to create conditions which build or offer a truly European perspective back home in Slovakia, in Lithuania or Latvia."
"After two years of membership of the Union, it is becoming more and more evident that the Europeanisation of conditions and prospects for young people is there, but it is a process; it takes time."
"The much-quoted, miraculous examples of Ireland or Finland are just logical results of long-term strategic policies where education, training, knowledge and research are at the centre and remain at the centre."
"That is a good example for all to follow."
"Both the European Union and its Member States invest enormous amounts of money into language education."
"Nevertheless, results are poor as, according to research, only half of EU citizens are familiar with holding a conversation in any foreign language."
"Does the Commission intend to act in order to encourage the Member States to evaluate without any prejudice the effectiveness of different language teaching methods, including new techniques?"
"Why are publications of the European Union not being translated into the languages of the new Member States?"
"Mr President, this happens month after month."
"Members have tabled questions to be answered by the Commission, they sit here while you allow supplementary after supplementary and let Commissioners run on at will and our questions are not reached."
"It is an outrage the way Members of this House are being treated, it is absolutely outrageous."
"I protest strongly about this."
"I can perfectly understand your annoyance, and to some extent I share it, but it is not strictly true to say that the questions will not be answered, as they will be answered in writing."
"I am not responsible for setting the Rules of Procedure."
"I am simply the referee who interprets the rules and, as you will appreciate, we cannot extend proceedings indefinitely."
"Mr Figel’, you have the floor again."
"Although estimating the effectiveness of any investment in education is always difficult, the Commission is not aware of any study demonstrating that the return on investment in language teaching is lower compared to other forms of education."
"On the contrary, it is commonly agreed that money spent on acquired language skills ensures a good return to the individual, his or her family, companies and society at large in terms of higher salaries, better jobs and increased business opportunities."
"According to a recent Eurobarometer survey, more than 50% of European citizens stated that they are able to hold a conversation in one foreign language."
"That percentage is encouraging, although it is far from our objective of giving all European citizens the ability to communicate in at least two other languages in addition to their mother tongue."
"To pursue that objective, the Commission promotes language learning and linguistic diversity through its programmes for education and training as well as through many other exchange programmes."
"Lingua 1 action under the Socrates Programme is aimed at developing and disseminating innovative techniques and examples of good practice in language teaching."
"Furthermore, the European Label for innovative projects in language teaching and learning is awarded each year to the most innovative language learning projects in each Member State."
"The Commission is bound by its legal obligation to translate into all official languages Community legislation and the related documents that are necessary to enable citizens, companies and other stakeholders to enjoy their rights and comply with their obligations."
"As regards other documents, they are translated in accordance with real needs, taking into account available capacity."
"That principle applies to all official languages."
"In my experience many people learn foreign languages, but not so many of them can speak them in everyday life."
"I think that is why it is very important to have a criterion at Community level to compare the different language teaching methods."
"That would be very useful."
"On your other remark, Commissioner, according to figures from InfoPoint Brussels, there are approximately 25% more EU publications in old Member State languages than publications in the new Member State languages."
"So those figures are correct as far as I know."
"In reply to the first comment, we are working on that in real terms, especially on the creation of a European indicator of language competence, which will help us to assess and influence the situation more effectively and to obtain feedback and improvements in the teaching and learning of languages."
"On publication, the ratio is something that reflects the total output, but the impact of the new languages has been to increase the linguistic diversity of the Union."
"We need, therefore, to function fully in this multilingual environment, because it defines us and provides us with a link to citizens."
"This has to be nurtured further, not only in the Union as a whole but also, and especially, in the institutions."
"We are working on that."
"I do not want to say much about that, as I was asked to shorten my answers."
"Perhaps in reply to other questions I can talk about the ways in which we want to promote multilingualism in our institutions."
"Questions 40 to 43 will be answered in writing."
"As indicated by the Essen European Council, Decision No 1692/96/EC(1) and the 'van Miert group', the Commission has included among the 30 priority projects for the trans-European transport networks the high-speed rail link Lisbon-Madrid-Barcelona-Perpignan-Montpellier."
"Decision No 884/2004/EC(2) establishes that work on the Perpignan-Montpellier line should be completed in 2015."
"Recently, France has said that it will postpone completion of the line until 2030."
"By allowing France to treat this public works project as an internal matter, the EU would be consenting in a non-integrated model for the Member States' railway systems, thus placing obstacles on the mobility of passengers and goods."
"Has the Commission received any official communication from the French government modifying the calendar for the Perpignan-Montpellier high-speed link?"
"What is its position on the proposed delay?"
"What measures will it take to ensure that Union-level decisions concerning major infrastructures are not ignored by a Member State attempting to protect its supposed interests, to the detriment of its neighbours?"
"."
"Mr Guardans Cambó, on 20 July 2005, the Commission appointed Mr Etienne Davignon as European coordinator in order to boost the development of priority project No 3, TGV South, which includes the Perpignan-Montpellier section."
"The first annual report by the coordinator, Mr Davignon, published on 13 September, states that there may be delays in the implementation of the section in question."
"The completion of this section is made more difficult by the presence of protected areas and very built-up residential areas."
"On confirmation from the French authorities, it appears that the delays should be far more limited than the ones you have pointed out."
"While it is unlikely that we will be able to keep to the date of 2015, the date of 2020 for the entry into service of this infrastructure seems entirely realistic, and it might even be conceivable that the section will be completed before then."
"Within the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework, the Commission wants to focus a significant proportion of the Community resources available on the 30 priority projects."
"Mr Guardans Cambó, in its amended proposal for a regulation laying down the general rules for the granting of Community financial aid, the Commission envisages paying special attention to projects concerned with the elimination of bottlenecks, with the cross-border sections and with the waterways, too."
"I must insist, Mr President, Mr Guardans Cambó, that Parliament permit the swift adoption of this financial regulation, thanks to which we will be able more swiftly to put in place the funding and to speed up the implementation both of this priority project No 3 and of other projects."
"– Thank you, Commissioner."
"What credibility does the European Union still have in the eyes of Europeans when it declares a project to be of European interest and sets a date for its completion, and then allows the authorities of the Member States to consider this project an internal project and to state in a press conference that they are not going to carry it through to completion?"
"You say that the date I have given is an exaggeration; it was the date given by the French authorities in the press conference."
"2030: it was the French authorities that said that."
"Thus, allow me to have more confidence in the French authorities, which are responsible for completing the line."
"What did you just say to us?"
"What credibility is still possessed by the Commission, which must ensure that European decisions are carried out, if nothing then comes of anything?"
". I spoke of 2020 after having consulted the French authorities."
"You are right, Mr Guardans Cambó, I am the first to want the major European networks to be completed within acceptable deadlines."
"However, that also depends on the Member States giving their support, and you also know that, instead of the EUR 20 billion that we were hoping for under the 2007-2013 financial perspective, we only have EUR 8 billion."
"That being said, the coordinator, Mr Davignon, and myself do not intend to let the French authorities effectively compromise the future of this major corridor, which is the subject of the priority project."
"I therefore have a personal commitment, Mr Guardans Cambó, and we will do everything possible to ensure that things change, and, although there has been the unfortunate announcement of a timetable that I, for my part, find altogether excessive, well, I am here to tell you that the Commissioner for Transport will fight to change the situation and to ensure that we can have a far more reasonable timetable."
"Commissioner, having chosen the thirty priority projects, it is alarming that the sluggish attitude of certain Member States should be turning these projects into phantom projects."
"Specifically, the coordinator of project No 3 has complained that, with regard to the planning of the Figueras-Perpignan route, there are regrettably enormous delays."
"To what extent, therefore, Commissioner, are you prepared to urge the French and Spanish Governments to fulfil their obligations and give due priority to the route we are talking about?"
"."
"The national programmes, Mr Grandes Pascual, will be examined by the Directorate-General for Transport and myself, and we will have the opportunity, in these negotiations with both France and Spain, to point out the priorities."
"There is no question of our distributing European money across all of the projects without having the Member States make a significant contribution to our priorities."
"In this negotiation, therefore, I believe that we will have ways of convincing them."
"Next, I believe that we will quite easily be able to remind the Member States of the huge importance of these corridors."
"They are going to completely change the transport sector in Europe, and that includes both passenger transport and freight transport."
"I believe, therefore, that we should not have a totally negative and overly pessimistic view of these problems."
"It is true that some convincing will be required, but, once again, I, for my part, fully intend, with Parliament’s backing, to take action so as to progress these projects, which were nonetheless, I would point out, defined by the Member States themselves."
"In its answer to my question E-1422/06 on this same subject, the Commission states that Member States are not required to notify it of complaint management or of the remedial action taken by companies in the event of overbooking, major delays or cancellations of flights."
"Can the Commission therefore specify what actual data it intends to present in its report to the Parliament and Council on implementation of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004(3) on 1 January 2007?"
"How does it plan to ensure uniform interpretation and implementation of the Regulation if it is not informed by Member States of the follow-up given to complaints?"
"How will it prevent companies from using motives unverifiable by users for not implementing the Regulation and from reducing it to an exercise in style?"
"."
"The Commission has already responded within the framework of a written question."
"The Member States are not bound to transmit information relating to the management of complaints from air passengers or to the penalties imposed on airline operators."
"However, the Commission does, of course, arrange regular meetings with the national control bodies in order to harmonise the application of the regulation and to strengthen the contacts between these bodies so that they will share data relating to the management of complaints."
"The Commission is cooperating closely in this context with the Member States in order to draft a guide on how to interpret the provisions of the regulation."
"I would point out that we are concerned here with Regulation (EC) No 261/2004."
"I am going to present a communication to the European Parliament and to the Council in January 2007 on the workings and application of this regulation."
"The Commission has published an invitation to tender with a view to choosing an external consultant who will be able to collect the quantitative and qualitative data relating to the application of this regulation."
"The Commission would like, in particular, to examine the position regarding denied boarding, cancellations, delays and the application of the regulation in such cases."
"The results of this study will be incorporated into my communication."
"I should like to tell you, Mr Tarabella, that the Commission has recorded more than 5 500 letters linked to air passenger rights."
"These letters are handled carefully."
"They enable certain trends to be identified."
"This entire monitoring exercise will be used in the context of the infringement proceedings that the Commission will bring against Member States that do not fulfil their obligations to citizens and respect the rights of those citizens as air passengers."
"Before we can bring those proceedings, however, we must have enough data."
"During the 18 months of implementing this regulation, the Commission will have collected a critical mass of information and it will be in a position to act when the right moment comes."
"I am grateful to you for your question because I, for my part, am really very anxious to ensure that these passenger rights now become a reality within the European area."
"– Commissioner, can the Commission give me some additional information regarding the amendments that it plans to make to the regulation on air passenger rights in order, firstly, to take account of the hundreds of complaints that have been lodged, for example, at regional consumption centres and that testify both to the serious shortcomings, and to the poor application, of the existing regulations on the rights of these passengers?"
"Secondly, how does the Commission intend to establish a precise definition of , an argument that is used systematically by airlines so as not to apply the regulation?"
"Finally, I should also like to ask the Commission how it plans to take account in future of problems such as those recorded by the hundreds of French passengers who were held up recently in Turkey and Israel following failings on the part of the organisers of seat-only sales, which are not covered by any European legislation?"
"."
"The Commission has organised three meetings with the national control bodies – on 19 May 2005, 17 February 2006 and 14 September 2006, which is very recent – with a view to strengthening the coordination among the various Member States and to harmonising the application of the provisions of the regulation concerned."
"In the meantime, we have established a question-and-answer-type information document that will make it easier for the national control bodies to deal with the data on a daily basis."
"This document was distributed in July 2006."
"As I said to you, Mr Tarabella, thanks to this critical mass of information, I could actually propose, with the communication that I am going to present before Parliament in prospect, a number of improvements enabling us to ensure that the new law that we have created to benefit passengers is properly applied."
"I would say to you once again: the Directorate-General for Transport has handled 5 623 letters, which means that we can already identify certain trends."
"I must say, for example, that we were pleased to observe a sharp decline in the practice of overbooking."
"You are right, though: the events that took place this summer must also be taken into account."
"Once I truly have an overall view of things, I hope to be able to come before this Parliament and to explain to it both what improvements have been made and what remains for us to do to ensure that these new rules are applied effectively."
"I am grateful to you for having asked that question; it is also an incentive for me to demonstrate even greater vigilance."
"It is just a question about airline operators."
"I understand that they are the ones that have to tell passengers what their rights are, but in various instances, with Air France in particular, we are told that it is not up to the airline operator."
"What is the Commission doing to make sure that airline operators take their responsibilities seriously?"
"I had to intervene on behalf of several passengers because they were told that they would not get overnight accommodation, for instance."
"I told them that was wrong and that the new law said that they were entitled to that compensation."
"."
"Yes, Mrs Lynne, I stated that we were going to ask an audit body to review the situation with regard to denied boarding, cancellations and delays, the application of the regulation by airline operators and the national authorities, and the degree of independence of the national control bodies from the national aviation authorities."
"You are quite right. It is not just a question of passengers having rights; it is a question of airline operators and the national authorities being able to really make the people concerned aware of those rights."
"Moreover, the study will be conducted in cooperation with airline operators, consumer and passenger associations, and the national authorities."
"I personally believe that, in the light of this study, we shall be far more able in future to monitor passenger information, which is in fact a prerequisite for enforcing these new rules."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"Questions 63, 64 and 77 will not be answered because they deal with topics that are already included in the order of business for the current part-session."
"That concludes questions to the Commission."
"We now continue with the debate on the report by Karin Jöns on the establishment of a Community programme for employment and social solidarity."
"– Mr President, the fact that the European institutions have finally adopted a common position on the PROGRESS programme, which deals with employment and social solidarity, is a very important step towards drawing up and implementing a coherent and transparent social policy in the European Union and translating it into the national social policies of the Member States."
"The PROGRESS programme not only simplifies and puts the specific elements of this policy in order, but it also integrates them into a single framework."
"This is something that had been lacking previously and which will be the key result of our joint debate."
"It is right and proper for the programme to be divided into five parts."
"Employment is the main challenge currently facing the European Union, its decision-makers and its citizens."
"Social security and social integration can be treated as two separate fields but it was probably appropriate to include them both under one section, as social security can be viewed as one of the prerequisites for successful social integration."
"Good working conditions complement a policy that aims to improve employment not only in terms of quantity but also in terms of quality."
"The fight against discrimination and the promotion of diversity represent the practical implementation of the principle of positive tolerance and pluralism which should be, and I think is, one of the hallmarks of the European Union."
"Creating full gender equality amounts to the implementation of a principle that was adopted in the Treaty of Rome, but which has not been fully implemented until now."
"I would like to make two further comments."
"First of all, employment is our primary challenge and should be a priority in terms of funding."
"However, gender equality is just as important as the fight against discrimination and the fostering of diversity."
"I would also like to point out that we have not focused sufficiently on social dialogue, without which we cannot implement the PROGRESS programme."
"As far as access to the programme is concerned, it is right to list the institutions and organisations that are entitled to it."
"The PROGRESS programme will make a key contribution to achieving the objectives of our social agenda."
". – Mr President, we, too, welcome this report on PROGRESS."
"We hope that it is the urgently needed tail wind for EU gender equality policy."
"In the wake of the Commission’s disappointing gender equality roadmap, it is all the more important that as much money as possible be made available for carrying out analyses and public-relations activities relating to EU gender equality policy in the EU Member States."
"I am pleased that my fellow Members have put the brakes on the Commission’s rationalisation pressure, or are set to do so, and have insisted on an increase in funding for PROGRESS."
"It is thanks to Parliament’s persistence that the resources for employment and social solidarity have been increased."
"As we all know, politicians are powerless to act without money."
"The objective of gender equality policy must be to provide the necessary resources, therefore, because it is impossible to continue this policy without money."
"It was a success for Parliament that it managed to push through obligatory gender mainstreaming in all programme areas."
"Admittedly we did not succeed in pushing through an independent action programme, but we did push through a cross-cutting task."
"Mr President, the PROGRESS programme plays an important role in promoting employment and social solidarity and it is all the more important as, increasingly, the drive to put profits before people excludes and marginalises so many."
"We are disappointed that Parliament's proposals were not accepted in their entirety and that the Council decided to weaken the programme in the areas of equality, migrant rights and, crucially, in relation to the budget."
"However, we believe it is important not to delay the implementation of the programme, otherwise much important work could not take place."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for her efforts to strengthen the programme and I hope that in the future we can work together to prioritise EU action to combat social exclusion."
"– Mr President, I would like to express my support for all the activities of the European institutions intended to foster growth in the fields of employment and social solidarity and especially for those activities related to PROGRESS, the new Community programme we are currently discussing."
"I hope that this programme will not turn into yet another ineffective instrument, swallowing up our joint resources."
"I hope that instead, it will contribute directly to changing the difficult situation that many European Union countries face in this area."
"I would like to highlight the fact that the issue at stake here is preserving the European social model in the face of a demographic slump that is spreading throughout Europe."
"The situation in the Scandinavian countries proves it is possible to implement this model at the same time as maintaining a reasonable level of economic growth."
"Of course, the key to success in Scandinavia is a high employment rate, which usually stands at above 70% for both men and women."
"Meanwhile, we know that these rates are significantly lower in the majority of the Member States."
"In Poland, for example, the employment rate stands at barely 51% for men and 46% for women."
"It seems very clear that it is absolutely vital to provide support in the field of employment, especially in the new Member States."
"The problem of poverty and social exclusion is another very important matter."
"We cannot allow a situation to persist where people are living in poverty, or going hungry, at the heart of Europe, which is one of the richest areas of the globe."
"In Poland, over 10% of the population live below the poverty line."
"I hope that the PROGRESS programme will contribute to improving the situation."
"Wealthy Europe ought to show more solidarity towards social groups which find themselves in a very difficult financial situation."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for her work on PROGRESS, a new and comprehensive structure for social solidarity."
"For many years, social partners have been viewing social funding, human resources and even goodwill as a cake for which they, like hungry children, have felt compelled to compete."
"PROGRESS will hopefully take the competition out of the allocation of funding and other resources to social partners representing people who, because of their situation in life – physical, mental, social, ethnic, economic, employment or lack of employment, and so on – need the support of the wider community."
"I should like to stress once more that within PROGRESS there needs to be room for small and new NGOs."
"They need to be encouraged to survive and to thrive."
"It cannot only be the older, bigger NGOs, unions and organisations that are recognised and involved."
"Needs change and new needs arise."
"We need to remember that the well-established groups were once small too."
"Mr President, hopefully it will be equally on time!"
"I welcome this new Community programme, which brings together four previous programmes and seeks to streamline them and to provide more money for their implementation."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, my own Group, Commissioner Špidla and the Council for largely agreeing the amendments which Parliament put forward and which the Commission fought hard for."
"It is important that more money is available, but it is also important that we should seek here to enhance the socially-inclusive Europe citizens clearly desire."
"I am particularly pleased that we have achieved the inclusion of gender mainstreaming in this new programme."
"I look forward to our sharing experiences with each other through organisations across Europe at conferences and so on. It is a sad fact that the European Union has, over many years, engaged in a lot of pilot projects, but a lot of the lessons that have been learnt in those projects and programmes have not been mainstreamed."
"Hopefully the achievement of gender mainstreaming, at least in this programme, will ensure that gender mainstreaming is part of all policies developed by the European Union and the Member States."
"– Mr President, implementation of the Lisbon Strategy is a very ambitious objective that the leaders of the European Union have set the Member States."
"The different experiences of individual Member States in areas such as employment demonstrate just how ambitious this objective is."
"There are some examples where employment levels have approached the indicators set."
"I would remind you that these rates are set at 70% for men, 60% for women and 50% for the 55 - 64 age group."
"However, there are countries, especially amongst the new Member States of the European Union, that are a long way from achieving the aims of this strategy."
"Bearing this in mind, I must once again applaud the initiative to create PROGRESS, a new employment and social solidarity programme for the Community."
"As a member of the PPE-DE Group, I would like to stress at this juncture that ever since the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs began its work, my group has been in favour of increasing funding for specific fields of action while, at the same time, decreasing the 10% target reserve which was stipulated in the draft programme."
"The PPE-DE Group specifically stressed the need to decrease the beneficiaries’ own contributions."
"This is why we welcome the fact that the funding for the PROGRESS programme has been increased to EUR 743 million."
"Fortunately, this increase has already been agreed within the framework of an interinstitutional agreement and included in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective."
"Finally, I welcome the fact that the Council’s common position contains most of the amendments tabled by the European Parliament This is particularly a positive step in terms of making better use of resources to ensure that women and disabled people are more active in the labour market."
"The low level of employment, especially amongst disabled people, is a particular problem in my country and I hope that thanks to the PROGRESS programme, we will be able to remedy this situation within the next seven years."
"– Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, on the efficacy of the enterprise."
"The Progress Community programme is a very important tool for achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in the field of employment and social policy."
"The importance of this tool is reflected in the agreement of all the institutions of the European Union."
"We need to emphasise that the reference to full and equal access for disabled persons to all activities funded under the Progress programme helps to achieve the basic objectives of the programme, in other words combating discrimination and social integration."
"At the same time, however, I wish to emphasise that I consider the provision for additional economic and other encumbrances caused by disability to be counterbalanced to be particularly important, in order to ensure equal participation of persons with disabilities in the programme's activities."
"Finally, I wish to emphasise the need for non-governmental organisations representing persons with disabilities to participate at regional, national and European level in the works provided for in the programmes, which are designed to transfer best practices and exchange information and raise public awareness about integration and social protection issues."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, the Commissioner and the Council on having worked so quickly and so well."
"Thanks to them, Europe will have this instrument from 1 January, and I hope that it will be, as we have said, a leap forward in terms of improving the coherence and complementarity of the existing programmes."
"Secondly, Mr President, I would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that we are taking the Lisbon process seriously in its entirety."
"That process obliges us to implement an economic reform and, undoubtedly, a modernisation of Europe, but at the same time to remember that, in order to ensure that the economic reform is a success, we must build a more cohesive and inclusive society."
"Now that PROGRESS is on the table, I believe that those who say that the social Europe is purely an issue for the Member States are mistaken."
"Europe has much to say and much to do and, although it is clearly still the Member States which are building their welfare states, Europe offers added value in the form of coherence and intelligence and helps our Member States to deal with the immense challenges facing us in this era of globalisation."
"I therefore hope that the Commission will act intelligently. It is a small instrument financially speaking, but it must be used very intelligently."
"I hope that we can maintain this approach of working together, of not losing sight of our priorities and of making our Agenda the citizens' Agenda."
"– Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Karin Jöns for this excellent programme."
"In light of the Lisbon Strategy, I consider it very important to take such initiatives, the aim of which is to improve employment, strengthen social solidarity and thus to make the European Union more competitive."
"We need ambitious goals: restoring full employment, improving the quality and productivity of labour and strengthening social solidarity."
"In this regard, I wish to emphasise in particular the part of the programme that devotes special attention to gender mainstreaming, the implementation of the principle of gender equality in social policy."
"I am also pleased that the report strives to take into consideration the special needs of people with disabilities."
"In working out and implementing the programme, I consider due cooperation with other committees to be important as well."
"In my opinion, the protection of minorities, and in particular of the Roma minorities, should constitute a separate section of the report, and perhaps it would be worth devoting proportionately more funds to the financing of gender equality."
"The implementation of PROGRESS calls for European-wide sharing of information and the dissemination of best practices throughout the entire Community, if we want to achieve these goals."
"All in all, we have before us a programme that can be realised only through collaboration across Europe, something that deserves our support in every area."
"Mr President, I am going to talk solely about actions aimed at equality between men and women."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when in the middle of 2004 we all hoped that the European Commission would launch a new action plan for equality between men and women, we were surprised to find that, instead, the Commission proposed PROGRESS, a programme for promoting employment and solidarity, which included actions to promote equality between men and women but within a broader framework of social action."
"In the belief that it was still necessary to pay greater and more differentiated attention to equality between men and women, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality was opposed, from the outset, to incorporating the programme on equality between men and women into PROGRESS, and it also called for greater budgetary resources and insisted on the need for equality between men and women to be treated as something common to all Community policies."
"An important and positive negotiation therefore began, which has been maintained throughout the parliamentary procedure that is ending today, with results that we can describe as more than reasonable."
"Actions aimed at equality between men and women are being kept within PROGRESS, and that is something that we do not find satisfactory. We achieved the separation of the DAPHNE Programme, but that has not been possible here."
"We are still calling for greater visibility for equality policies, but we must congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, the draftspeople for the committees’ opinions and also the Commission and the Council, because their joint work has made it possible substantially to improve the initial proposal in terms of funding and content and in terms of integrating the gender perspective into all of the programme’s actions."
"Honourable Members, I should like once again to thank the rapporteur and all those who contributed to this report, which as I can see from the discussion is seen as a joint success of the European institutions."
"It is clear from the discussion that the programme is regarded as being sensibly arranged and equipped with the appropriate resources."
"It is also clear that the manner in which the report was submitted is regarded as being appropriate to the situation – and at this point I should like to highlight the fact that the report will be submitted directly to Parliament."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must seize the opportunity to ensure that, from 1 January 2007, we pursue an effective and successful implementation of all of the aims and objectives envisaged in the programme, thereby fulfilling the expectations that are sure to have arisen through the success of this phase."
"I should like to thank all the speakers, 50% of whom were women."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"- the report by Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision amending and extending Decision 2001/923/EC establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the ‘Pericles’ programme) (COM(2006)0243 – C6-0179/2006 – 2006/0078(CNS)) (A6-0276/2006), and"
"- the report by Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision extending to the non-participating Member States the application of Decision 2006/…/EC amending and extending Decision 2001/923/EC establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the ‘Pericles’ programme) (COM(2006)0243 – C6-0180/2006 – 2006/0079(CNS)) (A6-0277/2006)."
"Mr President, allow me first to express my sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, for his support for the Commission’s proposal for the extension of the Pericles programmes."
"Pericles, a Community programme for exchange, assistance and training in the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, was established by a Council decision in 2001 and is designed to support and supplement the measures undertaken by the Member States to protect the euro against counterfeiting."
"With an initial duration of four years – 2002 to 2005 – it had a total reference amount of EUR 4 million."
"The Pericles programme covers a broad range of actions organised not just within the EU, but also in third or candidate countries."
"Its action incorporates diversified target groups and participants, covering all the areas relevant to the protection of the euro – law enforcement, judicial, financial and technical – and promoting the creation of networks useful in achieving greater efficiency in the fight against the crime of counterfeiting."
"In addition, Pericles assists the increased effectiveness of cooperation between law enforcement agents and representatives of the judiciary and financial institutions."
"Nevertheless, the counterfeiting of euros remains a serious and especially a symbolic problem, even if its proportions are not alarming."
"Since early summer 2003, the number of counterfeit euro banknotes detected in circulation has stabilised at about 50 000 a month, a level below the pre-euro levels, lower than the US dollar and extremely low compared to the 9 million genuine euro banknotes in circulation."
"The number of counterfeit euro coins also remains low by historical standards."
"Recently police forces have successfully conducted a number of operations to dismantle workshops and seize large numbers of counterfeit banknotes and coins before they enter into circulation."
"The Pericles programme is playing a significant role in achieving results in the protection of the euro and the fight against the crime of counterfeiting."
"There is clearly a need for continued joint efforts to combat this form of crime."
"The Pericles programme has recently been evaluated."
"The evaluators concluded that the programme did indeed improve awareness, its target groups have been reached, especially law enforcement officials, and its activities and information exchanges were considered relevant to the objectives of the programme."
"Based on the positive evaluation of Pericles and the continued need, in 2005 the Commission proposed the extension of the programme."
"Pending an agreement on the Community financial perspectives for the period 2007-2013, the Council initially decided to extend the Pericles programme for one year only, until 2006, but made a political commitment to the continuation of the programme."
"Consequently, building on the success the programme has demonstrated, in May 2006 the Commission tabled a proposal for a Council decision concerning the extension of the Pericles programme for the period 2007-2013."
"The yearly amount remains unchanged, approximately EUR 1 million, leading to an overall reference amount of EUR 7 million."
"The Commission’s proposal for extension until 2013 also reflects the practical convenience of fitting in with the duration of the Community’s financial framework."
"Once more I would like to thank Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, for their attention to the protection of this important element of the common European identity and heritage that is its common currency."
"The public authorities at national and European level, as well as industry, have to keep up their efforts and continue cooperation and the exchange of know-how."
"It is through our combined efforts that we will be able to protect the interests of tradesmen, consumers and the economy in general against illicit gain from the counterfeiting of our money."
"Mr President, the protection of the euro against counterfeiting is very important in terms of maintaining the citizens’ confidence in the single currency."
"I agree with everything that Mr Kallas has said."
"The introduction of the euro as a single currency was a huge challenge."
"The dollar, as a currency of a transnational nature, a reserve currency and a currency of global transaction, is presently the most counterfeited currency."
"Unfortunately, the euro shares these features with the dollar, though to a lesser extent, and that is why, since its birth, we have had to adopt and adapt many measures aimed at preventing its counterfeiting."
"The Pericles programme is intended to support and complement the actions introduced by the Member States and by the existing programmes for protecting the euro by means of exchanges, assistance and training with a view to protecting our single currency against counterfeiting."
"As we know, the programme was established by means of the Council Decision of 17 December 2001, which stated that assessment reports on the programme must be presented, accompanied by a proposal on its continuation or adaptation."
"The first report was published and presented to Parliament and the Council on 30 November 2004."
"Then, on 8 April, the Commission presented a proposal on the basis of which the Council extended the programme to 2006, providing it with a budget of EUR 1 million and requiring a detailed report on the results of the programme to be presented to Parliament and the Commission."
"With regard to assessment, Pericles has made a very clear positive contribution to the protection of the euro and the fight against counterfeiting."
"Its continuation is therefore fully justified."
"In particular, the perception of the Community dimension of the euro has been improved and it has given the participants a better understanding of the legislation and instruments available; an overall commitment of 80% of the initial reference sum during the period 2002-2006 has been achieved; 64 projects have been implemented involving 76 countries; the effective complementarity of national and Community actions has been emphasised − 48 of the 64 initiatives emerged from the Member States, while 16 came from the Commission or OLAF; the programme has taken on an international dimension, with the involvement not just of all of the Members States and those about to join, but also of other non-EU countries in which the production of counterfeit banknotes is widespread, such as Colombia; considerable structural improvements have been made, with the creation and establishment in several countries of national central offices responsible for combating the counterfeiting of the currency; and there has been systematic involvement of the European Central Bank and other organisations, such as Europol, OLAF and Interpol."
"The results of the Pericles programme so far are hopeful, as indicated in the six-monthly report of the European Central Bank on the counterfeiting of the euro."
"It is becoming increasingly difficult to counterfeit our currency."
"The data corresponding to the first six months of this year show that the proportion of counterfeit banknotes is falling in relation to the increase in the number of genuine notes put into circulation."
"As the Commissioner has already said, 50 000 notes of our currency are counterfeited each month, while there are 9 000 million genuine notes in circulation."
"Between January and June of this year, 300 000 counterfeit notes were withdrawn from circulation."
"Of all the counterfeit notes withdrawn during the first half of this year, 44% were 20 euro notes and 36% were 50 euro notes, which means that there has been a significant increase in the counterfeiting of 20 euro notes."
"Twelve per cent of all counterfeit notes were 100 euro notes, while 500 euro notes represented just 1%."
"In short, Mr President, I very much agree with the proposal."
"It is of crucial importance that the Community legislator ensure that the extension of the programme be properly linked both to the financial perspective and to the introduction of the euro in the new States."
"The Council is postponing the Pericles decision until a final agreement has been adopted on the financial perspective for 2007-2013; we entirely agree that it should conform to the financial perspective, with an annual budget of EUR 1 million."
"For all of these reasons, I recommend that, under these conditions, the European Parliament approve the Commission's proposals, modifying and extending the Pericles programme."
"I would like to say one more thing, Mr President. I wish to protest at the change of time for this debate."
"I have not been consulted and I have not been given any explanation."
"I should have been with the victims of terrorism from my country, but I am here out of respect for all of you."
"When I finish my speech, I shall leave to be with them and I would like to offer all of you, and you in particular, Mr Kallas, the apologies that you deserve - apologies such as I, for my part, was not given."
"I hope that you understand my reasons for having to leave."
"Apparently the actual timetable has not been changed."
"However, we began the Rapkay report this morning and we then went on with the continuation as foreseen in the original agenda."
"However, thank you for your observations."
"I am sorry that it caused you difficulties."
"Mr President, I am speaking with full knowledge of the facts and I believe that you should be aware of them too."
"I have here the agenda, with the timetable and the schedule for voting on the two Pericles reports this morning."
"The two Pericles reports should have been voted on this morning, and here it is in black and white, Mr President."
"I would therefore like to offer my apologies for leaving the Chamber now – apologies such as I, for my part, was not given."
"We understand your position."
"We will write you a letter explaining what has happened, from this perspective."
"Thank you for your observations and I am sorry that you were put to such discomfort."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, in the euro, we have one of the safest currencies in the world, and that is the way it should remain."
"It should not be taken for granted, however, as permanent measures are needed to keep it that way."
"By this I mean the technical measures that have been taken and are still being taken in the case of renewal, on the one hand, and training and exchanges on the other."
"Pericles as a supporting action programme – which has been extremely successful to date, with 64 projects and over 3 000 participants from 76 countries – shows the great interest there has in fact been in this action programme."
"Counterfeiting and losses have been reduced."
"I can give an example for my country, Austria, namely that, in the last year, seizures have been down by more than 40% and losses have been reduced by more than 50%."
"The programme can take some of the credit for this."
"Evaluation by OLAF has also revealed certain weaknesses, however."
"I am obliged to the Commission and the rapporteur for taking the opportunity this presents to set in motion the new Pericles programme, which runs until 2013."
"I consider it particularly important that new priorities are being set, for example in the field of practical training and of personnel exchanges and, looking ahead to the new generation of euro notes, specific training in the new technical aspects."
"I also welcome the extension to countries wishing to introduce the euro, that is to say, to the partner countries in which counterfeiting is in fact taking place, and also specifically to groups of people who have not been covered up to now to the same extent as by the first part, when the programme was used particularly for law-enforcement authorities."
"We must now appeal to the Member States to make optimum use of the programme, so that we can look to the future with optimism and make the euro the safest currency in the world."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to endorse the Council decision of 30 January 2006 amending and extending Decision 2001/923/EC establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, for which I am a shadow rapporteur."
"The decision also provides for the extension of the programme to the non-participating Member States."
"The main aim of the programme is, by means of exchange, assistance and training, to ensure uniform protection of the euro in all Member States while taking account of the individual situation in each country."
"In May this year the Commission presented an evaluation document that was generally favourable, because of the major contribution made by the programme in protecting the euro and fighting counterfeiting."
"The Pericles programme has allowed us to identify geographical areas, such as Colombia, for instance, where false banknotes tend to be produced easily."
"This has been possible because better structures have been created through the setting-up of national centres committed to the fight against the counterfeiting of our currency."
"It is important, therefore, to continue to ensure cooperation among the European institutions – the Commission, OLAF, the European Central Bank and Europol – making it possible to identify those areas where counterfeiting of the euro occurs most."
"Extending the programme will make it possible to continue surveillance, training and technical assistance, which are vital activities for maintaining the protection of the euro against counterfeiting."
"The programme also leads to greater effectiveness by extending technical assistance and even offering financial assistance for cooperation in cross-border operations, thanks to the participation of Europol."
"The new Member States deserve particular attention, above all those that are going to introduce the euro as the single currency."
"To conclude, I am in favour both of continuing the programme, as proposed by the Council, and of extending it to the non-participating Member States, so that the necessary measures can be adopted to ensure a uniform level of protection of the euro even in the Member States that have not yet adopted it as their official currency."
"."
"Mr President, we are in agreement with the Council’s decision to extend the duration of the Pericles programme."
"Extending the programme to Member States that are not in the euro zone is necessary and desirable."
"It is, after all, of huge importance that the trust in the euro should not be undermined by counterfeiting."
"There are two aspects that cause us to raise questions at the moment surrounding the euro."
"The first of these is the use of the euro as legal tender in countries outside the euro zone."
"The euro is being widely accepted particularly in Montenegro and Turkey."
"Can Commissioner Kallas indicate in what way those countries are being involved in the programme in order to fight counterfeiting and the bringing into circulation of counterfeit euro coins?"
"In 2004, the European Parliament adopted the report on medals and coins that resemble euro coins."
"There was a huge increase in fraud involving coins that resemble euro coins."
"Commissioner, could you say whether the Council’s regulation on this subject has had any impact?"
"– Mr President, ever since a decision was made to create a common currency in the European Union within the framework of the Maastricht Treaty, it has been necessary to contend with the dangers which arise in connection with the project."
"Counterfeiting has existed ever since people became aware of the value of counterfeit goods."
"It is extremely important to combat the production of counterfeit euros in order to maintain the citizens' trust in the common currency."
"At the moment, it is essential for Community legislation to ensure that the way in which the programme is extended takes account of the deadline for introducing the euro in the new Member States and the entry into circulation of a second series of euro banknotes."
"It is also necessary to ensure that competences in this important process do not overlap and to make sure that all the joint activities of the various institutions complement each other and are compatible."
"It seems essential for the European Commission and Europol to jointly assess new projects that are to be funded within the framework of the PERICLES programme."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we accept that the euro needs to be adequately protected by means of a range of integrated, effective measures involving close cooperation at both European and international level."
"We therefore welcome the creation of the Pericles programme."
"We support this detailed report submitted to Parliament on the implementation and results of this programme, and wish to highlight the fact that the results have clearly been good."
"In the second half of 2003 the number of false banknotes in circulation levelled off. The figures were favourable in comparison both with those prior to the introduction of the euro and with levels of counterfeiting of the US dollar."
"Although the number of counterfeit euro coins continues to rise, this figure is still low in comparison with the counterfeiting of the old coins."
"In other words, the level of counterfeiting is low, a major factor in which is the high level of cooperation among the relevant services."
"Action has been taken to dismantle counterfeiting operations and to confiscate significant amounts of counterfeit notes and coins prior to their entry into circulation."
"This programme has therefore largely achieved its objectives, and has made it possible to identify the places, both within and outside the Community, where production of counterfeit notes is at its highest."
"It has also led to considerable structural improvements. In a number of countries, for example, central bodies charged with combating euro counterfeiting have been set up."
"I therefore endorse Mr Díaz de Mera’s excellent report, the aim of which is to extend the programme until the end of 2013 so as to align its period of validity with the financial perspective. Furthermore – and this is a point I wish to emphasise – it is aimed at extending its application to the non-participating Member States."
"– Mr President, the extension of the Pericles programme is undoubtedly important."
"It is no good praising the euro as unforgeable and giving it various security features, however, if our citizens and cashiers are unfamiliar with these features or unable to use them properly."
"It is true that there is greater awareness now and EUR 100 and higher denomination notes are tested, but, since counterfeit EUR 20 and EUR 50 notes now make up approximately 80% of fakes, we must increase awareness of the problems still further."
"Unfortunately, the large size of the area using the euro, in particular, makes the production of high-quality counterfeit coins attractive to counterfeiters."
"In addition, the progress made in the field of printing technology has made it increasingly difficult for the lay person to distinguish genuine from counterfeit notes."
"With approximately 600 000 counterfeit notes withdrawn from circulation each year, much work certainly remains to be done, all the more so because, in addition to the rising figures for these, coins are increasingly arousing the interest of counterfeiters."
"The only way to tackle the increase in counterfeiting is by raising awareness, which was the idea behind organising more workshops on the subject, including by, or in, the EU information outlets."
"It would make particular sense to increase the provision of information in each of the regions in which increasing numbers of fakes – counterfeit money – have been found."
"It may also make sense to extend the search project by means of text-messaging business people to enable the perpetrators to be arrested, which is already being done in Austria with some success."
"At all events, making the eurozone an area with an unforgeable currency should be an important preoccupation of all of ours."
"Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, for his work in this field. It may not be a very exciting area, but it is a very important one."
"Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra has drafted a fine report, as I am keen to point out, as I myself was the rapporteur on this matter when it was one of the topics of the day during the last election campaign."
"At that time, opinions were a little more divided, especially with regard to which denominations would be counterfeited."
"The line taken by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats subsequently proved to be the right one."
"Many people thought that the EUR 500 notes would be the ones most counterfeited, but we in the PPE-DE Group were of the opinion that the smaller denominations, such as the EUR 20 and EUR 50 notes, would be at greater risk."
"I am pleased to see that Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra is in favour of the idea of careful monitoring also in countries where the euro has not yet been introduced."
"The risk of counterfeits is, more often than not, greater in these countries, as the populations have not had the same level of preparation as in the Eurozone countries."
"It is harder for people in these countries to tell the difference between real and fake notes and, in many cases, people are often less suspicious too."
"Fortunately, counterfeiting has been a much smaller problem than had been feared, perhaps due to the very Pericles programme that we are discussing, and especially due to the large scope that it has been given."
"This is another example of something good that the EU has done."
"This is an area where we no longer have so much conflict, but there is every reason to inform people about this programme, which protects us all in our everyday lives."
"I am grateful to Members for their comments and their support for the Pericles programme, which tries to fight counterfeiting."
"Counterfeiting is politically a very serious crime, which somehow humiliates the authorities, but the fight against it is eternal."
"The fight against the counterfeiting of euro coins in the European Union has been relatively successful."
"The cooperation between the European Central Bank, Europol and OLAF has also been relatively efficient."
"Euro notes are of quite a high quality."
"But that does not diminish the importance of fighting counterfeiting."
"In my previous occupations I have had occasion to deal with the issue."
"The main problem is always the streets and dark bars where the counterfeit notes are put into circulation."
"That explains why EUR 500 notes are not found amongst counterfeit notes."
"One specific question was about Turkey and Montenegro."
"Montenegro is a specific issue."
"It has the euro as an official currency."
"It is not so much a question of counterfeiting as of the monetary policy of the European Union."
"I know my colleagues are thinking about how to deal with that."
"Turkey has promised – I have visited Turkey and discussed this with the Turkish authorities – to gradually phase out the coins that are quite similar to euro coins."
"To change the production process takes some time, but at least they have made a promise to do so."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"The next item is the report by Panayiotis Demetriou, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Framework Decision on taking account of convictions in the Member States of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings (COM(2005)0091 – C6-0235/2005 – 2005/0018(CNS)) (A6-0268/2006)."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his report and for the excellent cooperation."
"Currently, little, if any, account is taken of convictions handed down in other Member States."
"That is not acceptable in an area of freedom, security and justice."
"That is why the objective of the EU is twofold: first, information on criminal convictions should circulate efficiently between the Member States, and secondly, it should be possible to use that information outside the territory of the sentencing Member State."
"The main objective of the proposal is to define the conditions under which a conviction handed down in another Member State can be taken into account in new criminal proceedings concerning different facts."
"As the effects attached to the existence of a previous conviction can vary widely from one Member State to another, the proposal does not aim at harmonising those effects."
"The core principle – which I fully agree with – is, rather, a principle of assimilation where the objective is to ensure that those effects are equivalent to those of a previous national conviction."
"In line with that principle, the proposal is not limited to the trial stage but covers the various stages of criminal proceedings where national law can attach effects to a previous conviction."
"It encompasses the pre-trial stage where the existence of a previous conviction can, for example, influence decisions on pre-trial detention, as well as the post-trial stage where they can notably have an impact on the execution of the sentence."
"The Commission fully supports this report and looks forward to cooperating closely with the rapporteur."
"– Mr President, the proposal for taking into account previous convictions in the European Union is part of the institutional regulations being promoted by the Commission within the framework of the implementation of the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere and I should like at this point to praise vice-president Commissioner Frattini on the efforts he is making to implement these conclusions of the European Council in Tampere."
"The proposal is another step in the direction of the enlargement of judicial cooperation and the development of confidence between the Member States in the field of justice."
"It is another measure to promote the principle of the mutual recognition of civil and criminal judgments, which is considered to be the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in the Union."
"The institution whereby account is taken of previous convictions needs to be introduced in order to combat crime more effectively, especially as the existing relevant European conventions of 1959 and 1970 have proven to be ineffective."
"The proposal as formulated is confined to the regulation of issues of substantive law."
"The regulation of procedural issues has been left within the framework of the other proposal which is pending in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and is being processed by our honourable friend and rapporteur Díaz de Mera."
"That proposal is the other side of the same coin."
"With the proposal to be put to the vote, administrative convictions are excluded from the definition of a conviction, because in most Member States they are not recorded in the register of convictions and because there is no uniform definition as to what constitutes an administrative conviction."
"The assimilation of the importance and gravity of a conviction handed down by a court in another Member State with a conviction handed down in the Member State in which the new criminal proceedings are taking place is being promoted."
"Thus, in the event of a conviction for a crime which does not exist in the Member State trying the new case, the conviction is not taken into account."
"The proposal is free of the confusion and uncertainty which would exist if the provisions of the original proposal for the selective taking into account of previous convictions and offences had been adopted, but retains the obligation of the Member State not to take account of convictions handed down in another Member State where the principle of non bis in idem, limitation or amnesty are infringed."
"We are of the opinion that, as the proposal to be put to the vote has been formulated, it adequately serves both the principle of mutual recognition of court judgments and the policy of gradual assimilation of the law."
"It should be emphasised once again that the present measure, like other similar measures, is based on the principles of mutual recognition and confidence."
"However, it is important for the Council to proceed as quickly as possible with the approval of the drastic proposal for the minimum criteria in criminal proceedings, which was voted through many months ago by the European Parliament and will strengthen the above principles."
"Why is the Council delaying on such an important issue?"
"Finally, I welcome the statement the other day by the Finnish Presidency about intensifying the drafting of legislation and the monitoring of the application of decisions relating to criminal matters."
"Let us hope that this statement will be put into practice."
"– Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, over the last seven years we have witnessed the development of tools, such as the European arrest warrant or the transfer of prisoners, which are designed to strengthen mutual confidence between the national judicial authorities and the development of a policy leading to the convergence of criminal law."
"Now we are approving the Commission decision to establish a new system, on the basis of which the Member States will be able to take account, in criminal proceedings, of previous convictions against the same person handed down in another Member State of the European Union."
"Previous convictions handed down in other Member States will have the same force as those handed down in the Member State in which the new criminal proceedings are to be instituted."
"I should like to add something else to the other arguments about the need for the measure expounded by Mr Demetriou: that this is absolutely logical, because previous convictions shape the personality of the offender and play a role in assessing the punishment."
"To close, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, who succeeded, with his amendments, in reconciling the views of the Council and the Commission, which differed considerably on certain basic points."
"Finally, I hope that the statement by the Finnish Presidency will not remain a statement, but will start to be put into practice."
"We need to take faster steps to unify criminal law."
"Mr President, while taking into account the current diversity of national judicial systems, it is highly desirable to promote mutual recognition of judgments between the European Union Member States."
"As already indicated by the Tampere European Council, the mutual recognition principle is the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters."
"That being so, it is of the utmost importance to lay down an appropriate legal basis, so that a conviction handed down in one Member State can be taken into account in new criminal proceedings against the same person concerning different facts in other Member States."
"The Commission proposal for a framework decision should be approved as amended."
"The object of the mutual recognition principle is to confer the same validity and the same effect on convictions handed down in other Member States as on previous national convictions."
"It should be explicitly stated that the Member State is not required to enforce the conviction handed down in another Member State, but just to draw the appropriate conclusions from the earlier case in the new proceedings."
"Furthermore, the effects of previous convictions will still be governed by national laws in each Member State."
"A principle of assimilation of judgments given in other Member States to national convictions should be established, still leaving it to national legislation to draw the appropriate conclusions from the principle."
"However, I have to consider it necessary for previous sentences to be taken into account, provided that their weight in the other evaluation is equal to the sentence issued by the Member State in which proceedings have been opened."
"Moreover, in the case of criminal proceedings in the Member State, a firm conviction related to acts not punishable in that Member State must not be taken into account."
"Mr President, in this report we see another example of the so-called beneficial crisis which gives the European Union the opportunity to press forward with yet more political integration."
"There is indeed a problem."
"In London, the Metropolitan Police admit that most of the organised crime is now run by a variety of ethnic gangs, many of them from EU countries."
"This is quite apart from individual criminals who have come to Britain to pursue their professions."
"The real problem lies with Britain’s open border policy and the right of EU citizens to unhindered entry to the UK, as well as the Government’s complete abdication of any control over who can and cannot come in from anywhere in the world."
"But the telling part of this report is the reference to the Tampere European Council which intends to force a European system of justice on the UK and the comment that ‘there is a long way to go until justice is procedurally, evidentially and substantially administered in a more or less similar way in all the Member States’."
"Yes, indeed there is, and long may it remain so."
"Britain still has – the right to trial by jury and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty – and some of us in Britain intend, and want, that we should keep those safeguards."
"The UK Independence Party’s response to this report is ‘thanks, but no thanks’."
"– (PL) Mr President, the framework decision that we are debating is particularly important as regards the assimilation and harmonisation of legislation."
"I agree with the rapporteur that national law should be the only criterion determining whether, and to what extent, legal effects should be attached to previous convictions handed down abroad."
"However, we should not forget basic principles such as , the statute of limitations, amnesty or removal of entries from the national criminal register."
"I therefore think that we should retain Article 4."
"We should also emphasise that, during the course of criminal proceedings in a Member State, we cannot allow convictions handed down abroad to be taken into account if they relate to acts that are not punishable in the Member State in question."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the best place for the provisions contained in Article 6 is in the proposal concerning the Council framework decision on the exchange between the Member States of information pertaining to the criminal register and its contents."
"Mr President, as in the case of many EU harmonising proposals there is a certain simplistic and plausible appeal to mutual recognition of criminal convictions throughout the Community."
"But make no mistake: it is part of a grand design for an integrated and EU-controlled criminal justice system requiring, of necessity, the subservience of national systems."
"For me, criminal justice matters are intrinsically national issues and must remain so."
"Hence I welcome the resistance at last Friday’s Council of Ministers meeting to a further surrender of the national veto."
"I hope it will be sustained."
"Not only because of my opposition to the grand design of which it is part but because it diminishes the protection of my constituents against unfairness, I oppose this proposal."
"The savage experience of British citizens abroad confirms my view that we have much to lose from criminal justice integration."
"Remember the spectacle made of the British plane spotters in Greece."
"Remember the appalling conviction of Kevin Sweeney in Holland."
"Why should it be possible for ropey convictions, secured by lesser standards than those applicable in the United Kingdom, to be held against United Kingdom citizens in their own country?"
"I say they should not."
"Therefore, I oppose this proposal."
"In the protection of my constituents, my watchword is ‘British standards for British citizens’."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"The next item is the recommendation from the Committee on Regional Development on the proposal for a Council decision on Community strategic guidelines on cohesion (11807/2006 – C6 0266/2006 – 2006/0131(AVC)) (Rapporteur: Constanze Angela Krehl) (A6-0281/2006)."
"Mr President, let me start by saying, on behalf of Commissioner Špidla and myself, that we very much welcome the report on strategic guidelines for cohesion adopted by Parliament’s Committee on Regional Development on 11 September."
"In particular I should like to thank Mrs Krehl for her hard work in drafting the report and also for the good cooperation we have enjoyed over the past year on the dossier."
"I have been grateful for the support and ideas of the Committee on Regional Development and Parliament during this period on what is perhaps the most important and innovative part of the new cohesion policy for 2007-2013."
"Through the guidelines we are seeking to ensure that Community priorities are more fully integrated into national and regional development programmes supported by the Union."
"The guidelines seek to provide a clear and consistent approach in support of growth and jobs under the renewed Lisbon Strategy."
"I believe that the guidelines have benefited considerably from Parliament’s contribution."
"I would draw your attention to the recitals that have been added to the document since Parliament produced its report last May."
"These are important in the sense that they reveal the political orientation that lies behind the guidelines."
"The recitals draw heavily on the suggestions in the report drafted by Mrs Krehl."
"For example, they draw attention to the importance of partnership (recital 16), to the contribution of infrastructure to convergence (recital 11), to equality of opportunity and the fight against discrimination (recital 15), to the importance of development that is sustainable in environmental terms (recital 14), to territorial cohesion and to the urban dimension (recital 12)."
"It is worth noting that in adopting these recitals the Council and the Member States are in effect writing a memo to themselves on how the next programmes should be run."
"This is clearly very important for us as we look forward to the programme negotiations."
"In addition to the recitals, the text of the guidelines has been reinforced in key areas of importance to Parliament."
"In particular we have given more attention to territorial cohesion."
"This includes stronger wording on the urban question."
"We have also developed the text on the three initiatives – Jasper, Jeremy and Jessica – which you have supported strongly."
"This should, among other things, make a contribution to developing the use of public/private partnerships in our programmes, which is one of the recommendations of your report on the guidelines."
"There are many other areas where I think you will find that the Commission has tried to accommodate Parliament’s wishes."
"I do not need to summarise once again the content of the document, but perhaps it would be worthwhile to remind ourselves of the vision of the new cohesion policy, which the strategic guidelines can help us to achieve."
"This vision is centred around economic development, which is increasingly being driven by local and regional resources, be it innovative small and medium-sized enterprises, local human skills or academic institutions."
"This vision is about developing our unique system of multilevel governance by taking policy closer to the local and regional levels, closer to the people and closer to the place where growth and jobs are created."
"I know that some of you expressed a wish to have more debate on strategic guidelines, so I am looking forward to hearing your views."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with today’s debate and tomorrow’s vote, Parliament is laying the keystone of two-and-a-half years’ work on preparing the legislative package on cohesion policy for the years 2007–2013."
"This is a cohesion policy that is to function with 25 – or 27 – Member States for the first time, the new Member States all being beneficiaries of the Cohesion Fund and set to draw great benefit from the future cohesion and structural policies."
"We should like tomorrow’s vote to clear the way for the conclusion, submission and approval by the Commission of the operational programmes in the regions, so as to ensure an early start to the projects in the less-favoured regions of the EU next year."
"Looking back, I should like to express my most sincere thanks for the cooperation I have received on the report on the strategic guidelines."
"The Commission proposal is good; it was a joint effort – with the Commission and the Council, that is – and I should like to mention explicitly here that we had a great deal of direct contact with the regions."
"The visits I was able to make to Lisbon, Madrid, Bratislava, Prague, Stockholm and Helsinki as rapporteur contributed considerably to the quality of the report that was subsequently adopted jointly in committee and plenary."
"I am delighted that the additional priorities Parliament wanted to introduce for the guidelines have indeed been largely reflected in the document on which the Council decided in August."
"Probably the most important point is the clear statement that we want the EU to develop in a sustainable way, that we have more in view than short-term economic objectives, but instead are striving for sustainable improvements, including in living and working conditions, particularly in the less-favoured and underdeveloped regions of the EU."
"That is why it was so important to us that access to cohesion funding be free from discrimination."
"The final document now present spells out once more that disabled and elderly people and those with a migrant background have exactly the same access to funding as everyone else."
"This is an important signal to the public in the regions."
"We have attached importance to emphasising that the EU is striving to create not just any jobs, but better-quality, sustainable jobs."
"This is closely linked to an improvement in training and in the opportunities for setting up research organisations, and also to the opportunity of bringing the results produced by these research organisations to small and medium-sized enterprises more quickly and to a greater extent."
"We have anchored all of this even more strongly in the strategic guidelines."
"Very important to us – after a long, detailed debate – is the field of support for towns, cities and urban areas, as it is there that 80% of the European population lives."
"For this reason, we must concentrate resources on this field, not only on job creation, but also, for example, on the development of transport infrastructure or the improvement of the environmental situation in towns and cities."
"We have emphasised one point in particular, and that is the territorial cooperation that is more important than ever in an enlarged EU to enable us to learn from one another and develop projects together."
"Last week, a working-group visit to Hungary gave me the first opportunity to see for myself the kind of strategically intelligent visions and ideas that are being generated in the new Member States, too."
"Perhaps some of the regions that have been receiving EU cohesion funding for years could take a leaf out of the new Member States’ book."
"For this we need to promote territorial cooperation further, however."
"A further point – about which I shall speak particularly in my role as coordinator of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament – concerns the promotion of equal opportunities in the EU, particularly for women and young people."
"In the new aid period, the Community should further draw on the success it has achieved with EQUAL and continue to operate the networks."
"This has also been incorporated into the guidelines."
"On the whole, we, Parliament, can count the negotiation results as a great success, not only for Parliament, but also for the public."
"No success or compromise can survive without a ‘but’. There is of course a ‘but’ with these guidelines, too."
"Parliament has attached great importance to enhancing cooperation with the social partners and civil society, and this has made its way into the guidelines, in the report finally adopted by the Council, but unfortunately only in significantly watered-down form."
"We, Parliament, shall be at pains to speak up again on the occasion of the mid-term review of the structural support period and revise these guidelines together."
"This will relate to the cooperation, and we shall also examine very carefully whether earmarking was really a good idea on the part of the Council, or whether it only serves to increase bureaucracy for those involved."
"If this is the case, we shall certainly press for its abolition, as Parliament has a responsibility and duty towards the public, a duty it intends to fulfil."
"– Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Krehl not only for her report but also for the hard work she has put into drawing up the European Parliament’s position."
"Parliament's report deals with the Community's strategic guidelines and is an excellent example of interinstitutional cooperation."
"The European Parliament, through the work of its Committee on Regional Development, has tried to define its expectations during the course of the legislative process and today we can say that nearly all of these expectations have been taken into account."
"It is true that there is a discrepancy between the strategic guidelines as they are presented today and the previously published list detailing Lisbon Strategy spending, which was later included as an annex to the regulation."
"Nonetheless, the Members of this House believe that we should support the final version of the strategic guidelines, as they meet our expectations."
"It could be said that, for the Member States, the strategic guidelines form an internally coherent basis for planning the implementation of cohesion policy."
"Having first adopted these guidelines by means of a Council directive, let us hope that the individual Member States will be prepared to implement them."
"An indicator of the resolve of the national governments will be, for example, the use they make of the guideline on strengthening the role of towns during the planning stage and when implementing integrated regeneration programmes."
"The strategic guidelines are indispensable for the creation of a framework for implementing cohesion policy between 2007 and 2013."
"That is why I think the House should support this proposal which takes account of the European Parliament's suggestions."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot but express my satisfaction and warm congratulations to the rapporteur on the fact that important issues which had been emphasised by the European Parliament were accepted both by the Council and by the Commission."
"I could refer, in connection with the initial text, to the improved guidelines on the principle of sustainable development in Structural Fund and Cohesion Fund interventions, of equal treatment for men and women and of non-discrimination based on gender, race, nationality, religion or disability, with emphasis on the accessibility of people with disabilities to all stages of the preparation and implementation of programmes and works, of the emphasis on the urban dimension and of the linking of urban and rural areas and partnership in general."
"One essential success factor for the programmes as far as we are concerned is the extent to which all the interested agencies – at regional and local level – will be included in their planning and implementation, especially the social partners and the local authorities."
"Achieving the objective of economic and social cohesion during the new programming period does indeed constitute a difficult challenge, at a time when inequalities in enlarged Europe are increasing and funds for applying cohesion policy are restricted."
"The strategic guidelines are an important means in the direction of more efficient and targeted distribution of funds."
"At the same time, they strengthen the strategic content of the cohesion policy and create the framework for synergy between it and the Lisbon Strategy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are at the start of a new era for the cohesion policy."
"In the new programming period and in light of the interim review, the cohesion policy will be called upon to prove – if I may say so – its raison d'être and the need for it to continue."
"All of the foregoing, together with other quality factors introduced by Parliament in either the regulations or the guidelines, will be what helps to achieve its objectives."
"The Member States and the regions must take them into account when preparing their national strategic reference frameworks and operational programmes."
"Proper application and supervision as regards their application are a matter for us all."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I will join my fellow Members in thanking Mrs Krehl for the work she has done and in thanking you, Mrs Hübner, for the quality of the relations we have had with you and with all of your services throughout the months that have led us to tomorrow’s vote."
"No one will be surprised as to how my group votes because, of course, we shall adopt this text, and we shall do so for at least two reasons."
"Firstly, it takes account not only of the majority of the requests from our group, but also, I believe, of the requests from the majority of us."
"Secondly, this matter has gone on for far longer than was scheduled, and it is therefore important that we adopt this text."
"I should like to make four comments."
"Firstly, I should like to point out to you – as my fellow Members have already done on several occasions – that, in Article 1 of the text that was adopted on 18 August by the Council, the words ‘to act as an indicative framework for the Member States’ are written in black and white, Commissioner."
"I am aware that, as things currently stand, it is considered bad form to want to impose on the 25 Heads of State or Government directives that come from the Commission or Parliament."
"I should, however, like to stress that we would have liked to have found some slightly more binding elements in this text."
"As some of my fellow Members, such as Mrs Krehl, have said, we will make sure, at mid-term, that we formulate the points of view that will be needed to change the wayward paths that may have been taken."
"Second point: I must emphasise the motivation for these strategic guidelines."
"The contacts that I currently have refer me to a Brussels ‘technostructure’ and to a Parliament that decides on strategic guidelines."
"All of that is very complicated."
"People forget too quickly, far too quickly, that it is in fact thanks to these Structural Funds and to these guidelines that, in previous years – with Portugal, Spain and Ireland – we have achieved important results, and this for the benefit of human beings who experience unfavourable circumstances in disadvantaged regions."
"They forget that our commitment to solidarity, which is being expressed today in this cohesion policy, is designed to allow all the communities and each and every inhabitant of the disadvantaged regions to have access to the same benefits as people in the more well-off regions."
"I should like briefly to say how much I welcome the flexible approach announced at the very start of this text."
"It is an approach that, in taking account of the strengths and weaknesses of each region, should enable priority to be given to transport, to the environment and to energy, in particular."
"Finally, like our fellow Members from the intergroup, who have already highlighted this point, we welcome the fact that this text emphasises the importance of cities."
"Having been in Germany myself a few days ago, I am in a position to say – and my German fellow Members will correct me if I am wrong – that 90% of the German population live in towns or cities with more than 2 000 inhabitants."
"In the text submitted to us, the importance of cities is emphasised."
"What I should like to say is that, aside from the words, aside from the financial amounts that are going to be dedicated to the Cohesion Fund, there will be the means to use the fund."
"Commissioner, in your communication on cohesion policy and the cities, you have reserved a special place for the integrated approach."
"I should like to say, at this stage in the debate, that we must remain extremely vigilant and ensure, above all, that the implementation of the integrated approaches does not only affect the cities in the strictest sense of the word, but also the communities surrounding the cities."
"We were talking about this matter with my fellow Member, Mrs Bourzai, who is present in this House, at lunch."
"It is not just the city that counts, it is all of the land that surrounds it, within a radius of 10, 20, 50 or 100 km, in which people live together on a daily basis."
"If people are to live together harmoniously, the various topics concerning transport, society and education must be linked together effectively."
"I shall conclude by saying that the actors must also have good links with each other: actors at national, regional, local and other levels."
"Just as an orchestra, with its violins and its pianos, needs a conductor in order to play well, we will ensure that there is a good conductor for all of these arrangements, one who is capable of making a success of this Cohesion Fund."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for coming so frequently to Parliament to discuss her proposals with us."
"I would like in particular to thank Mrs Krehl for her work to bring some improvements to the Commission’s original proposal, particularly in regard to partnership, the role of cities and their hinterlands, civil society, access for the disabled and the environment."
"I must, however, reiterate concerns that I have raised repeatedly about earmarking, which remains central to the Commission’s guidelines."
"It has been and will continue to be used at Member State level to downgrade much of what Parliament has sought to do and what people have spoken about here this evening."
"It champions Lisbon over Gothenburg and some elements of Lisbon over others."
"In Ireland, at present, there is another concern, unrelated to the guidelines, which I take this opportunity to raise."
"Namely, that in the future ‘Peace Programme’ funding will be distributed in a way contrary to equality measures and equality provisions."
"I hope to speak to the Commissioner further about this."
"We need to remember the original reasons for these funds and programmes and to look at them again in the mid-term review."
"As Mr Beaupuy reminded us, we in Ireland, north and south, experienced great benefits and great strides with the help of those funds."
"We have to remember our solidarity and allow other areas to do the same in the future."
"– Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Krehl on her work."
"Today, in the European Parliament, we have discussed Romania and Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union."
"In relation to that enlargement, I would like to highlight a statement contained in the introduction to the Council’s decision."
"It reads as follows: ‘The enlargement of the European Union to include 25 Member States is an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen both the economic competitiveness and the internal cohesion of the European Union.’"
"Of course, we should also be fully aware that at the moment, significant divergences remain in relation to wealth and the rate of development in certain regions."
"However, barely 28 months after the accession to the European Union of 10 new Member States, we can already see that even the poorest regions are developing at a significantly faster rate and now have relatively high growth rates."
"I speak as a citizen of one of these areas, the Podkarpacie region in south-eastern Poland."
"The word cohesion does not mean homogeneity or uniformity, but rather it describes a state where a given structure remains an intrinsic whole without internal tensions or fissures."
"This is my understanding of the European Union’s cohesion policy."
"Activities undertaken in the framework of efforts to foster solidarity between countries and nations within our Community will attain faster and greater success if there is a greater level of macroeconomic stability and essential structural changes are implemented in a more effective manner."
"It is therefore vital to define the principles for cohesion for the entire European Union and correlate them with the strategic frames of reference created by individual countries."
"Accordingly, we should welcome the fact that between 2007 and 2013, cohesion policy will aim to provide financial support for the least developed areas while also focusing on fostering economic growth and increasing employment."
"I am pleased to see that the territorial dimension of cohesion policy has been emphasised, as it aims to create a balance between the development of urban and rural areas, as well as of regions with specific characteristics."
"It will be extremely important to make sensible use of financial instruments, which is why the mid-term assessment will play such a significant role."
"We should take a long-term view of our activities in Europe."
"I therefore think that we need to breathe new life into the Lisbon Strategy."
"We need to encourage innovation in all possible fields, we need to base our economy on knowledge and education and we need to foster entrepreneurship, irrespective of the size of the companies in question."
"These are the approaches that will guarantee success."
"However, we must remember that all our actions should treat people as individuals, as family members, as members of local and regional communities, as nationals of specific countries and as citizens of the whole Community."
"This also applies to disabled people."
"It is therefore very important to take account of the demographic dimension of cohesion policy."
"– Mr President, with the report by Mrs Krehl, whom I would like to congratulate on the work which she has done, we are finishing the legislation relating to the Structural Funds for the period from 2007 to 2013 and we are moving on to practice, in other words to the application of the legislation."
"However, the question that arises is: is the legislation which we have voted through the best?"
"I say not."
"In my view, it could have been much better."
"However, given the equilibriums which exist in this Union, of which our countries are Member States, this European Union of twenty-five states, I can say that it is the best possible legislation."
"Consequently, we now have before us the challenge of seeing not only and merely how the 308 billion cohesion budget will be taken up by the Member States and the regions, but also how they will make use of all this money."
"Within this framework, the strategic guidelines which we are discussing today are important, because they refer precisely to the content of cohesion policy: where the money will be directed and which the priority sectors will be."
"Of course, it is absolutely right for cohesion policy to be linked to the Lisbon Strategy and this is clearly expressed through the guidelines."
"It would perhaps be better if the link had been clearer or more specific or if the Lisbon Strategy had been given a narrower definition, in order to cover certain truly leading sectors for the economy of the European Union."
"In all events, the time of responsibility has come."
"The time of responsibility for the Commission, the time of responsibility for the Member States, especially for the ten new Member States which need to learn fast lessons in order to see how the Community Support Framework operates, and for us as far as control is concerned."
"Our work does not end today."
"I would say that today is when it starts."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking our colleague, Mrs Krehl, for, and congratulating her on, her report and, in particular, on her first own-initiative report, which has enabled the European Parliament to voice its opinion on the guidelines on cohesion fairly early on, with the aim of being heard and of having an influence on the second version that has been proposed by the Commission and that we are debating."
"It must be stressed, in fact, that the procedure has been slightly surprising."
"While, at Community level, we had not yet adopted the strategic guidelines, the Member States were already in the process of preparing to adapt nationally."
"Admittedly, the Member States were motivated by a legitimate desire to use the new Structural Funds from 2007, but this at the risk of a lack of overall consistency."
"Indeed, the regional policy reform took place not only in the difficult context of the expansion and the renewal of the financial perspective, but also in the context of the revival of the Lisbon Strategy, something that clearly reoriented the objectives."
"The fact is that reorienting them exclusively towards innovation, the knowledge-based economy, competitiveness and entrepreneurism is not enough to guarantee the objectives of territorial cohesion and sustainable development, which seem to me to take priority."
"I deplore in particular the fact that the earmarking of the appropriations in relation to the Lisbon objectives, together with the classification of expenditure, should not have been made subject to the agreement of the European Parliament."
"I also regret the fact that the territorial dimension of cohesion should not have been explicitly taken into account as a strategic guideline, even though I have fully noted the developments in relation to urban policy."
"I am worried, however, about the gaps, the shortcomings in relation to the rural environment, the funds for which are not very …"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community's strategic guidelines lay down the principles and priorities of the cohesion policy and suggest measures to allow the European regions to make full use of the EUR 308 billion appropriation allocated to national and regional aid programmes over the next seven years."
"I should like to focus in particular on a factor that is decisive for the effectiveness of the cohesion policy: the quality of the partnership among all the local and regional actors involved in preparing and running the programmes."
"Strategies drawn up at the closest possible level to the citizens really must form an integral part of the efforts to promote growth and employment."
"The role of small and medium-sized enterprises, the need to fill local skills shortages, the importance of groupings and the need for local innovation centres are so significant that a bottom-up approach is crucial in most cases."
"Involvement concerns not only the economic agenda, but also the more direct involvement of citizens through partnerships and the mechanisms of governance at various levels, in the context of which the cohesion policy is managed, in order to achieve the Union’s objectives of growth and employment."
"Closer cooperation between the Commission and the Member States’ authorities is crucial for drawing up a cohesion strategy that addresses Community priorities in a national and regional context and also for it to have a useful effect on the ground through an operational programme."
"I also want to congratulate Mrs Krehl, who, with her usual competence, very skilfully stimulated debate on such an important topic as the subject of this recommendation."
"I am pleased to note, Commissioner, that the strategic guidelines give due credit to the hard work done by Parliament over the last two years."
"It is a result that we consider to be highly significant and important."
"Indeed, they take into consideration important topics on which my fellow Members have focused and which have been examined in the relevant parliamentary committee and debated here in this Chamber."
"To conclude, I hope, or rather expect, that my fellow Members will vote in favour of the legislative resolution and thus acknowledge all the hard work that has been poured into it."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by expressing my appreciation and congratulations to Mrs Krehl for this, an important component of cohesion policy for the coming years."
"After all, it is the task of the strategic guidelines to supplement the Regulation governing the Structural Funds and to support the national and regional authorities in programme planning."
"Consequently, these guidelines contain the political priorities for the investments to be made."
"The new strategic guidelines rightly focus more than before on growth and jobs, with the emphasis on knowledge and information society, entrepreneurship and employment."
"In other words, the priority here is the Lisbon Strategy, but I should like to emphasise that this is pursued never as an end in itself, but rather – within the framework of cohesion policy – always with a view to achieving the objective of strengthening economic cohesion and of pan-European competitiveness."
"In so doing, these guidelines must also take account of the promotion of investment in individual businesses by means of subsidies designed especially for SMEs."
"Concern must still be expressed about the considerable administrative burden in the field of European structural policy, which, unfortunately, is not significantly reduced by the requirements set out in these guidelines."
"I should also like to emphasise that we must not only make intelligent, efficient, targeted use of the scant resources at our disposal, but also attach great importance to private cofinancing at project level."
"Unfortunately, public–private partnerships are still used much too rarely in connection with the Structural Funds, particularly because of a large number of unresolved legal issues."
"We must now do our utmost, as quickly as possible, to enable countries to submit their operational programmes soon, and particularly to afford them a smooth transition to the new aid period."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by echoing the expressions of gratitude for the work of Mrs Krehl, thanks to which we have been able to reach a common position within Parliament, which has undoubtedly considerably improved the content of these strategic objectives."
"This will allow us to enable the European regions to benefit as much as possible from the budgetary contribution allocated for that purpose, and we have proposed the bases for the national strategic frameworks, that is to say the search for a balance between growth and territorial cohesion."
"We must not forget that Europe is made up of a large number of regions which have great similarities but which also have many special characteristics of their own, and we must take these into account from the point of view of cohesion: the urban environment and the rural environment, where agriculture is the main activity, the outermost regions, islands and regions suffering depopulation."
"In short, the cohesion policy must be aimed at eliminating the specific difficulties faced by each of them, thereby guaranteeing equal opportunities."
"Within the framework of the strategic guidelines, therefore, recommendations have been introduced which must be stressed: the creation of more and better jobs; innovation and the knowledge-based economy, which contribute to the elimination of the digital divide; environmental investments, which guarantee sustainability and the management of natural resources; transport infrastructures and accessibility, which allow equal opportunities to be offered to the people most in need of them, such as the elderly, the disabled and women."
"The incorporation of these elements has been crucial to the proper implementation of the cohesion policy, and they will ensure that the objectives initially set are achieved."
"Finally, we must point out that the principle of participation in the drawing up of European policy has been taken into account."
"We will have thereby created the bases for mobilising the economic growth potential of all of the regions, with a cohesion policy that improves the geographical balance of economic development, increases the growth of the Union as a whole and ultimately lays the foundations for a stronger, more cohesive and more cooperative Europe."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we are hardly in any doubt as to the outcome of tomorrow’s vote on the strategic guidelines, which will probably gain the support of virtually all of our Assembly;"
"I, like many others in this House, believe that the work of our rapporteur has got something to do with that."
"It is, however, as everyone knows, quite late in the day to be talking about this, here and now."
"The drafting of the operational programmes is already well under way in most countries."
"Obviously, it is the result that interests us."
"What will the Union’s regional policy, which represents almost 40% of the Community budget, really be of use to: the Lisbon Strategy, territorial cohesion, or indeed both?"
"We hope that it will be of use to both."
"It seems to me, at any rate, that the principle on which Parliament was not consulted – earmarking, which mainly concerns the old Member States – is one of the most technocratic and, in my modest opinion, undoubtedly one of the least intelligent ever thought up in Europe."
"It is the combination of two technocracies, that of the Commission, whose skill in this area is renowned, and that of the Member States, which is as varied as it is developed."
"What will come of this?"
"We can still hope for the best. To do so, we shall have to wait for the Commission to examine the operational programmes submitted by the Member States, a process that will take months."
"I hope that these programmes will respond first and foremost to the needs and to the will of the urban populations, and of the rural populations, to which they apply."
"We know that you are paying attention, Commissioner, to these well-founded concerns."
"Let us hope that you can convince your interlocutors and colleagues of this."
"– Mr President, the Community Strategic Guidelines for cohesion is one of the most important documents for planning structural fund spending in the Member States of the European Union."
"This document outlines the main priorities for countries applying for cohesion fund aid between 2007 and 2013."
"The guidelines provide the basis each Member State needs in order to draw up a strategic frame of reference defining national development priorities."
"These guidelines will direct future cohesion policy measures towards improving competitiveness so as to foster economic and employment growth."
"In order to achieve this objective, the European Union must primarily focus on knowledge, innovation and investment in human capital, as well as on work aimed at eradicating disparities between levels of development in particular regions."
"Making effective use of available funds is a key task and involves measures such as fostering public-private partnership programmes, especially at a local level."
"It is also extremely important to pay particular attention to the urban dimension, as it is in towns and conglomerations that problems such as crime, social exclusion, pollution or heavy traffic generally make themselves felt."
"This House should be satisfied with the current version of the strategic guidelines."
"We can now only hope that the Member States will be able to effectively implement cohesion policy on the basis of these guidelines."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Krehl, on a very thoroughly prepared document."
"Mr President, I too should like to sing the praises of Mr Krehl's report and the results that have now been incorporated in the directive, including those achieved in the past two and a half years by Mrs Hübner in the debate at European level."
"I am in favour of earmarking; we should be able to admit to this in this Chamber, and I am the first to do so."
"This also means, though, that we can eliminate the noncommittal dimension and fragmentation to the left and right in policy."
"In doing so, we can update the cohesion policy to include it in a new agenda: that of Lisbon."
"The emphasis is shifting from less concrete and less asphalt to training our people in knowledge society."
"We will, in the next 20 years, need to focus on cut-throat competition at world level."
"Central will then be the role of Parliament in this new era, with an interim review in 2009-2010."
"What we can then look forward to is agriculture being weighed up against cohesion policy and against Europe’s external role in the world."
"The focus will then be even more on the policy’s added value."
"It is because of that role that in the committee, I pledged my support to the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that looks to enhance Parliament’s role during reassessment."
"I am also asking the Commissioner and the European Commission whether we will have sufficient information at our disposal in order to be able to hold a proper debate on the financial reprioritisation."
"I am asking you for information about what the nation states are now doing."
"I sense a reluctance among our Member States to report adequately, and I regard that as a real disgrace."
"They are given the instruments and should respond accordingly."
"It is true that the new synthesis for the new era and the new financial proportions will require a significantly reassessed policy, as well as a permanent role for the regions and the towns in the cohesion policy."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a decision on strategic guidelines on cohesion, to which we have been asked to give a favourable response, and which will serve as the basis for drawing up national strategic reference frameworks, strikes me as an excellent statement of intentions for the Council, for which we must thank Mrs Krehl."
"The strategic guidelines make it clear that Europe needs to concentrate on meeting the Lisbon Strategy objectives, which are of course close to my heart, in terms of both fostering employment and growth, and encouraging innovation and a knowledge-based economy."
"In our quest to meet the challenges facing the EU on the world stage and in light of our new size and scale, we must always ensure that all parties are involved, be they social partners, NGOs, local authorities or regional authorities."
"We have become a giant with ambitions to match our size and we cannot afford to neglect any part of the territory; together, we must meet the objectives that we have set ourselves."
"We have to prove that the classic, multi-level model of our society is sufficiently sound."
"Full employment, a qualified workforce, lifelong training and increased productivity are essential prerequisites if economic, social and territorial cohesion in the EU is to be a success."
"For this to happen, these factors must be embraced by all of us in a spirit of cooperation."
"The report gives due prominence to the factors of investment in innovation and researchers by means of incentives to encourage such talented people to remain in Europe, and the setting up of centres of excellence; these are vital tools for economic development in the regions and the Member States."
"There is an increasing awareness of the need to decentralise knowledge hot-spots, away from the large population centres towards the less populated areas. Such areas may prove highly conducive to the establishment of centres of excellence."
"– Mr President, the Community’s strategic guidelines for the upcoming seven years that are before us represent a considerable step, and are particularly helpful in shaping the new Member States’ cohesion policy, which will ultimately mean a more unified and cohesive Europe for all of us within a few years."
"The European Parliament has acted with the greatest possible speed in preparing the Community’s strategic guidelines, and now it is up to the Member States to draw up the best, most credible and most feasible national development plans possible, and to submit these to the European Union."
"Allow me to draw attention to a few aspects of the document which did not receive much emphasis earlier, and which therefore did not constitute the same sort of incentive when the Member States were drawing up their own development plans."
"I would like first to mention the part of the document which stresses the broad participation and involvement of the various civil and professional organisations, and urges giving equal say to all in the process of preparing Member States’ national development plans."
"The perspective according to which health is considered an economic value and a motor of development represents a great advance in the document, which recommends the same approach in preparing national development plans."
"Today health no longer means simply improving the health care system or making it more accessible, but includes creating more and better jobs, the goals of sustainable development as well as the principle of equal opportunity already mentioned."
"The attention to improving the transparency and accountability of European Union support is a very important step forward, and thus strengthens trust among the Member States."
"We all know what an enormous job it is to prepare such a document."
"For my part, I can only thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Krehl, and the shadow rapporteur, Mr Olbrycht, for their excellent work."
"– Mr President, reducing the disparities among regions, and particularly border regions, is an important challenge for the Community’s strategic guidelines."
"With this in view, we should emphasise the actions that will have a long-term impact, such as those carried out not only within the transport and environment sectors, but also in connection with the Lisbon Strategy, regarding support for SMEs and the cross-border labour market."
"It is regrettable, however, that, in this quest for balanced development, the border regions underpinning regional policy should sometimes be very different entities in terms of size and population and may have significant disparities linked to the statistical nomenclature."
"That can in fact result in unequal amounts being allocated from the Structural Funds, and there is, then, a great risk that strengthening the competitiveness of these cross-border regions – one of the priorities of cooperation – might turn into a form of fierce competition among neighbouring regions."
"The inequalities in development that could result on both sides of the borders would be liable to harm the European Union’s cohesion policy, even though one of the aims of this policy is to mitigate the negative effect of having borders."
"How, in this case, can we enable the citizens concerned to recognise the added value of the European Union?"
"It is therefore imperative that we create the ideal conditions for balanced cross-border economic and social development and pay special attention to programmes aimed at achieving this cross-border cooperation."
"Finally, I should like to conclude by thanking Mrs Krehl for her report and, above all, for her boundless enthusiasm in championing a form of lasting cohesion."
"Mr President, I welcome the strategic guidelines on cohesion and the three priority areas identified."
"Like everybody else, I compliment the rapporteur, Mrs Krehl."
"As an Irish Member of the European Parliament and coming from an economy that has been transformed in 15 years from the weakest in the EU to one of the strongest, I wish to acknowledge the huge role that the cohesion and structural funds have played in bringing about the economic miracle known as the ‘Celtic Tiger’."
"The EUR 308 billion for 2007-2013 will go largely to the new Member States."
"Ireland’s entitlement is reduced from EUR 3.7 billion for 2000-2006 to EUR 901 million, which is a barometer of our economic success."
"I have no problem with that."
"However, I should like to ask my colleagues in the new Member States not to give their national governments the power to decide at central government level how and where the money is to be spent."
"They need regional structures with real development power, real decision-making powers for the regions."
"I speak from experience."
"I represent a constituency in Ireland known as the BMW region."
"It is one of the poorest regions, bordering the Atlantic Ocean and largely mountainous."
"It is still the only region in Ireland that retains Objective 1 status, though that, through national economic performance, ceases on 31 December 2006."
"Over the years, funds that flowed from the cohesion and structural funds and were intended for regions such as mine were channelled to Dublin, the east and the south of the country and co-financed national development plans."
"I do not exaggerate."
"EUR 680 million of co-financed monies intended for the BMW region have gone to Dublin, the east and the south."
"Why?"
"Because in Ireland there is no regional authority with real decision-making powers."
"Everything is decided in Dublin at central government level."
"Now is the time for the new Member States to ensure that they have real regional authorities – not just paper tigers – otherwise they may find that the Irish experience will be their experience tomorrow."
"Commissioner Hübner reiterated that this evening."
"I think it should happen, it must happen, and the Commission has a role here as well in insisting that it does happen."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Krehl on her excellent report on the proposal for a Council decision on Community strategic guidelines."
"The report was a vital factor in the Council welcoming a number of Parliament's positions, on issues such as sustainable development, the urban dimension, equal opportunities and renewable energy sources. For this and other reasons, Mrs Krehl is justified in recommending that Parliament vote in favour."
"Once this Council decision has been adopted, the Member States will not have much time to submit their strategies for implementing the Structural Funds, incorporating these Community guidelines, to the Commission."
"It is regrettable that this tight schedule may adversely affect the implementation of the new cohesion policy as of January 2007."
"I should also like to say that I endorse the proposed guidelines and priorities, and in particular the idea that cohesion policy is a vital tool for implementing the Lisbon Strategy."
"Let us not forget, however, that the Lisbon Strategy is primarily based on the notion of promoting European competitiveness, as opposed to the notion of solidarity on which the cohesion policy is based."
"It will not always be easy to work with these two different approaches in tandem, but a balance needs to be struck."
"Accordingly, I have serious doubts about the idea of obliging the old Member States to set aside high percentages of the funds for meeting the Lisbon Strategy objectives, and, at the same time, to promote an effective cohesion policy, not least in the area of territorial cohesion."
"I trust, therefore, that the national strategies to be submitted succeed in achieving the best possible balance between competitiveness and solidarity."
"Mr President, first of all, cohesion funding has been very important in underpinning the success of the 2004 enlargement and, like others, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work in that area."
"The economic progress seen over recent years in the EU-15 Member States that enjoyed cohesion funding represents something of a model for what we can do when EU resources are properly targeted and implemented."
"While the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda is largely a matter for the Member States, I am nevertheless pleased that the strategic guidelines set out an ambitious programme for growth and jobs, which we hope will be realised throughout the European Union."
"When the ten new Member States joined in 2004, we welcomed their membership for various reasons, not least because those countries in central and eastern Europe had marked a major milestone in their remarkably short transition from the horrors they had experienced under communism to democracy."
"We welcomed enlargement in the political sense."
"However, we also recognised that if enlargement was to work it would be necessary to provide adequate funding for the new Member States in order to boost their economies, thereby creating growth and jobs."
"I am pleased that we are using tried and tested mechanisms of structural and cohesion funding to achieve that important goal."
"The United Kingdom Government announced last year that it would offer an extra EUR 8 billion over the 2007-2013 budget period to help the new Member States build their economies and societies."
"While my constituents in Northern Ireland recognised that enlargement would bring with it a financial burden on the richer Member States, they were also keen to ensure that funding is allocated in ways that will bring sustainable improvement throughout the entire European Union."
"We appreciate that the economic development of eastern Europe will in the longer term bring economic advantages for all of us."
"As someone from Northern Ireland, I would just like to say that the people there were very envious of the cohesion funding received by the Republic of Ireland, because it certainly helped that country."
"It is an awful pity that Parliament, the Commission and the Council did not listen to us in the past when we asked for cohesion funding for Northern Ireland."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Community’s strategic guidelines on cohesion are an extremely important document, which should contribute towards finalising national framework reference strategies regulating the draw-down of structural funds in the individual Member States."
"Unfortunately, however, the adoption of this document has been greatly postponed in comparison with the original timetable."
"National materials are now ready in most Member States and logically this document cannot be formally implemented while they are being drawn up."
"This will lead to further complications throughout the process."
"Concerning the implications for the preparation of operational programmes and their necessary adoption by the Commission, we should be aware that the programming will now be delayed, thereby postponing the prospect of risk-free draw-downs of financial resources from the Structural Funds for individual Member States."
"On the other hand, it must be said that these strategic principles take on board the great majority of our comments."
"I am especially pleased that the crucial role of local authorities in particular, that is to say the towns and cities, has not been overlooked in the process of improving competitiveness across the Community as a whole."
"I feel that this declaration will not merely gather dust, and that we will all strive to ensure that the principle of partnership between national administrations, regions, communities and other entities is fully honoured in all Member States."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is still much work to be done on explaining certain aspects such as, for example, the programming method for the urban dimension."
"In future, the form of the integrated urban plans must be clarified, so that there is no miscommunication and so that the goalposts are not moved, as was the case with the release of aid aimed at improving municipally-owned waterworks infrastructure in the Czech Republic."
"I should like to conclude with a vote of thanks to Mrs Krehl."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the most recent enlargement, through which the EU gained ten new Member States, at the same time brought to the Community deeper differences in economic development, a geographical shift of inequality to the east, a doubling of socio-economic differences and a drop in average GDP."
"This is in spite of the fact that the new Member States actually have some of the highest rates of economic growth."
"With the impending accession of Romania and Bulgaria, whose GDP stands at a third of the current EU average, I believe that we now need the strategic guidelines on cohesion more than ever."
"European solidarity is referred to in the preamble of the Treaty on the European Union, which specifies that the Community will strengthen its economic and social cohesion with a view, above all, to reducing differences in the level of development between different regions."
"The EU earmarks over a third of its budget to reducing differences in development between different regions, as well as inequalities in the standard of living."
"Through the fund, the EU is contributing towards the development of regions that are lagging behind, the restructuring of industrial regions and the revitalisation of neglected urban areas."
"The reform of cohesion policy should offer the opportunity for greater effectiveness, transparency and political accountability."
"In the next programming period, cohesion policy must be clearer and more coherent and I personally expect it to become more goal-orientated and focused."
"Concerning the countries in receipt of support from the Cohesion Fund or the Structural Funds, it is necessary to take account of enlargement and to distinguish between the various kinds of action supported by the funds."
"Mr President, while I believe that the guidelines now take on board Parliament’s main concerns, as you know we were not in a position to accommodate all of them fully."
"I am thinking in particular of certain provisions that are now enshrined in the regulations and which cannot, by definition, be contradicted in the guidelines."
"Certainly earmarking is perhaps the principal example of such a provision which Parliament has tended to oppose, but let me emphasise very strongly that earmarking is not anti-cohesion."
"It is a recognition that the world has changed and that we need to redirect efforts towards new priorities in order to achieve sustainable cohesion."
"At the same time, compared to the Commission’s initial proposal, the final list of earmark categories has been enlarged during the negotiations to include other expenditures, especially in the convergence regions, but not only those regions."
"In addition, the regulations now provide for the possibility, during the programme negotiations, for the national authorities and the Commission to agree to earmark other expenditure categories that do not appear on the final list, where these are held to be of national or regional importance."
"We are now on the home strait with regard to the implementation of the EU cohesion policy."
"We have the regulations in place and by the beginning of October, assuming Parliament’s assent tomorrow, the guidelines will be adopted as a first phase in the programming exercise."
"While it is the home strait, we should not underestimate the challenges that lie ahead in reaching the finishing line, but I can assure you that I will spare no efforts in persuading our partners in the Member States and regions to put in place ambitious and innovative programmes."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"– First of all, I would like to thank all my colleagues, the colleagues at the Commission and the Council and of course Mrs Krehl for the effort they have made on behalf of improving the guidelines."
"The essence and the real achievement of the agreement, from the perspective of the regions, micro-regions and cities of the new Member States, is that their situation has convincingly improved."
"Sources can be used:"
"– with greater certainty (counting with greater certainty on a 2007 start, and planning on full operation)"
"– with greater ease (with much less individual effort and more favourable regulations)"
"– in a customised fashion (new specific goals such as home renovations, mass transit, road building)."
"Areas of development are expanding, there is greater freedom of choice in their uses and value – this significantly increases our chances for dynamic growth and cohesion."
"Out of 27 countries, mine ranks second highest in the amount of cohesion/convergence support per head, out of which development worth at least 8 billion Ft can be realised."
"In the regulations aimed at our cohesion and thus in the strategic guidelines as well, the majority of Hungary’s requests and proposed amendments formulated in the committees of Parliament and the Council received support, indeed we even received things we did not request or even hope for."
"All the conditions are present for the regions of Europe that are still lagging behind to align themselves with the front line."
"Continued success depends on whether we manage to build our country with the kind of collaboration one finds in Brussels, and whether we will be able to deal with the real issues, so that instead of futile arguments, we will be able to raise Hungary and the other new Member States to the rank of Europe’s top players."
"It is now up to us …"
"– Statistics show that between 1988 and 2001 the gap between the poorest regions and the EU average was narrowed by one-sixth, precisely because of the results achieved by the cohesion policy."
"The year 2005 was a record year for the cohesion policy in terms of resources invested, with a total of EUR 38.3 billion committed to the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the pre-accession fund for candidate countries (ISPA)."
"In the same year, the reform of EU regional policy achieved notable results, including its official recognition as an instrument for growth and employment under the Lisbon Strategy."
"Recent research shows that the overall growth in GDP in the new Member States from 2007 to 2013 will be in the region of 7-12%, and that 2.5 million jobs could be created."
"The new strategic guidelines approved in this Chamber today focus more on growth, showing that in future the cohesion policy should place the emphasis on the knowledge and information society, entrepreneurship, the environment and employment, in order to promote the even more balanced and sustainable development of the Community."
"– I am grateful to the European Commission for having significantly enhanced the inclusion of the territorial dimension of cohesion policy in the latest version of its strategic guidelines."
"I endorse the Commission’s desire to seek mechanisms for executing cohesion policy that will help guarantee that all regions are treated fairly on the basis of their individual capacities in relation to factors of competitiveness."
"For the next generation of programmes, territorial cohesion must be promoted in such a way as to allow Europe as a whole to contribute to the measures in favour of growth and employment, thanks in particular to high-quality partnerships gathering together actors at every level: national, regional, urban, rural and local."
"The new legislative framework also makes provision for a special allocation to be granted to the outermost regions in order to take account of the high costs they incur as a result of being so remote."
"I concur with the Commission’s objective, which consists in ensuring that this allocation will also help create sustainable growth and employment in the outermost regions."
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Barsi-Pataky and Mr Rübig on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Glante on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mrs Hall on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and Mr Pirilli on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on taking stock of the Galileo programme (O-0094/2006 – B6-0430/2006)."
". – Mr President, Mr Vice-President, a year ago the European Parliament voted here in Strasbourg at first reading on the financing of the GALILEO programme, and on the whole it unanimously supported the programme."
"A great success of the past year has been the fact that the GIOVE-A satellite went into orbit and occupied its frequency."
"Our gratitude goes to the European engineers and developers."
"Discussions regarding the realisation and operation of the project are under way, and Parliament takes note of the Commission’s communication to the effect that the first result of these talks will be the so-called ‘head of terms’ regarding its financing, which is to come before us before the end of this year."
"We request the Commission to do everything possible in the interest of fulfilling the common objective of financing the GALILEO programme by a two-thirds/one-third split between private capital and the Commission."
"Despite the results, we must express our concerns."
"The programme is considerably delayed."
"We realise the significant difficulties which the Commission faces daily."
"The European legal and regulatory system is difficult to use when it comes to realising a joint project."
"Furthermore, it is our experience that this is a new and difficult task, as regards financing, risks and operations, for the European space industry selected to carry it out."
"We agree that the European GALILEO programme has entered the global sphere and has offered its services worldwide."
"If, however, cooperation with third countries is also to figure in the overall institutional transformation of the Supervisory Authority, then the European Parliament wishes first to give its opinion on this matter."
"We, the various political groups in the European Parliament, consider that what the GALILEO programme now needs is what is known as ‘good governance’."
"For this reason, I wish to ask the President and Vice-President what the Commission plans to do to ensure that this promising programme, which is one of the vehicles for the Lisbon Strategy, will be realised without further delay."
"When will the regulations on its uses be ready, allowing European undertakings to prepare in sufficient time for the participation that is the key to the success of the entire programme?"
"Mr President, I, like Mrs Barsi-Pataky, am also particularly concerned about the issue of timing."
"Delay is absolutely critical, because Galileo’s unique attractiveness to investors is lost once the American GPS 3 system has reached operational capability, which is estimated to be in about 2015."
"I should be grateful if the Commissioner would spell out to what extent the delay is going to be detrimental to Galileo’s success in the international market for satellite navigation."
"I am concerned that the delay undermines Galileo’s business plan in other respects as well."
"Firstly, with the delay have come increased costs."
"Indeed, the costs of Galileo have already exceeded the budget by over 40%."
"Secondly, the delay undermines the potential for revenue."
"The most important source of revenue is expected to be royalties from intellectual property rights."
"Receiving manufacturers would pay a licence fee to the Galileo-operating company in order to have their receivers Galileo-enabled."
"But what manufacturer will want to pay a licence fee for Galileo if it does not offer any added value when compared to an upgraded GPS?"
"Therefore, delay to the Galileo programme is not just unfortunate: it could have really grave consequences for the financial burden which is carried by the public purse."
"I should be very grateful if the Commissioner could give us some explanation on this."
"."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky and Mrs Hall, as well as Mr Rübig and Mr Glante, who should be with us soon."
"I am grateful to them, and particularly to Mrs Barsi-Pataky, for the close attention they have paid to the development of this great Galileo programme."
"I will try to provide you with some specific answers, because I should like to put to rest certain fears that, in spite of everything, seem to me to be rather excessive."
"I would remind you that the Galileo programme was designed in three stages."
"First, there is a development and validation phase, involving the development of the satellites and terrestrial components of the system and their in-orbit validation."
"This development phase runs from 2003 to 2009, and is currently being managed by the Galileo joint undertaking."
"This will be followed, from 2009 to 2010, by the deployment phase, involving the production and launching of the satellites and the full instalment of the terrestrial component."
"Finally, the operating phase will start in 2010."
"The deployment and operation phases will be covered by a concession contract lasting around 20 years."
"The Supervisory Authority, which is a Community agency, will manage these two phases, and will act as the licensing authority."
"Within this schedule, there is one date to which we absolutely must stick – and on this point you are quite right – namely the date from which businesses and citizens will be able to receive accurate and reliable signals from Galileo."
"That will be at the end of 2010, when the first Galileo satellites will start transmitting their signals."
"That said, I have no intention of glossing over the difficulties."
"Galileo is not only a technological innovation, but also, at institutional level, a very particular operation."
"The project now involves eight industrial players, 25 public players and three institutions."
"In the long term, this multiple patronage will be Galileo's strength, but it is true that all of these players, all of these supporters of Galileo, will really need to adapt in order to make progress on the matter together."
"When, in 2005, I observed the problems between the eight members of the future industrial consortium, I appointed Karel van Miert to resolve the problems, which he did with remarkable success."
"We also needed to deal with the changes in safety and security requirements that necessitated a further delay for technical examination."
"Be that as it may, the important thing is the result in 2010."
"Having said that, we also need to make steady progress in the schedule of intermediate steps, paying close attention to the quality and viability of the project."
"For example, the industrial activities of the in-orbit validation phase, which are the responsibility of the European Space Agency, began in December 2004."
"The contract regarding the completion of this phase was signed on 19 January 2006, and the work is currently progressing satisfactorily."
"The technical feasibility of the project has been proven, and it is now a question of laying the foundations for a true public/private partnership for the next 20 years."
"It goes without saying that I will inform you of any problems that arise regarding the signing of the concession contract."
"I should now like, in response to your second question, to turn to the European Supervisory Authority."
"This is the authority responsible for supervising the future concessionaire."
"The Supervisory Authority will have to ensure that the concessionaire complies with the concession contract and the annexed terms and conditions, and it will take all appropriate measures to ensure that services are not interrupted if the concessionaire goes bankrupt."
"In addition, the Supervisory Authority will also have to monitor all the technical, security and financial aspects of the concession."
"In this regard, I would say that the wording of the concession contract is obviously very important, because it will be the primary instrument on which the Supervisory Authority's ability to monitor the concessionaire will be based."
"The concession contract must therefore be worded quite unambiguously, and I will of course inform Parliament of it, as the Commission has made a commitment to inform you of the content of the concession contract before it is signed by the Supervisory Authority."
"Two final problems remain to be addressed: first of all, the financial issue."
"The distribution of financial contributions between the Member States and the industrial players is largely dependent on the risk assessment, but this assessment itself requires the best possible understanding of Galileo's possible applications."
"That is why, by the end of November, I will publish a communication in the form of a Green Paper on these applications."
"For that purpose, we have come up with a competition to appeal to the imaginations of the European people regarding the possible applications of Galileo."
"I am quite sure that we are still underestimating the potential of Galileo, and I would urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to make efforts yourselves to encourage all our European industries to contribute to this discovery of the possible applications of Galileo."
"The second problem is that of cooperation with third countries."
"As you will be aware, the international agreements regarding the Galileo programme are negotiated on the basis of Article 300 of the Treaty."
"The procedure laid down in that article must always include consultation of Parliament before such agreements are concluded, and I will see to it personally that this takes place."
"It is quite certain that cooperation with third countries regarding Galileo represents an opportunity, but this opportunity must be managed, and the Commission will send another communication to Parliament and the Council this autumn, setting out the broad outline of this cooperation policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to gloss over the difficulties that go hand in hand with the implementation of a project as ambitious as this one, but at the same time I would draw your attention to the risks involved in giving the impression that this programme will in some way be subject to crucial delays that cast doubt on the viability of the project."
"That is not the case, and nor will it be, because I personally intend, with your help, with the active support of Parliament, to ensure that this great project can be put into practice in accordance with the schedule that we set to guarantee its viability, because you are quite right that there will be no shortage of competitors."
"Galileo therefore needs to be put into operation within the timeframe I have set out."
"I really will keep a close eye on this throughout the procedure, aided and supported by your Parliament."
"."
"Mr President, I am particularly pleased that we are discussing this topic – albeit at this late hour – because it is indeed the case that we need to get our skates on. We must keep the momentum going, not least in view of global competition."
"Mrs Barsi-Pataky already gave an excellent outline of the framework with regard to the possible delay, the legal framework and so on. I hope you will allow me briefly to dwell on this public-private cooperation this evening."
"It is estimated that a future-oriented project such as this can yield 150 000 extra jobs, and I know that industry cannot wait to take part in it."
"Moreover, there are also regions in Europe – Bavaria and North Netherlands for example – that are prepared to invest money from the structural funds in developing this further."
"That has also been done before for the LOFAR radio telescope project in North Netherlands."
"As you, Mr Barrot, will know, since you have been Commissioner for Regional Policy, structural funds must, more than ever, be invested in technologies and information."
"Would you be prepared to take over this development of decentralised involvement and funding?"
"You have mentioned a Green Paper."
"Could that be the bridge that can bring about this acceleration?"
"I am also mindful of the new rules for state support."
"Mrs Kroes outlined possibilities for projects of this kind a moment ago."
"I think that we are under-using the other instruments in this Parliament and in the European Union."
"Galileo is still in pole position globally."
"Europe is still ahead, but Galileo cannot afford to fall flat on its face in the implementation stage."
"Galileo should not carry on drifting, it must land."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for its explanations;"
"I believe that it has grasped that we are worried about the situation with the Galileo programme − which is similar to what is happening in the case of Airbus, for example."
"That is the true purpose of the debate."
"Time planning and compliance with the timetable laid down are crucial to the commercial viability and success of the programme."
"A considerable delay is building up in relation to Galileo, in terms of the 2005 forecasts."
"The tender procedure has been extended, and that is going to have serious repercussions for the programming of the project as a whole."
"That too is why our question is relevant."
"We must ensure the continuity of the project and seek the most creative and appropriate solutions in the light of the programme's objectives."
"We would urge the Commission to continue with its negotiating efforts and ensure that there are going to be no further delays, so that Galileo, the largest of the European-scale industrial projects, moves forward under the best possible conditions and can play its appropriate role in the achievement of the Lisbon objectives."
"We would also ask that the Commission carry out the reforms necessary also to promote the participation of SMEs."
"In order to support Galileo, Parliament needs to be kept informed."
"The commitment is there and you have mentioned it."
"We must also be informed of the costs and consequences of the delay."
"I agree that it will be useful for Parliament to monitor the project periodically."
"To that end, it is important that the supervisory authority, which you have mentioned, also send its reports to Parliament and that the expert appointed by Parliament has the status of observer in the authority’s activities."
"In fact, this Parliament has previously expressed its full support for the Galileo programme, taking on legislative and budgetary commitments and clearly acknowledging that Galileo is a strategic project, one of the pillars of the Lisbon Strategy, which in turn offers great opportunities to our small and medium-sized businesses."
"."
"Mr President, you know, I would be happy to continue this discussion all night, because Galileo is a really exciting project."
"Even so, I should like once again to reassure the honourable Members: the first of the two experimental satellites was launched from Baïkonour on 28 December 2005, and it has successfully transmitted all of the signals allowing us to guarantee the use of the frequency bands allocated to the European satellite navigation system."
"The second satellite, GIOVE-B, will be launched in the course of 2007."
"It will carry other technologically advanced equipment such as the passive hydrogen MASER atomic clock, which will be the most precise atomic clock ever launched into space."
"In parallel with this, the industrial activities of the in-orbit validation phase began in December 2004."
"I have already said, and I will say it again, that the entire contract for the validation phase, amounting to EUR 1 038 million, was signed on 19 January 2006."
"We are now entering a new phase, which will involve investigating all the possible applications for Galileo."
"As I have explained, we have issued a kind of appeal to all small and medium-sized enterprises and engineers able to develop innovations in this field."
"The Green Paper will in fact aim to ask the right questions, which should enable us to reach a better understanding of all the possible applications."
"Next, when this has given us an overall vision of the applications, we will be better able to deal with the public/private partnership and to plan how to distribute efforts."
"The industrial sector also needs to be involved, to the extent that it can benefit from these applications."
"That will finally allow us to found this concession contract on a reasonable financial basis."
"There is no reason to think, at this stage, that we will find ourselves in a situation difficult enough to upset the balance of the project."
"That being said, I have made a genuine commitment to keeping Parliament informed – Mrs Barsi-Pataky, as rapporteur, is well aware of this, and I should like to thank her once again."
"I am absolutely committed to coming to Parliament whenever necessary to explain how things stand and how they are developing."
"You suggested that Parliament should have observer status; we have already explained our position in this regard to the competent committees."
"It would be difficult for Parliament to try to be an observer at the same time as performing all of its monitoring activities."
"In any event, however, Mr President, I should like to reiterate this evening the commitment I have made: I will keep Parliament fully informed of everything that happens, both of the implementation of the concession contract and the public/private partnership and of how we are going to manage the contributions of third countries and their participation in Galileo."
"I am much obliged to Commission Vice-President Barrot."
"To wind up the debate, a motion for resolution(1) has been tabled under Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"The next item is the joint debate on freedom, security and justice, as well as immigration, all of which are extremely topical issues, particularly following the repercussions of the meetings held this weekend in Tampere."
"These are:"
"- the oral question to the Council on the progress made in the area of freedom, security and justice (Articles 2 and 39 of the EU Treaty), by Jean-Marie Cavada, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (O-0086/2006 B6-0428/2006), and"
"- the Council and Commission statements on the common immigration policy."
"Mr President, Mr Rajamäki, Mr Frattini, fellow Members, before replying to the oral question, allow me briefly to thank you publicly, Mr Rajamäki, for organising the Tampere ministerial meeting, which took place in really excellent conditions."
"As Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I very much want clearly to express how keenly the European Parliament supports the Presidency’s and the Commission’s proposal to activate the bridging clause provided for by Article 42 of the Treaty."
"This bridging clause was, I repeat, devised at the very time when the European Union was entrusted with the task of facilitating cooperation between the Member States on security matters, that is to say at the time when the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht was drawn up."
"The clause did not include a deadline by which it had to be activated."
"Broadly speaking, it is enough for there to be a combination of mutual confidence and the right political conditions in order for this decision to be taken."
"Oddly enough, this bridging clause has never so far been activated because transfer to the ordinary legislative procedure was determined directly by the Treaty of Amsterdam when it came to asylum and immigration policies and to judicial cooperation on civil matters and then by the Treaty of Nice, which facilitated transfer to the codecision procedure in the case of these policies that had been communitised."
"Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters has, however, remained excluded from the scope of such communitisation."
"On that basis, the question arises as to whether, 14 years after the Treaty of Maastricht, the political conditions – in the form of mutual confidence – have finally come together, enabling the Member States to agree to apply the normal decision-making procedure provided for since Maastricht to this highly sensitive field of cooperation."
"For the European Parliament, the answer is clearly in the affirmative, and for three reasons."
"Activation of the bridging clause would, firstly, enable the democratic deficit to be reduced; secondly, strengthen the rule of law; and, finally, make for more effective decision-making."
"Let us quickly consider these three points."
"Where the democratic deficit is concerned, I think it crucial to strengthen the democratic principle whereby all EU legislation, especially when it affects the rights and freedoms of the individual, must be adopted in association with the representatives of the people."
"There is a serious deficit when that does not happen."
"To defenders of the status quo, who claim that this democratic principle is not absent from the third pillar because governments supposedly act under the supervision of their national parliaments, I should like to offer the following clear response. Can anyone sincerely maintain that national parliamentary supervision is sufficient to ensure democratic balance when decisions are adopted at EU, rather than national, level?"
"What, moreover, is one to make of cases in which this parliamentary supervision is absent, as will be the case when it comes to renegotiating the agreements with the United States concerning, in particular, the Passenger Name Records (PNR) agreement – an extremely serious issue that will be considered outside the framework of any democratic control."
"Let us turn now to the second reason, which has to do with the principle of strengthening the rule of law."
"According to this principle, it must be possible for a judge to verify the legality of legislation of any kind."
"Where EU legislation is concerned, the judge in question should, logically, sit in the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
"However, Article 67 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and Article 35 of the Treaty on European Union introduce such limitations on the competence of that jurisdiction that the judges themselves have expressed doubts as to whether certain legislation relating to the second and third pillars respects the principle of the rule of law."
"This issue therefore needs to be resolved."
"Let us finally turn to the third point, which is about effective decision-making."
"As we all know, the need to maintain unanimity prevents rapid and effective decision-making of any kind, and this at a time when the seriousness of the threats to the EU since the attacks of 11 September and those on Madrid and London should encourage a much more rapid decision-making process."
"Having noted these three weaknesses - and they are, moreover, difficult to challenge objectively – how is it possible still to justify postponing a decision that could have been taken as long as about ten years ago?"
"Some claim, Mr President, that this issue should be settled within the framework of negotiations for a new Constitutional Treaty."
"That is something to hope for, but can we afford to await the outcome of this whole process, which will, at the very least, take two to three years when there are ongoing security threats and a permanent question mark over our freedoms?"
"Admittedly, the bridging clause will require ratification by the national parliaments, and that could enable those who are more hesitant to gain a bit of time."
"This difficulty may, however, be overcome through more thorough dialogue with the national parliaments, which, moreover, we in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will be receiving on 3 and 4 October 2006, that is to say next week, in the form of a big interparliamentary meeting at which we have high hopes of convincing them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I bring greetings from Tampere and my colleague Leena Luhtanen."
"I would first like to thank Mr Cavada and Mr Gargani for their enormous contribution at Tampere."
"We had open and concrete discussions about the development of freedom, security and justice."
"In connection with this, while we were there we also learnt about cycling, and Commissioner Frattini said that we have to keep pedalling so we do not fall over."
"It is somewhat similar with the European Union."
"Some of my more critical colleagues said that surely the bicycle can be stopped safely, and you can even put your feet on the ground to support yourself."
"I finally had to say that if the chain has come off, however, it is difficult to get going again."
"We should perhaps adopt the philosophy that Mr Cavada seems to espouse in what was an excellent speech."
"Cooperation in the European Union is important for strengthening the security of our citizens, and at the same time we need to ensure that basic rights and freedoms are observed."
"In this connection, the European Union’s ability to function, take speedy decisions and respond to changes in the operating environment is decisive."
"The policy line taken at the European Council in Tampere in 1999 means that there have to continue to be high levels of cooperation between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council."
"The Finnish Presidency wants to promote the new Tampere spirit."
"The protection of fundamental rights is a priority."
"All the Member States are parties to the European Convention on Human Rights, and the work of the Council constantly reflects the importance of guaranteeing that the principles contained in it are upheld."
"This also obviously applies to such sensitive issues as combating terrorism."
"I would emphasise that these values are acknowledged in all areas, both in internal action and in relations with third countries."
"Particular attention is being paid to establishing a European Fundamental Rights Agency."
"Discussions on a Council Regulation establishing the proposed Fundamental Rights Agency of the European Union have begun, and the work has now reached an important phase."
"The Finnish Presidency will be making a determined effort to have this agency set up by the beginning of next year."
"An important question that was raised is whether the Agency should also act in areas now covered under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union."
"The Presidency particularly wants to focus on exploring the Agency’s competences under the third pillar."
"To this end, we hope that the Member States will demonstrate flexibility, so that we might find a solution that satisfies everyone."
"Last autumn, we had constructive talks on the Data Retention Directive, in what was a difficult situation, to look at its technical, legal and financial aspects."
"We were soon in a position to address the main concerns of the Member States and the European Parliament."
"I think that this is a splendid example of how decisions can be taken by a qualified majority, but at the same time the aim is to reach a consensus."
"Thus encouraged, we would like to adopt the Framework Decision on the protection of personal data under the third pillar as quickly as possible."
"We aim to conclude the first reading of the proposal during the current six-month term."
"The Council is now carefully considering the European Parliament’s opinion on this proposal."
"The abolition of checks at internal borders – that is, the expansion of the Schengen area – is an important political objective for creating an area in the European Union based on freedom."
"The Schengen evaluation process launched at the beginning of this year has already made it possible to carry out comprehensive evaluations of police and visa cooperation in the new Member States, as well as data protection at land and sea borders and at airports."
"The new Member States must meet all the conditions for applying the Schengen ."
"This also implies the existence of a viable Schengen Information System."
"The inspections arranged for this year are now well underway."
"We will be reviewing the results in December and then deciding on further measures."
"Some time ago, we received a report from the Commission concerning the delayed technical progress of the SIS II system."
"Measures and timetables relating to this must be examined openly and honestly in the light of the latest information."
"European Council policy means that we have an obligation and a desire to examine what we might be able to do to accelerate preparations for abolishing checks at internal borders."
"The Finnish Presidency has promoted the drafting of the legislation on SIS II together with the European Parliament, and hopefully we will reach consensus on this in October."
"I would like to thank Parliament’s rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for his tough but resolute approach to finding a joint solution."
"In a high-level working group in the Council, we also agreed on practical measures to try and improve coordination of the SIS II project and cooperation between national projects and preparations for the central system, which is the responsibility of the Commission."
"The Finnish Presidency of the Council raised this controversial matter immediately in July, and it was also discussed last week at Tampere."
"At next week’s Council meeting, we will be discussing the new technical preparations timetable for the SIS II project and any realistic alternative solutions that we might have at our disposal."
"This should lay the groundwork for setting a target date for removing internal border controls at the December Council and in the European Council."
"At the December Council, the overall situation with regard to the Schengen inspections may also be examined."
"We will do our utmost to expand the Schengen area as quickly as possible, with no compromises on security."
"The Treaty already contains provisions on procedures to help assess interpretations of cases under Title IV of the Treaty or the legality or interpretation of acts adopted by the Community’s institutions."
"Under Article 67 of the Treaty, the Council, acting unanimously and having consulted the European Parliament, may adapt the provisions relating to the competence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"This Friday the matter will be raised for the first time by the Court of Justice working party, and whether or not it will be discussed further will depend on the opinions expressed by the Member States there."
"The Presidency regards this as an important issue."
"As we know, the citizens of the EU quite rightly expect the European Union to be able to engage in more effective cooperation in the fight against terrorism and organised crime."
"At the same time, we have to ensure that fundamental rights and freedoms are respected."
"By virtue of the Treaty on European Union, the Council, acting unanimously and having consulted the European Parliament, may adopt the use of the bridging clause provided for in Article 42 TEU, and ‘communitarise’ police cooperation and cooperation on crime either entirely or partially."
"Last week in Tampere, an important debate was held on this subject between representatives of the Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament, and I particularly want to draw attention to the view firmly expressed there by Mr Cavada in the Council of Ministers, which reflects not only my own opinion but that of the European Parliament too."
"It was a very important addition to our debate."
"There was also huge support there for more effective decision-making."
"We are determined to continue the work in this area in accordance with the European Council’s conclusions."
"I wish to stress that this debate does not go against the Constitutional Treaty: we want to emphasise specifically the importance of the Treaty in the development of an area based on freedom, security and justice."
"In order for progress in legal and internal matters to be visible in public security as well, we need to ensure that these acts are fully integrated into the legal systems of the Member States."
"During our presidential term, we will aim to develop systems to evaluate legal and internal matters, on the basis of the Commission’s communication."
"In addition, several peer evaluation methods have been established for matters connected with organised crime and terrorism."
"Not all the Member States have yet ratified the Protocols to the Europol Convention."
"The Council has regularly reminded Member States of the importance of this matter."
"Finland trusts that the Protocol will enter into force by the end of the current year."
"Closer cooperation between law enforcement authorities has been one way of trying to achieve added value in internal security in the enlarged Union."
"The Presidency can announce that Finland will adopt actions nationally in the near future that will permit it to become a signatory to the Prüm Treaty."
"Soon at least eight Member States will have signed up to this Treaty."
"This fulfils the minimum requirement for initiating enhanced cooperation pursuant to Article 43 of the Treaty on European Union."
"As the country to hold the Presidency, we will work towards making the Prüm Treaty part of the European Union’s legal system."
"The Council will continue its discussion on the Framework Decision on procedural rights on the basis of the Commission’s initiative."
"In June, the Council decided to continue its work on the basis of the compromise proposal put forward by the Presidency."
"This imposed greater restrictions on the number and scope of rights than did the joint proposal, focusing instead on general requirements."
"We are likewise aiming to bring to a conclusion the first reading of the proposal as regards its main content during the current six-month term."
"Regarding racism and xenophobia, the Council has been advised that the Member States that had had general reservations about the draft instrument no longer have them."
"Talks can therefore start again as soon as possible."
"The European Union has developed a joint policy on immigration, border control and asylum on the basis of the Tampere European Council and the Hague Programme."
"It is founded on the solidarity of the Member States, mutual trust and shared responsibility."
"It takes full account of human and fundamental rights, including the Geneva Convention on Refugees and the right to seek asylum in the European Union."
"Member States and their authoritative bodies are responsible for controlling their external borders and immigration and carrying out asylum-seeking procedures."
"During the Finnish Presidency so far, the Council has aimed to have a comprehensive debate on immigration questions."
"This was the case both at the July Council and at the informal ministerial meeting in Tampere last week."
"Recent events in the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean highlight the destiny that the countries of Europe share and the need for commitment on the part of all the Member States."
"It is essential that the Union’s institutions – the European Parliament, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), the Commission, and other competent bodies – act in a spirit of cooperation and coordination."
"The European Union needs to step up its efforts to give practical support to Member States that bear the greatest burden when it comes to the number of illegal immigrants arriving."
"In connection with this, the Presidency presented its initiative on extended European solidarity at the meeting in Tampere."
"Under the initiative, in return for a financial contribution from the EU, procedures would be put in place to ensure that Member States adhere to jointly agreed rules and take responsibility for illegal immigrants and asylum seekers entering their territory."
"The debate on the President’s initiative is to continue, on the basis of the very positive discussions at Tampere."
"Development aid from the European Union and the Member States is crucial to eliminating the reasons for illegal migration."
"The crisis in the Mediterranean now at last shows us how important external relations are in the fight against illegal migration."
"The Global Approach to Migration and the principal measures focusing on Africa and the Mediterranean region, adopted by the European Council last December, provide a common framework within which the EU can act."
"This will strengthen cooperation between the Member States and increase dialogue with the countries of Africa and cooperation in the Mediterranean region as a whole."
"The European Council has asked the Commission to report back on the progress made by the end of this year."
"A number of important initiatives have come out of the Global Approach."
"These include the ministerial meeting in Rabat in July, the initiatives by Frontex to develop Mediterranean coastal surveillance, and special operations to help Spain and Malta."
"The Presidency is promoting these initiatives, as well as the very important Commission proposal for a Regulation for establishing Rapid Border Intervention Teams (the ‘Rabit’ Regulation)."
"One of the Finnish Presidency’s main priorities is to develop a system for the integrated control of external borders and the adoption of a strategy on this."
"Furthermore, the Commission will be examining the relevant questions in the communication on illegal immigration presented in July coherently and thoroughly."
"In order to fulfil the aims on illegal immigration set out at Tampere, a number of acts have already been passed which apply to the status of people long resident in a country, family reunification, granting residence permits to the victims of human trafficking, and admission for the purposes of study, vocational training, voluntary work and scientific research."
"Last January, the Commission adopted a policy plan on legal immigration in accordance with the mandate in the Hague Programme."
"This also takes account of the Lisbon Programme adopted in July last year."
"Another major step forward is the framework programme on solidarity and management of migration flows for the period 2007-2013 and the four funds to be established under it: the European Refugee Fund, the External Borders Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals."
"The Council is working towards an agreement at first reading with the European Parliament on these important instruments."
"The Presidency realises that the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning third country nationals who are illegally resident is very important for a common repatriation policy, but we are also aware of the issues that have to be resolved in order to reach a compromise on the proposals within a reasonable period of time."
"In partnership with the European Parliament and the Commission, the Council has already decided to intensify the debate to bring deliberations on the proposal to a conclusion."
"On the matter of asylum, a discussion on how current EU asylum rules might be improved is expected to be launched."
"The Commission is to draft a Green Paper on the future of the common European asylum system."
"This was also discussed at Tampere."
"It is the goal of the Presidency to ensure that the current minimum standards are transformed into genuine common rules on asylum and subsidiary protection."
"Practical cooperation between Member States on asylum issues also needs to be reinforced."
"The Council is expecting the Commission to put forward its proposal on this matter."
"The Council is also expecting the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal in the near future with regard to extending long-term residential status to refugees and to those who have gained subsidiary protection status."
"Increased transparency in the work of the Union is a key aim."
"In June, the European Council agreed on measures to enhance transparency."
"The Finnish Presidency stresses the vital importance of transparency, and proposes actively to take forward the debate on transparency on the basis of the Green Paper."
"The transparency banner was also waved vigorously at Tampere."
"Finally, with regard to the secret detention facilities mentioned in a speech by the President of the United States of America in early September, I wish to reassure Parliament that the Council is aware of the possible implications."
"At a sitting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in September, ministers expressed their commitment to combating terrorism effectively using all the legal means and tools available to them."
"Terrorism is simply a threat to a system of values based on the rule of law."
"Human rights and humanitarian standards have to be adhered to in the fight against terrorism."
"As I said at a meeting in August in London, not one victory must go to terrorism or to their efforts to undermine our fundamental rights and values."
"At the JHA Council in July, I said that I thought it was essential that the Member States should also encourage a report on CIA flights carrying prisoners to be produced, in order to strengthen the basis of more confidential and viable cooperation on security."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that my speech has gone on for so long, but I have been involved in parliamentary work for 24 years now."
"When you get a chance to speak to such an agreeable gathering, you can feel like saying a bit too much, but I would like to say in conclusion that our citizens expect the European Union to deliver security, more effective decision-making and the ability to respond to new challenges as a matter of course."
"They will also insist that we should be able to fight organised crime and terrorism and control migration flows and our common external borders effectively."
"It is our responsibility and a challenge to parliamentary competence, both in the European Parliament and the national parliaments, to respond together to the demand being made of Europe that it should be a fair and safe place for everyone to live."
"Thank you very much, Mr Rajamäki."
"The Council and the Commission have no time limit."
"They can therefore take the opportunity to speak for as long as they need or see fit, but there are still only twenty-four hours in the day."
"."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to express my profound satisfaction at the excellent cooperation with the Finnish Presidency, in particular, Mr Rajamäki and Mrs Luhtanen, and with the European Parliament, particularly with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and Mr Cavada."
"Implementing and further developing The Hague Programme is a joint goal."
"This calls for effective decision-making and requires clear political priorities to make a real difference."
"The strategic political goal remains striking the right balance between improving citizens’ security and promoting and defending people’s individual rights."
"As you know, last week in Tampere, we discussed the main challenges in the area of freedom, security and justice and how best to address them."
"It is clear that the fight against terrorism and the management of migration flows are currently the main priorities for the European Union."
"As I stressed in Tampere, I consider that our efforts in the fight against terrorism at European level need to focus on key areas such as fighting radicalisation and recruitment, the misuse of the internet by terrorists, the prevention and detection of the misuse of explosives, the protection of critical infrastructures, bio-preparedness and transport security."
"I am also convinced that any new security measure, especially in relation to air transport, should not bring about a disproportionate reaction which, in my view, would hand victory to terrorism."
"Security is at the centre of my action and we will assess carefully the effect and proportionality of any decision taken in that field."
"The fight against terrorism and the defence of individual rights should go hand in hand."
"As regards migration, the Commission decided to set up a Commissioners’ Group on Migration Issues."
"I have the privilege of coordinating that group, which brings together all the policy areas relevant to migration management: from justice and home affairs to development, employment, education and training, regional policy, economic issues, external relations and European neighbourhood policy."
"That comprehensive approach involves legal and illegal immigration, as well as integration."
"Solidarity, in the form of financial support and the deployment of experts and equipment to our shared borders, is also an essential element of this approach."
"While the focus is clearly on migration from Africa, such an approach has to take into account migratory movement from other regions of the world, particularly from our eastern neighbours, some of the countries from which many kinds of illegal trafficking originate."
"In the field of illegal immigration, we have, as you know, recently taken many practical measures, particularly in relation to migration flows affecting southern Member States of the European Union."
"Frontex, in particular, has been very active in coordinating assistance to the Member States in question, for example the Canary Islands, and further operations are planned in the short term in the central Mediterranean area."
"Solidarity means practical help to Member States under pressure."
"We need funds, equipment, boats, helicopters and aeroplanes."
"For example, for the period 2007-2013, the Frontex Agency will have EUR 272 million, which I deem insufficient to deal with the growing phenomenon of migration."
"Next year the agency’s budget will be some EUR 21 million."
"I hope that Parliament will agree to a further increase in the financial envelope."
"Additional financial support has been provided to the Member States most affected, in particular Spain, Malta and Italy, via the ARGO programme."
"In that regard, I should like to mention that last week the Commission decided to fund six emergency projects in the above countries."
"The Commission has also adopted a package of measures to help Mauritania in its efforts to contain the flow of illegal migrants to the Canary Islands under the Rapid Reaction Mechanism."
"We shall do the same concerning other important partners in sub-Saharan Africa, such as Senegal."
"As regards the management of the southern external maritime border, I presented to the informal Tampere Council a set of recommendations for operational measures to be taken in the short term, that is, before the summer of 2007."
"Those recommendations include: firstly, the setting-up of an operational command centre in the relevant regions to coordinate a Mediterranean coastal patrol network; secondly, exploring the establishment of a European surveillance system in order to link up the existing national surveillance systems; thirdly, making the pooling of assets a reality with equipment made available by all Member States to be put at the disposal, at short notice, of a Member State requesting assistance; fourthly, exploring options for the creation of a team of asylum experts in close cooperation with international organisations, above all the United Nations; fifthly, making the maximum and best use of current and future financial instruments."
"The above measures aim to strengthen the Community’s capacity to manage and prevent the kind of situations we have seen this year, and should be taken in parallel with the implementation of the global approach on migration adopted by the European Council last December."
"It is a matter of ensuring an immediate political response based on tangible European solidarity – and I stress the word ‘tangible’ – and a sharing of responsibilities and burdens."
"That means, as recently stressed by President Barroso and by myself at Tampere, it is of the utmost importance that all Member States continue working together in a spirit of solidarity, not least to assist those southern Member States most affected today by illegal immigration from Africa."
"It must be absolutely clear that it is up to Member States to provide the assets required to make the joint operations a success."
"We have made a start, but just a start."
"The size of the problem, however, is such that much more work is needed."
"In that regard, I also hope that from next spring the European Union can make use of the Rapid Border Intervention Teams, whereby teams of national experts, under the coordination of Frontex, will provide quick technical and operational assistance to Member States in need."
"Addressing migration in a comprehensive manner also entails developing a structural approach and reinforcing the inclusion of migration in European external policies. This includes looking at the root causes of migration and development issues."
"The Commission is making serious efforts to make migration an integral part of its development policy and is engaging in particular with African countries on this matter."
"In particular, we must give priority to the implementation of the action plan agreed in Rabat last July and to the preparation of a successful European-African conference on migration with the African Union."
"It is hoped that it will take place in November in Tripoli, Libya."
"We should also strengthen our cooperation with North African countries, in particular Algeria, Morocco and Libya, on migration issues, including the issue of international protection, which necessitates a regional response."
"In this regard, both EU Member States and North African countries must take responsibility for those in need of international protection, including asylum seekers."
"Refugee protection is another important part of my portfolio and I am happy to announce to you that two specific regional programmes will start in the coming weeks."
"We should also ensure that illegal migrants are returned to their countries."
"In this respect, the Commission is ready to support the efforts of Member States politically, diplomatically and financially, while fully respecting people’s individual dignity."
"We should also not forget another important element in fighting illegal immigration: the need to step up the fight against illegal work."
"It is a key pull factor for illegal immigration."
"As mentioned in July’s Commission communication on illegal migration, we are currently considering drafting a legislative instrument to harmonise sanctions against employers of illegally resident migrants."
"Obviously, Member States would have to take immediate measures in this direction, so as to address the issue of illegal work."
"In relation to legal economic migration, I must emphasise that the implementation of the Policy Plan on Legal Migration is a priority for the Commission and for me personally."
"By eliminating illegal work and creating admission procedures for legal migrants, Europe will set up a virtuous circle, or, should I say, a positive structure of incentives."
"The Commission is convinced of the necessity of a common approach to managing economic migration as an additional means of achieving the Lisbon objectives and tackling the negative effects of demographic ageing, in order to foster the European economy and competitiveness."
"In particular, to contribute to economic growth, it is fundamental that Europe becomes, first and foremost, a real pole of attraction for highly skilled migrants."
"The idea of proposing a directive on the conditions for admission to the European Union for highly skilled workers, including the possibility of a European green card, responds to this economic necessity."
"Europe continues to receive low-skilled or unskilled labour only, while the United States, Canada and Australia, for example, are able to attract talented migrants."
"However, at the same time, I think proper measures should be taken to avoid the growing risk of a brain-drain from poorer countries."
"A proposal for a directive on the rights of legal migrants in employment constitutes the other pillar of the Commission’s policy in this field for the next year."
"Both proposals will be presented in the second half of 2007, under the Portuguese Presidency."
"Last but not least, I should like to stress another important element of European immigration policy: the integration of migrants."
"As highlighted in the Common Agenda for Integration, which I put forward in September 2005, greater integration efforts are crucial for a successful common European immigration policy."
"I strongly hope that after the Council in Luxembourg has endorsed this global European approach towards migration, the same European common approach will also be approved at the highest political level by the European Council in Lahti."
"Let me now turn to the ‘ clause’."
"In Tampere, as Minister Rajamäki and Mr Cavada have just said, we also discussed how to improve decision-making in the field of security and justice, in particular by using the ‘’ or ‘bridging clause’."
"As you know, the Commission’s position has always been very close to Parliament’s on this issue, as we consider that the bridging clause represents an appropriate and important tool for the Union and Member States to ensure greater efficiency, transparency and accountability of the decision-making process in addition to greater democratic legitimacy, given the stronger role of Parliament."
"The debate in Tampere has been very open and constructive."
"All the Member States, even those that are still reluctant, agreed on the need to move forward."
"While some of them expressed fears that a decision now on the ‘clause’ would pre-empt the debate on relaunching the constitutional process, I believe this is not the case."
"We will be among the first to welcome a positive outcome of the exploration the German Presidency intends to carry out in 2007 and we will give them our full support."
"Nevertheless, we have to prepare ourselves for a situation where the ‘passerelle’ clause may be the only way to address the urgent need that all of us share."
"I agree that we need the Constitution, but if we wait we may find ourselves paralysed."
"In any case, as you know, when the Constitution comes into force the ‘passerelle’ clause will be incorporated into it automatically."
"I agreed with Minister Rajamäki when he said in Tampere that Europe is like a bicycle: either it goes ahead or it falls to the ground."
"And it was only by going ahead faster than others that my compatriot Bettini won the Cycling World Championship a few days ago."
"We must, therefore, continue this very important political discussion, building upon the common goodwill shown by all Member States in Tampere."
"At the next Justice and Home Affairs Council, which takes place in a few days in Luxembourg, we will have a chance to decide on how to move this important dossier forward."
"Finally, citizens do want more Europe."
"Europe would then be more effective in taking decisions."
"Practitioners, judges, prosecutors and police authorities also want more effective instruments to fight organised crime and terrorism."
"To be frank, we cannot allow civil society to move faster than our political strategies and policies."
"If we want to be credible, we have to respond now and not only after tragic events, as has happened in the past."
"We thank the Vice-President of the Commission for his explanation of what happened in Tampere and for his optimistic view of what took place there."
"We shall now hear the opinions of the political groups."
"Please bear in mind that the Members’ speaking time is restricted."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the management of migratory flows, and hence the control of immigration into the EU, is among the most pressing problems with which we have to deal, and it goes without saying that doing so involves looking beyond our narrow national horizons, but that does not mean that we can limit ourselves to a European analysis or to European approaches either."
"Cooperation with transit countries and countries of origin, and support given to them, are part of the solution, but what is also needed is an integrated approach, for immigration needs to be regulated, and that cannot be a matter for internal policy alone; solutions can be found only by joint efforts across various policy areas."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has for a long time been calling for immigration policy that takes account of the needs and rights of other Member States."
"For example, one cannot go ahead with a mass legalisation without informing or consulting others, only to seek help from the EU once that action begins to suck other migrants in."
"It is fundamental that national immigration policy must bear in mind its effects on other Member States."
"It has to be said, though, that making a policy area – in this case, that of immigration – part of Community policy-making, which involves making it subject to codecision, is not a panacea."
"There are certainly many problems that affect us all, but at least an equal number that are specifically national, regional or even local in character."
"For many, one of the attractions of a Community policy on economic migration is that it not only extends their own powers, but could also help with the enforcement of an immigration policy for which there was no majority support at national level, but that motivation takes no account of the Member States’ right to adequate solutions; no policy can succeed unless the citizens of our Member States have a hand in framing it."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we, in our group, have spent a great deal of time working out how we were going to approach today’s debate."
"The last time I took the floor of this House to speak in a debate on internal and security policy was when I spoke on the European arrest warrant and the plan for a European Public Prosecutor’s office, following which I had an enormous row with the President-in-Office of the Council."
"I have no desire to repeat that experience today, but I have to tell the President-in-Office and the Commissioner that I am not going to mince my words either."
"Looking around the Chamber, I can see Mr Kirkhope, Mr Pirker, Mrs Klamt, Mr Watson, Mrs Lambert and Mrs Roure; like me, all of them were sitting here six years ago, when we all said exactly the same things."
"At the time, Mr Watson was the Committee chairman, and the Commissioner was a certain Mr Vitorino, who, by way of a follow-up to Tampere, presented us with what was called a scoreboard, which incorporated all the measures that you, Mr President-in-Office, and you, Commissioner, have described."
"The scoreboard owed its name to the fact that it explicitly specified timeframes, with measure A to be transposed by the Member States within period B, and the Commission’s report to reach the Council within period C, and so on."
"Why, then, six years on, are we again sitting in this House discussing the same issues, the passerelle clause, for example?"
"Six years ago, we were full of optimism when we discussed the provision in the Treaty of Nice to the effect that, from 1999 onwards, and entering into effect five years later – that is, in 2004 – and subject to a unanimous vote in Council, the policy areas that we are discussing today should become subject to the codecision procedure, yet, two years later, nothing has happened yet."
"Mrs Klamt made an important point when she said that we must not, where integration or the processing of asylum applications are concerned, interfere with the powers of national, local and regional authorities, but nor can we tolerate a situation in which Community rules and regulations are indispensable yet not forthcoming."
"The streams of migrants reaching Europe’s southern coasts, which we are discussing today, will not be managed by restrictive measures alone; they call for an approach combining measures against organised crime, measures to give immigrants legal status and a coordinated policy of integration."
"That is not news to any of us."
"Why, then, are the Member States refusing to implement the proposals that Commissioner Frattini has just described? I think I know the answer to that question."
"The reason why they are refusing to do it is that these policy areas – the security of external borders, asylum, the law on citizenship, freedom of establishment and movement, police and justice policy – give them an opportunity to say to their citizens: ‘It is we – not anyone else – who hold the reins of power in this state.’"
"For fifteen years, the states have shrunk back from the abrogation of sovereignty that the transfer of such rights to the European Union represents, and I can understand why they do, for it involves, to a degree, the surrender of national power, but this surrender of a bit of power must be weighed against the prospect of migration, people-trafficking, uncontrolled immigration and the problems associated with them being allowed to drag on even longer."
"For ten years, the interior ministers of the European Union have failed to do anything about this, and this state of affairs must be brought to an end."
"That is why the approach to which our question refers, and the answers we have been given today – particularly by Commissioner Frattini – are right, but it is time for action at long last."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Cavada for his oral question, the opportunity for this debate, and the excellent work that he and his colleagues do in their committee."
"I had the honour to chair that committee at the time of the Council meeting in 1999 in Tampere."
"I have observed the process from Tampere to Tampere."
"It has been seven lean years."
"Rather like a critic once said of Samuel Beckett’s play : ‘It is a two-act play in which nothing happens, twice.’"
"I salute the efforts of Commissioner Frattini and of the Finnish Presidency in trying to coax and cajole the Member States forward."
"Mr Rajamäki spoke of breathing new life into the spirit of Tampere."
"It is desperately needed."
"But the fact is that the country I know best threw a spanner into the works when it insisted on having three pillars."
"Other countries are now blocking the process of repair."
"Unless we are able to bring in the footbridge – the ‘ clause’ – we will never have a credible policy in justice and home affairs."
"We will continue with a policy like a push-bike when what we need is a Ducati."
"Member States sit there in their medieval fastnesses with the drawbridges firmly up."
"In the name of national sovereignty they are enhancing global anarchy."
"Our citizens demand better."
"In the early period of building the European Union, political leaders were ahead of public opinion."
"They saw leadership as painting a vision of the Europe they wanted and leading people towards it."
"That can be a dangerous strategy, but far less dangerous than being in the position – as you pointed out, Commissioner – of being behind public opinion."
"Our citizens are asking: why is there no immigration policy to prevent the human tragedy we see on our southern shores?"
"Why are we not sharing criminal intelligence in the fight against terrorism or the fight against drugs?"
"Why is there no access to justice for victims of cross-border crime or cross-border marital breakdown?"
"When ministers meet, as Abba Eban once said in a different context, they ‘never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity’."
"We want to see more emphasis on European values."
"We may have no constitution, but we have a Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Mr Rajamäki, you said that human rights are at the top of the Council’s concerns and fully taken into account."
"Are you sure?"
"What about the CIA secret prisons saga, where this House was right to set up a committee on rendition to see whether we need to use Article 7?"
"What about the PNR issue, where the 2007 agreement to replace the sticking-plaster solution you have devised this month must be in tandem with the framework decision on the protection of personal data?"
"And what about minimum procedural guarantees for suspects in criminal proceedings: why is that issue still at the bottom of the in-tray?"
"Of course there is some progress."
"But too often the Union looks like the mime artist Marcel Marceau; he appears to be climbing a wall but actually he is going nowhere."
"I want Mr Frattini and the Presidency to take to the Council on 6 October the message that Europe demands better."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has been in favour of these topics becoming part of Community procedure ever since the Treaty of Maastricht invented the pillar system, which in theory was only meant to be temporary but in reality has proved to be fairly definitive."
"Procedures are not everything, however, and I wonder what policy will now be implemented on these topics by Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"The priority seems to be that of reducing, rejecting, constraining and eliminating, and it is curious to note that this debate began with the Commissioner speaking about terrorism and maintaining that security must be our top priority."
"I believe that this speaks volumes, not least about what many of our leaders think constitutes a priority."
"Despite the borders, the terrible risks, and the ever-increasing tolerance of violations of international law, we will not succeed in stopping immigration, and that has to be a point on which we are all quite clear."
"Frankly, Commissioner, I do not like it when you overuse the word ‘solidarity’, especially when you mean ‘helping the Member States to refuse entry at the borders to people who arrive in a desperate state, without any rights’."
"I should also like to point out that, by adopting this approach, we have by no means eliminated the risk that, if we refuse entry at the borders to people arriving by boat, we will be seriously breaching the right of many of them to seek asylum, insofar as they are being sent straight back to the place from which they came."
"Mass legalisations, which are condemned not only by Mrs Klamt, but also by Mr Frattini, are a direct result of the policy that says ‘zero immigration is possible’, but that actually hides a reality, namely that we need immigrants."
"Mr Frattini, Mr Rajamäki, I do not know whether it is true that the majority of the illegal immigrants who come to our countries have no qualifications."
"I know of cases of history teachers and electricians: qualified people who come here but who cannot find jobs for qualified workers, because they obviously become mixed up with people who have no qualifications whatsoever; in my opinion, saying that the problem is one of depriving developing countries of people who can, instead, help those countries to get out of their underdeveloped state is the wrong message for the European Union to be sending out."
"Finally, Mr Rajamäki, Mr Frattini, I should like it if you could give your ideas on the topic of agreements with third countries."
"My group and I are very concerned about this issue; we know that some of the Member States, such as France, Spain and Italy, are using understandings between police forces to secretly negotiate agreements with third countries that give no guarantees whatsoever regarding respect for people’s rights; we know full well that those countries very often deliberately violate the rights not only of their own citizens, but also of migrants."
"This is particularly true of Libya, to which Mr Frattini has just stated his desire to donate a large sum of money."
"Personally, I should like it if he were to spend a little time explaining what kind of democracy and publicity is required for agreements such as this one."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that, after the failure of last week's Informal Summit in Tampere, the decision has been taken not only to stop pedalling, but perhaps also to lean the bicycle against the wall."
"Today’s debate also shares this characteristic: the fight against terrorism, the CIA flights, PNR and police cooperation are all being mixed up with immigration."
"Only when we realise that the topic of immigration must be dissociated from repressive policies, measures to criminalise migrants and the methods used to combat terrorism and organised crime will it then be possible to hold a serious debate on a common European Union policy on immigration."
"We must also ban from our debate any talk of an invasion: the label 'invasion' is untrue and unfounded; we all know that only 15% of illegal immigrants come by sea from Africa and that all the rest come by land or by air."
"This is the case in Spain and Italy too, even allowing for the numbers of migrants who arrive in the Canary Islands or Lampedusa."
"We need to start again using legal channels. As the Commission Green Paper informed us: ‘We need 20 million immigrant workers by 2030.’"
"So let us take steps to let these people in, instead of leaving them to drown at sea."
"We do not understand what Frontex did this summer to prevent people from dying."
"Europe cannot become known for turning immigrants away , nor can we allow the Atlantic and the Mediterranean to become open-air cemeteries."
"I have a proposal to make to Mr Frattini: let us build a monument, an eternal reminder of the migrants drowned at sea."
"In a few months’ time, it will be the 10th anniversary of the first recognised drowning of migrants at sea, when a boat carrying almost 400 emigrants sank off Porto Palo, between Malta and Sicily."
"Let us make a humanitarian gesture!"
"Let us build a monument, a symbolic collective tomb for the unknown men and women who died at sea because they were seeking a better future."
"As a great Roman poet might have said, ‘let us build a collective monument more lasting than bronze’."
"When it comes to holding a serious debate on immigration, this is probably the most powerful, most practical gesture that Europe can now make."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have already taken the floor on many occasions in this House in order to stress the urgent need for a common immigration policy, and I am pleased to note the recent initiatives undertaken at Community level and the recent release of funds intended for crisis-hit countries."
"The gradual realisation on the part of the Member States – which are now convinced, albeit belatedly perhaps, of the countless tragic deaths in the Mediterranean – that migration no longer just affects the States on the edge of the EU and that the general objectives of economic growth can only be achieved within a general climate of security is anything but trivial."
"This realisation may at last persuade them to take an equal share in the responsibility and financial burden of managing our borders."
"This is a real commitment, and it is also demonstrated by the increased financial resources that the EU will make available over the next seven years for the purposes of consolidating an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Another positive aspect is the creation of a specific programme aimed at controlling migratory flows with funds intended for repatriations, refugees and integration."
"Equally important is the creation of a border management agency, which unfortunately still does not have enough staff, but I hope that it will gradually benefit from more attention and funds."
"I hope that, by taking this step, we will be able to create common minimum standards for combating illegal immigration and controlling legal immigration and that we will be able to draft a credible policy that respects the rights of individuals."
"However, a credible policy can only be rigorous; there is no place for a European policy that promotes mass legalisations and that indiscriminately hands out citizenship rights."
"It is widely known these days not only that legalisations do not allow problems to be resolved without immigrants' circumstances being improved, but that they nearly always exacerbate them instead, merely encouraging marginalisation and widespread crime, which often result in terrorism."
"Finally, being credible means reaffirming the ideals of solidarity and of safeguarding the EU’s own freedoms, and tying this to respect for the law."
"The EU will never refuse to help the needy and those who genuinely want to integrate, but when it comes to those who want to export violence, culture, values and religions, the 'zero tolerance' principle must take effect; we may not like it, but sometimes it is crucial."
". Mr President, last week’s informal summit in Tampere made one thing clear: the Member States fundamentally disagree on how to tackle illegal immigration."
"Everyone can see that a solution is needed, but opinions differ on how this should be done."
"That is why the immigration issue is something that Member States are keen to consign to the European negotiation tables, and that is how history gets to repeat itself."
"In the late 1990s, the Netherlands and Germany, facing major problems with the influx of asylum seekers, insisted on solidarity and a distribution of the burden."
"France, Spain and Portugal, however, obstructed every solution at European level, while northern Member States now fail to react to requests for help."
"It is at the European level, though, that the solution must be found."
"A common market with a shared space in which citizens can move freely requires consistent security of its external borders and regulated access to that space."
"European policy for illegal immigration is necessary, provided that countries stop acting independently."
"If the Spanish authorities can give 700 000 illegal immigrants an amnesty without consulting other Member States, then Spain cannot expect help from other Member States."
"Finally, President Bush has acknowledged the existence of secret CIA prisons."
"To this day, though, it is unclear in which countries these prisons were situated, and whether any of them were in the European Union."
"I should like to hear from the Council and Commission what they intend to do in order to dispel this uncertainty."
"Mr President, by regularising the status of one and a half million illegal immigrants in 2005, Spain and Italy have provoked a huge influx of people from Africa, the continent nearest to Western Europe and something of a suburb of Paris."
"Spain, rightly accused of irresponsibility in regularising the status of illegal immigrants, argues in response that the majority of Africans arriving in the Canaries – 25 000 since the beginning of the year – are French speakers whose intention it is to travel on to other countries."
"That being the case, one can appreciate why the truly disastrous Schengen agreement, applied since 1985, needs to be repealed, as it enables any illegal immigrants arriving in Spain, Italy or elsewhere, their status newly regularised, to enter France and benefit from all the social benefits provided there."
"Having missed eight of the last ten Council meetings for ministers of the interior, Mr Sarkozy is in no real position to criticise Spain, and this at a time when France is in favour of abolishing the requirement of unanimity in judicial and police cooperation, that is to say is in favour of abandoning one of its sovereign powers."
"It is crucial to be able to monitor our own borders at a time when immigration is a worldwide phenomenon."
"The task of monitoring thousands of kilometres of eminently porous coastline or land borders cannot be entrusted to others, and the Member States’ shortcomings in this regard cannot be made up for by Frontex, this European setup that is supposed to monitor Europe’s borders."
"Unless we deal with the problem of immigration at source and come up with a large-scale development policy, we shall continue to play host to millions of immigrants who, little by little, will destabilise the Europe we know and finally swamp it."
"The European institutions are merely accelerating this downward spiral by favouring an immigration policy referred to hypocritically by Mr Sarkozy as ‘selective immigration’."
"The nations of Europe should take charge of their own affairs again, as Switzerland has just done, and protect themselves against the migratory invasion that has only just begun."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Frattini on having quite rightly once again used a term that is crucial at this point in the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice: the term priorities."
"In this regard, I would like to say that we need a great debate and a great result, which cannot be delayed at this point in the construction of the European Union, because we are often talking about concrete measures, but we need to define what is most important."
"In one decade, what will be the final objective in terms of the competences of the European Union and the Member States with regard to the two issues that Mr Frattini has mentioned: immigration and radical Islamist terrorism?"
"That debate cannot be postponed, and, until it takes place and until we have a result, we will not be able to make the correct and appropriate progress in these areas."
"It is a pre-constitutional debate."
"It is undoubtedly the thing that creates the most fear today amongst Europeans in terms of their future."
"It is therefore a pre-constitutional debate and therefore, Mr Frattini and representatives of the Council, it is something that cannot be postponed under any circumstances."
"A European Union in one decade is impossible without an immigration policy."
"It is impossible to conceive of a United States of America with as many immigration policies as it has States."
"It is impossible to accept that with regard to an emerging phenomenon such as Islamic terrorism – which has dared to move on from placing bombs on a bus to placing bombs on a plane, from attacking cartoons to directly attacking the Pope, that is, an emerging phenomenon – the European Union and its institutions do not yet have a political role that the citizens can see."
"It may be little, it may be enough or it may be a lot, but the serious problem is that the European citizens do not know what the European Union does, either in the field of immigration or in the field of terrorism."
"This is therefore a debate that cannot be postponed."
"This is the pre-constitutional debate yet to be held and it is the great debate that Europeans will hold over the coming months."
"Mr President, our debate is taking place soon after the Tampere II ministerial meeting, at which the Member States tackled issues fundamental to implementing a genuine European area of freedom, security and justice."
"I am happy, then, that the issue of the bridging clause is finally up for discussion by the Council."
"We are of, course, in favour of communitising the whole of the third pillar, particularly where legal immigration is concerned – a process that will finally help stop a number of Member States from blocking matters."
"I would therefore ask the Council to continue with its discussions, which will, I hope, enable this bridging clause eventually to be activated."
"I also wish to raise the issue of the agreement on transferring personal data in connection with flights, otherwise known as the Passenger Names Records (PNR) agreement."
"Discussions with the US authorities are under way, but I understand that these authorities want still more."
"Could Vice-President Frattini tell us whether these negotiations will lead to a common agreement before the end of the month, which is not far off?"
"We agreed on a two-stage procedure whereby the content would be discussed again in 2007."
"Will the Americans really also be proceeding on that basis?"
"I should like, in this connection, to address a remark to the Council and point out that the European Parliament is now awaiting a firm commitment from the Council regarding the framework decision on data protection."
"At the Tampere ministerial meeting, the Council appears to have gone back on the strong commitments on immigration made by the European Union seven years ago, particularly when it comes to putting in place a common immigration policy and common asylum system between now and 2010."
"In this area, too, the deadline is close."
"My group emphasises that better management of the external borders can only be one aspect of our common immigration policy."
"No one can remain indifferent to the difficulties and the humanitarian crisis presented at our borders, particularly in southern Europe, or to the huge influx of migrants and asylum seekers."
"We therefore want to see European solidarity strengthened."
"We ask that Europe share the burdens and responsibilities of its immigration policy."
"We also want to see partnerships implemented with the countries of origin and transit, based above all on respect for both fundamental rights and the right of asylum."
"We must not, however, in any instance allow our borders to be controlled externally."
"We want a comprehensive and transversal approach to immigration problems."
"The fight against illegal immigration must be accompanied by practical proposals, whether they be in favour of opening legal immigration channels or of real and effective co-development."
"We must fight against the underlying causes of migration in the shape of poverty and conflicts."
"We must allow third countries in difficulties to develop, and migration must also be perceived as a positive factor for development, helping to reduce poverty."
"We propose, for example, putting in place financial support for immigrants in their countries of origin."
"To conclude, we want to see active exchange between countries of the North and those of the South and to be made aware of how the proposals in this area put forward in Rabat will be put into practice."
"Mr President, as the immigration problem is one of the biggest challenges to face us so far in 2006, one would think that all Member States would have been aware of the urgency of this problem by now, but nothing seems to be further from the truth."
"The reports on last week’s meeting in Tampere were enough to make one squirm."
"Indecisiveness reigned supreme."
"A truly humanitarian tragedy is unfolding along the Union's external borders, partly on account of the Member States’ failing policy, and I have to say, I am deeply embarrassed."
"The Council’s primary aim – if one can speak of such a thing existing at all – is to reinforce the external borders."
"Frontex is the key word, but it relies on the resources and manpower supplied by the Member States, and those resources are still extremely limited."
"Moreover, it is an illusion to think that the flows of immigrants can be controlled by reinforced external borders alone, not that those are something we should want either."
"We must look at the reasons why immigrants choose to leave their countries in droves."
"The link between immigration and development is paramount."
"Large-scale and strategic investments in the countries of origin are necessary."
"You might well want to call it a modern Marshall Plan."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you should follow the example set by Commissioner Frattini, who has, on a number of occasions, asked you to consider a total package of measures, which alone will enable the Union to have any impact, so I urge you to realise your ambitions, as enshrined in the Tampere programme and confirmed at The Hague, to get stuck into this so important link between immigration and development, establish those cooperation agreements with the countries of origin and transit, draft, as a matter of urgency, a European return policy according to which everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, launch those information campaigns, make sure this European green card becomes a reality, and deal with your own black market in labour."
"I should like to urge the Council, to use its own metaphor, to pedal as fast as it can."
"– Mr President, exactly a year ago, more than 11 and perhaps as many as 16 migrants were shot dead in Ceuta and Melilla."
"Were the bullets Spanish or Moroccan?"
"We do not know, and no inquiry has been conducted."
"All that we know at present is that one of those killed was from Cameroon."
"As for the others, no one has any idea who they were."
"Have we learned the lessons of this tragedy?"
"Not at all, because, in July, three other migrants died – in Melilla, I think – and pressure continues to be exerted on Morocco to sign a readmission agreement even though we have, since then, seen evidence every day that police roundups and deportations into the desert are continuing in this country, as well as violations of the fundamental rights of migrants, including those with papers from the High Commissioner for Refugees."
"What lessons have we learned from this tragedy?"
"The pressure we continue to put on Morocco has simply caused migrants to take ever more perilous routes further to the south."
"A few years ago, the idea of reaching the Canaries in small motor boats would have been absolutely unthinkable."
"Today, it is a reality experienced by many."
"We know how many of these people arrive in the Canary Islands. We do not know how many left Africa."
"Thousands, perhaps."
"Who are they, and what are their names? How many people have perished in this way in Mauritanian or Senegalese waters?"
"What is the policy in question, and what, Mr Frattini, do I hear you say in your interviews?"
"I hear you say that you want a European armada, with patrols, aircraft, boats and military helicopters; that you want, indeed, to protect our borders."
"That is what I read and what I hear you say, Mr Frattini."
"Why this bellicose language?"
"Have we gone to war against migrants?"
"European Union policy has entered an absolutely vicious circle."
"We are buying third countries’ collaboration in supervising their own frontiers, that is to say we are shutting migrants into their own countries."
"Mr President, Mr Frattini, Mr Rajamäki, the thousands of people who have died in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean have made a mistake, and that is to have been born people."
"If they had been born goods or currency – if possible the pound, the dollar or the euro – the European Union would have reacted in a different, very hospitable, manner."
"They were born people, however, my friends."
"They have committed the terrible crime of leaving their countries to escape hunger or war and to try to live in peace."
"That is the crime they have committed."
"I would beg the Commission and the Council never again to discuss terrorism and immigration at the same time."
"It is an affront to civilisation."
"I would beg you never to do it again."
"Because if you do, you encourage speeches like that of Mr Le Pen – fascist, racist and xenophobic – or actions such as those of countries that are European, but not members of the Union, such as Switzerland, which are very welcoming when it comes to financial flows, banking flows, my friend, but when it comes to people, they even call into question the right to request asylum."
"That should not be the European Union’s message. I therefore believe that we must entirely change our approach."
"They are people and they deserve a civilised response."
"– Mr President, I would like to raise the issue of so-called forced labour camps."
"One such camp became public knowledge a few months ago."
"It was located in the south of Italy and run by an international criminal gang who forced foreign labourers, mostly Poles, to work and even went as far as murdering some of those who tried to escape."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to say a few words of praise for the actions of a certain Italian lady who has spontaneously taken it upon herself to care for the grave of an unknown worker who was murdered there."
"She is an old lady with a low income."
"Her gesture has been reported in the Italian and Polish press, and I would like to convey my deep gratitude to her."
"This really is a very serious problem."
"It is likely that the camp discovered is not the only one of its kind. Indeed, there are many indications in the press that similar camps probably exist in other countries."
"It is therefore incumbent on us to place this matter at the top of our agenda."
"– Mr President, the ability to control one’s borders and decide who should be a citizen in your country is one of the most basic characteristics of a nation state, and in that regard the UK is very lucky because we are not part of the continent of Europe."
"We are an island, we have our own natural borders and it is for that reason that I, and the vast majority of the British population, do not want immigration to be controlled at a European level, believing it far better that we organise it for ourselves."
"But while I am here listening to these debates I am struck that too often we are talking about immigration from third countries, from outside the European Union coming in; we are not talking about what is going on between the Member States."
"Just yesterday there was an announcement that two very poor eastern European countries – Romania and Bulgaria – will join the EU."
"Well, it is perfectly obvious that if you have the free movement of peoples between countries with vastly differing levels of wealth it will lead to a huge migratory flow; all of which makes me wonder how on earth Commission President Barroso can have decided that he is going to make a Romanian the new Immigration Commissioner!"
"This debate goes to the very heart of what the EU is all about, and it is becoming perfectly obvious that no nation can control its own borders, decide its own immigration policy, and at the same time remain part of the European Union."
"When this argument gets out there amongst the peoples of Europe, it will be a potentially explosive issue, because once again we have the political class here in the institutions of Brussels and Strasbourg heading in one direction, and public opinion demanding that you head in completely the opposite direction."
"You may have got away with it on previous policies, but on the question of immigration you will not."
"You have been warned!"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first decision made by Mr Prodi’s new government in Italy was to legalise the situation of 500 000 illegal immigrants, and with the family reunion policies that figure will easily reach at least a million."
"The Zapatero government in Spain has done the same, legalising 700 000 illegal immigrants."
"The other European Union countries are therefore entitled to wonder what the aim of such measures might be, other than political demagogy."
"We have to wonder why the European institutions never dare to insist that these governments face their responsibilities."
"In Italy, however, the Prodi government has gone further, even altering Community law by making it possible to claim political asylum even in situations that do not fulfil the strict criteria, which we endorse and which are legally required for recognition of political asylum – a fundamental aspect of the freedoms associated with human rights."
"The privileges of political asylum are even granted to immigrants who do not come from unsafe countries where human rights are not respected, or from war zones."
"They just need to have applied for asylum or, if their application has been rejected, to be waiting for the end of the lengthy appeals procedure."
"These policies run counter to the strict immigration policy being sketched out today by the European institutions, not least since we are talking about tightening up the asylum principle."
"It could be said, however, that such measures may become a means of getting round the rules, which are designed precisely to keep the problem under control."
"So I say, thank you, Switzerland!"
"Thank you, Christoph Blocker!"
"Long live Switzerland!"
"No more demagogy in Europe on immigration!"
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, once again we are taking stock here in this Chamber of the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"We should acknowledge that whereas much has been done, much besides remains to be done."
"I refer to the favourable comments made by Mr Rajamäki as regards the conclusion of the Schengen Information System (SIS) dossier."
"I hope it will be possible to vote quickly for a compromise at first reading providing us with the legal instrument needed to implement the second generation of SIS."
"I should also like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency for including the issue of immigration in the priorities for the forthcoming European Council."
"Hopefully, the Council will respond favourably to our request to broaden the codecision process to cover legal immigration and integration."
"We want to see more democratic legitimacy and a common European approach to migration that is based on the principles of cohesion and solidarity and that covers the integration of immigrants living legally in Europe."
"I was pleased to hear you speak about the recent events in the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean, Mr Rajamäki."
"Urgent, practical measures are needed in the area of maritime operational cooperation with a view to developing adequate surveillance capacities at our sea borders and to setting up rapid border intervention teams."
"I especially welcome Mr Frattini's remarks about the need to ensure that the Community instruments are given the necessary resources."
"Frontex, for example, must not be deprived of the financial resources it needs to carry out its work."
"Lastly, immigration policy must cover the unremitting fight against illegal immigration and against the trafficking of human beings, the return of illegal immigrants to their countries of origin, the opening up of channels for legal immigration, and cooperation and support for the development of countries of origin."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we must condemn the extraordinary mass regularisation of immigrants, as happened in Spain in May of last year."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Cavada, who has inspired a debate on an absolutely crucial issue: the area of freedom, security and justice."
"I would like to focus on the issue of immigration."
"Minister, seven years have passed since Tampere."
"I was there in a different capacity."
"Work began there on immigration and on a common policy relating to it, and today the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Frattini, has made a speech full of passion and information in support of that policy."
"I believe that this year the Commission has begun to react seriously and the assistance of a number of countries has contributed to that, particularly the countries most affected: the countries of the South."
"It has made many promises for the future."
"While I agree with him on the need for a common policy and for the unified leadership and coordination that he has advocated in the Commission, I would like to say to Vice-President Frattini that ‘actions speak louder than words’."
"In last year’s budget, which is being discharged, 80% of the heading corresponding to immigration has not been spent."
"I would remind you that, when the events in the Canary Islands took place, the Commissioner’s spokesman said that there was no money."
"I would draw your attention to something else, and that is that the money needed cannot be taken from development cooperation, because that would mean robbing Peter to pay Paul."
"I believe that that is also important."
"He has promised us an active policy of investments;"
"I believe that, with regard to Africa, it is the ‘push effect' – which is the really important thing, since it is stupid to think that Africans spend all day reading the Official Journal of the European Communities or the official State bulletins of all of the countries – that must lead us to a common policy, to common immigration criteria and to an active policy with regard to our needs."
"If we are to take a constructive approach, Mr President, that is what we must do."
"I welcome the step that has been taken, but I hope that it will have serious consequences for the future."
"– Mr President, this is a difficult thing for me to say, but Mr Schulz is absolutely right in everything he has said."
"I do not think I have ever said that in this House before, and it does not seem likely that I will ever do it again, but he has spelled out where the problem lies, namely in balancing the sovereignty of the Member States against the Union’s capacity to act."
"How much are the Member States prepared to concede, and how much capacity to act do they want the EU to have?"
"This is aptly reflected in the saying to the effect that the spirit is willing, but the flesh weak."
"Perhaps, in this instance, it will be the German Presidency of the Council that will send out the signal that moves the European Union further ahead, but I have to say that I would like to see Finland and Portugal acting as particle accelerators, for Germany, although large, is sluggish; it is comparable with France in being a country with great traditions, but not much in the way of speed."
"Like an oil tanker, it is slow and unmanoeuvrable, and less innovative than countries like Finland where these matters are concerned, and so I ask that you help the German Presidency of the Council to make it easier to weigh up where the fundamental key issues are."
"On the subject of immigration, Günther Beckstein, the Bavarian Interior Minister, made a disastrous error when he claimed that it would not be too much to expect Spain to take in 25 000 people, for what matters is not whether or not it is reasonable that they should be expected; the real point is that the fate of people – people in desperate need – waiting offshore, is at stake."
"As far as migration in search of work is concerned, the German Federal Interior Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, made it abundantly clear that legal migration cannot be considered in isolation from the labour market, so we know that nothing is happening on that front either, and, as for the Human Rights Agency that is so important to you, what the German Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, had to say about that was, in effect, ‘well, yes, all right, if we do not have any choice in the matter, but why do we have to have an agency to watch over our own fundamental rights?’"
"You can see, then, where the problem lies, so I ask you to put your particle-accelerating skills to use; you can enable Germany to make a good job of its term in the Council Presidency."
"At the moment, it is a prospect that fills me with foreboding."
"Mr President, I am delighted to see that there is so much consensus on the fundamental premise: that the phenomenon of immigration is a current and growing phenomenon and that it is not going to stop despite some people’s desire to put up barriers and walls in the sea."
"What we need to do from now on, as others have said, is to regulate those migratory flows, but to regulate them on the basis of policy and, more specifically, on the basis of European policy. Let there be no doubt, the people who come to the Canaries are not coming to stay there."
"They are passing through the Canaries. It is an entry point to Europe; it would appear that some of our fellow Members from other countries have not yet understood that."
"They are not going to the Canaries for their holidays. It is a way of getting into Europe."
"That is where we have to provide the resources."
"We cannot leave the responsibility for dealing with this issue solely to the Spanish or Canary Islands authorities."
"I do not therefore understand, and even less share, the reticence about using the passerelle procedure and communitising this issue from the point of view of collective responsibility."
"I do not understand why there is so much fear and reticence about accepting a European approach to an issue that cannot be seen in any other way."
"Please allow me to add another concern. We must not employ an ostrich-like policy and delegate or transfer responsibility for these flows to countries that are well known for their lack of respect for human rights, such as Morocco or Libya, for example."
"Mr President, there are many of us who have for years been fighting for the basic principles of the rule of law."
"In particular, we have fought for legal certainty, which is of course protection in relation to the police and other forces of the state, especially for society’s underprivileged."
"The fight has, in general, been in vain."
"Never has legal certainty been exposed to such serious threats as it is today."
"The EU Treaty’s ‘area of freedom, security and justice’ is at best a myth or, rather, perhaps, a piece of juridico-political deception, concealing the systematic destruction of the rule of law. Moreover, none of the EU’s institutions has shown an ability to implement the eminently necessary change of course."
"There is only room for two messages."
"The first is that, without having committed crimes on the scale of the United States – with Guantánamo and other torture centres around the world – the EU and the Member States commit outrages every day against both terrorist suspects and refugees who have no rights."
"The ‘Fort Europe’ police state is dangerously near."
"Secondly, the EU’s institutions have no desire to find any explanation for the two basic problems that are at the root of the evils."
"The most important cause where both points are concerned is, purely and simply, economic and social inequality in the world: inequality that increases each day as a direct consequence of the EU’s policy towards, and oppression of, the world’s poorest countries."
"This is the root of the evil."
"Only in acknowledging this will the necessary legal policy acquire any meaning."
"If, seven years after the adoption of a programme for strengthening the European Union’s external borders in order to check uncontrolled immigration, the task still remains undone, it is clear that the European Union’s common immigration policy is still a matter for the future."
"The arguments that are used in defence of uncontrolled immigration do not withstand criticism."
"Immigrants do little to help stabilise adverse demographic trends in Europe, since the jobless rate amongst immigrants significantly exceeds average levels."
"The fact that unemployment indicators also maintain the same trend amongst immigrants from second-world countries demonstrates that the task of integrating immigrants does not form part of Member States’ immigration policies."
"In actual fact, the labour market is often closed to immigrants, and this leads the Member States to open up their social insurance systems."
"In turn, this is perceived as an invitation by immigrants in ‘donor’ countries."
"I would like to say something about Europe’s common immigration policy."
"In the short term, together with significant improvement to the European Union’s external border controls it is necessary to come to an agreement on a comprehensive and structured immigration policy."
"This should be based on an assessment of the Member States’ employment markets and Member States’ potential to integrate immigrants."
"In the medium term, together with a significant improvement in the quality of the aid programmes designed for developing world countries, the Member States must be able to agree on an important revision to the European Union’s existing import and export policies, particularly in the sphere of agricultural products. Thank you."
"Mr President, fellow Members, we have heard Mr Frattini complain about our not being able to protect Europe’s southern borders, rightly pointing out that an illegal immigrant who succeeds in getting into Spain or Italy can be in Lille or Hamburg within a day, and heard him propose, like Mr Sarkozy, that the right of veto be completely abolished."
"This is one more example of European integration being used as a solution to the problems it presents."
"Have not most of the parties represented in this House opened the floodgates to uncontrolled immigration by means of the Schengen agreements and the Treaty of Amsterdam, thereby depriving the Member States of their competence in this matter?"
"The Commission is now freezing the readmission agreements between Member States and interfering in family reunification policies and even wishes to bring in 25 million additional immigrants to curb the population decline."
"No, ladies and gentlemen, it is not possible to takes turns in power for 30 years and then, as soon as the elections come along, make out that one is not responsible for the current situation."
"Moreover, we are also supposed to go further in the headlong flight towards federalism."
"Frankly, if you want to destroy European civilisation, just continue as you are."
"– Today we are speaking about progress in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Talk of progress is premature, however, when the Commission is unable or unwilling to honour its commitments for 2007 as regards the expansion of the Schengen area."
"I find it unacceptable that citizens of the ten new Member States will not be able to move freely across EU internal borders by the promised time, namely October of next year."
"It is inexplicable, in my view, that they will be subject to border police controls for a further two to three years."
"The Commission ought to behave not like a bunch of interlopers but like a body elected by this Parliament and extraordinarily well paid by the taxpayer."
"If it is incapable of getting the conditions in place for the Schengen area then it is incompetent."
"If it is simply hiding behind technical difficulties and wants to defer freedom of movement, then it is not to be trusted."
"Mr Barroso and his Commissioners are now hampering the free movement of people, which is one of the pillars of the EU."
"They should be aware of the extent to which they are risking the public’s trust in the Europe project in its current form."
"Mr President, here we are again."
"Mr Schulz was quite right."
"I dusted my 1999 speech down, Mr Schulz left the Chamber after his speech, various other things remain just the same as they were seven years ago."
"There is a lot of grey hair in this Chamber – not on me, of course."
"It is true that we have the same issues and I myself believe in pragmatic inactivity as being something we should not always be concerned about."
"In this particular area, at a time of great terrorist threat – and there were terrorist threats in 1999 as well – there is a very uncertain message being sent out that the Presidency and the Commission and, regrettably, too many of those sitting in this House then and now seem to think that the most pressing need is to bring in the under Article 42."
"I have always had reservations about imposing a single model of justice on countries where there are different legal systems evolving in different ways."
"In the case of the UK, our system of civil law is the greatest legacy of the great Angevin king Henry II, which developed with great success for over 800 years."
"Equally, we have not experienced the Napoleonic Code imposed throughout much of Europe 200 years ago."
"Even though we cannot apply that system, we have never wished to stop others doing so where it is appropriate."
"Even on its own terms, the move to harmonisation is flawed."
"The ruling in the Cassis de Dijon case was one of the key moments in the development of the internal market, giving precedence to the principle of mutual recognition over blanket harmonisation."
"The Council is due to present its mid-term review of The Hague Programme at the end of the year."
"As Piet Hein Donner, the midwife of the programme, has said, the first principle is the implementation of mutual recognition as the fundament for judicial cooperation."
"The programme is founded on the assumption of cooperation."
"Cooperation should determine the dynamics and development of European collaboration."
"I believe that is a practical and sensible approach, one which is showing signs of success and I urge the Presidency and the Commission to proceed on those lines."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on such a sensitive subject, we really must avoid having a dialogue in which nobody listens."
"Instead, it is a good idea to begin to lay down some points of reference."
"The first point of reference is the subject of immigration, which is a challenge for us all."
"We need only think about what happened this summer: once again, tens of thousands of people landed on Lampedusa and the Canaries, or it would be better to say that they arrived in Europe."
"Spain, Italy and sometimes Cyprus and Greece have often been merely gateways through which these people pour in, as they do not just stay by the gates."
"As President Borrell Fontelles, Commissioner Frattini and now the President-in-Office of the Council have also pointed out, that is why it is not just a case of a humanitarian emergency or a one-off event; above all it is a structural problem, which is testing the whole European Union and its ability to implement a European immigration policy at last."
"Such a policy is needed not in order to do any particular Member State a favour, but because the Union as a whole is involved."
"The second point of reference is that even those of us in positions of responsibility must not make the mistake of confusing immigration with terrorism, because that above all makes the people of Europe feel afraid and insecure."
"Instead, we should perhaps introduce a different paradigm: that of immigration and slavery, since many of these immigrants are beginning to be associated with that in certain Member States."
"The third point of reference is more positive, however: we have to acknowledge that we are facing a new challenge for our civilisation to address."
"Such an awareness lies at the heart of the cultural and political leap that the Union has to make on immigration."
"It is not a marginal issue that only affects a few of us, but a new commitment that the Union needs to adopt as one of the new Millennium goals, and we have already clearly spelt out what that means."
"Mr Frattini, Mr Rajamäki, we are aware that all of this will meet with considerable resistance from many governments, but if this Parliament has a role to play, then it is to exert pressure, to commit itself and to send out the message: ‘Let us do something about it.’"
"We need to tell the governments that are frightened that it is also a way to rebuild trust between the Union and its citizens, by showing that the Union exists and can make its presence felt."
"Mr President, it is a red herring to say that we cannot get effective EU action on crime, terrorism and civil liberties without a new Constitution."
"Mr Schulz, your outrage was as entertaining as ever, but it is your Government and Mrs Klamt’s which is using that pretext from Berlin."
"We get endless speeches and conferences saying that terrorism, racism and immigration are top challenges – which they are; but the Commission still cannot tell us if states have implemented the five-year-old anti-terrorism law, and states are only just moving forward on a four-year-old proposal to tackle race hate crime."
"There is no common EU policy on migration."
"We are told today by the Council that safeguarding human rights is a priority for EU governments."
"If that is so, how come foreign ministers were unable recently to make any formal response to President Bush’s admission of CIA secret prisons, just as they were unable to do anything about Guantánamo for four years?"
"This system is dysfunctional and ineffective in fighting terrorism and upholding human rights."
"It is a betrayal of the 21st-century security needs of what will soon be half a billion people."
"– Mr President, immigration goes on whether we want it to or not; the only thing that matters is how we handle it."
"Europe needs immigrants, and the idea of Europe as a fortress with wealth within and poverty without is unsustainable."
"This proposal may well be well-intentioned, but it is nevertheless not a good one; it is a party-political compromise lacking sufficient vision."
"The current practice of sending foreigners back from southern Europe and northern Africa is brutal, inhumane and ethically indefensible; we have forgotten how to act in accordance with the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity."
"Our approach to human rights is highly hypocritical, and we are disregarding the Geneva Convention on Refugees."
"– I should like to use this two-minute speech on the important issue of immigration, which in view of its multi-faceted nature would require a great deal longer, to call for the following:"
"- An end to repressive, securitarian policies that criminalise immigrants, who after all are just men and women looking for a job and a decent life;"
"- The closure of immigrant detention centres and an end to the inhuman policy of deportation;"
"- The fight against traffickers in human beings and their accomplices to be stepped up;"
"- The fight against xenophobia and racism, and against all policies and distorted views feeding these attitudes, to be stepped up;"
"- The regularisation of immigrant workers, ensuring their labour and social rights, a crucial prerequisite for putting an end to the appalling phenomenon of exploitation;"
"- An effective immigration policy that specifically includes family reunification;"
"- A policy that reverses the current trend towards concentrating wealth in the hands of the few at the expense of the exploitation and poverty of millions and millions of human beings."
"I should also like to quote some statistics from the United Nations: The 691 richest people in the world have a net fortune equivalent to USD 2.2 billion, which is equal to the combined wealth of the 145 poorest countries."
"What is more, the 500 richest people have a combined income higher than that of the 416 million poorest."
"The 8 million richest people in the world have a net fortune equivalent to 80% of the GDP of all the countries in the world."
"- In other words, what is needed is a policy that uses the human race’s ample resources, means and advances in science and technology to effectively resolve the problems facing the peoples of the world."
"This policy should be diametrically opposed to that of neoliberalism, militarism and failure to respect the sovereignty of peoples and countries."
"Mr President, in the context of the problems related to the immigration process raised in today’s question, attention has been drawn, amongst other issues, to the lack of mutual trust between Member States of the European Union."
"This mistrust and suspicion almost automatically affects relationships with third countries, such as the United States, which is Europe’s natural ally in the war on terrorism."
"Such an attitude hampers the establishment of clear legal provisions in these areas."
"It effectively limits, or even prevents, useful cooperation."
"It is hard to agree with the view expressed today by Commissioner Frattini, namely that the protection of fundamental rights and fighting terrorism ought to go hand in hand."
"I believe that for the benefit of most European citizens, serious thought should be given to redefining fundamental rights with a view to restricting them."
"This would allow us to counter terrorist actions swiftly and efficiently."
"Clearly, we must move in that direction in the interests of security."
"Mr President, last Sunday the small country of Switzerland voted in favour of a type of immigration policy that is best suited to the needs of the country in question and its citizens."
"As Commissioner Frattini stated, it could also be worth emulating the immigration policies adopted by Australia and United States."
"The European Union, however, has been following an over-ambitious immigration policy for years, to the detriment of the interests of its own citizens."
"Our security, justice and immigration policies ought to strengthen development aid for Africa."
"It should put an end to the influx of Muslims and, if demographic factors or the situation on the labour market require it, welcome Christians from Eastern European countries like Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia and Russia, who would not jeopardise the identity of our Christian civilisation."
"– In the long run, we cannot cope without a common immigration policy and common strategies."
"The Member States are mainly responsible for integration."
"The exclusion that we have at present, along with benefits instead of work, must be brought to an end, and integration policy activated."
"Work must become the rule and benefits the exception."
"In Sweden, the new government is aiming to make the unemployed more attractive to employers."
"Integration policy must also be combined with measures to combat people-trafficking and with the development, in partnership, of agreements with third countries."
"I want to praise Mr Frattini for his endeavours in this area."
"We must also join together in defending the humane values on which the EU is based."
"An area of freedom, justice and security requires increased legal certainty and a strengthening of individual fundamental rights that the European Court of Justice can and must apply."
"Although we do not have these things in the third pillar, any more than we have data protection, we have seen measures introduced that interfere extensively in private life."
"How much longer does the Council believe we can go on without fundamental rights and a court at EU level competent to re-examine cases?"
"The focus should now be on legal certainty and fundamental rights."
"In the long term, this should help us combat crime more effectively."
"Legal certainty and the fight against crime go hand in hand."
"– Some months ago, in this Parliament, Commissioner Frattini said that he cannot go ahead at the pace he would like to."
"We understand and we appreciate that there are bureaucratic problems, but these cannot continue being used as excuses and allow an alarming situation to change into an explosive and uncontrollable one."
"It is embarrassing that the Union is coming across as extremely passive when faced with a situation which is so sensitive, human and tragic for so many people and countries, including Member States."
"Malta, like Italy, Spain and other countries, is faced with a burden no country can shoulder on its own."
"This is a crisis which transcends frontiers, and therefore the solution must be European, Mediterranean and African, and, if necessary, must also involve the United Nations."
"For a long time we have been hearing words like mobilisation, solidarity and financial help."
"Let us take, for example, the promise made to Malta that, during Summer, European patrols would commence in our waters."
"Summer has come and gone in the same way the immigrants have come, but the patrols were nowhere to be seen."
"So far the result has always been a piecemeal policy comprising unconnected measures, and the occasional announcement that we have found another half million Euro to donate."
"This is such a critical situation that it warrants the formulation of a European emergency plan, and in this context I believe that the European Parliament should have greater competence and a more pronounced role."
"There are many initiatives which can be adopted, one of which is the establishment of an observatory based in a Mediterranean country like Malta so that coordination work about illegal immigration in the region can take place."
"The Council and the Commission have to send out a clear and concrete signal that they really consider this problem as a priority, and that they are ready to move and to act in order to implement a comprehensive policy which addresses not only the immediate needs of the Member States affected, but also those of the immigrants."
"Very often they are the victims of political repression, of organised crime or of economic poverty."
"This plan must involve the countries from which these immigrants depart, and must address the problems, especially economic problems of the immigrants’ countries of origin."
"The more serious the situation becomes, the greater the citizens’ loss of faith in European institutions."
"Mr President, we urgently need the bridging clause for more efficient and democratic decision-making."
"The EU must speak with one voice and not allow the United States to determine unilaterally the conditions of our joint counter-terrorism efforts."
"This applies, for example, to the negotiations on the post-2007 PNR agreement, but also to CIA activities."
"Last week the Member States issued a very feeble condemnation of secret CIA detention camps, but I would like to know whether the Europeans will continue to use the information obtained in these secret and illegal prisons."
"On fundamental rights, which are conspicuously absent from this debate, in 2004 the Commission obtained the approval of the European Parliament on condition that the Commission become the champion of fundamental rights; but so far the Commission has been fairly timid."
"For example, you condemn homophobia with words, but will you also take action, Commissioner Frattini, for example on the basis of Article 7 against homophobic actions and statements by EU governments and ministers?"
"Will you finally end the unacceptable discrimination against married gay couples?"
"Commissioner and Council, will you be tough on terrorism, but also tough on intolerance in Europe?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, more than 20 000 illegal immigrants have, at peril to their lives, run their boats onto the beaches of the Canary Islands, Lampedusa and Malta since the beginning of the year."
"We do not know how many others have actually drowned."
"As for what Mr Le Pen said a few moments ago about these men and women, it was pretty disgusting."
"Our sole aim where these immigrants are concerned is to provide for the vital needs of their families."
"The men concerned, who are often responsible for families, are prepared to do anything to enable their children to eat, and nothing will stop them."
"Rather than stigmatise these people, we need to put an end to these human tragedies."
"Let us, then, turn our words into actions and put a genuine immigration policy in place quickly."
"During the visits made by colleagues and myself to the detention centres on Europe’s southern borders, we sounded a warning note."
"This summer, a delegation from the Frontex agency was sent out to patrol the Spanish and African coastlines."
"That was a positive first step."
"Unfortunately, there is still a glaring lack of resources."
"Here are a few examples of what might be done, referred to in my group’s resolution."
"Firstly, increase security at our external borders."
"Let us remember that, in our Schengen area, it is crucial to share responsibilities and the financial burden."
"Let us therefore consider creating effective joint patrols for the maritime borders, a European border police force or a network of immigration liaison officers."
"Secondly, let there be a more effective crackdown on traffickers in human beings and on undeclared work in all the Member States."
"Thirdly, there should be real partnerships and readmission agreements with countries of origin."
"To start with, we want the European return directive to be adopted as soon as possible."
"With regard to co-development, let us put more effective monitoring systems in place."
"Co-development money must reach the people directly, without being misappropriated."
"Development aid must be provided only in proportion to the efforts made by countries of origin to prevent their populations from emigrating illegally."
"Finally, have those Member States that have regularised the status of huge numbers of their illegal immigrants in recent years got on top of illegal immigration in their countries?"
"The answer is, unfortunately, no."
"Mass regularisation is not, as some people think, the right solution."
"To conclude, I would quite candidly ask you how long it is going to take and how many meetings are going to be necessary before the 25 …"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we had no need for a secret services committee in the United States to tell us that the War in Iraq would increase rather than reduce the risk of terrorism in Europe and the rest of the world."
"Nor should anyone declare in the future that they are surprised if it emerges that secret prisons, flexible interpretations of the Geneva Convention, the tapping of thousands of telephones, distrust of every European traveller and the approach to the millions of immigrants living among us with repression rather than integration measures are not only giving terrorists recruiting arguments, but are also, primarily, measures that undermine the sense of security and democracy at the very heart of Europe."
"The European Parliament is neither naïve nor romantic on questions of anti-terrorism."
"It has repeatedly demanded harsh measures to combat all these murderers."
"However, at the same time, it insists on the application of European law and on the protection of fundamental rights."
"However, Parliament's balanced and strong stand does not appear to bother certain ministers in the ΕU."
"Last week in Tampere, certain ministers of justice insisted on keeping Parliament in the role of ventriloquist's dummy on these issues."
"Unfortunately, they included the Greek Minister of Justice, who should be more careful following yesterday's disclosure that the Greek Government had secretly agreed with the USA in 2004 to facilitate the transmission of thousands of data items – not on Greek but on European citizens – during and after the Olympic Games in Athens."
"In our countries, no one understands the national parliaments not having a decisive say and control in policing and justice matters."
"In Europe, however, it would appear that some people wish to draw a line and say that democracy does not count here."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a minute is a very short time, so I shall confine myself to making a single point."
"We are dealing with policies in which it seems clear what Europe can and should do: it needs to develop a common asylum system, common rules on legal immigration, and common management of our external borders."
"It is clear that national efforts are no longer enough, because they simply do not work."
"It is clear that public opinion would support this alternative idea of effective European sovereignty, although I admit that there have been too many speeches by Italian or Mediterranean Members this morning, as if immigration were purely our problem, that is, one affecting just the Mediterranean countries."
"What is not clear, however, is the title of the press release issued at the end of the Tampere Summit: ‘Ministers call for greater solidarity and cooperation.’"
"I am sorry, Mr Rajamäki, but from whom else can they demand that but themselves?"
"As we do not yet have a European Constitution – I wish we did – does anyone in the Council have a different idea other than quickly implementing the bridging clause?"
"Besides, who benefits from this institutional standstill?"
"Today, at least, I think a large majority in Parliament has made its opinion quite clear on that point."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are many new threats to our security and freedom, and uncontrolled immigration is certainly one of them."
"The greatest and most recent threat, however, comes from terrorism, as Mr Frattini pointed out earlier."
"As the coordinator for my group in the temporary committee on the CIA, I have addressed the problem with my colleagues and we have all looked for solutions together."
"I personally have come to the conclusion that we can do very little – and, unfortunately, we have done very little – to discover anything new about the situation, about its causes and about who is to blame."
"We now need to concentrate on the future and on ways and means to prevent the recurrence of situations of illegality that further endanger our freedom and security."
"What can we do?"
"One idea can be found in the question to the Council that led to this morning’s debate, where it mentions initiatives to remedy the lack of trust between Member States."
"That is an important, indeed crucial point."
"To combat terrorism within the Union we need to exchange more information, including with our main allies and in particular the United States, with which we have recently had some difficulties."
"We must exchange information on an equal footing and on the basis of mutual trust."
"Greater control is also needed over the activities of one country’s secret services when they are operating on another’s territory."
"Secret services have to remain secret in order to operate effectively, but only within certain limits."
"Our committee on the CIA has no powers of investigation and so we have to insist that the national parliaments, which in many countries have the appropriate powers, investigate any infringements of human rights and any threats to our security and freedom."
"It will then be our job to coordinate the research in order to achieve compatible solutions at a European level."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even if some people choose to ignore the fact, Europe is a continent that attracts immigrants."
"Many people in this continent of ours could accept that and live with it if they felt that this immigration was to some extent under control and kept within reasonable bounds."
"What they cannot accept – and this is of course exploited by the extreme Right in particular – is the feeling that they are facing some sort of onslaught that they are powerless to control."
"It is, then, absolutely right that the Council and Commissioner Frattini in particular should openly call for action to be taken to give the public the sense that there is such a thing as a single European migration policy with certain cornerstones that ensure that everything is kept under control."
"Solidarity within Europe is, of course, a part of this."
"It may be that certain countries – Germany and Austria, for example – are somewhat bitter about the times when they were on the receiving end of a great deal of migration, particularly from South-Eastern Europe, but of little solidarity, but that is no reason to deny that solidarity to others now."
"Far from it; where this is concerned, we have to make common cause."
"Immigration policy, though, must go hand in hand with a policy for integration."
"I am very glad that Commissioner Frattini addressed the subject of unauthorised workers, for it is sometimes the case that those elements in politics that get terribly worked up about immigration tolerate, at the same time, the presence in Europe of vast masses of illegal workers, constituting a sort of illicit reserve of labour and also bringing downward pressure to bear on wages."
"That is not on!"
"It is quite right to demand that the individual governments take firm action to deal with this."
"Mr President, fellow Members, I was in Spain at the end of August, and I have to say that I was deeply shocked by the terrible pictures I saw of these poor wretches landing on the coasts of the Canary Islands."
"I must also say, however, that I was ashamed, not at what the Spaniards were doing – they were doing their best – but at the lack of solidarity on the part of the European countries that had promised to help Spain but did not do so."
"I was also ashamed – and, Commissioner, I hope that you looked at the Spanish press – at the limited resources available to Frontex."
"It was a case of too little, too late."
"Mr Rajamäki, it is usual in European circles to use flowery language to say that we are together constructing a common area of freedom within common borders."
"Remind your colleagues, however, that a common border has to be managed and protected jointly."
"It is scandalous that a number of Member States haggle over their solidarity and shameful that one Member State should have to beg for help from the others in order to perform a task that is in everyone’s interests."
"Mr President, the Spanish Government's mistaken policy is flooding the Union with people without documents."
"Spain is now a country of destination and a country of transit."
"There must be no more mass regularisations."
"We must be able to say how many people, and who, can live in dignity amongst us."
"What can we do?"
"There are national solutions and there are Community solutions."
"At Community level, we must move towards the objective of a common immigration policy."
"To this end, it is crucial to take advantage of the opportunities provided for in the EC Treaty and, specifically, in paragraph 2 of Article 67, and apply the codecision procedure to illegal immigration."
"We shall have to implement policies such as the following: greater cooperation amongst the Member States, equal rights and obligations for all immigrants, partnership and cooperation agreements with conditions, bilateral agreements between the Union and countries of origin, including obligatory repatriation clauses."
"No, I repeat, no, to national mass regularisation processes, yes to constant improvements in resources and strengthening of the capacities of FRONTEX, to the coordination of controls at maritime borders, to the creation of joint border control patrols and teams, to protecting the Union's external borders and to external European Union action."
"Solana and Ferrero to Africa and the Mediterranean!"
"All of this must be accompanied by the humanitarian treatment that illegal immigration demands and that we support unreservedly."
"Assistance, humanitarian care and return."
"Nobody should remain in European territory outside of the law."
"I would like to make one protest in order not to break with my tradition."
"This is a good debate, but it is a that takes us nowhere."
"Hence my protest."
"We are talking here about immigration, about terrorism, about passerelle clauses and about organised crime."
"We must learn a lesson from this and hold debates on single subjects."
"Thank you, your comments are noted."
"It is, however, a debate on the progress made in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"It is an annual debate, so naturally it has to be rather wide-ranging."
"Mr President, Parliament has to give its opinion by the end of the year on the framework programme known as solidarity and management of migration flows."
"I should have liked to have seen more resources given to this major instrument, but we are suffering the constraints of a draconian Financial Perspective."
"I hope, in any case, that the Commission will not accept any watering down of its latest proposal."
"Our objective must be to guarantee that the distribution between the four funds – those in relation to refugees, external borders, integration and return – reflects a balanced, rather than essentially repressive, approach to the issue of immigration."
"That is why we must defend the integration fund as, if the Council states that integration can be financed from the European Social Fund (ESF), the integration fund will be the only real instrument financing measures intended for new arrivals."
"If, finally, we have a duty of solidarity towards Member States that are particularly vulnerable in this respect, let us remember that what we are concerned with here are structural funds which, as such, are not intended to be used as emergency funds, all the more since the distribution keys in each fund allow a variety of situations to be taken into account."
"Mr President, the European Union’s credibility in the eyes of millions of citizens is at stake."
"If the European Union cannot protect its own borders in a joint fashion, then what is the Union for?"
"Europe has a shared external border, and it is everybody’s responsibility."
"African immigrants do not enter via the North Pole, Minister, nor via the shores of the Baltic, but they are entering Europe, and Europe belongs to all of us."
"Everybody has their own particular geography, though, and they have been given it by God, as some people might say."
"It is not charity that certain Member States are asking for but, rather, consistency with the European project that we all talk about so much and which is so easy to preach when we are talking about the single market in financial services or the common market in goods."
"When it comes to borders, however, it appears that each Member State has their own, and they do not feel the need to share responsibility for other borders."
"We are not talking about charity, but about coherence, about responsibility for the European project."
"The European Union’s credibility is at stake."
"Mr President, Mr Rajamäki stated that a revised timetable for the accession of the new Member States to the SIS II system will be made known by the end of the year."
"It follows that a revised timetable for the elimination of internal borders will also be set."
"It is not known when this will come about, but the postponement is not due to delays on the part of the new Member States."
"Poland will be ready to start implementing the SIS II system by March 2007."
"The same is true of the other new Member States."
"Commissioner, Mr Rajamäki, how does this situation impact on the Commission’s credibility with regard to granting citizens such a fundamental right as full freedom of movement across the territory of the European Union?"
"The Commission is forever ramming slogans about a Europe of the citizens and a Europe of results down people’s throats."
"How dare it, therefore, for allegedly technical reasons, hold up the process of the full enlargement of the Schengen area, and postpone it until after next year, as had been agreed at the European Council?"
"Perhaps experts from the new Member States should be asked to ensure that the central unit is completed on time?"
"The best IT staff and programmers must be recruited to ensure that this is done."
"If it is not, the Commission and you personally, Commissioner, will be called to account for such lack of professionalism."
"I am not referring to the financial, technical, political and social consequences of this decision."
"The European Parliament is monitoring the Commission’s progress in this area, together with any costs arising from the delay, and it will continue to do so. I therefore urge all concerned to consider the costs and benefits involved before taking the final decision on this matter."
"I congratulate the Council on reaching a compromise on the SIS II legislative package."
"Nonetheless, we still need the Council to demonstrate strong leadership and reveal the so-called technical problems for what they really are, namely a smokescreen for the lack of political will on the part of certain Member States."
"After all, it is the SIS II system which creates certain technical opportunities and is thus one of the conditions ensuring that the common immigration policy becomes a shared responsibility for all Member States, not just for those most affected by illegal immigration and terrorism."
"If this does not happen, we shall never be able to deal effectively with terrorism and the influx of emigrants."
"– Mr President, migration into Europe, whether by legal or illegal means, is a Community task In an age of open borders, problems with immigration can no longer be dealt with by nation-states acting on their own; there is a shared responsibility that no Member State – not even Germany – can wriggle out of."
"Looking forward to the German Council Presidency, one thing is clear, namely that we cannot act as if legal and illegal immigration were absolutely unconnected, for the opposite is the case; each is conditional upon the other."
"The fact is that migration is a complex phenomenon and is as old as the human race itself; deportations and border guards will be ineffective in dealing with it."
"That is why the Council of the European Union must at length face up to this problem, not only in Europe’s interests, but also and above all in the interests of the desperate people who go in search of what they are told will be a better future only, alas, often to lose their lives in the attempt."
"The utterances that Mr Beckstein of the Bavarian CSU came out with in Tampere are shameful to say the least, and reveal once more what this man and substantial elements in his party actually believe."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, very little progress has yet been made in the area of security and freedom, and certainly not enough for such a crucial issue."
"For years, the Council has decided to base its actions in the area of freedom on mutual recognition, as if the courts, police and secret services in the individual countries of Europe could necessarily cooperate on the basis of mutual recognition."
"Events have shown that this principle alone is not enough: we also need the courage to harmonise certain policies and thus turn them into European policies, particularly on matters of freedom."
"We remain firm on some points: the antidiscrimination directive, the racism observatory, the framework decision on procedural rights, and safeguards of privacy in the transfer of air passenger data."
"It is on the subject of freedom that we lack common safeguards at a European level; in this area, cooperation among the Member States is not enough."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the problem of how to contend against illegal immigration is the greatest challenge of modern time, although I have to make it clear that 99% of immigrants are not refugees, but rather economic migrants, and it is ultimately for the European Union and every one of its Member States to decide which migrants, and how many of them, are to be accepted; this is a quite separate matter from asylum, the necessary solutions to which are possible only on a Community basis."
"I am glad to see that, after many debates, the way is being paved for real action on this front, and Commissioner Frattini deserves praise for Frontex and other measures, but what we should be doing is investing more in prevention."
"The first steps are indeed being taken to this end, but I suggest that we should give thought to stepping up development aid, to targeting and monitoring it, to the possibility of information campaigns in the mass media, which should be a collaborative effort with the countries of origin, in which people would be informed about the risks and consequences involved in illegal immigration by being shown how things really are for stranded ‘boat people’ and for those who migrate illegally in search of work, and they would also have to be told about the possibility of migrating legally."
"That really would help to alleviate a lot of need and misery."
"Thirdly, we must do more to address the problem of people working illegally within the European Union and take firm action."
"I expect the Council to ensure that there will be no more mass legalisations, which do more than anything else to draw more migrants to the EU."
"Finally, I would like once more to appeal to the Member States to abandon for good their national animosities where asylum, migration for work purposes and internal security are concerned, or at any rate to curb them and move towards Community-based solutions, for what new challenges demand is new European responses."
"EU citizens attach high priority to the debate we are now having."
"As quite a few speakers have said in this House, we should have solved these acute problems a long time ago."
"That applies to the migratory flows to the Canary Islands and Malta, information updates for everyone waiting for permission to stay in the EU and better support for those fighting to be accepted as new EU citizens."
"We should have made more progress in influencing attitudes in our societies and combating segregation in working life, housing and education."
"In Sweden, we had elections two weeks ago, in which a xenophobic party won seats on councils in every third local authority."
"I am perturbed by their message that too many immigrants have been allowed in."
"They talk about that, but not about the responsibility we all share and the solidarity we all need to show."
"The EU’s population is ageing quickly, and there will need to be more of us."
"We must have a successful debate on this."
"We in Parliament must obtain increased powers, greater responsibility and access to more rapid decision-making."
"It is only by means of a common EU policy in this area that we can achieve results for EU citizens."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yet again this summer we have witnessed landings and shipwrecks every day that have led to hundreds of deaths in European waters."
"The steady flow of boats trying to reach the Union’s shores shows no signs of abating; indeed, it is increasing."
"The situation has now clearly developed into a real emergency, which has to be addressed seriously."
"Even today, three or four Member States find that they have to deal with these landings by themselves."
"Something that we have heard and said all too often in this Chamber is that Malta, Italy and Spain are making an effort for the sake of the whole Union but are left to suffer alone."
"The European Union as a whole, with its 25 – soon to be 27 – countries, must once and for all tackle this extremely serious situation jointly."
"National self-interest has to be abandoned."
"It is time to start regarding the immigration emergency as a problem affecting all 25 Member States and not just those whose geographical position means that they have to recover bodies from the sea every day."
"Through the good offices of Mr Frattini, who thoroughly deserves our plaudits – and not just because he is a friend – the Commission is preparing specific action plans and is trying to implement existing programmes."
"It is the Council, however, that has to decide to address a situation that has been a human tragedy for some time."
"Instead, Minister, the Council is still taking Europe for a ride."
"The Council needs to take responsibility for sending out a strong, effective signal to make this a Community issue."
"To that end, Minister, I shall use this opportunity to ask yet again that an extraordinary Internal Affairs Council be called, to be held on the island of Malta, which is one of the countries worst affected and facing the greatest difficulties because of its size."
"I also call yet again for a debate on the Dublin II agreement."
"No more idle talk, Minister!"
"Through the Council, the European Union needs to prove that it really exists!"
"Mr President, Lampedusa is not just an Italian problem."
"Immigration is not currently as great a problem in my country, Poland, as it is in Spain, Italy, Malta, Greece or Cyprus, but any of us could be hit by a wave of illegal immigration."
"Immigration is therefore not a local or regional issue."
"It affects the whole of Europe and needs to be dealt with at that level."
"If the Union is to develop an effective, common immigration policy, this policy must be based on decisions taken by a majority vote."
"It is time to do away with unanimity at the Council and to make immigration a first pillar policy."
"I shall now move on to the matter of Frontex. Frontex is located in my country, in Warsaw."
"Poland has the longest external border in the European Union and yet, ironically enough, its citizens cannot move freely across the territory of the whole Union at the moment, because SIS II is not ready."
"I wonder, Commissioner, whether by the time we come to celebrate the Union’s 50th anniversary in March 2007, you will be in a position to say when the citizens of the new Member States will be able to enjoy free movement across the whole of the territory of the Union?"
"Mr President, allow me emphasise the issue of police and judicial cooperation and to say that widening and deepening such cooperation between the Member States of the European Union is really crucial."
"We cannot talk about effectively combating crime and terrorism on a pan-European scale with the current cooperation levels and mechanisms in the police and judicial sector."
"It is about time that we proved that our declarations and assurances for enhancing and developing the cooperation are not meaningless."
"That is the major challenge facing the European Council, which will be meeting soon with the aim of reviewing the programme."
"If the European Council has the will to remedy the decision-making incompetence of the Europe, in this respect there is only one decision to take: to shift these subjects from the third pillar to the first pillar."
"It has the legal power to do that, under Article 42 of the European Treaty and the ."
"Let that be used at last."
"Last week the Finnish Presidency admitted, inter alia, that practical experience has shown that problems with current decision-making at EU level are leading to a decreasing number of police cooperation initiatives."
"That was indeed a nice honest admission."
"However, the steady degrading of police cooperation is due to the lack of European framework decisions which would develop and establish such cooperation."
"Those shortcomings have to be remedied."
"The low credibility of the European Union as far as the security of the citizens is concerned reduces its prestige."
"We have been waiting a long time for approval of the framework decision for minimum procedural rights in criminal cases and for revision of the European arrest warrant."
"What has caused the delay?"
"Why is the Council inactive and incapable of taking decisions?"
"We have to leave rhetoric behind and finally embark on action."
"– Mr President, Europe is a bicycle."
"Needless to say, this quote leaves itself wide open to all kinds of feeble comparisons, because with the Schengen information system, an instrument that helps us, among other things, to track illegal immigrants, we are engaged in some kind of political Tour de France, which involves all of us racing like mad in the same direction."
"Meanwhile, there are other challenges, such as preventing immigration, and the solitary figure of Commissioner Frattini is attempting to make headway using a tricycle."
"The green card is a fine idea but, unfortunately, pie in the sky as things stand."
"Perhaps Commissioner Frattini will tell us whether the Council is prepared to give these issues a ‘mountain bike treatment’."
"Something else that is left hanging in the air is the presidency’s remark that majority decision-making works."
"It does, but I am all the more surprised, then, that the Council should want to restrict Parliament’s codecision rights where biometrics is concerned."
"Are we not cycling around the Schengen information system fast enough?"
"Will Commissioner Frattini give us his opinion on whether we are or not?"
"I look forward to his doing so."
"– Recently, there have been conflicting reports about what sort of cooperation we have with Libya regarding illegal immigration."
"Initially, Commissioner, you said that Libya was interested in participating in the Mediterranean patrols; we then heard Libya deny this."
"Later, the Corriere della Sera announced that Italy and Libya had agreed to undertake joint patrols."
"Subsequently this news item was denied as well."
"Afterwards, Commissioner, you said that the European Union was ready to help and give financial assistance to Libya to encourage it to cooperate."
"Can the Commisioner and the Council clarify at what stage contacts with Libya are, and what the present situation is like?"
"What is certain is that in the struggle against illegal immigration, cooperation with Libya is necessary, in the same way that it is important that we help Libya protect its borders in the south of the country."
"After all, we cannot expect Libya to help us protect Mediterranean borders if we ourselves do not help Libya protect its own desert frontiers."
"Mr President, the need for a great pact amongst Europeans on immigration is clear."
"This pact amongst Europeans requires a pact amongst Spaniards."
"The government has proposed one repeatedly and the People’s Party has spurned it, preferring to go late to Brussels to propose measures that are already being implemented in our country with the support of the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me briefly to sum up the three main points of the Spanish Government’s immigration policy."
"Firstly, effective management and regulation of legal immigration linked to the reality of the labour market."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the ‘draw effect’ is caused by the submerged economy; we want workers with rights and obligations, not slaves."
"Extraordinary regularisation has been a necessary one-off measure for dealing with the dreadful migratory situation that we inherited from the Aznar government."
"Secondly, the full social integration of legal immigrants into Spanish society."
"Finally, resolve in the fight against illegal immigration: all immigrants entering Spain illegally are treated properly, but they must return to their countries."
"In Spain this year, 54 000 illegal immigrants have been repatriated."
"Mr President, Mr Rajamäki, ever since the Tampere Summit in 1999, it has been clear that the Union needs a common approach to the problem of migration, and to economic migration in particular."
"As a result of the increasing flood of immigrants and the alarming pictures from the Canary Islands, we have now become more aware than ever of the need for a common European migration policy to deal effectively with this problem."
"Immigration should not be perceived simply as a threat, however."
"Europe is clearly experiencing a demographic crisis."
"Well-managed migration could be the answer to the negative consequences of an ageing population."
"I would remind the House that, in view of the current rate of migration, it is anticipated that there will be about 20 million fewer people employed in the Union in the period 2010-2030."
"The leading regions of the world have long been competing with each other to attract suitably qualified immigrants, and the Union must not remain on the sidelines."
"The lack of a common migration policy actually increases the likelihood of immigrants circumventing national regulations."
"We have seen how individual countries have responded to such practices by undertake mass measures to legalise the status of illegal immigrants, as the Socialist government recently decided to do in Spain."
"Moves of this kind are not the solution to the problem."
"In fact, they aggravate it because they act as an incentive for middlemen involved in smuggling more groups of immigrants into Europe."
"I venture to take this opportunity to disagree with the opinion expressed by Mr Rajamäki at the start of this debate concerning the positive impact of development policy on reducing the influx of immigrants, notably those from Africa."
"I do not believe it is useful to think along those lines, Mr Rajamäki."
"I accept the need to strengthen development policy, but am inclined to support Commissioner Frattini’s approach, namely to deal firmly with illegal immigrants and give priority to common management of economic migration."
"I would also like to call for the work on the draft directive on admission to be speeded up, along with the work on the directive regulating procedures for returning immigrants to their countries of origin."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, opening legal entry channels that take account of the market requirements in the individual Member States is, together with clamping down on illegal work, one of the priorities for dealing pragmatically with the complex problem of immigration."
"This needs to be done through a common European action plan, a joint commitment and a collective effort."
"For that not to be just empty rhetoric, however, we have to give up the hypocrisy of grandiose, theoretical statements of principle at Council meetings and stop using the immigration issue for domestic political ends, a practice that is utterly unacceptable and irresponsible."
"From this perspective, implementing the clause at last is absolutely crucial."
"That is the only way in which we will be able to act effectively in an area where we have been remiss for too long."
"I agree with whoever said ‘we have to pedal’, but I would add ‘otherwise we fall off’."
"In this case, however, we will all fall together, in unison."
"If we have not yet realised it, we are all on the same bicycle."
"– Mr President, we have all realised that there is now an urgent need for us to take a common approach towards terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration."
"As far as immigration is concerned, it is necessary to coordinate the structures involved in managing migration flows and simplify decision-making procedures using the qualified majority."
"Particular emphasis must also be placed on the need to respect solidarity and the fair distribution of burdens between the Member States, including those not under pressure from immigration."
"We also need to highlight the need for cooperation between all of us on the effective control of external borders."
"Particular emphasis needs to be placed on better management of sea borders in Europe by creating a Mediterranean coastguard in order to prevent human tragedies and control immigration flows."
"Finally, it needs to be understood that the mass unilateral legalisation of illegal immigrants not only is no solution, but also creates greater immigration pressures and unforeseen developments."
"Unilateral deeds in a community of open internal borders – in which interdependence and interactions are unavoidable – are a matter which deserves our serious attention."
"These are just some measures that we need to decide on jointly and not just decide on, but also apply with religious devotion."
"Mr President, I believe that we are now at a key moment when it comes to the future of European immigration policy, a moment of truth in which every man and woman needs clearly to perceive what is at stake."
"What, precisely, is Europe’s response to these challenges?"
"At present, it is –it has to be said – a mixture of compassion and repression that offers no real solution to the recognised need for protection."
"Let us be aware in this House of the dangers of disposable immigration in which the migrant is seen only in a utilitarian perspective."
"Hypocrisy has prevailed since the first Tampere European Council, which was ultimately supposed to make it possible for asylum and immigration policies to be communitised."
"We are now seeing our responsibilities assumed instead by our southern Mediterranean neighbours, who have a lot of difficulty in taking on this very heavy burden."
"How, then, is it possible to believe that we shall be able to stem these migratory flows at a time when, in addition, the future arrival of refugees from climate change is already being foreseen?"
"We need finally to leave behind short-term politics and to support policies that require action to be taken."
"Mr President, we see more and more every day how a common European immigration policy has become essential."
"For those who were in any doubt about the matter, certain European countries’ mass regularisation of foreigners without papers has demonstrably led to huge numbers of new illegal migrants arriving on our continent."
"This situation has repercussions for all the countries of the European Union since, as everyone knows, a migrant whose papers have been put in order may move freely within a large part of the EU’s territory."
"The example of Spain has shown that, in the area without borders in which we live, a government can no longer decide alone, and without consulting its partners, to regularise the status of all illegal immigrants on its territory."
"A common and agreed policy has become essential, as foreseen moreover by the draft European Constitution, which put most of these matters on a basis whereby they could be decided on by qualified majority voting."
"I note that, despite the Commission’s efforts, a number of Member States seem to be taking a backward step by now rejecting what they had accepted yesterday."
"That is deplorable."
"The continued requirement of unanimity in this area is a factor leading to paralysis and ineffectiveness."
"At the European Union’s informal summit on 20 October 2006, strong practical measures must be decided on with a view to putting a stop to illegal immigration."
"The summit must not be content with fine statements of good intentions, as summits too often are."
"Put a stop to illegal immigration by all means, but the root cause of the problem has to be tackled."
"The problem must be examined in consultation with the African countries within the framework of a genuine co-development strategy and by means of a proper sharing of competences between countries of immigration and countries of emigration."
"Above all, however, the European Union must extend its development aid policy and monitor it more successfully and must know where the funds are going and how they are used."
"Finally, I am not forgetting the very short term and the immediate problems and, like Mr Deprez, I deplore the behaviour of those Member States that have talked non-stop about mutual aid and solidarity but without ever having translated their words into deeds."
"Faced with the influx of illegal immigrants in the Canary Islands, it is our duty to come to the aid of Spain and the task of the Member States to take action and show solidarity."
"Mr President, it is fundamentally important that the basic principles and values on which the European Union is based are applied, in all circumstances, as part of the Member States' and Community policies too."
"If our aspirations towards this are fulfilled, it will bring us closer to safeguarding the Union's democratic legitimacy and retaining our credibility."
"This also means that the protection and promotion of fundamental rights must receive appropriate institutional support."
"This is why I feel it is important that no Member State should prevent the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights from being set up to operate in a genuinely accountable, independent, as well as effective manner."
"No Member State can be allowed to disregard Europe's fundamental values and principles."
"But this is especially true for new Member States or for states now joining the Union, where the rule of law is, in many cases, only put to the test after they become members."
"This is why open or covert official support by the government and politicians for intolerance and extremism cannot be allowed in Slovakia, neither can we tolerate its direct result: turning a blind eye to the acts of violence committed against minorities and the Hungarian population."
"This cannot be regarded as a domestic matter."
"It has a direct impact on freedom, security and justice within the EU, which makes it a European matter."
"Similarly, we have seen a lack of principle, obscenities and lies being openly and cynically upheld, contravening Europe's fundamental principles and any responsibility and accountability to citizens, being presented, without any hint of an apology, as an act of courage and heroism."
"I am referring, of course, to the events surrounding the Hungarian prime minister, Ferenc Gyurcsány."
"This also undermines the foundations of the rule of law and credibility."
"This is why it jeopardises everything we build together in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"The way in which the Council and Commission handles the expansion of the Schengen area has jeopardised the credibility of Community institutions and the confidence of the new Member States' citizens in the Union, especially when it has been recently announced that the area's enlargement would be postponed until the second half of 2008."
"We simply do not understand this, and it is unacceptable to new members that they cannot join …"
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to comment on a problem that all of Europe is facing, particularly the Mediterrranean countries."
"Everyone has had his or her say; everybody has said that a solution should be found."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the solution is right here in front of us: we should introduce a mechanism that ensures that responsibilities are shared by everybody."
"Empty words are useless; it is useless to say that in this Union we should all be helping each other, but then do next to nothing when it comes to the crunch."
"It is useless to utter beautiful-sounding words like ‘solidarity’, but then continue to fail to act."
"Let us not allow this Union, which was created precisely to enable everybody to enjoy equal rights, to be reduced to a Europe of documents, a Europe of resolutions, a Europe of promises or a Europe of dreams."
"I know efforts are being made, but they are not enough."
"This is the moment of truth, this is the moment to practise what we preach and state what we really believe in."
"I am convinced that, with some good will on all sides, a compromise will be found which will lead to a lasting solution to this problem, that is, the sorely-needed common European policy."
"Mr President, I am sorry to raise this yet again, but it appears that no one in Parliament’s Presidency is listening."
"We were told to arrive here for votes at noon."
"That has now been postponed to 12.05 and again to 12.10."
"I know that you are very efficient at getting business through this House, but I urge you please to inform the Conference of Presidents of the continuing dissatisfaction of colleagues in this House about the times of votes being changed arbitrarily, at considerable inconvenience to the way this House’s business is conducted."
"We have had a very comprehensive, whole-morning debate on a single subject."
"There have been 63 speakers."
"I do not want to be discourteous either to the Council or the Commission, but the Minister spoke for 23 minutes and 49 seconds, and the Commissioner spoke for 21 minutes and 19 seconds."
"I am obliged to give both of them the floor now."
"I hope they will be brief in their remarks."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Parliament for an excellent debate."
"I regret, however, that there has been insufficient time."
"Unfortunately, I cannot take, say, two minutes to give a five-minute speech, although that would certainly be possible in the Finnish Parliament."
"The Presidency is aware of the nature of the draft Framework Decision on the protection of personal data under the third pillar – I am now referring to Mrs Roure’s proposal – and of its importance for the citizens of Europe, and of the fact that the European Parliament has engaged with the proposals on the Framework Decision VIS and SIS II information systems."
"In this connection and on behalf of the Presidency, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the work it has done, and to say that we are doing all we can in order to reach an agreement on the draft Framework Decision by the end of our presidential term."
"Where possible, we will take the European Parliament’s opinion and views into consideration in future work within the context of the acts of the Treaty, so that we can use an acceptable legislative instrument to guarantee high levels of protection of personal data by establishing common rules for data protection under the third pillar."
"The issues of immigration and migration call for more focused discussion, and I hope that we will have the opportunity to return to them once again."
"The situation in the Mediterranean was an issue I raised immediately at the first meeting of the Council of Ministers for Home Affairs."
"It has been on the agenda and has been discussed at every such meeting, and will be again."
"It is essential that we should be able to have a greater influence on social and economic development and on general conditions in third countries from which migrants come."
"In general, we Ministers of the Interior prefer to deal with the purely human and negative impact; in other words, we put the plaster on the wound."
"As a result, it is very important to have better coordination of the EU’s external relations and internal affairs in cooperation with third countries and the Commission."
"This is also something that has been continually underlined in the work of the Council of Ministers."
"It is also important that we give support to countries which bear a heavy burden when it comes to illegal immigration."
"The initiative regarding extended solidarity proposed at Tampere is an important one."
"It may help us to make progress, and not just by doling out money."
"As a counterweight to this burden, we need significant financial investment."
"In addition, we need guarantees of a procedure that will ensure that the Member States adhere to the jointly agreed rules and take responsibility for illegal immigrants and asylum seekers entering their territory – in other words, that they register them and give them a residence permit, or make arrangements for their repatriation."
"It will be very important to establish information systems for this, and to develop existing systems too."
"Together with the Commission, the Council supports the available forms of assistance needed in coastal surveillance in the Mediterranean and other areas of cooperation, but I wish to point out that in the European Union, responsibility for operations such as these lies with the Member States, which must have adequate competence, planning skills and management abilities for a continuing operation, as well as for joint operations."
"The countries on Schengen’s external borders are also responsible for preventing illegal immigration into the Schengen area."
"We want to support that, as well as the work of the new European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex)."
"It is vitally important that, when we emphasise the importance of ensuring protection and implementing the Geneva Convention, we make a distinction between illegal and legal immigration."
"In this respect, it is very important that a proactive European immigration policy is developed and its quantitative and qualitative management established, while at the same time we bear in mind the question of stability in our job markets."
"A proactive European immigration policy is not, however, the same thing as illegal immigration under the control of organised crime."
"As Commissioner Frattini said, we must also take a serious view of the fact that the illegal job market and the grey economy are responsible for human and economic chaos."
"The various Member States of the European Union should now be able to discuss this fact frankly and openly."
"For this to happen, the authorities must be better able to recognise the phenomenon of the smuggling and trafficking of human beings and to step up their efforts to protect the victims of human trafficking."
"The most disgusting form of organised crime, human trafficking, is a European phenomenon, although we hardly talk about it."
"Finland wants to revitalise this debate both at home and in the European Union."
"It is very important to monitor the way in which the enlarged European Union responds to the demands of our citizens and what they find acceptable, on the one hand, and the demands of internal security, on the other."
"In this connection, I consider it very important to improve the decision-making process."
"It is totally unacceptable that we should take more than a year to think about who to choose as Director of Europol."
"It is also unacceptable that, at the same time as we demand controls at external borders and a border strategy, we should be dwelling on the matter of which city the Border Security Agency should be located in."
"We must be able to implement a decision-making system that aims at better and more credible security."
"Regarding the mountain bike that was called for in earlier speeches, I would like to say that Finland, like Germany and the other presidencies, as well as Commissioner Franco Frattini, would like to put this mountain bike into a higher gear, and that we aim to use it for the benefit of common security and a safer Europe."
"Thank you, Minister."
"I believe it was US President Jackson who said ‘I like the noise of democracy’."
"That is what you are hearing."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I realise that, in the very few minutes available, it is going to be extremely difficult to reply even briefly to all the suggestions and remarks made by those who have taken the floor in the two and a half hours or so of this important debate."
"Mr Rajamäki, you mentioned earlier that today’s debate concerned certain priorities for the European Union, one of which is certainly the fight against terrorism."
"We have not talked about it much today, but you are all perfectly aware that just this summer, thanks to some painstaking cooperation, the security authorities in three European countries – the United Kingdom, Denmark and Germany – have foiled some terrorist attacks that could have proved devastating."
"Terrorism still remains the main threat to our democracy."
"In my view, there is no link between terrorism and immigration, and I share the opinions of those who have pointed that out."
"Immigration is undoubtedly a separate priority: it is a challenge, not a danger to the European Union."
"Many of you have mentioned co-development policies, especially with African countries."
"I can tell you that the Commission, which is always somewhat ambitious when drawing up proposals, has proposed allocating EUR 17 billion – a substantial sum – to the new European fund for the development of countries such as those in Africa, and that the co-development policies that many have called for will be enhanced accordingly."
"There will be co-development policies targeting institutional stabilisation, the fight against corruption, and good governance."
"These are all co-development initiatives aimed at improving their capacity to prevent the flow of migrants, as many of you hope."
"Mr Barón Crespo mentioned the problem of the take-up of the available European funds."
"I fully agree with Mr Barón Crespo, and I call on the Member States once more to draft some projects: European funds can only be spent if projects are put forward by EU Member States."
"In recent years, unfortunately, several funds made available by the Commission have not been spent for lack of projects."
"I invite all the Member States to put forward more projects, so that further initiatives can be financed."
"A great deal has been said about prevention, protection and maritime borders, referring to the Mediterranean."
"We are going to submit a project for the integrated management of the Mediterranean border to the ministers in Luxembourg for their approval."
"I should like to say something to all those who have spoken in harsh terms, which I do not endorse, of a kind of ‘European armada’ to wage war on immigrants."
"I should just like to mention – and this is directed in particular to Mrs Flautre, whom I hold in great esteem – that had it not been for the patrols in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic this summer, had it not been for thousands of coastguards, police and security operatives, many thousands of immigrants would have drowned at sea."
"The primary purpose of the patrol boats is to save people’s lives at sea and not to wage war on immigrants."
"The truth is therefore precisely the opposite of what was suggested: it is in the interests of safety that we intend to propose a system that all the governments have asked us to provide."
"The subject of the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean certainly deserves to be debated thoroughly."
"With regard to Libya, I shall only say that that country has agreed to talks with the European Union, which we shall begin in practical terms on the basis, above all, of a guarantee of full compliance with the rules on the dignity of the person and respect for the individual."
"We have demanded this of Libya just as we demand it of all our other non-EU interlocutors."
"Libya has asked for help in controlling its southern border: its 2 000-km desert border is practically uncontrollable, and one of the requests that we have received is: ‘help us to control this border better, and we can help you to control people before they set off and, above all, to eradicate people trafficking,’ which unfortunately often takes place across the Mediterranean."
"We have a duty to start talks with Libya, and we must do so on the basis of mutual respect between the European Union and its non-European partners."
"The African Union-European Union conference on immigration, to be held in Tripoli, will be a further signal to make Libya understand that we want not only Libya but also all the countries in North Africa to be seriously involved."
"I should like to make a couple of final considerations. The first concerns solidarity."
"Many people have mentioned solidarity."
"I believe that we need to take a global approach towards solidarity, just as we do towards immigration, because we must show solidarity above all to the victims of people trafficking."
"That is the first kind of solidarity that we must have."
"Then there is the solidarity that we must show towards the African countries of origin, as well as the transit countries, as they too are exposed to an often uncontrolled flow of people."
"Then there is also the solidarity among Member States within the European Union."
"We must not deny the importance of mutual solidarity among countries in the European Union, since it is one of the forms that the word ‘solidarity’ must take."
"How can we forget that countries like Malta or the small islands of the Canaries or Lampedusa cannot deal with the ongoing flow of illegal immigrants by themselves?"
"That, too, is solidarity."
"There is the human solidarity towards the people who land on our coasts; there is also the solidarity that countries far from the Mediterranean must show towards countries surrounded by or bordering the Mediterranean."
"The second topic is respect for the law."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I do not think the European Union can be asked to turn something illegal into something legal, because, where a law has been broken, the infringement remains an infringement."
"Those who deal in human beings must be punished severely and without tolerance."
"When people provide work illegally and under cover and take advantage of illegal immigrant workers, there have to be sanctions."
"When people get into the EU by breaking all the laws and remain in the EU by breaking all the laws, European policy must respect the dignity of the individual, but it must also be credible and must send those who have broken the law back to their countries of origin; otherwise we shall be giving the impression that they can break the law and nothing will happen to them."
"Lastly, my final consideration concerns our institutional and constitutional policy."
"We have talked about it a great deal: we need vision, as Mr Schulz and many others have said, to steer and to activate the political processes."
"I cannot imagine us lagging behind civil society; I cannot imagine us, as institutions, waiting for civil society to give us a push or even to show its dissatisfaction with our capacity for political leadership."
"Many people mentioned the need to give up national self-interest."
"I see this as a central theme: if we and the Member States’ governments realise that not even they stand to benefit from sticking to their national self-interests, then those governments will understand that national pride, which many of us consider important, can be upheld rather better if we pool our common policies."
"Upholding national pride by maintaining that immigration or terrorism can be addressed solely through national policies is not a matter of upholding national pride or upholding the great principles behind so many countries’ traditions; it is merely not responding to what the people are demanding."
"That is why we need a political vision with the courage to go in a different direction."
"I should like to thank all 63 speakers who took part in the debate."
"I should like to thank the Minister for his brevity and the Commissioner for his passion."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow."
"‘Prevention is better than cure’ is a popular idiom."
"This issue is one of both prevention and cure."
"There is no doubt that the European Union is finally understanding that the problems faced by Malta and other Mediterranean countries affected by the immigration phenomenon will ultimately become a problem of Europe as a whole."
"And this is the Europe that Malta wanted to join."
"There is nothing more noble than solidarity."
"Some, however, are criticising the Union for providing too little too late."
"Maybe they are right; but better late than never."
"Definitely two boats to patrol the extension between Gibraltar and Alexandra are inadequate, but on the other hand the request by Libya to help control its 2000 km hinterland borders is extremely good news, especially for Malta."
"This is part of the policy of prevention."
"The process to cure the phenomenon is much more complicated."
"Unless the endemic African problems of poverty, civil wars, disease, hunger, unemployment, corruption and international debts are addressed and enhanced by a system of good rule and justice, the problem of irregular immigration will remain irresolvable."
"I cannot but criticise some European countries for squabbling over financial help to their partners – Malta, Italy, Spain and Greece – which are doing their best to alleviate the plight of irregular immigrants."
"– Achieving a European common policy on immigration and asylum is undoubtedly a priority, although the Member States have so far shown varying degrees of willingness to address the problem."
"However, the need to tackle the problem of illegal immigration is, in my view, even more urgent. Despite the institutions’ repeated calls for cooperation, the main burden of this still falls on the Member States located on the European Union’s natural borders."
"Practical solutions therefore need to be found urgently to contain and regulate the problem."
"Coordinating the border forces of the various Member States is useful but not enough."
"The idea of setting up a joint border task force is certainly the most appropriate solution, and I am grateful to the Finnish Presidency for mentioning it."
"Not least, dialogue with and support for those countries from which the immigrants come and those through which they pass on their way to Europe are absolutely essential for any lasting, effective solution."
"I hope that the forthcoming presidencies, starting with Germany, which receives a large proportion of the immigrants filtering through from the southern borders, will tackle the issue firmly and achieve a consensus on this subject, which closely affects all Europeans as well as the Union’s delicate social balance."
"I should like to take this opportunity to welcome to the distinguished visitors’ gallery members of a Chinese delegation led by Deputy Minister Qiu Yuanping."
"Mrs Qiu is Deputy Minister of the Central Foreign Affairs Office of the People’s Republic of China."
"The delegation is here to meet a number of political groups as well as the Chairman of the Committee on International Trade and the chairmen of the Delegation for relations with the People’s Republic of China and the Delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"I wish them an instructive stay in the European Parliament."
"– a warm welcome to you all!"
"Mr President, I very much welcome the visit of the Prime Minister of Lebanon this afternoon, but I very much regret that the Question Time session with the Council has had to be abandoned to make room for this, with no attempt by the Conference of Presidents to reschedule it to another time."
"Question Time is one of the important democratic traditions of this House."
"It is the one opportunity we have to question the Council on issues of concern to us and our constituents."
"It is central to our work."
"This is the second time this year that this session has been arbitrarily cancelled."
"Can I urge you, please, to make sure that there is no third repeat of this."
"We take note of your remarks, Mr Bushill-Matthews."
"."
"Fellow Members, I would ask you to vote in favour of the legislative resolution contained in my report on data protection under the third pillar."
"Indeed, Mr Rajamäki has, this morning, been able to give shape to the moral undertakings given by the preceding presidencies."
"The Finnish Presidency has made data protection its priority, and I would today thank it for having done so."
"I would also take the same opportunity to welcome the Presidency’s presence in this House."
"The Council is to present us with a document at the beginning of 2007 and it will take account of our opinion."
"That is why I call on you to vote in favour of this report."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry, Mr President, but an error in the French translation of Amendment 29 has been pointed out to me: as the authors of the text, we should like the words ‘’ corrected to ‘’, in line with the spirit of the text in French."
"That is the political will of the draftsmen."
"We consider it a translation error."
"Mr President, in paragraph 29, there is a mistake in the Dutch version."
"I am not an expert on the Dutch language – but I will improve!"
"As far as I know, the phrase is not an appropriate translation of what is written in the English version, i.e. ‘appropriate legal initiatives’."
"I think my Dutch friends will agree with me and maybe also give me a grade A in the Dutch language!"
"I would like to underline that it is the English version that is the authentic text in this case."
"There is an error in our amendment."
"What we are concerned with here are, of course, services of general economic interest, since the sentence relates to the deregulation of these and has no bearing on other services of general interest."
"It is therefore a case of services of general economic interest and not of services of general interest."
"Mr President, I have the same request to make: that services of general interest be replaced by services of general economic interest."
"− The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposes swapping the order of paragraphs 28 and 29 and combining them into a single paragraph."
"Is anybody opposed?"
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also proposes inserting paragraph 30 before paragraph 22."
"Is anybody opposed?"
"It does not make a big difference, but we prefer the original sequence, and therefore we oppose this shifting of paragraph 30."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also proposes inserting paragraph 33 before paragraph 31 and combining them into a single paragraph."
"Is anybody opposed?"
"Mr President, I do not want to hold up the vote any longer, but here too we prefer the original sequence because we think it is better."
"Mr President, I have a simple oral amendment to correct the text."
"It suggests that a committee of experts should be set up by the Turkish Government to look into the issue of the genocide, ‘under the auspices of the United Nations’."
"This is our idea not their idea, so to make it clear that it is our proposal that this committee should also work under the auspices of the United Nations, we want to improve the text by replacing ‘under the auspices of the United Nations’ with ‘which should be under the auspices of the United Nations’."
"We are therefore adding the words ‘which should be’."
"."
"Mr President, on behalf of the members of my delegation, I wanted, for clarity’s sake, to make a change to the voting list."
"Against the vote in sections about the original text of paragraph 72, a minus sign has been inserted in both the first and second parts by mistake."
"This should be changed into a plus sign in both instances, just so as to make matters absolutely clear."
"We will be voting by roll call for the first and second parts."
"Mr President, I see that the oral amendments have been distributed."
"They merely update the text of this amendment, so I do not think we need to have much discussion on them."
"."
"Mr President, the vote on this report puts an end to a few months of exhaustive proceedings."
"With the vote, as this House has voted on the amendments, the text of the report is coming very close to the original text which I as rapporteur proposed to the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"The report is strict, yet fair: fair because we in this House have expressed our seriousness and commitment, but fair also because we, in turn, demand from Turkey that it should show commitment, both in terms of the implementation of the Ankara Protocol before the end of this year and of carrying out political reforms in the area of the freedom of expression of opinion and freedom of religion by the end of 2007."
"Nor let there be no mistake about the text with regard to the Armenian genocide."
"Although it is, strictly speaking, not a formal condition, we think it unavoidable for a country on the path to Europe to come to terms with its past."
"I therefore hope that Turkey will interpret this paragraph 50 as an extra incentive, together with its neighbour Armenia, to face up to the facts."
"Mr President, I come to the conclusion that the report is fair but tough."
"The European Parliament is fulfilling its responsibility for safeguarding European values and the accession criteria with this report."
"I therefore ask all Members to support the report as broadly as possible."
"I hope that Turkey will see it as an incentive to speed up its reforms."
"That concludes the vote."
"We shall now proceed to the explanations of vote."
"– Mr President, I voted in favour of the Roure report on the grounds that the war on terror is, for the USA, a welcome pretext for compelling others to hand over personal information."
"European data protection provisions, however, categorise the USA as a third country with poor data protection security, something irreconcilable with the agreement on passenger data, which is itself worthy of criticism."
"It would also appear that the banks, too, are being blackmailed into disclosing the movements of funds."
"While one would hope that all these things are being done only for good purposes, the EU must stop lending legitimacy to the concept of the transparent person, and should instead get back to taking data protection seriously."
"The report is clearly a further step towards total harmonisation of the Member States’ criminal justice systems."
"As always, proposals of this kind involve a protracted and very complicated compromise between the countries."
"The June List is always a devoted adherent of the Member States’ right to self-determination in criminal law, and we are very concerned about legal certainty."
"Among other things, the report would, under certain conditions, entitle private actors to acquaint themselves with very sensitive personal data, a development that, in the opinion of the June List, cannot be regarded as offering sufficient legal certainty."
"It is true that Parliament’s amendments contain certain guarantees of legal certainty for individuals, but the proposal as a whole entails a major step towards supranational control of what is at the heart of the right to self-determination of a state governed by the rule of law, namely criminal law."
"– The Greek Communist Party voted against the report because, despite the individual improvements which it proposes to the proposal for a directive of the European Commission, it basically accepts its entire underlying philosophy, which is no less than the unlimited and, from a practical point of view, uncontrollable facility for the prosecuting authorities and repressive mechanisms not only of the Member States of the EU, but also of third countries (aka the USA) and even of private individuals, to collect, process and exchange all the personal data of each citizen of the EU, including data relating to their political and trade union activities and their ideological, philosophical and religious convictions."
"The sights of the gigantic data-recording mechanism being promoted by the ΕU are now set on every EU citizen, in that the personal data of every person can be collected and transmitted without their even being suspected of an offence, purely and simply for reasons of public order and security."
"The right to privacy and the protection of personal data is basically being abolished in that, with the proposed directive on the so-called protection of personal data, the exceptions to this protection are institutionalised as the rule, though a simple and uncontrolled reference to reasons of public security, while the protection of data is the exception, which it is almost impossible for anyone to impose."
"– I voted in favour of the report by Mr Diaz de Mera Garcia Consuegra on the proposal for a decision of the European Council on the PERICLES programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting."
"This issue is essential to the proper functioning of our single currency, and I am delighted that the decision is being extended to Member States that are not part of the euro zone."
"It is important to note that, while the number of counterfeit euro notes appears to have stabilised at 50 000 per month, we are seeing a worrying explosion in counterfeit coins."
"We should therefore consider whether it may be in our interest to look into the introduction of a one euro note, following the example of the one dollar note in the United States of America, in order to prevent counterfeiting and also because it would be of some practical use to commerce and to the citizens."
"Since the euro was introduced and the Member States’ national currencies correspondingly withdrawn, there is just one encouraging development to be noted: the reduction in counterfeiting."
"In 2005, the total number of counterfeit euro coins withdrawn from circulation was substantially lower than the total number of counterfeit coins in the former national currencies before the introduction of the euro."
"This is due, in particular, to the constructive cooperation between the anti-fraud office, or OLAF, the European Central Bank, Europol, Interpol and the competent national authorities."
"Beyond straightforward counterfeiting, there has also, however, been the recent emergence of new coins confusingly similar to two–euro coins."
"Since 1 January 2005, Turkey does, in fact, have a new coin, known as the ‘new Turkish lire’."
"Looking at the new one-lire coin, you can see that it is of exactly the same size and appearance as the two-euro coin."
"Is this a coincidence or a clever piece of counterfeiting?"
"Wait and see ..."
"The problem is that these Turkish coins are already circulating in Europe, no doubt in anticipation of Turkish accession to Europe, as announced by our leaders and eurocrats, regardless of the will of the nations themselves."
"Let us be vigilant. Turkey is closer than ever to our gates."
"I am abstaining in the vote on this report because I believe that the EU should invest as many resources in protecting the Swedish krona and other EU currencies as in protecting the euro."
"The fight against counterfeiting is, of course, a good thing in itself, especially when it is based on cooperation and conferences and not on increased police supervision."
"– Mr President, we did not vote for Mr Demetriou's report, even though it is a substantial improvement on the proposal for a framework decision tabled by the Council."
"Why did we not vote for it?"
"Because, in spite of everything, this whole instrument is still remarkably ambiguous."
"What exactly does it mean that criminal decisions taken in a Member State will be taken into account?"
"Will they be taken into account to avoid the application of the double jeopardy rule, in order to avoid unfair double convictions?"
"That would be perfectly natural."
"On the flip side, however, does it mean taking them into account in order to suggest that someone is guilty on the basis of actions that are not regarded as criminal in their country of origin?"
"For example, will the historian David Irving, who is currently unjustly imprisoned in Austria for a thought crime, be regarded, when he returns to his country, which we hope will happen soon, as a criminal and persistent offender, when he is doubtless the greatest British Second World War historian?"
"Those are some of the ambiguities contained in this text, which, in our view, justify our reticence, all the more so because there is a convention on this matter, the convention of 1970."
"As the report quite rightly states, a framework decision cannot unilaterally amend an international convention."
"This also raises the problem of the States that are not Members of the European Union but that nevertheless ratified that convention."
"This reservation, which we have developed since ratification, presents a new problem in international law, which we would prefer to regulate under the terms of the international conventions."
"– I voted in favour of the excellent report by Mr Demetriou on the proposal for a Framework Council Decision on taking account of convictions in the Member States of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings."
"The functioning of the single market and the mobility of Europeans within the Union makes it essential to define the conditions under which convictions in the Member States must be taken into account in the course of new legal proceedings involving different cases in another Member State."
"It has become essential to establish the principle of mutual recognition of convictions, together with the gathering and exchange of appropriate information that would naturally accompany that."
"This is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition if we are to move towards a European judicial area in the belief that European democracy must be based on law and, conversely, that the law must stem from democracy."
"The June List believes that legal certainty for individuals is a very important issue that should not be compromised on. Criminal law goes to the heart of a country’s sovereignty and right to self-determination."
"There is no doubt that widely different legal cultures exist at present within the EU, just as there are widely different attitudes to legal certainty and the impartiality of the courts."
"The proposal is in danger of undermining the Hague convention governing the international scope of criminal courts, which was signed back in 1972 and has operated successfully since then."
"True, the June List believes that Parliament’s amendment is better thought-out, but it also believes that the proposal as a whole is a further step towards a supranational union."
"We are therefore voting against the proposal on grounds of principle."
". One absolute principle in all modern codes of criminal law is that of , according to which criminal penalties may only be applied to something that was punishable as a crime at the time the deed was done."
"What this means is terms of this framework decision is that a sentence previously handed down in state A may not be taken into account in a new criminal trial in state B if the relevant act was not a punishable offence in B under that state’s own laws."
"Since this can, ultimately, be determined only by, for example, a judge in state B repeating the whole proceedings from state A complete with the collection of evidence – which would involve such things as re-interviewing witnesses and would be neither desirable nor workable – it must be sufficient that he should have good reason to doubt that the act was punishable."
"If a judge has such doubts, he should no longer be allowed to take such a previous conviction into account."
"It is regrettable that this is not expressly stated in this framework decision."
"I would have tabled an amendment to it, had it not been for the fact that the time available for discussion of amendments in committee ran out, since the deadline for handing them in fell in the summer recess and the vote took place immediately following it without further debate in committee."
"I find this highly regrettable, since a bit more time would have made it possible for the problem I have described to be avoided."
"We need to stress that cooperation rather than harmonisation must underlie any measure in this area."
"This report is no doubt worthy, however we need strongly to reiterate the prime importance of respecting different national legal traditions rather than following too prescriptive a path."
"Therefore, my British Conservative colleagues and I have abstained on this report."
"– The report moves in the direction of homogenising the rules of criminal procedure and the 'communitisation' of criminal law at EU level, within the framework of the implementation of the Hague Programme on the creation of a single area of security, freedom and justice."
"It proposes the amendment in an even more reactionary direction of the proposal for a Commission decision, in that it provides the facility to take account in a Member State of sentences handed down in another Member State of the ΕU against a person, even if the deed for which they were sentenced is not a criminal offence under the law of the state in which it is taken into account."
"In this way, Euro-unifying legislation is adding yet another tool to the effort to impose on national criminal legislation the supranational arrangements of the ΕU, which will determine the acts which it judges should be classified as criminal."
"It is yet another step which tightens the noose around personal freedoms, targets action by the mass grassroots movement and creates the preconditions for the movement's fighting activities to be classified as criminal."
"The Greek Communist Party voted against the report and calls on the workers to step up their action through the workers' and grassroots movement to defend democratic rights and grassroots freedoms."
"Mr President, I voted against my party's whip with regard to the Capoulas Santos report on the fisheries agreement with Guinea-Bissau."
"Over the last seven years I have become increasingly concerned about the nature of the various fisheries agreements the European Union has with many and various countries."
"This has been reflected in my voting up until this point."
"A few years ago I read the Court of Auditors’ report on a number of these fisheries agreements which raise particular questions and doubts as to whether there are benefits to the countries concerned."
"Certainly there is little benefit to the local fishing communities, and certainly no benefits to the ecology of the local fisheries."
"I especially dislike the fact that the EU is hoovering up fishing rights on the cheap for rich and mainly Spanish fishing fleets to abuse, and thus I voted against this particular report."
". The extension of this Fisheries Agreement will allow for better preparation for the new Partnership Agreement between the EU and Guinea-Bissau."
"The main difficulty currently facing the Community fleet concerns the manifest lack of resources for the inspection and surveillance of the country’s exclusive economic zone, that is to say, outside the 12-mile zone. The result of this lack of resources is illegal practices that are jeopardising the sustainability of the fishing activities of the Community fleet."
"This extension will also maintain the fishing opportunities for the European fleet and will enable the Guinea-Bissau Government to guarantee best fishing practice for the EU on the basis of the sustainability of the resources concerned."
"I shall be voting in favour of this report."
"Mr President, today we are asked to approve yet another fisheries agreement exporting our disastrous policies to a third country."
"These agreements do not serve development, conservation or the credibility of the EU and I shall continue to vote against them."
"Mr President, I did not vote on draft amending budget No 4, the Pittella report."
"This is not because I have no respect for the rapporteur – in fact I have a huge amount of respect for Mr Pittella and I am quite sure that this particular adjustment in the budget is fine."
"But I do have a definite problem with the process: a qualified majority vote without an indication of votes, no check of votes on the floor and absolutely no scrutiny of the process behind this."
"I would like to reflect many of my constituents’ worries about the European budget."
"I was recently at meetings in both Daventry and Brixworth in my region, where concern was expressed that the budget is not spent or implemented properly."
"Transferring huge amounts of money between budget lines, which does not reflect Parliament’s considered political view at the time of the budget process, is a worrying development that is happening more and more."
"Thus I did not vote on the Pittella report."
"Today, we have voted on an amending budget affecting the income side of the EU budget."
"The amending budget includes, for example, the recalculation of the contributions necessary for funding the British rebate."
"We find it unfair and antiquated that a Member State should have been placed in this kind of unique position and we wish, in this connection, to emphasise the importance of reviewing the EU budget planned for 2008/2009."
"It is crucially important that this review should cover the British rebate as well as the common agricultural policy."
"We have voted against this report because it rejects the Council of Ministers’ draft amending budget no. 3."
"Unlike the majority in the Committee on Budgets, we believe that the Council of Ministers is perfectly entitled to redistribute expenditure between the EU’s different institutions during the budget procedure if it thinks this the right thing to do."
". With the adoption of the Progress programme, all of the Community actions that were previously spread across different programmes have been brought together, for example the fight against discrimination, the Community strategy for equality between men and women, incentives in the area of employment, activities relating to working conditions and actions in the fight against social exclusion."
"During the debate and negotiation stage we were able to improve upon various aspects of the Commission’s original proposal on Progress, which now includes a number of proposals put forward by our group on the opinion of which I was draftsman on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. Unfortunately, however, the important aspect of the cofinancing contribution was not amended."
"This represents a backward step for associations working in the area of poverty and social exclusion, given that the contribution has dropped from the 90% negotiated in 2001 to the current figure of 80%, a flat figure for all associations."
"There may be exceptions but it would be very difficult to gain approval for them."
"This is the main reason behind our abstention on this report adopting the Progress programme."
"Like so much that we see in this Chamber, the objectives of this programme are well-meant."
"Yet I doubt that it will achieve much practical effect."
"The proposed budget of EUR 650 million is both too much and too little: too much because such a sum, wisely used, could potentially achieve some good; too little because at about EUR 1.50 for each EU citizen, it cannot make the broad-scale changes that are envisaged."
"Most of the money will go into administration, allocation and assessment, and precious little to getting results."
"When will we ever learn?"
"Over and over again we see well-meaning programmes like this that fail to deliver."
"Yet we keep trying again."
"It is a triumph of hope over experience."
"Yet here we are, with yet another centralised attempt to set the world to rights."
"Let’s be brutally honest."
"The main effect of this measure will be to make us in this House feel that we have ‘done Something’."
"It will give us a glow of self-righteousness."
"But it will pass unnoticed amongst those it is intended to help."
"We are fiddling while Rome burns."
"Or perhaps I should say fiddling while the Treaty of Rome burns."
". – For 2007-2013, the Progress programme wants to absorb the Community programmes on social protection, working conditions and so on into a single text."
"This mish-mash is just yet another socially useless instrument along the same lines as the ineffective 'Lisbon Strategy' for European economic growth."
"This programme also quite clearly has an ideological slant."
"Whilst gender equality and consideration for the needs of disabled people are very laudable objectives, the defence of 'people potentially exposed to discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, religion or beliefs, disability, age and sexual orientation' may be a way of silencing opposition to the immigration policy currently being pursued by the Member States, which has been threatening our social protection systems for 30 years."
"Quite apart from its costs, this draft strengthens the powers of the European bureaucracy in Brussels, which bears a large part of the responsibility for the ruin of many of our industries, for the destruction of our countryside and therefore for the social regression from which the peoples of Europe are suffering."
"Only a new Europe of nations, based on national solidarity, will enable true social progress in our countries."
". The overall objective of the Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity, or Progress, is to provide financial support for implementing the objectives of the EU in the area of employment and social affairs and to help achieve the targets of the social agenda in the context of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The partial political agreement on a common position already incorporates most of Parliament’s amendments to the text of the proposal."
"Broadly speaking, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have taken the same line on this programme."
"I therefore lend my full backing to the text of the common position, which creates the conditions in which the proposal for a decision establishing the programme can be quickly adopted."
"This text does not change the substance of the Commission’s original proposal, but it does bring greater clarity and transparency to the implementation of the programme and above all to budgetary questions."
". As Europe grows older and the economy becomes ever more globalised, it has become increasingly necessary to attach special importance to social policy, with a view to strengthening regional and social cohesion in Europe."
"The Progress programme is more than an important instrument of social policy. It is indicative of the fact that Parliament recognises that public policy continues to play a central role in promoting employment, social protection, social inclusion, favourable working conditions, the fight against discrimination, diversity and equality between men and women."
"Naturally Europe must look at the economic growth indicators that it needs to improve."
"Yet for this to happen the Member States need to realise that progress must be made on certain key aspects, such as making more concrete progress in the construction of the internal market."
"The view that what is required is more Europe and less self-interest is a further vital factor in the success of regional and social cohesion policy."
"I welcome the simplification that PROGRESS will bring, by continuing to develop activities launched by four previous programmes, in line with the Commission’s intention to consolidate and streamline the EU's financial instruments."
". – I voted in favour of the assent for the strategic guidelines on cohesion, but I should like to emphasise that the regional policy reform took place not only in the difficult context of the renewal of the financial perspective, but also in the context of the revival of the Lisbon Strategy, which clearly reoriented its objectives."
"The fact is that reorienting them exclusively towards innovation, the knowledge-based economy and competitiveness in the old Member States is not enough to guarantee the objectives of territorial cohesion and sustainable development, which seem to me to take priority."
"I deplore in particular the fact that the earmarking of appropriations in relation to the Lisbon objectives, together with the classification of expenditure, should not have been made subject to the agreement of Parliament."
"I also find it regrettable that the territorial dimension of cohesion was not explicitly taken into account as a strategic guideline in its own right."
"Nevertheless, this is not enough for the development of isolated rural areas."
"I am worried about the fate that awaits them in the programme, because there is still no clear dividing line between intervention from the ERDF and that from the EAFRD, which is part of the CAP and has very limited funds."
". – The Community strategic guidelines for 2007-2013 have finally been adopted by the European Parliament."
"I voted in favour of the rapporteur's recommendations approving these guidelines."
"Nevertheless, during the debate I drew the Commission's attention to the challenge of cross-border cooperation, which should enable us to reduce the disparities between the Union's border regions, provided the unequal amounts being allocated from the Structural Funds as a result of the statistical nomenclature do not hinder the objective of cohesion and do not increase inequalities."
"It is vital that we create the conditions for balanced economic, social and territorial development on both sides of borders and pay special attention to programmes aimed at achieving cross-border cooperation."
". The quick adoption of Community strategic guidelines on cohesion is a vitally important factor in the ongoing process of programming assistance from the European Funds in the Member States in the field of the reform of the cohesion policy for 2007-2013, with a view to the new financial programmes being operational as of 1 January 2007."
"Parliament had its say on the guidelines in its sitting of 18 May in a resolution that it adopted based on the Krehl report on preparing for the assent procedure for the Community’s strategic guidelines for the period 2007-2013 (Cohesion Policy in Support of Growth and Jobs), which I supported and on which I voted accordingly."
"The recommendation on the proposal for a Council decision on Community strategic guidelines on cohesion by Mrs Krehl is based on that parliamentary resolution of 18 May."
"I therefore voted in favour again."
". Now that the majority in Parliament has given its assent to the Community strategic guidelines on cohesion for 2007-2013, the Member States will submit their national reference frameworks."
"We do not accept the change implied by these strategic guidelines, insofar as they make cohesion play second fiddle to competitiveness; in other words, the objective of economic and social cohesion becomes secondary to the 'Lisbon Strategy' objectives and their neoliberal agenda of liberalising the markets and public services, encouraging deregulation and reducing job security, privatising social security and selling off teaching and research to the highest bidder."
"It is an agenda, in other words, that undermines economic and social cohesion and promotes territorial disparities and social inequalities."
"The establishment of a minimum quota of funds for these purposes – at least 60% for convergence regions – is therefore unacceptable, as it pits contradictory objectives against one another, especially in a context in which the amount of funds has been cut to 0.37% of Community GNI from 0.41% in the previous framework."
"Furthermore, we are opposed – especially in this context – to extending the use of private-public partnerships."
"We therefore voted against."
"Mr President, I congratulate our rapporteur Mrs Krehl on a well balanced report on this crucial issue."
"In Scotland we have long experience of using structural funds effectively and well, and it is vital that the funds continue to evolve to meet Europe’s needs."
"This report takes proper cognisance of developments and suggests a number of helpful steps forward and I welcome it wholeheartedly."
"– Mr President, I should like to explain why, after yesterday's very interesting debates and today's votes, I voted against Mr Rapkay's report: it is quite simply because I cannot help but observe that it is a resounding victory for the liberals."
"We voted for the deregulation of public services, against a framework directive, against the distinction between services of general economic interest and services of general interest, for the application of competition law to all services of general interest and their precise definition, against the definition of 'in-house', in other words state control, and against the specifics of the Altmark criteria."
"Under these circumstances, we are taking a considerable step backwards in comparison with the previous resolutions by Mr Herzog and Mr Langen in 2001, and the Commission is now proposing a new communication at the end of the year."
"In other words, we are currently leaving whole swathes of Community law and local public services exposed to the uncertainties of the Court."
"What is meant by State control?"
"What is meant by inter-communal structure?"
"What is meant by mixed-economy society?"
"What concessions need to be made to market and competition law?"
"We still do not know, and that is why I shall continue to advocate over-arching texts that enable us to put subsidiarity on a firmer footing."
"Unfortunately, I think that we are far from achieving that, and that it is now a losing battle."
"I hope that it is not a final defeat."
"– Mr President, we did not vote in favour of the Rapkay report for one very specific reason: it constitutes a completely unjustified backward step in comparison with the text of the Constitution."
"The text of the draft Constitution provided for a European law laying down the principles and conditions that enable us to provide, implement and fund services of general economic interest."
"This would therefore be what is currently called a framework directive."
"Not only does the report move away from this principle, but, by rejecting Amendment 10, it formally rejects and publicly expresses opposition to the Constitutional Treaty."
"I am consequently most concerned about the wayward path being taken by Parliament, which claims to support the Constitutional Treaty but which, when it comes to something important, and even crucial, to public opinion in some countries, pulls back with no justification."
"– I voted in favour of the report by Mr Rapkay on the Commission White Paper on services of general interest (SGI) because it is a balanced report."
"In particular, he has had the courage to point out that it is impossible to provide a uniform definition of SGIs in such a heterogeneous social and economic environment as the European Union and that, in this field, the principle of subsidiarity must be reaffirmed, leaving it to the Member States to define what should or should not be classed as coming under the general interest and directly to act in accordance with their decisions."
"Following the difficulties in reaching a political compromise at first reading on the ‘services’ directive, the debate on SGIs is far from concluded."
"It is urgent that we legislate at European level on particular sectors, namely social services and health services of general interest, in order to provide them with legal certainty."
"Finally, this matter will be important in terms of the competitiveness of the European area, to which we must pay close attention."
". – I voted against Mr Rapkay's report on the Commission White Paper on services of general interest because several amendments that were very important to me were rejected, in particular the amendment calling for a framework directive on services of general interest and those calling for clarification of the criteria distinguishing between services of general interest (SGIs) and services of general economic interest (SGEIs) and the criteria for granting compensation for the provision of public services and in-house provision."
"We must not give way on these vital issues for the future of public services in our countries, and we must not take a backward step in comparison to what Parliament adopted in the Herzog resolution in 2004 and the Langen resolution in 2001, especially at a time when the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has drafted a proposal for a framework directive on general interest services that goes still further."
". As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the Commission White Paper on Services of General Interest (SGIs), I fought for the following:"
"- the complete exclusion of SGIs – both non-economic (SNEGIs) and economic (SGEIs) – from the scope of the directive on services in the internal market (the ‘Services Directive’)."
"- the adoption, by contrast, of a framework directive, a framework legislation or a general legal framework, call it what you will, for SGIs (including SGEIs, although this does not prevent the latter from being subject to a specific sectoral regulation); and"
"- the definition and description of SGIs, along with a clarification of the distinction between SNEGIs and SGEIs, for the purpose of legal certainty."
"Broadly speaking, I feel that these ideas have been covered in this report. I therefore supported and voted in favour of this report."
"I am disappointed, however, that the report did not incorporate another of the main ideas that I put forward in the opinion of which I was the draftsman, namely a recognition, in the context of SGIs, of the unique situation of the outermost regions, in view of the particular structural and permanent obstacles that they face."
"– I voted against Mr Rapkay's report for the following reasons. First of all, the Commission is not requested to propose a framework directive on services of general interest."
"There is now a threat hanging over administrations, mixed-economy societies and inter-communal structures, due to the risk of disputes in the name of competition law."
"Mr Barroso made no mistake when, during the debate in plenary, he observed that there was no consensus on a proposal for a framework directive."
"By refusing to define services of general interest and the specific law applicable to them, the Commission is leaving public services subject to the rules of the market, and hence to competition law."
"Now is no longer the time to publish yet another communication, or to put forward new sectoral proposals."
"We expect the Commission to respect Parliament's decisions and to proceed as soon as possible to an evaluation of the liberalisation policies being pursued."
"We know that the results are a long way off the published objectives."
"This resolution does not look at services of general interest as a fundamental pillar of the European social model, or as a means of achieving the EU's objectives in terms of society, the economy, the environment and territorial cohesion."
". We voted against this report because its broad premise is to submit public services to competition and to a future internal market for services, in light of the compromise reached by the Council over the notorious Bolkestein Directive."
"At the same time, it covers up the effects of the sectoral liberalisations that have already taken place in areas such as transport, energy and communications. Contrary to what is claimed, and as many user groups and consumer protection organisations have proved, liberalisation has led to more difficult access to services, lower service quality, higher prices and the loss of thousands of jobs, on the pretext of sectoral restructuring."
"The idea of dividing services of general interest into economic and non-economic, from a commercial perspective, is actually part of an attempt to put almost all public services at the mercy of the market."
"Our position is to defend the exclusive competence and sovereignty of the Member States in defining how public services are to be funded and how that funding is to be organised. After all, public ownership is a fundamental element in protecting high-quality public services, so as to guarantee universal access throughout EU territory, supply at socially fair prices and the democratic involvement of end users in defining, managing and determining the quality of these services."
". – Mr Rapkay’s report on services of general interest, whether economic or otherwise, promises us yet more convoluted European legislation and further interference on the part of the Commission in the budgetary and fiscal systems of the Member States and their local authorities, all of which is in flagrant breach of the principle of subsidiarity, which is nonetheless mentioned time and again by the rapporteur."
"The people of Europe must be constantly reminded that the liberalisation of public services, with its all too familiar consequences, is the Commission of Brussels’ way of holding the Treaties to legal ransom."
"The fact is that the market, on its own, cannot guarantee either the quality or the completion of all of the tasks relating to these services, regardless of whether they are connected to society, territorial planning or strategic and national interests."
"Public services, whether profitable or not, must come under the exclusive power of the Member States, in terms both of their definition and of their organisation, the appointment procedures, the number and nature of the bodies to which they are entrusted and even the funding methods."
"I voted against the Rapkay report because I consider that the final text did not provide adequate support for services of general interest (public services)."
"Directives on a sectoral basis alone will only result in ‘salami slicing’ of the overall public interest and carve out sectors for business benefit."
"There are aspects of social services which support the educational sector, forms of housing which serve a general public interest even if not expressly dealing with a deprived social sector etc. – a sectoral approach is not enough."
"As we have so often done in the environmental domain, we need an overarching framework directive first, setting out the general interest before we embark on specific sectors."
"We can find a legal basis."
"It is not enough for people to say this lies within the competence of Member States when those same Member State governments are using market rules, the Services Directive and other means to achieve liberalisation by the back door."
"I hope those who supported the amendment on liberalisation, who voted against a horizontal directive and voted for the final report will be able to explain to their colleagues in local and regional government why they are not defending more strongly the public services their colleagues have to deliver."
". – Mr Rapkay’s report on services of general interest (SGIs) is initially appealing."
"It talks about more being done to protect public services and the principle of subsidiarity, about democratic respect being shown for national traditions and about the definitions relating to SGIs being clarified by means of the specific introduction of the concept of services of ‘non economic’ interest."
"These good intentions may fool people, especially when the draft framework directive now seems to have been abandoned."
"However, a good many binding rules are going to compete with the Member States’ prerogatives, such as their control over funding methods."
"The door therefore remains open for a wayward pro-European path to be taken in future."
"Finally, it is clearly impossible for me to vote in favour of this text, as it refers to the Constitutional Treaty – the Constitution – which the report maintains would provide better guarantees for SGIs faced with the current mess that European legislation is in."
"I would point out that the European Constitution was democratically rejected by the people of the Netherlands and of France."
"This text, which, in the end, takes neither side in the debate, only warrants a vote of abstention."
"– I voted against the Rapkay report. It does not acknowledge the need for a framework directive for SGIs and SGEIs and thus leaves the door open for a continuation of the current process of deregulation, which jeopardises our public services, as well as the opportunity for everybody, no matter where they live, to access these vital services."
"A framework directive should guarantee standardisation among users, equality among the citizens and the regions, territorial planning and the long-term continuity of the services provided, as well as a quality standard level."
"We must, as a matter of urgency, stop this across-the-board liberalisation, which satisfies neither the employees engaged in these activities nor the citizens."
"– Services of general economic interest, with the distinction between their economic and non-economic aspects, are in the sights of big business, with a view to commercialising the satisfaction of basic grassroots needs and increasing their profits."
"The ΕU is intensifying the ban on state aid on the pretext of protecting competition and promoting the full liberalisation and privatisation of services with a view to permitting the penetration of big business."
"Within the frameworks of the single market and the stability pact, the Member States are selling off the grassroots wealth, thereby strengthening the plutocracy."
"According to the ΕU, services profitable to capital must be sold off."
"The results of this policy will be particularly painful for the workers: the loss of thousands of jobs, worse industrial relations and a fall in the standard of living."
"The consequences, which we have already seen in services which have fallen victim to capitalist restructurings and the privatisation policy, will be particularly adverse for all the users of these services, especially the grassroots classes."
"The Greek Communist Party voted against the European Parliament resolution which accepts the division of services of general interest into economic and non-economic services and promotes the selling off and commercialisation of these services."
"It supports the workers fighting for better and cheaper public services for the benefit of the standard of living of the people and not of the profits of the monopolies."
". Regardless of the capitalist and market economy model that we advocate, there will always be a need for public services to be provided by public bodies, either directly or indirectly."
"Accordingly, and given that this issue comes up in various Community measures – if only for the purpose of excluding it from their scope – it is understandable that the Commission should submit its opinion on this issue."
"That said, I wish to make three reservations, mindful of future developments."
"Firstly, the EU is not in a position to provide services of general economic interest, and this is increasingly true of services of general interest as well (any exceptions should ideally be based on cooperation between the Member States); legislation on these services should increasingly be at national level, although it should also comply with the rules of the internal market and the principles of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services."
"Lastly, I am dismayed that the resolution on this issue calls on the Commission to submit a comprehensive analysis ‘of the effects of liberalisation to date, in particular on the situation of consumers and the employees affected’."
"The term ‘affected’ introduces an ideological angle in a context that should be impartial."
". The EU’s internal market has already proved successful in liberalising a large number of sectors of its services, which has ultimately benefited European consumers and employees."
"In order to give the European economy fresh impetus, however, the EU must make another qualitative leap ahead to complete its internal market and thus to derive maximum benefit from it."
"This leap ahead could be made by means of initiatives in the area of services of general interest (SGIs), public services that are not of a commercial nature and that are financed mainly by public funds."
"I believe that the precise definition, formulation, organisation and funding of SGIs should rest exclusively with the Member States, reflecting the reality in the Member States and respect for regional and local autonomy."
"The provision of SGIs at local, regional and national level has been at variance with Community legislation."
"These services occupy a legal grey area at European level, given that it is unclear what rules apply to SGIs – as regards, for example, competition, public competitions and the internal market."
"The case law of the European Court of Justice has done little to clear the fog."
"I support the report insofar as it promotes a clear distinction between, on the one hand, the implementation of Community law and, on the other, the pursuit of objectives in the public interest in the provision of SGIs."
"– Mr President, the Austrian People’s Party delegation voted ‘yes’ to the first part of paragraph 69, on the grounds that we see this as a process with an open outcome, whilst rejecting the second part on the grounds that it contradicts the first."
"In the final vote, though, despite the majority support for the second part, we voted in favour, taking the view that this report does not pass judgment on the ultimate objective, but rather on the progress of negotiations to date, and that it constitutes a critical and objective discussion of the European Union’s shared laws and resolutions rather than a final vote and statement."
"I wanted to make this statement for the avoidance of inconsistencies and misinterpretations."
"– Mr President, I have voted, deliberately and with conviction, in favour of the first part of paragraph 69 and against the second, taking as I do the view that the good work done by Mr Eurlings and many other Members does in fact amount to an enumeration of issues and situations that militate against Turkish accession, and that is a reason why the negotiations should not have accession as their final objective."
"It is for that reason that I have voted against the report as a whole."
"We should focus on paragraph 71 by trying to find a way of tying Turkey into the European structures, and we should do the same for other neighbouring countries to which the prospect of Member State status should not be held out and that we do not in any case believe capable of achieving it."
"– Mr President, even though there is no doubt that it has a number of good or interesting points – not least the way it makes clear that Turkey is not ready for Europe and also that it probably never will be – I voted against the Eurlings report, and I did so on the grounds that the Turkish Government is doing nothing more than indulging in window-dressing, in that it has agreed on a few reforms, albeit without implementing them, not to mention the fact that we are not getting any closer to solving certain problems with considerable potential for doing damage, such as the conflict over Cyprus, the Kurdish problem or the acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide."
"All these matters should have been resolved long before negotiations started, all the more so in view of the EUR 1.3 billion that the Turks have been given over recent years in pre-accession aid."
"I believe it is now time that we did what Europe’s citizens have been doing for some time, and said an honest ‘no’ to the accession negotiations."
"– Mr President, many of us abstained from voting on the Eurlings report, and we did so for the following reasons."
"We would have voted in favour of this report because, as I said yesterday, it is the most critical report ever adopted in this Parliament on the subject of Turkey’s behaviour towards the European Union."
"Unfortunately, Parliament, by means of its vote, has rejected the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite for accession and, in spite of our vote and that of a number of our fellow Members, has also adopted a provision that implicitly provides for accession as the only outcome of the negotiations."
"We disagree on these two points."
"Nevertheless, that does not mean that we wanted to oppose the efforts made by Mr Eurlings and the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"They have sent out a very strong signal on behalf of this Parliament, and that is why we abstained from voting."
"Mr President, I had originally intended to vote in favour of the Eurlings report today, even though I, as a staunch opponent to Turkey’s accession, believe that this report overlooks the essence of the matter, but a number of amendments, particularly those on Armenia, prompted me to change my mind during the voting procedure, and so I ended up voting against this report."
"What the Eurlings report did do, though, was to prove that the mood in this Parliament and in Europe has shifted in the right direction in the past two years and that we have become more aware of the many points on which Ankara is failing to fulfil the Copenhagen accession criteria."
"It was therefore a good thing that the rapporteur reminded us of the Armenian genocide, but today’s vote is making the Liberals, Greens and Socialists in this Parliament look like fools."
"They are so full of human rights and grand principles, but when the chips are down and they are faced with the realities of politics, they fail to deliver."
"One can hardly imagine a more selfish attitude."
"It appears that not every genocide is entitled to our remembrance."
"The same applies to the Cyprus issue, in respect of which many in this House appear to forget that the northern half of that country, with its terrorist regime, has, for over thirty years, been kept under the thumb of Turkey, a country that can never, and indeed should never, become a Member State of the European Union."
"Mr President, I too voted against the Eurlings report, because it still works on the premise that Turkey’s accession remains desirable."
"If, though, we were to examine the impressive catalogue of serious problems, we would know better."
"Taking out the key clause on the Armenian genocide is a disgrace; the actual effect of it is that we in this House are distancing ourselves from the two resolutions we have adopted on this subject in the past."
"It also encourages the Turkish Government to continue to pursue its policy of state-sponsored denial."
"In that connection, I should also condemn the lack of stamina shown by the groups on the Left."
"The Walloon , for example, withdrew its support for recognition of the Armenian genocide for fear of losing votes among the ever increasing Turkish electorate in Brussels, where elections are to be held in two weeks’ time."
"So much for people claiming to uphold grand principles."
"Talk about hypocrisy!"
"– Mr President, I, too, should like to make a statement of vote in relation to the Eurlings report."
"Although the report contains many statements that I can endorse, I eventually voted against its adoption on the grounds that I am fundamentally opposed to Turkish membership of the European Union, whilst the report – although it does impose many conditions – does not exclude full Member States status as an objective."
"Another reason why I rejected it was that the report does not call for the accession negotiations with Turkey to be suspended with immediate effect."
"It is intolerable that we should still be negotiating with a Turkish Government, members of which have recently compared Pope Benedict with Hitler and Mussolini."
"It was politicians of Turkish origin who made the most odious statements in response to Pope Benedict’s speech in my own country."
"On this issue, though, I shall put my trust in the people of France, assuming as I do that the majority of them will vote against Turkish accession, so that it will not come to pass."
"– Mr President, we, in the UDF, very strongly support Mr Eurlings’s report, because it contains some very powerful truths that must be made known."
"Even so, we were obliged to abstain from voting."
"Why?"
"Firstly, precisely because this report seems to rule out the idea of an enhanced partnership acting as an alternative to pure and simple accession."
"Well, that is unrealistic, especially because, by rejecting the paragraph on Armenia, this Parliament is sending out an extraordinarily negative signal."
"I would point out that, in 2004, we voted in favour of a resolution stating that we were calling for the recognition of the Armenian genocide; and that, in 2005, we voted in favour of a resolution stating that we were calling for the recognition of this genocide as a prerequisite for accession."
"We have forgotten about all of that today."
"What message is being sent out?"
"The message that this is a Parliament that changes its mind and that forgets about its resolutions."
"The message is simple – it consists in saying to the people of Turkey: you need not be in any hurry to change regarding this matter; you may continue to make the very mention of the genocide a crime of opinion; and, when all is said and done, you will not be asked to recognise this genocide."
"This is an extremely negative and extremely serious message."
"I regret that it has been sent out and that it has prevented us from voting in favour of what is, I might add, an excellent report by Mr Eurlings."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the debate evaluating Turkey’s supposed progress towards joining the European Union, and since we approved an important resolution on the Armenian genocide, I have been wondering what we can demand from Turkey other than a clear commitment in this area at last: specifically a commitment to respect human rights and to accept the values on which the European Union is founded."
"Instead, today’s vote has yet again shown the hypocrisy of political correctness, in that it seeks to leave out the need for a clear position statement from the demands that Europe has a duty to put to Turkey's leaders and institutions – the same people who welcomed the Pope's words and forthcoming visit with vulgar, violent language and Mafia-like threats."
"Europe just looks on, while their school books still teach Turkish children that the Armenian genocide is a fabrication of history."
"People were right to say that we should listen carefully to the criticisms levelled against those who want to rewrite history."
"It is disgraceful!"
"Turkey still refuses to recognise the rights of peoples – not just the Armenians, but the Kurds as well – while Europe remains hypocritically and shamefully silent."
"We no longer have a Europe of human rights, but a Europe that could not care less about human rights!"
"– Mr President, I voted for the adoption of the Eurlings report in the belief that it was good, critical, and the best report of this kind to have been put before us to date."
"I voted for it even though I do not like everything about it."
"I do not, for example, like the way this report approaches the Armenian issue."
"Let us imagine for a moment that the Holocaust that occurred under Hitler’s regime were, in Germany, to be always referred to only in inverted commas or described only as the ‘so-called holocaust’; that is the way in which the Armenian issue is handled in Turkey."
"I voted in favour of the Eurlings report even though a majority backed the inclusion of a clause stating that the objective to be aimed for had to be Turkey’s full membership of the European Union, an objective of which I am of course not in favour on the grounds that Turkey is neither ready for accession nor willing to comply with our requirements, and because I know – as does everyone else in this House – that the EU cannot afford to have Turkey as a Member State."
"I found it easy to vote in favour of this report, for the statements that I did not want to see incorporated, yet which nonetheless have been, and which I have just enumerated, are quite obviously so nonsensical that the report, taken as a whole, nevertheless represents a good reflection of this House’s position."
". I voted against the Eurlings Report because I remain resolutely opposed to non-European Turkey obtaining membership of the EU."
"Those who claim that movement towards membership will induce Turkey into full democratic and human rights compliance are shown, even by the lack of appreciable progress conceded by this report, to be lamentably wrong."
"On reform, human rights, religious freedom, Cyprus, Armenia we have obtained nothing, but in return we have wasted, and will continue to waste, millions on pre-accession aid."
"Not for the first time, the EU is being taken for a ride."
"The EU's lust for endless enlargement is driven by a craving for ego-building world status, which goes hand in hand with the drive for super-statehood through the rejected Constitution."
"Turkey's membership, even wider enlargement and the Constitution are all part of the same grand design."
". – One year on from the start of accession negotiations with Turkey, the Eurlings report reviews the progress that has been made and the problems that have been encountered."
"With the tabling of certain amendments, it has been possible to balance this report so as to take account of the efforts made by Turkey and, at the same time, to highlight areas that remain problematic, such as Turkey’s failure to sign the Ankara Protocol and the treatment of minorities."
"As regards the Armenian genocide, it absolutely must be recognised by Turkey."
"This recognition cannot, however, be presented as a prerequisite for accession, in view of the Copenhagen criteria."
"As regards the paragraph on the possibility of enhanced cooperation between the EU and Turkey in the event of a breakdown in negotiations, such a move is not appropriate at the moment."
"We are in the midst of an ongoing process, and we cannot be pessimistic right from this stage about the conclusion of the negotiations."
"With this vote, I want to show the considerable progress that Turkey must make in order to join the European Union, but, in doing so, I do not want to create any further obstacles to its possible accession."
"In my opinion, Turkey’s entry into the EU represents both an opportunity for Turkey and an opportunity for Europe."
". – Mr President, on behalf of the Transnational Radical Party, I voted against the Eurlings report on Turkey, because Parliament is thereby authorising the European Union to shut itself off from the Mediterranean and the Middle East yet again."
"Instead of showing its willingness to speed up the process of integrating Turkey into Europe, Parliament is proposing alternative ways to bring Ankara closer to Brussels that have nothing to do with serious accession negotiations."
"The European Union must not just shut itself off and focus solely on its Constitution, as President Barroso explained to us a few days ago."
"Nor should it pin its hopes on the Pope’s good offices to establish a dialogue with the Islamic world and the Middle East, as the Eurlings report suggests."
"Josef Ratzinger is not Javier Solana."
"Instead, starting with Mr Pannella’s appeal for peace in the Middle East, we have to revive our federalist and democratic aspirations, so as to create a Europe that can include the largest possible number of people in a political project of freedom, democratic reform and peace."
"I voted in favour of this report and I support the principle of Turkish accession to the European Union upon completion of the accession negotiations and provided that Turkey meets the necessary standards in terms of human rights, the functioning of the democratic system, respect for minorities and coming to terms with its past."
"Developments in Turkey are very worrying in a number of areas."
"A number of cases in which journalists and authors have been arrested and accused of committing crimes against ‘Turkishness’ have been observed."
"While these developments are naturally very worrying, Turkey’s democratic forces and forces sympathetic to reform must not be forgotten."
"That is now our task as the EU: to continue to help and support these forces as they set Turkey back on the right road again."
"Mr Eurlings includes justified criticism of Turkey in his report, but other criticisms of his suggest that Turkey should be handled differently from other candidate countries."
"That is unacceptable. It is important for Turkey to come to terms with its history, including in relation to Armenia."
"The issue must not, however, be allowed to determine whether or not the negotiations with Turkey are to continue."
"It is important for the EU to feel a sense of responsibility now and not to play into the hands of fundamentalists and reactionaries. Instead, we need to vote a balanced report through."
"We have therefore chosen to vote in favour of paragraph 50 and the amendments that promote a constructive approach to Turkey."
"I voted against Amendment 51 from my own group to paragraph 50 of Mr Eurlings' report on Turkey's progress towards accession."
"I did that with some regret, but the consequence of the amendment passing would have been to delete the reference to the Assyrian community, amongst others."
"As someone who has consistently complained that the plight and even existence of the Assyrian community is being ignored in Iraq, it would be hypocritical of me to collude in exactly the same way for the case of Turkey."
"I did the same for the other amendments to this paragraph."
". – I voted against the Eurlings report because it reflects Europe’s growing hypocrisy regarding Turkey."
"In my opinion, Turkey is destined to become a member of the European Union: it has always been part of Europe’s political, economic and cultural past."
"Even though it is clear that Turkey still has more work to do in many areas, certain political forces within the Council and Parliament are multiplying the obstacles that Turkey has to overcome."
"I, for my part, intend to dissociate myself from these shameful tactics which, at the end of the day, are merely designed to preserve a ‘Christian Europe’!"
". – If you had not incorrectly described Turkey as a European country – which it is not – then you would not be in the position today of having to acknowledge a number of truths."
"You tell us today that religious minorities, and Christian minorities in particular, are oppressed in Turkey and that respect for human rights in general, and women’s rights in particular, is not guaranteed there."
"You have discovered that Turkey is still refusing to recognise Cyprus - even though it is a member of this Union that Turkey wants to join – and that it frequently provokes border incidents with another Member State, Greece."
"You declare that Turkey is breaching one of the basic principles of the European Union, freedom of movement; and there are many more that could be mentioned."
"All that you have to say on the matter is: ‘let us continue with the negotiations, but be aware that, at the last minute, we will still be able to say “No”’."
"Who can believe such a tale?"
"On 3 December 2005, you had a duty to listen to the people of Europe, the majority of whom were opposed to Turkey’s joining Europe."
"Your duty was to propose to Turkey a privileged partnership that respected our differences, and not this political and diplomatic farce, which is humiliating for both parties and especially for the people of Turkey."
"The report is a survey of the progress made so far by Turkey regarding its future accession to the EU."
"Only one chapter, ‘Science and Research’, has been opened and provisionally closed."
"Consequently, there is a long way still to go."
"The June List does not see Turkey’s geographical position or its religion as an obstacle to possible membership of the EU."
"We believe that the same accession requirements should be laid down as were laid down in the case of earlier enlargements – neither more nor fewer."
"Turkey does not fulfil the Copenhagen criteria, so EU membership is not appropriate as matters stand."
"However, it is not only Turkey that has to adapt."
"The EU’s agricultural policy and structural funds must be reformed."
"A possible future Treaty is another issue that must be discussed before further enlargements of the EU can be carried out, with particular attention being given to the voting strength of each Member State so as to prevent a situation in which a small number of large Member States become able to dominate the whole of the EU."
"Both Turkey and the EU have a very long road to travel, politically and economically, before Turkish membership can be an imminent possibility. If and when that day comes, the June List would, however, welcome Turkey."
"We have therefore voted in favour of this report."
". – I abstained from voting on this report."
"The report presented in plenary has the virtue of finally seeing things as they are."
"For a very long time, Parliament demonstrated naïve optimism on this issue."
"This report is more solid than previous reports, but I regret the lack of courage shown by Parliament on the issue of the recognition of the Armenian genocide."
"That is why I decided to abstain from the final vote."
"For years now, I have been opposed to Turkey’s joining the European Union, but I would ask for a privileged partnership to be set up with that country."
"More MEPs have now adopted this position, which was still very much a minority position a few years ago."
"Turkey does not recognise one of the Member States of the European Union – the Republic of Cyprus – and has been occupying it for 30 years!"
"Turkey does not recognise the Armenian genocide."
"Turkey does not approve of freedom of association, and 97% of its territory is situated outside Europe."
"Europe has a duty to help this country on the road to democracy, but because of its geography, history and culture, Turkey cannot claim to be part of the European Union’s political project."
". A year on from the opening of negotiations over Turkey’s accession to the EU, the Turkish authorities have not taken any steps towards recognising Cyprus, an EU Member State."
"Turkey also continues its military occupation of the north of that Mediterranean island, in breach of UN resolutions that have been in place for dozens of years."
"After a year of negotiations, reports have come to light of a downturn in the economic situation of the Kurdish people and of breaches of the Kurds’ legitimate political and cultural rights. News has also come of increased repression by the Turkish police and military in the region."
"These two issues alone are indicative of the many questions raised by Turkey’s accession negotiations."
"Its accession is being promoted by the major powers in the EU, since the large economic and financial groups in those countries want to be able to exploit Turkey's economy and resources and to use its geostrategic position for their plans to influence and dominate the Middle East, the Caucasus and Central Asia."
"The accession process has also brought to the surface contradictions in the way the major powers share control over the EU’s decision-making process, and has served to deepen the divisions between the ambitions of the major European powers and the USA, in terms of their subordination to, or participation in, North American imperialism."
"Ever since the Middle Ages Turkey has been a large entity that is beset with problems."
"Today the most complicated issue in relation to Turkey is that of the criteria for measuring the country’s progress."
"One chapter of the accession negotiations has been closed, and it has undeniably been a success."
"A further 28 chapters remain open, however, without even mentioning the Copenhagen criteria."
"There are problems everywhere, including an electoral law that tramples on the freedoms of the citizens, women and national and religious minorities; inadequate infrastructure in the east of the country; tense relations with its neighbours; the employment structure; the manner in which the police and army investigate crime; and the occupation of part of an EU Member State."
"The process of implementing new laws will undoubtedly be a long and complicated one."
"On the other hand, I personally know a number of well-educated Turks and I know how enthusiastically they welcomed the opening of negotiations with the EU."
"Following the adoption of a number of amendments which remove the most urgent problems from the report on Turkey’s progress towards accession, it is unfortunately not acceptable to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"We therefore felt obliged to vote against the adopted wording."
". – Mr Eurlings’s report contained some excellent passages, particularly those concerning the Armenian genocide - which the Turkish authorities refuse to acknowledge - the economic blockade imposed on Armenia and the refusal to recognise Cyprus, a Member State of the European Union."
"Just one of those elements ought to lead us to the conclusion that the negotiations concerning Turkey’s accession to the European Union must be stopped."
"Not only does the rapporteur not come to this conclusion, but, more importantly, he does not mention the following obvious fact: Turkey is not a European country."
"95% of its territory is in Asia; its capital, Ankara, is in the heart of Asia Minor; and, with the Christian communities having been wiped out during the 20th century, 99% of its population belongs to the Muslim world."
"Turkey therefore has no reason to join the European Union."
"This obvious fact, which is acknowledged by the people of Europe, particularly in France and Austria, is not acknowledged by those who govern us."
"This morning’s vote illustrates this divide: not only did the majority of our Parliament vote in favour of Turkey’s accession, but they also rejected paragraph 49 calling for the recognition of the Armenian genocide, thus bowing to Turkey’s wishes."
"– Despite the fact that the Eurlings report is critical regarding Turkey’s accession to the European Union, in particular by calling for the recognition of the Armenian genocide, it does not go so far as to call into question this accession."
"It is true that the European Commission, Mr Chirac and the British, as the main champions of the Ottoman regime, are there to prevent any wayward paths or measures being taken that are likely to delay or prevent accession."
"We, for our part, have not changed according to the circumstances and to the fluctuations in the Turkish Government, which blows hot and cold with the negotiators from the European Commission and the main Member States."
"We are against Turkey’s joining the EU as a matter of principle."
"Turkey is not a European country and does not meet any of the Copenhagen criteria, which are meant to define a country’s accession to the European Union."
"The negotiations should move in the direction of privileged partner status by maintaining the visa requirement for Turkish nationals, as is the case at present."
"Turkey will not join the EU without the people of Europe’s approval."
"As defenders of the people of France, we will protect their interests, which hinge, among other things, on the rejection of Turkey’s accession to Europe."
"– I have always felt that Turkey’s entry into the EU could not be considered within the present context of European integration."
"I advocate a Europe that is comprised of three circles."
"The first circle consists of a federal nucleus, with countries that share ambitious social objectives and the desire for a ‘powerful Europe’, a player on the international stage."
"The second circle groups together the existing 27 countries of the EU."
"In view of the difficulties and of the crucial need to consolidate this circle, any further enlargement must be ruled out."
"The third circle must set up a close, global partnership with neighbouring countries in the Balkans, the Mediterranean and elsewhere."
"I would emphasise the importance of close partnerships with the Mediterranean region that treat Turkey and the Maghreb - as areas of the world with which our Europe has forged long-standing and important links – equally."
"I therefore abstained from all of the votes except for the one on the recognition of the Armenian genocide, which Parliament has always defended, and I did so to prevent anyone from thinking that I had any reason, in principle, to be prejudiced against Turkey."
"This is a different view of Europe."
". – We voted against this text. It levels a criticism at Turkey, which, when all is said and done, is very unfair: that of being Turkey, that is to say of not being European."
"What is the use of plying this country with recommendations and demands?"
"The people of Europe do not want Turkey to join, because the evidence is right there in front of them: Turkey – and this is not intended as an insult to the country – is not part of the European family."
"It has its own culture, its own values and its own sphere of influence."
"That is the meaning behind the amendment that we have tabled on behalf of the Independence and Democracy Group."
"We must now put a stop to the hypocritical and devastating game of accession negotiations, which can only end in a major crisis, since the potential accession treaty has no chance of being ratified by the people, and particularly by the people of France, where the referendum procedure will be obligatory."
"Let us spare a thought today for our French fellow Members, who are suffering from a bout of full-blown schizophrenia."
"Even though they claim to be against Turkey’s accession, they vote, each year, in this House and in the French Parliament, in favour of Turkey’s receiving pre-accession appropriations, and they have welcomed within their own European party – the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – observers from the AKP, the Islamic party led by Mr Erdogan."
"I welcome this report on the accession of Turkey."
"The report commends the opening of the active phase of negotiations and the completion of the first chapter of science and technology as well as the resumption of legislative change in Turkey through the ninth package of legislative reform."
"Despite welcoming all of these advancements, I regret the fact that Turkey has not fully addressed the Cyprus issue."
"The Cyprus issue needs to be settled conclusively before Turkish accession; it is essential that Turkey recognises all Member States of the European Union."
"Sinn Féin looks forward to Turkey joining the EU, if it decides to do so, on the same basis as other countries did including the respect for human rights, civil government, acceptance of the political rights of the Kurdish population and the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus."
"We welcome today’s decision by the European Parliament to recognise that the resolution of the problem caused by Turkey’s occupation of part of Cyprus is a major issue which must be dealt with before Turkey can join the EU."
"While believing Parliament’s position fell short of what it should have done on the question of the rights of the Kurdish population in Turkey, we are also glad to see the plight of the Kurdish population in Turkey being raised as a key issue in the accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU."
". Negotiations with Turkey are in the interest of the Kurds, Armenians, religious minorities and political prisoners."
"They are also important to the millions of Europeans of Turkish origin, who will feel confirmed as equal EU citizens as a result."
"I hope that those negotiations will eventually lead to a democratic, multi-ethnic and multi-religious Turkey that lives in peace with all its neighbours."
"This seems unlikely for the foreseeable future."
"Chances are that the negotiations will soon run aground as a result of the delay in Cyprus’ federalisation and the ongoing tensions between Turkey and Cyprus that result from that."
"Moreover, there are forces at work within Turkey that persistently refuse to accept equal rights for differing cultures or opinions, and consider any accommodation with the Kurds and Armenians as an attack on Turkey’s honour."
"If Turkey is eventually to accede, it will probably take thirty years of negotiations interspersed with many interruptions."
"Anyone who wishes to accelerate this process in order to equip Europe with a larger army or more cheap labour will leave Turkey’s democratic forces and its disadvantaged people in the lurch."
"Accepting an unchanged Turkey will lower the standard of democracy and human rights in Europe and will make the EU even more a cause of public contention."
"I voted in favour of the report despite the endorsement contained therein of full Member States status as the ultimate objective, and, in a roll-call vote, together with the other CDU/CSU MEPs, expressed our repudiation of the idea that Turkey should be a full Member State."
"The realistic and critical view taken by the report of the situation in Turkey makes it appropriate that it should be adopted."
"It notes that, from the very outset of accession negotiations, Turkey has not by a long way met the Copenhagen criteria in such core areas as human rights and freedom of religion."
"It also speaks in plain terms of the failure to come to terms with what happened to the Armenians in Turkey."
"It is inconceivable that Turkey should become a Member State of the EU without facing up to the facts of history."
"The report also calls for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue; if Turkey continues to deny Cyprus recognition, the EU must suspend the accession talks."
"Turkish accession would overstretch, and therefore weaken, the EU."
"European unification has been a success story so far, and can continue to be one only if the EU remains strong."
"A Europe without political or geographical contours is a Europe that the public reject."
"Enlargement must not be seen as an automatic process."
"We want Turkey to be an important partner alongside the EU, and it is for that reason that we advocate a privileged partnership as an alternative to full membership."
"– I voted in favour of the Eurlings report on Turkey's progress towards accession to the European Union because I am in favour of Turkey's European prospects."
"However, Turkey's leadership should put into practice – and quickly – the undertakings which it made in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria."
"The European Parliament is rightly insisting on real compliance by Turkey with European standards and rejects pressure from the Washington/London axis for à la carte concessions, especially for Turkey."
"I am especially satisfied because amendments seeking to play down the Cyprus question were rejected and the amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left highlighting the need for a policy to resolve the Kurd question were approved."
"The Turkish leadership needs to implement the undertakings it has made under a specific roadmap."
"It is absurd for a country wishing to join the Union not to respect European principles in practice."
". The debate on Turkey’s possible accession to the EU should take place transparently and clearly and without any blackmail on either side."
"Accordingly, it must be made abundantly clear that this needs to be an open process in which the final outcome has not been pre-decided."
"Furthermore, it must be acknowledged from the outset that this is not only about Turkey honouring a series of criteria without which accession would be impossible, but also about the EU being in a position to receive and absorb Turkey."
"On the other hand, as I noted at the beginning of this negotiation stage, I feel that a negotiation in which one of the parties does not recognise the other in its entirety, as in the case of Turkey towards Cyprus and, by extension, the EU, is a negotiation that has got off on the wrong foot and that suffers from severe shortcomings."
"Lastly, this process has a great deal of potential in terms of promoting economic openness, development, democracy and respect for human rights in Turkey and this should not go to waste."
"The worst outcome of this process would be a chasm developing between Turkey and the EU."
". – Yes, I ended up voting in favour of this report on the accession of Turkey."
"I did so with a heavy heart, or something approaching it."
"We have confirmed the vote that took place within the Committee on Foreign Affairs on many points: we regret the slowing down of the reforms and highlight the persistent violations in relation to freedom of expression, religious freedom, minority rights, women’s rights and even cultural rights."
"We are very clear as regards the Cyprus question."
"We maintain above all that, if accession is the aim of the negotiations, then it will in no circumstances be automatic."
"That is why I voted in favour of the amendments to the rapporteur’s text."
"Why, then, do I have this huge regret?"
"Because of the issue of the Armenian genocide, whereby Parliament has blatantly gone back on what it voted for previously."
"By yielding to the pressure of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and others, plenary has just taken a step backwards: we are no longer calling on Turkey to recognise the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite for accession."
"This is an unacceptable U-turn that sends out what is, in my view, a disastrous signal to the negotiators: Parliament is eating its words, losing its memory and, even more seriously, losing sight of its duty to remember."
"Mr President, I welcome this realistic report, though do think it could have been stronger."
"I in principle support Turkey’s eventual accession provided they have taken reform seriously and faced up to their past."
"I do not believe that they have, and it is up to us to keep the pressure up."
"On the recognition of the Armenian genocide and on treatment of the Kurds in particular I believe this report could have been more uncompromising, though on balance I support the findings and congratulate our rapporteur on a major piece of work."
"I have decided to abstain from the final vote on the own-initiative report by Mr Eurlings on Turkey's progress towards accession."
"This is because I do not feel that such a report is appropriate or relevant given that the European Commission, which is responsible for following Turkey’s progress towards accession, has not yet published its report."
"The European Commission alone has the competence to judge the progress made by Turkey."
"What is more, the Eurlings report struck me as imbalanced."
"The efforts that this report requires of Turkey on a number of subjects, including freedom of expression, the rights of minorities and women’s rights, are of course essential. However, the report gives very little recognition to the advances made by Turkey in the area of the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"Since submitting its application, Turkey has been making substantial efforts to comply with the accession criteria; admittedly, there is still much progress to be made, but it is on the right track."
"The amendments adopted during the plenary session, in particular those from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament removing the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prior condition to accession, have gone some way to redressing the imbalance of the Eurlings report."
"However, I was not completely satisfied by this."
"Recognising that Turkey’s accession negotiations will take many years and that substantial reform is needed, there are many elements of the Eurlings report that I can support."
"Nevertheless, the report is excessively negative and very unbalanced, particularly in relation to the Cyprus issue, where there is no recognition of Turkish Cypriot support for the Annan Plan or of the EU’s unfulfilled promise to end the isolation of Northern Cyprus."
"There is also no call for any constructive movement on the part of the Republic of Cyprus, which is left to determine the pace of Turkey’s accession negotiations (according to recital B) and whose interests even intrude into NATO, where Turkey is then blamed for making difficulties (paragraph 54)."
"Furthermore, future enlargement of the EU is specifically linked to the revival of the EU constitutional process, to which I fundamentally object."
"On this basis I abstained."
".I decided to abstain from voting on the Eurlings report, even though it is a harsh report."
"Admittedly, it marks a turning point in terms of our becoming aware of the reality of the relations between the EU and Turkey, but by implying and confirming, after the rejection of certain amendments, that accession is an end in itself, it remains too unilateral."
"The undeniable slowing down of the reforms in Turkey, despite the Commission’s opening accession negotiations, should, on the contrary, give added weight to the option of a privileged partnership."
"The fact that the opening of these negotiations has not speeded up the reforms is worrying, and our response must consist of a demand for results and not of the idea that accession will take place no matter what."
"That is why it was necessary to point out that the normalisation of relations with Cyprus must be a prerequisite for any accession."
"The fact that Turkey has still not ratified and implemented the Ankara Protocol, which is a minimum - only just acceptable - legal form of recognition, is inadmissible."
"Finally, I endorsed the amendment on the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite for this possible accession, because we are not talking here about a symbolic point but about a moral obligation and a historic demand that are incumbent on the Turkish authorities."
"Turkey has a very long way to go before EU membership can be an imminent possibility."
"I have previously voted against beginning membership negotiations with Turkey because it will be a very long time before it meets the requirements for EU membership."
"It is not possible to maintain a negotiating process over a 20-year period."
"The pressure to relax the membership requirements would be in danger of becoming irresistible."
"It is important to make clear demands of Turkey."
"The Copenhagen human rights criteria must be fulfilled. The sovereignty of Cyprus must be respected, and the 1915 genocide of Armenians and Syrians/Assyrians must be acknowledged."
"Before Turkish membership of the EU can become an imminent possibility, the voting strength of each Member State must be changed so that a small number of densely populated Member States will not dominate the EU’s decision-making."
"The financial consequences of possible Turkish membership of the EU must be investigated carefully."
"The EU’s common agricultural policy and regional policy must be reformed before Turkey can become a member of the EU."
"The EU’s budget should be limited to one per cent of the Member States’ total GNI, and possible Turkish membership should not lead to that ceiling being exceeded."
"It is important to note that the fact that negotiations with Turkey have been embarked on does not automatically mean that Turkey will become a member of the EU."
"That concludes this item."
"– The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Darfur."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is concerned about recent developments in Sudan, especially the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Darfur."
"The Presidency, together with EU High Representative Javier Solana, has been working closely with EU partners and the international community to try and set common objectives and to cooperate in order to build lasting peace in Darfur."
"Furthermore, Pekka Haavisto, who was appointed EU Special Representative for Sudan in summer 2005, is continuing to monitor the general situation in Sudan and the coordination of EU action, and to take part in discussions with Sudan in his capacity as EU representative."
"The Darfur Peace Agreement, which was signed in May by the Sudanese Government and Minni Minnawi’s rebel troops, the Sudanese Liberation Movement, was regarded as an opportunity for peace."
"The Peace Agreement was expected to end the three-year long conflict, which has claimed almost 300 000 lives and driven more than two million people into exile."
"Four months on, however, security and the humanitarian situation in the region are rapidly deteriorating."
"Violent attacks on villages and refugee camps, both in and outside the country, have increased, particularly in the last few months."
"The Sudanese Government has reinforced its military presence in Darfur."
"Both the Sudanese Government troops and the rebels are in breach of the ceasefire agreements."
"Owing to deteriorating security, the number of refugees and people in need of humanitarian aid has gone up."
"At the same time, it has become harder for humanitarian aid to get through, with help reaching only around 50% of those who need it."
"If the Darfur Peace Agreement were implemented – and barely any progress has been made on this – it would have an immediate impact on the lives of some six million Darfurians."
"It would make it possible for the refugees to return to their homes and a normal life."
"It would make it possible for agriculture to get going, which would help ensure a supply of food, and for schools and healthcare to be established, and it would help guarantee the basic essentials of life, to name just some of the benefits."
"All this depends on improved security."
"In order to ensure that the Darfur Peace Agreement is viable and that it can be implemented, the groups that have not signed up to the pact need to be included in the peace process."
"In order to improve security, it is vital that the parties involved in the conflict commit to the ceasefire and that the ceasefire is monitored."
"The EU has repeatedly called on the parties involved in the conflict to comply with their obligations under the Peace Agreement and the Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement signed in N’Djamena in 2004."
"The European Union, and in particular its special representative, Mr Haavisto, has also been active in trying to involve those not party to the Agreement in the peace process, and to persuade them to sign up to the Darfur Peace Agreement."
"The European Union is worried about the effects of the Darfur conflict on the peace process in Sudan as a whole."
"The conflict will have serious repercussions for regional stability in East Africa and the Horn of Africa, especially in Chad and the Central African Republic."
"To support the Darfur peace process, in 2004 the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) was set up."
"The EU has supported AMIS since the launch of its operation through the African Peace Facility (APF)."
"In all, the Union’s financial support for the AMIS operation has added up to around EUR 242 million."
"In addition, the Union has provided material, logistic and planning aid and support, as well as personnel."
"The Member States have also lent support to the operation with major bilateral contributions."
"AMIS, the first peacekeeping operation in the history of the African Union, has done excellent work in extremely difficult circumstances."
"Its capacity and resources are nevertheless insufficient to confront the enormous challenges that Darfur presents."
"In spite of the huge sums of money from the EU, the operation has also had serious financial problems."
"From this, it is clear that the only possible and realistic solution to peacekeeping in Darfur is a UN operation."
"The EU strongly supports Resolution 1706 adopted by the UN Security Council on 31 August."
"This expands the UNMIS peacekeeping operation’s mandate in South Sudan to cover Darfur, to continue the work begun by AMIS."
"The main task of the UN operation would be to support the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement."
"The protection of civilians and monitoring the ceasefire would be essential elements in the operation’s mandate."
"As AMIS’s biggest supporter, the European Union is very concerned that the Sudanese Government has not agreed to the UN operation in Darfur."
"The UN operation is vital to improve security in Darfur and to implement the Peace Agreement in a way that is sustainable."
"Darfur cannot, however, be left in a ‘security vacuum’."
"For that reason, the EU takes a positive view of the decision taken by the African Union in New York on 20 September that AMIS’s mandate should be extended until the end of the year."
"The EU has undertaken to provide AMIS with support during this ‘transition stage’ too."
"The EU is still insisting that the Sudanese Government should agree to AMIS coming under the supervision of the UN, in accordance with UN Resolution 1706."
"On more than one occasion, the Union has expressed its concern about this issue and has discussed it with the Sudanese Government."
"The EU has also urged other international players to take action to convince the Sudanese Government of the usefulness and necessity of the UN operation for the peace process in Sudan generally."
"It was with this in mind that the Finnish Presidency, EU High Representative Javier Solana, EU Special Representative Pekka Haavisto and the Member States discussed the matter in depth at their meeting during the Ministerial Week at the UN General Assembly in New York."
"The EU is very anxious about human rights violations in Darfur."
"In particular, women and children have been the victims of physical violence, including rape."
"The Union backs the work of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights to improve the human rights situation."
"The EU has repeatedly reminded the Sudanese Government of its responsibility to protect its citizens from all forms of violence and to guarantee respect for human rights."
"The EU is one of the main providers of assistance in the reconstruction work following the civil war in Sudan."
"At the Oslo Donors’ Conference on Sudan in April 2005, the Commission and the Member States together promised substantial aid to cover immediate needs and start reconstruction."
"When the Darfur peace process starts in earnest, the EU is also prepared to aid reconstruction in Darfur."
"The Union will also give Sudan and Darfur substantial humanitarian aid."
"It is important that the EU should have a conspicuous and active role in Sudan and Darfur."
"The situation in Sudan and Darfur is one of the most crucial issues with regard to Africa and the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and will stay high up on the agenda during the Finnish EU Presidency."
"The matter will also be raised at all the main conferences and meetings with third parties, including high-level meetings."
"If no proper action is taken, Darfur will be at risk of getting caught in a new spiral of violence."
"And that is something we cannot afford."
"."
"Mr President, Mrs Lehtomäki, as everyone is aware, we are at a critical moment in Darfur."
"The humanitarian tragedy is continuing and even worsening, resulting in more death and suffering."
"Darfur is liable at any moment to lapse back into all-out war, with unpredictable and incalculable consequences for the stability of both the country and the region."
"The peace in the south of Sudan could be jeopardised."
"Several neighbouring countries, such as Chad, the Central African Republic and Uganda, and even countries further afield, such as Somalia and the Republic of Congo, could be forced to suffer the effects of this."
"Although we are at the height of the crisis, there is still a chance to avoid the worst of it, and to restore peace and stability."
"The Commission takes a positive view of the decision taken by the African Union to extend its mandate until 31 December."
"That will help prevent a security vacuum in Darfur, at a time when violence is erupting once again and when the process launched by the Abuja peace agreements is at a standstill."
"We regret, however, that the Sudanese Government has not yet accepted Security Council Resolution 1706, which defines the framework within which the African Union’s military responsibilities would be transferred to the United Nations."
"It must be pointed out that the African Union itself had already decided on this transfer back in March. The Commission regards this transfer as key to the restoration of peace in Darfur."
"It is therefore important to convince Khartoum to accept it."
"There can be no peace in Darfur if Khartoum does not agree to the transfer, and especially not if it opposes it."
"Khartoum has denounced this transfer by speaking of a plot devised by the West."
"At times, there has also been talk of a Zionist plot."
"This is unfounded."
"There is no agenda on the part of the international community to undermine Sudanese sovereignty or, worse still, to overthrow the Sudanese regime."
"This shows just how urgent it is, on both sides, to succeed in swiftly re-establishing a calm dialogue on Darfur and on the issue of the transfer, in order to resolve the misunderstandings that could still exist in relation to this matter."
"That is the main purpose of the current intense diplomatic activity in which the Commission is taking part."
"Let us remember that the aim of the transfer of responsibilities from the African Union to the United Nations is to restore security and stability in Darfur, as well as to protect its civilians and to enable the humanitarian organisations to carry out their work."
"It must be pointed out that 13 humanitarian workers have been killed over the last few months."
"This transfer is key to restoring a climate of confidence among the protagonists and to enabling the Abuja peace agreement genuinely to be relaunched for Darfur; to making the non-signatory States sign; to supporting the actual implementation of the agreement; and to preventing the structure resulting from the North-South peace agreement from being undermined."
"All of these aspects are also in Khartoum’s interests."
"The present excessive talk, like the increased fighting, lead nowhere."
"Those extremists who think they can win by following the worst-case scenario and radicalisation approach are mistaken."
"They are greatly mistaken."
"This approach can only backfire on them."
"The conclusions of the last General Affairs Council send out a very clear and very firm message both to the rebels and to Khartoum regarding their own responsibility."
"The Commission believes that there is still a possibility of de-escalation and a space in which a genuine dialogue can be resumed."
"It is important to act quickly, however, before this space closes up."
"It is in this frame of mind and with a desire to listen that Mr Barroso of the European Commission and my fellow Commissioner, Mr Michel, intend shortly to travel to Khartoum and meet President Bashir with the aim of taking forward the process of transition from the African Union to the United Nations and of relaunching the Abuja peace process."
". – Mr President, those people who have managed to survive in Darfur are in a desperate situation, with Janjaweed militias continuing to attack and destroy villages, torturing, raping, and compelling new recruits to join them on a daily basis."
"There are parts of Darfur that international aid organisations can no longer reach."
"The Sudanese Government ought to be discharging its obligation to protect its own people, but its intentions are the very opposite, and its latest military offensive constitutes a breach of the Darfur peace agreement."
"I would like to give voice to my fear that what the government probably wishes to do is to pursue its strategy of destruction and expulsion to the very end."
"In this situation, it is absolutely vital that the international community should implement UN Security Council resolution 1706, which opened the way to the deployment of up to 25 000 UN troops."
"The African Union, which has done everything it possibly can, is also in favour of a relief by UN troops, but it is of course important that it should be given every possible support – as it has been to date – until that happens. I have to say that that is, quite frankly, in my view, no more than the second-best solution, for the UN troops really need to be there right now."
"A particular responsibility rests not only on the members of the Security Council, but also, and primarily, on those powers that can exercise a veto in it, for their responsibility is to the world at large, and they must not be guided solely by their own national interests."
"It is with this in mind that I would like to make a particular appeal to China, which, on 11 September, together with the EU, confirmed that – and this I shall quote in English:"
"‘Leaders emphasised that transition from EU to United Nation operations would be conducive to peace in Darfur.’"
"– We therefore call on China to bring its influence to bear in Sudan in order that the stationing of UN troops in Darfur may be agreed to without delay."
"Mr President, I have to say that in both the Council and Commission statements I detect a rather worrying element of complacency."
"You cannot talk of working with General Bashir and hoping that in the future we can persuade him."
"I have followed the situation in Sudan for many years and I can confirm that would not be realistic at this time in particular."
"The future of the people of Darfur is now in the balance, just as much as it was before the agreement on maintaining the AU force until 30 September 2006."
"The government of Khartoum is answerable to nobody."
"It is patently failing to allow humanitarian access to some three million people in Darfur."
"What will the international community do?"
"You are not telling me what you will do to hold the government in Khartoum to account."
"In three months, or even earlier, the UN force must be ready to deploy, because the AU will start to pull out."
"The confusion about the future of the African Union is very serious: it is underfunded, overstretched and finding it very difficult to operate."
"A United Nations force must be deployed as quickly as possible, with a stronger mandate than it has now, and it must be capable of protecting the vulnerable and traumatised people of Darfur who are currently under such terrible threat."
"No deadlines have been met by the Sudanese."
"Their genocidal strategy is moving forward."
"There is no ceasefire to monitor any more."
"It is pointless to talk about the peace agreement: it is finished."
"We said ‘never again’ in 1994 after Rwanda, and what we face now is the first genocide of the 21st century, unless we end this complacency and do something."
"You talked about the key players."
"There are key players: China, Russia and the Arab League are also complicit in this."
"One last important point: you did not talk about the need for the imposition of a no-fly zone."
"There have been 13 UN resolutions, each of which has called for a no-fly zone."
"Not for a moment has this been imposed."
"What are you going to do, Council, what are you going to do, Commission, to ensure that those Antonov planes do not continue to fly over the villages of Darfur dropping bombs on those innocent civilians?"
"I urge you to think seriously about the imposition of a no-fly zone."
"Could you not consider using the French jets that are currently in neighbouring Chad to monitor the airspace and stop the Sudanese from terrorising the people of Darfur?"
". – Mr President, for three years now, and under the gaze of a powerless international community, Darfur has been the victim of a terrible tragedy."
"As you have said, the conflict has caused the deaths of 300 000 civilians."
"Two million people – or one third of the population - have been displaced within Darfur; 200 000 have crossed the border in order to flee to Chad."
"Three million people are entirely dependent on international food aid."
"Each day, children and families are attacked, displaced and killed."
"The humanitarian crisis is getting worse."
"In the majority of Darfur, humanitarian organisations are banned from coming to the aid of some 350 000 people who need medicines and food."
"Owing to the state of malnutrition and lack of water, cholera and hepatitis E epidemics are multiplying in the camps."
"Those in charge of the NGOs are they themselves also victims of this conflict: twelve of them have been killed in the last two months."
"Insufficient as it is, the peace agreement signed in Abuja on 5 May has not helped to end the violence but has, on the contrary, given rise to a fresh outbreak of violence."
"The fighting and the civilian massacres have resumed."
"100 000 people have had to flee the violence since May."
"Thousands of soldiers from the Sudanese army have been deployed once again in the region, and the aerial bombardments have resumed."
"In the meantime, more than two million people are trying to survive, cooped up in camps, surrounded by their enemies and regularly attacked."
"Hundreds of women are raped each month as soon as they leave the camp and walk a few metres to go and find some wood to burn for heating or to use for food."
"The only job that these millions of people used to have was that of working the land; they now find themselves deprived of this basic right and are reduced to cultivating – when they can – a few dozen square metres around the camps, running the risk of being attacked by the very people who destroyed their villages."
"They are all 100% dependent on international aid, which is not particularly generous."
"Some months, the food rations are halved, because there are no subsidies, because the donors did not materialise."
"These camps, ladies and gentlemen, are truly open-air prisons."
"We can no longer remain indifferent to what is happening in Darfur."
"Europe has a humanitarian, political and moral duty to impose peace in this part of the world."
"There can be no military solution to the Darfur crisis."
"There is an urgent need to reopen a negotiating space and to work on a political agreement to which all of the parties concerned would fully contribute."
"That is essential if the population of Darfur is to support the peace process."
"This agreement will have to provide for the people of Darfur to be represented at the various levels of government, for a genuine guarantee that the Janjaweed militias will be disarmed and for a guarantee that the two million displaced persons and the 200 000 refugees will be able to return safely to their lands."
"We also call for humanitarian officials to be guaranteed free and secure access to all of the conflict zones, and we appeal to the Commission and to the Council to ensure that the European Union significantly increases its humanitarian aid."
"We also call on the Sudanese Government to end its armed offensive and to immediately accept the Security Council decision to deploy a UN peacekeeping operation with the aim of putting a stop to the violence."
"It is now that Darfur needs Europe."
"We here, in the European Parliament, do not have the right to turn our backs on this issue."
". – Mr President, unfortunately, where Darfur is concerned, the resolutions and the declarations have been following on from one another for several years now with, it would seem, little to no success."
"As has been pointed out, the abuses continue, the acts of violence are on the increase and the women and children are the main victims of these crimes and these atrocities."
"This situation is totally unbearable."
"Faced with that, there seems to be a growing sense of powerlessness or fatalism, but we have a duty to get involved now so that we can make genuine progress on the ground."
"In fact, the more time that goes by, the more the government in Khartoum thinks that it can act with impunity and says to itself that, in the end, by digging its heels in and by gaining time, it will achieve its ends."
"If we want to act, then, it seems that there are three priorities to fulfil."
"Firstly, the top priority is to gain access to the refugees because, right now, thousands of people are in fact suffering from hunger and violence, and no one can gain access to these populations: it is this situation that must be improved as a matter of urgency."
"The second priority is the fight against impunity."
"It is unacceptable that, despite the declarations and the vague desire for sanctions, nothing has ended up being done."
"The criminals and those who are growing considerably richer continue to go about their business as though nothing were wrong, and little has been done in that regard."
"The third and final priority is, of course, the establishment, as quickly as possible, of a United Nations force that can go and strengthen that of the African Union, which is all the same playing an important role that should be consolidated."
"So, admittedly, here we are now obliged to call on China and Russia to play a positive role in this affair, even though everyone knows that China and Russia are perhaps not examples of the ideal to aspire to when it comes to respect for human rights or for the populations affected by such conflicts."
"Furthermore, we must, at the same time, call for a general dialogue, as the previous speaker pointed out."
"Finally, I have a few words to say about the role of oil in this affair."
"We are not burying our heads in the sand."
"We know only too well that oil stirs up conflicts, excites envy, enables people to buy weapons and also leads to standstills, particularly on the part of China - which has very important interests in that area – and of all those, and the superpowers in particular, that are now searching ever more feverishly for oil resources to which they can have easy access."
"We will therefore have to integrate this issue of access to oil into a much broader, European and international, context."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the humanitarian and political situation in Darfur is getting worse from one day to the next."
"According to Jan Egeland, the UN coordinator for humanitarian aid, the humanitarian situation has deteriorated since 2004: entire regions of Darfur have been left without any humanitarian personnel because the Khartoum government is preventing international agencies from gaining access."
"The persecution of the civilian population by the notorious Janjaweed – armed gangs financed and supported by the Sudanese central government – now looks very much like genocide."
"The international community cannot just stand by and look on, now that the forces sent in by the Organisation for African Unity to protect the civilian population have practically failed."
"Their lack of any political and military credibility is now beyond doubt."
"That is why we support UN intervention under Security Council Resolution 1706, which the Sudanese Government stubbornly disregards."
"The peacekeeping troops proposed under Resolution 1706 now need to be deployed in order to protect hundreds of thousands of women, men and children who for too long have been suffering attacks from the Janjaweed, even though previous UN resolutions have rightly called for them to be disbanded."
"It would be even better, of course, if the Sudanese Government approved the deployment of the UN force;"
"I hope it will, and I also think that the Arab League countries should put more effective pressure on Khartoum to accept the UN resolution."
"At the same time, however, any kind of Sudanese veto against the United Nations would be unacceptable: there are hundreds of thousands of innocent lives at stake, and we need to do something for them."
"Otherwise, the entire credibility of the international community will be called into question."
"It is therefore crucial that the UN be allowed to send its humanitarian personnel into the whole Darfur region; otherwise it will be impossible for humanitarian aid to be distributed properly."
"Sudan has to realise that it must cooperate with the United Nations in order to be fully accepted into the international community."
"."
"Mr President, there certainly is unity in this Chamber this afternoon on what should be done regarding Darfur."
"Three hundred thousand people have been killed and two and a half million driven from their homes."
"In the last month alone, 50 000 people have been driven from their homes."
"This really is a human catastrophe on a massive scale."
"The only solution is to put in place a proper United Nations force with a very clear mandate."
"The only way we can get that is through aggressive diplomacy."
"How can it take 30 days, a period of time criticised at that stage as too lengthy, to get a UN force in place in Lebanon, yet with Darfur we are talking about three years?"
"It is because we are not as committed to this problem as we should be."
"Yes, people blame the Sudanese Government, and it is to blame."
"Its crimes have been outlined by previous speakers so I will not go over them."
"It is hiding, for trade reasons, behind the governments in China, Russia, India and Malaysia, which said that they would protect the Sudanese Government and veto sanctions against it."
"We must put pressure on these governments to make sure that they do not allow this to happen."
"They and everybody must help to try to stop what is happening in Darfur."
"It is an absolute catastrophe."
"We need a UN peacekeeping force at least 20 000 strong on the ground in Darfur if we are going to stop it."
"The present force of 7000 African Union troops is ill-equipped and, when you consider that the area they are covering is the size of France, it is quite impossible for them to police it."
"A proper UN force is needed and it is needed quickly with a proper mandate."
"Sudan requires a political solution very fast."
"The UN and the EU must act."
"We must confront genocide and do everything we can to facilitate peace in the region."
"It has been ignored for too long, it is an absolute outrage and the Government in Khartoum cannot be allowed to get away with it any longer."
"It cannot hide behind other countries which say that they will veto any action taken against Sudan."
"We must act to make sure what is happening is stopped."
"– Mr President, there is no doubt about it: the Darfur crisis is the result of the government’s policy of Arabisation, as well as of its willingness to arm the militias engaged in the civil war in southern Sudan."
"The results of that policy are to be seen – as already emphasised in this debate – in innumerable deaths and millions driven from their homes, leaving swathes of land unpopulated."
"Despite that, President Omar al-Bashir denounces it as a lie that Sudanese Arabs are attacking Sudanese black Africans, and claims that human rights organisations that decry the present state of affairs are doing so only in the hope of attracting more donations."
"It is evident, then, that what Sudan would prefer is to be left to itself and its civil war."
"The best hope is that it will agree to the extension of the mandate for a peace mission by the African Union, although those with inside knowledge describe this as not only badly equipped and under-motivated, but also – quite simply – as completely out of its depth."
"Although the deployment of the UN’s 'blue helmets' promises to bring much greater success, this is rejected as neo-colonialism."
"Perhaps, then, this genocide might be halted if there were an agreement to send a multinational peace-keeping force composed of Africans and Muslims, in other words a joint intervention by African Union and UN troops."
"Mr President, Darfur continues to be a humanitarian crisis."
"More than a quarter of a million innocent people have been killed since 2003, and a further 2.5 million people have been displaced."
"The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1706 last month calling for the deployment of more than 22 000 peacekeepers in the region."
"However, the Government of Sudan remains opposed to such a force, accusing the UN of an exercise in neo-colonialism manipulated by Washington."
"This is nonsense talk and it is nothing more than the Sudanese Government playing politics with people’s lives."
"The mandate of the African Union Mission in Sudan has been extended so that the UN now has three more months in which to reach an agreement with the Sudanese Government on the need for a more effective multilateral force to protect civilians."
"However, in the likely scenario of Sudan’s continuing to resist UN efforts, the UN must take a stronger stance."
"The UN may need to consider, for example, military intervention under Chapter 7, given its responsibility to protect civilians where national authorities fail to save their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and/or crimes against humanity."
"The Sudanese Government has shown no willingness to protect internally displaced persons."
"In fact, there is strong evidence to suggest that it has assisted and sponsored attacks on refugee camps."
"For the time being, support for the 7000-strong AU force is essential and the UN has agreed to give logistical and material support."
"The Arab League has finally pledged some economic support and EU Member States also need to be generous in this regard."
"The EU has a responsibility to make Darfur an ongoing priority for the UN."
"More pressure is needed on China and Russia in particular to play a more positive role in Sudan."
"More civilians have died in Darfur than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined."
"We all have blood on our hands because of the slow international response to what has happened to date."
"This is the toughest resolution that we have seen on Darfur, but it is action that is needed."
"I hope we will not be looking back in a year’s time at another 100 000 dead."
"– Mr President, at this time when we still want – although I do not know whether we are able – to remain hopeful about the peace agreement signed in May, we are witnessing the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the region, which many other Members have already described."
"The European Parliament is once again issuing its opinion on the situation in Darfur and, in my particular case, I am adding my voice to that of the victims: the civil population, the women and the children of Darfur."
"Since the armed conflict broke out three years ago, the appeals from the humanitarian agencies have become increasingly desperate."
"They have been entirely in vain."
"The more than 50 000 dead, the two and a half million internally displaced and the 500 000 refugees illustrate the tragedy of a region in conflict better than anybody’s words could."
"In its resolution, my group introduced its grave concern about the violation of the rights of children and the generalised rape of women as a weapon of war."
"This has unfortunately not been included in the compromise resolution, as if it were of no importance."
"Hundreds of thousands of children killed, disappeared, sexually abused, kidnapped, displaced, used as soldiers and then abandoned etc. can be counted and identified and, furthermore, have no access to humanitarian aid."
"We are all to blame, not just the Khartoum government and the military and guerrilla factions."
"There is complete impunity despite the fact that Sudan had ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its optional protocol on children in armed conflicts."
"We also have specific data indicating that, last August, more than 200 women were sexually assaulted in one single camp, and that is something that humanitarian organisations had been warning us about."
"This information is telling us more and more about the infernal spiral into which Darfur is being plunged and in which, once again, the bodies of women and girls are often the favoured battleground of the soldiers and guerrillas."
"With regard to things that are happening today, in another camp of displaced people, rather than being protected, women have been raped and are being prevented from reaching …"
"Mr President, the situation in Darfur is extremely grave."
"The Government of Sudan is pouring its troops into the region and the extension of the African Union’s mandate by three months is only a breathing space."
"The population of Darfur still faces the prospect of so-called security being provided solely by the Sudanese Government, with no international protection."
"Those of us from Parliament who visited Darfur in 2004 saw with our own eyes razed houses scattered with empty shell cases."
"That was all that was left of a village bombed by the Sudanese Government in the name of security."
"Even as recently as last week, a Sudanese Government Antonov plane was bombing villages in north Darfur."
"If there is no international presence in Darfur there will be a total massacre, notwithstanding all the hand-wringing and assertions of ‘never again’ after Rwanda."
"That is why the presence of the UN force, as authorised by Resolution 1706, is so vital."
"There is no more urgent task for international diplomacy than to work with Russian and China to isolate Sudan and impose a UN presence in Darfur."
"The EU-China statement on 11 September was encouraging, but it needs to be built on."
"I would ask the Council what steps it is taking to achieve that."
"For its part, the African Union has said that an Africa-dominated UN force in Darfur is absolutely necessary."
"On the worsening humanitarian situation, a growing number of places have become no-go areas for NGOs because of the current fighting."
"At the same time, the number of people dependent upon humanitarian assistance has risen to nearly 3 million."
"This month more than 30 new cases of cholera have been reported."
"Without true peace, the humanitarian effort will collapse and hundreds of thousands of people who fled their homes to save their lives will now once again face death."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to repeat what has just been said about the situation in Darfur in all its frightful cruelty."
"What I do want to say right now is that I am less than convinced by what has been said by the presidency, the Minister, or, indeed, by Commissioner Frattini."
"For as long as those responsible within the European Union – by which I mean you, you in the Council and the Presidency – cannot even realise that what is going on at this very moment is genocide, and while you only talk about how we are going to play our part in reconstruction once peace is established, and so on and so forth, I wonder why you do not call this by its name, for what matters most of all is that this genocide – which is what is going on here – should be brought to a halt, and once that is done we can get on with the rebuilding work."
"There is a need for clarity, not least within the European Union, the dilemma in the Security Council is that China and Russia are preventing anything being done."
"It is clear, then, that the right of veto in the Security Council must be abolished."
"No country on earth must be allowed to use a veto to allow genocide to continue."
"Secondly – and this is something we Europeans can do – we have to spell out the fact that, under such tragic circumstances, the so-called sovereignty of the Sudanese state is very definitely negotiable."
"It is human security, the protection of human life, that is the ultimate good, rather than the alleged sovereignty of an undemocratic, brutal and failing state."
"Let us just recall the debates we had about sending troops to the Congo and then to the Lebanon – this time we are talking about 22 000 soldiers."
"We cannot respond to the news that there will be an extension until December by saying ‘hooray’ and hoping that by then 22 000 soldiers will have been found for a UN force; that will not work."
"It would mean that we would, until December, remain passive spectators of genocide and would only then get around to grappling with the issue, without having already done anything about it."
"Europe cannot adopt such a policy!"
"– Mr President, the situation in the Sudanese province of Darfur is quite obviously terrible."
"People are being driven from their homes, brutally, in what Jean Ziegler described as a ‘dreadful tragedy’, but it is pretty easy to say that troops should be sent, as provided for in the UN resolution."
"You all know what this UN Resolution says; it says that the Sudanese Government – as is customary – must give its consent, and that is precisely what the Sudanese Government is not going to do."
"What that means is that what is needed in this situation is a political solution rather than the calls for troops or for preparations for their deployment that we hear from within NATO."
"The European Union’s part in this really is what the Council and the Commission have described it as being."
"It is very easy to say that we want the troops."
"The problem is that there are certain ground rules that must be complied with, and they do indeed say that the relevant government must give its consent, and this one has not done so."
"I want to underline once more what the honourable lady Member from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance said; particularly in Southern Sudan, there are certain economic interests that play an essential part in this conflict – reference has already been made to oil – and this involves not only China, but also, without doubt, European states, such as the country from which I come, for Germany, too, is heavily involved because of the plans for the building of a major railway line there."
"The call for people to be helped sounds wonderful, then, and it is one that I certainly endorse, but it should be realistic and should actually result in more humanitarian aid being provided."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I would prefer not to speak at all, in protest at both your and our ineptitude."
"Yet China needs minerals, oil, markets, water and land."
"What we are witnessing is the Chinese colonisation of Africa."
"The Sudanese Government, a partner or constituent part of Al-Qaeda, longstanding home to Osama, staunch ally of Al-Tourabi, literally practices ethnic cleansing, raping and impregnating tens of thousands of women in the cause of Arab-ness and membership of the League of Arab States."
"The Russians supply the arms."
"The mission of the African Union has reached breaking point."
"Our glorious African intervention leaves two million people in exile and half a million dead."
"I should like to ask the Council and the Commission what they are doing in order to provide immediate support for a substantial United Nations mission under Chapter VII?"
"What actions are they taking to finally implement the no fly zone called for in 13 completely pointless resolutions?"
"What are they doing in order to ensure that they put an end to the impunity of all those who rape and kill completely innocent civilians?"
"It shames me that as a member of Parliament’s Investigation Committee I took on more responsibility when I visited Darfur and Abéché, and yet today all I can do is prattle on, if you will excuse the expression."
"Commissioner, imagine looking into the eyes of a young woman who is caring for a baby and asking her the child’s name."
"She cannot answer you and she says she does not know, because the child was born out of rape."
"How do you think you would feel?"
"– The al-Bashir Government has been the main perpetrator of the strategy of genocide against the people of Darfur."
"The EU cannot remain under any illusions on this issue."
"The Commission, the Council and the European members of the United Nations Security Council must, as a matter of urgency, confront Sudan by sending UN forces to the Darfur region with a robust mandate under Chapter VII of the Charter."
"There can be no more excuses or dithering."
"The Sudanese Government must be punished if they persist in thwarting the efforts of the international community in Darfur."
"As a matter of urgency, bank accounts must be frozen, and members of the Sudanese Government and others already identified by the International Criminal Court as being the ringleaders of the atrocities must be prevented from travelling."
"If China and Russia continue to drag their feet as regards an embargo on Khartoum, the EU must get together with the United States and declare a trade embargo, especially on weapons and oil, and a complete freeze on the financial transactions of the Sudanese Government."
"Military measures are also urgently required."
"A no-fly zone over Darfur could be operated from eastern Chad to block the Sudanese air force from attacking the population of Darfur, as I and other Members of this Chamber witnessed near Al Fashir in September 2004."
"A multinational force must be sent immediately to eastern Chad to protect the refugees, to prepare the UN force in Darfur, to control the border between Chad and Sudan and to restore some stability in the region."
"That stability is also threatened by the heightened tensions in Somalia on account of the Ethiopian intervention instigated by the Bush Administration, which has had the disastrous outcome of strengthening the Islamic courts in Mogadishu."
"Lastly, the EU must not remain silent over the role of China, Russia and the Arab League in supporting Khartoum’s strategy of genocide."
"After the UN enshrined the principle of the responsibility to protect, Moscow, Beijing and Arab capitals have shamed themselves by seeking to sweep the lessons of Rwanda, Bosnia and Congo under the carpet when it comes to Darfur, where a Muslim population is being massacred by Muslims."
"Mr President, when back in August the United Nations humanitarian aid coordinator, Jean Egeland, pointed out to us that the situation in Darfur was the worst it had been since 2004, he was also reminding us once again that it has long been time to resolve this situation."
"It is true that the UN is insisting that a United Nations mission be sent to the area, but it is also true, as has been said, that the Sudanese Government’s opposition makes that more difficult."
"Nevertheless, as the International Crisis Group points out so often, it is our obligation to apply what is known as the responsibility to protect."
"We have the responsibility to protect and we cannot shy away from it."
"Three very specific things can be done with regard to Darfur: firstly, very directly, we can impose sanctions aimed directly at any actor, including the government, which is currently breaching the ceasefire or directly attacking humanitarian operations and, as has also been said specifically, and I would emphasise this, attacking the civil population, particularly women."
"Secondly, the African Union can and must be used to a greater extent, in order to ensure that the different parties accept at least part of the Darfur peace agreement, but, to this end, the support of international partners, including the European Union, is also needed."
"Finally, and this is the most important thing, the United Nations Security Council must speed up the process of deploying United Nations forces on the ground, in accordance with the clear mandate of Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter."
"Otherwise, it will be difficult to halt this massacre."
"Mr President, Darfur is a humanitarian disaster."
"This tragic region has reached crisis point and we need to give it our full attention and take swift action, as Mr Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, said just a few days ago."
"It would be hard to disagree with his views."
"The whole world is aware that the region has continuously been at war since 2003."
"As a result, 300 000 people have died and over 2.5 million have been displaced."
"Alarm bells have been rung in recent weeks by humanitarian organisations working in Sudan."
"Three million people in Darfur depend on international humanitarian aid, including food supplies, medical aid and shelter."
"It is becoming almost impossible to provide this aid as a result of the escalating conflict in the region."
"Twelve international aid workers have been killed in Darfur since the beginning of May alone, which is more than those killed over the last two years."
"Although the African Union is to remain in the area until the end of the year, it is clear that it cannot put an end to the war on its own."
"We should remember that this is an under-equipped and under-financed 7 000 strong contingent, covering an area the size of France."
"Even if it were to be reinforced by a further 4 000 soldiers, it would be unable to assist the millions of civilians under attack in the region or to guarantee the security of international organisations and protect refugees."
"A number of solutions to the problem are currently under consideration."
"They range from deploying UN forces in the field, through substantial UN support for the African Union in terms of logistics and equipment, to NATO commitment to resolving the conflict."
"As I see it, one thing is abundantly clear."
"African countries and their leaders should be much more involved in finding a solution to this pressing problem."
"They are experienced, are familiar with the area and have established strong contacts there."
"We should therefore encourage our African partners to become more strongly committed to finding a solution to this conflict."
"Mr President, everyone is saying: ‘Darfur is on the brink of the abyss’."
"The parties involved in the conflict continue to kill and to rape."
"The civilian populations are their daily targets."
"Humanitarian workers are abandoning the area under the pressure of the acts of intimidation and, indeed, murders, since 13 have been killed over the last few weeks."
"The conflict is threatening the entire sub-region, extending, as it does, to Chad and to the Central African Republic."
"It seems that all is now set for the final assault."
"All is set for a massacre."
"The government is playing a cat-and-mouse game with the international community."
"It is a very cruel game that is paid for each day in hundreds of human lives."
"Since 2004, the Union has spared no financial efforts, and this commitment has certainly helped to prevent carnage."
"However, a firmer political commitment is now vital."
"The priority is to act as quickly as possible and to deploy, in accordance with Resolution 1706, a United Nations peacekeeping force with a mandate to use force if necessary to protect the civilians."
"However, the only way to protect the populations is to do so quickly, here and now - by forcing the Sudanese authorities to stop their current offensive and to apply the peace agreement to Darfur; by strengthening the mandate and by giving the material resources to the African Union forces that are on the ground and that, at the moment, do not constitute a solid enough shield to protect the civilian populations; and, as my fellow Members have said, by immediately introducing the no-fly zone provided for in United Nations Resolution 1591."
"Furthermore, if appeals to reason are not enough, well, let us clear the way for sanctions: an oil embargo, an international arrest warrant, and individually targeted sanctions against the perpetrators of atrocities and, in particular, against the 51 people whose names appear on the list passed on to the International Criminal Court."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament will not allow the first genocide of the 21st century to take place, in silence and practically in front of its very own eyes."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of my speech is to strip away the last veil of hypocrisy surrounding the Khartoum government’s stance."
"In 2000, I went on a visit to Sudan together with the Members of this Parliament who also sit in the ACP Assembly."
"Mrs Kinnock and I were able to talk to Ibn al-Turabi, who was then in prison; he was an old companion in arms of Omar al-Bashir, one of the leading figures of Islamic fundamentalism in Sudan and one of the men who had organised hospitality for Osama bin Laden in Sudan."
"Back then, in 2000, he spelt out to us what the Khartoum government’s ‘Arabisation’ strategy consisted of."
"It was a strategy to Arabise – and I mean just that: not to Islamise, but to Arabise – an area inhabited by what many official Sudanese Government documents termed the ‘Darfur monkeys’, in other words the people of Darfur."
"Well, if Europe acknowledges this, it now means once again that we must not simply play along with the government in Khartoum by asking to mediate between hypothetical opposing sides, because there are no opposing sides."
"There is no civil war in Darfur: there are just murderers and victims."
"There are just murderers acting hand in glove with the men that give the orders in Khartoum, who use them to pursue a demented ideology that is no longer likely just to lead to genocide, but will ratify a genocide that has been going on for a very long time."
"It is therefore crucial for Europe’s institutions to adopt emergency measures, such as those described just now by Mrs Carlotti, in order to bring on board everyone who cares deeply about the lives of a generation."
"– Mr President, the Darfur peace agreement was concluded in May 2006, and not one single deadline in this treaty has been met since then."
"There is no less fighting, no less violence against the civilian population; indeed, both are on the increase."
"Rape, carried out systematically, is still being used as a means of waging war, and a sharp increase in the number of rapes was recorded over the last three months."
"The Sudanese Government is still opposed to a UN mission, which would have significantly more resources, troops and powers than the present African Union peace mission, which is largely ineffective."
"Much as the expansion of the African peace mission to 11 000 police officers and soldiers in the Western Sudan is to be welcomed, the African Union’s continuing and collective support for UN troops shows that this can be seen as no more than a transitional measure."
"It is evident that the Sudanese Government is already planning to send its own troops to protect the region."
"Amnesty International warns that ‘the prospect of soon being “protected” by the same government soldiers that had driven them from their homes and mistreated them, is spreading panic among the people’."
"Aid organisations active in the region fear that they would have to close their operations down completely if the government troops were again to come up against the bands of secessionist rebels that have not yet signed the Abuja peace treaty."
"We therefore call on the Sudanese Government to comply with Chapter 7 of the UN Charter and accept the presence in Darfur of a UN peacekeeping force of the kind provided for in Security Council Resolution 1706."
"Sudan is standing on the brink of disaster."
"Every attempt must be made to prevent another genocide on the continent of Africa."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as two Sudanese survivors told me, we need to break the silence suffered by the victims of the genocide."
"It is on behalf of these silent victims of the genocide under way in Darfur that I have taken the floor today to direct an urgent appeal – a cry of distress – to you."
"It is not only an MEP, but also the chairman of an international NGO that is very involved in Darfur, who is addressing you."
"I belong to a generation that vowed that, after the Holocaust, there would never again be anything like it."
"The words ‘never again’ are uttered repeatedly, but here we are again having to talk about this issue."
"Are we going to wait until all of the populations have been exterminated before we mourn for them?"
"How many people need to die before we intervene?"
"Is there a minimum threshold of people who need to be sent to concentration camps before we intervene?"
"In fact, I believe that there are some victims that will never be very popular."
"Darfur is one of them."
"Mr Annan declared that Darfur was hell."
"Yet, it is impossible to imagine just how hellish it is for the populations tortured by the genocidal militias that are in the pay of an illegitimate government."
"Are we going to add to what is a crime in itself the crime of indifference?"
"No!"
"The torturers need to know that we will not leave them alone because we cannot say that we were unaware of what was going on."
"We are aware, but we are not taking action."
"Europe has a powerful role to play."
"Europe must put real pressure on and show itself to be more offensive in demanding an end to the atrocities and the massacres and in demanding the deployment of the United Nations forces in order to protect the civilian populations in Darfur."
"This can only be achieved by means of diplomatic efforts and very strong international involvement."
"For once, the army can intervene in a positive way in order to come between the murderers and the murdered."
"We must demand a solution to the militias and we must call for the delivery of humanitarian aid."
"As a number of my fellow Members before me have said, let us waste no time, for we are actually witnessing the first genocide of the 21st century."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, unfortunately the war in Lebanon and the clash in the Middle East have taken up international interest and the international news at the expense of tragic developments in Darfur, where there is a humanitarian crisis, genocide, ethnic cleansing and a criminal war."
"We have UN Security Council Resolution 1706, which we are calling for to be applied."
"With Resolution 1701 on Lebanon we had international action for its full application."
"Five resolutions later, however, in Resolution 1706, we unfortunately find – as regards its application –international indifference and international hypocrisy."
"Two sets of standards for this major humanitarian crisis which is ultimately also undermining our common European values and principles."
"I believe, Commissioner, that the European Union basically has a moral responsibility, not only a political and strategic responsibility, to take initiatives."
"The bureaucratic resolutions of the Council of Ministers alone do not suffice."
"On 20 October we have the summit."
"What is needed from your side also is for the European Union to take an initiative in the Security Council, so that there is a common stand by all the members of the Security Council on the resolution of the problem, on the application at long last of Resolution 1706 and, because we need to speak honestly, there is an obligation for initiatives to be taken on China."
"China is one of the countries which is responsible for the prolongation of this impasse, of this crisis."
"The Arab League has the same responsibility."
"So take initiatives towards the Arab League, the Islamic conference, China, Russia and even the United States."
"The bland statements by Mr Bush and the US Congress do not suffice and, finally, Commissioner, the of international law relating to the right of international intervention when human rights are being trampled underfoot must be applied."
"Mr President, we have all witnessed the crimes against humanity committed on Sudanese soil over the last three years."
"They include genocide, war crimes and ethnic cleansing."
"While we watch helplessly from our ivory towers, the Sudanese state is failing to fulfil the basic duty required of any state, namely to ensure the security of the population of a given territory."
"We gaze down from Brussels and Strasbourg on events in Sudan, despite the fact that the European Union arose from a political and moral protest against crimes of that nature."
"Each successive enlargement was heralded by the same clarion call: never again, never again will we allow such crimes against humanity, never again will we permit ethnic cleansing, never again will we tolerate genocide!"
"In the statements made today by representatives of the European Union, I did not detect such strong commitment to ensure that the European Union actually does all that lies within its power to stop the widespread slaughter in Sudan."
"What steps should be taken?"
"Over the coming weeks, the Union should focus on exerting effective pressure on the government in Khartoum to ensure that it agrees to the deployment of UN peacekeeping troops on Sudanese territory."
"Should that endeavour not be successful, and should the government in Khartoum continue to refuse to countenance the presence of UN peacekeepers on its territory, then it would be appropriate to further increase the logistical and material support provided to the African Union mission to Sudan."
"If all that fails to impact on what is happening in Sudan, we should consider calling on NATO forces to ensure that the African Union’s military mission is in a position to guarantee peace and security across the territory of Sudan."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been an excellent, robust debate."
"I can assure you that the Council does not view the situation in Sudan and Darfur apathetically."
"We all agree that developments there have been very worrying, and we must do everything in our power now and in the future to improve the security and humanitarian situation in Darfur."
"We are constantly doing everything in our power, or at least a good deal."
"We are maintaining active diplomatic contact with the various parties and third countries in order to gain the widest possible support for the UN Resolution and its implementation, and to be able to step up the pressure on the Sudanese Government."
"Special Representative Pekka Haavisto has an important role to play in Sudan in ensuring that all parties there commit to this peace process, as otherwise there can be no lasting peace."
"It is very important, and a positive sign, that the African Union has, through its AMIS operation, shown itself to be strongly committed to resolving this crisis."
"That dedication has had the support of the European Union, and this continues to be the case, as the EU lends support to the AMIS operation in the form of logistics, material aid, planning assistance and other similar measures."
"The African Union has decided to increase its peacekeeping presence – that is, its AMIS operation – by an additional 4 000 troops, meaning there will be a total of 11 000 troops stationed in the region."
"When the UN operation is finally underway in the region, the easiest way to promote its acceptability in the eyes of the Sudanese Government may be for it to be made up of African and Asian troops."
"We also have to remember that the other neighbouring countries in the region have a very important role to play when it comes to border issues and refugee problems."
"The human rights situation in the area is very worrying, as has been mentioned in this debate."
"The European Union has highlighted these human rights issues by including them in the agenda of the UN Human Rights Council now in process."
"With regard to the issue of genocide, and the use of this term in particular, we should remember that the International Criminal Court is investigating this at present, and the European Union supports the work it is doing."
"There is not just one key to a solution on Darfur and Sudan."
"It is very important that we make progress along all the paths open to us in an effective, broad-based, and coordinated way, and in a spirit of cooperation."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree entirely with the conclusions expressed by the Minister, who is representing the Presidency."
"I do not think anyone in this Chamber is in any doubt about the catastrophic scale of the Darfur tragedy, just as there cannot be any doubt that it really is genocide."
"Today's debate, however, touches on a much more general political problem that is extremely important for this Parliament and for the European Union’s institutions in general: the Union’s role as the promoter and defender of fundamental rights outside its borders."
"We often wonder whether the European Union can and must (I personally think it can and it must) be a standard-bearer throughout the world for the fundamental rights primarily of respect for human dignity – human dignity that has been utterly destroyed in the Darfur tragedy."
"For it to play that role, however, the great political debate that we must address is how Europe can take these values beyond its borders and uphold them when there are other parties like the Sudanese Government, which tolerates and encourages fundamentalism and the most violent, horrible excesses committed by the militias."
"Well, many of you have said in no uncertain terms, ‘Let us go in with troops and weapons to implement Article 7; let us send in a military force that can use force to put an end to this catastrophic situation.’"
"I am well aware that this is one of the options provided for in the international treaties, but then I remember that, when promoting human rights around the world, we Europeans have often talked of guaranteeing the so-called principle of ownership: in other words, we cannot decide here in Strasbourg or Brussels on the right path for another country or continent to follow and simply impose it on them."
"We have to work with the local institutions and, in my view, the first part of the solution will be to work with the African Union, strengthening its role and ensuring that it gets the practical help it needs."
"We do not want Europe to be seen as aloof one moment and suddenly in there the next, deploying troops and weaponry and playing a role that, if anything, the African Union ought to be consolidating and strengthening."
"As the Presidency has just pointed out, that is the first step."
"The second step along this path will be to provide logistical assistance on the ground."
"That is a job that we – the European Union and its institutions – can do, and the Commission can also provide economic aid."
"How can we guarantee that the humanitarian aid will actually reach its intended destination: the suffering population and the NGO workers on the ground who are risking their lives?"
"Logistical assistance on the ground is thus another area where we, the European Union, can make a difference."
"The third step, which has not really been given enough weight by some people, is how to work with the Arab League."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we come up against the sensitivities of Islamic or Arab countries in many parts of the world."
"In some cases they are our staunch allies, as in the fight against terrorism, for instance. In other cases they prove so extremely sensitive that it is advisable for us to reach agreements before intervening."
"What is the difference between Darfur and Lebanon?"
"The difference is that in the case of Lebanon there was an agreement, and the troops went in as peacekeepers because the Lebanese Government and the Israeli Government both accepted it."
"The Sudanese Government, on the other hand, still rejects the idea."
"Do you believe that it would be possible to intervene unilaterally without a strong role for the Arab League?"
"Do you not think that, without a strong role for the Arab League, such action would send out an extremely negative signal to that enormous population – which unfortunately harbours the most fundamentalist ideas in the world?"
"Would that not strengthen the extremists and fundamentalists, who would then have a further argument in their propaganda arsenal?"
"The third part of the solution, therefore, is the Arab League."
"We are working to encourage the Arab League to distance itself from the Government of Sudan and to withdraw its consent and support; as you know, this is happening to a certain extent, but we have to do more along these lines."
"Then there is another point that somebody mentioned: what if the Khartoum Government does not listen to the international community?"
"I have always been of the opinion that military action must only be used as a last resort, even if humanitarian intervention is justified under Article 7 of the Treaty."
"There are some other middle paths."
"In this context I heard somebody mention a ‘no-fly zone’; that is a measure that could be explored, adopted and proposed."
"You realise that, if we proposed action under Article 7 to the Security Council, China, like it or not, would probably use its veto and so nothing would happen."
"I wonder, therefore, whether it might not be better to work on an initiative – which might not solve the problem but it would help – such as stopping aircraft from overflying the area and killing people with bombs and air strikes."
"That is another concrete possibility."
"I shall end my speech with two remarks."
"First, President Barroso and my colleague Louis Michel will be going to Khartoum."
"They will be sending the highest echelons of the Sudanese Government a strong message explaining that the European Union intends to take strong diplomatic action, as well as action on the ground to help the people who are suffering."
"The message will refer to the isolation to which Sudan would be consigned if it continued to refuse to listen to the international community."
"Such isolation would be particularly devastating for Sudan itself: being isolated from the rest of the international community would not be in Khartoum’s interests; that, then, ladies and gentlemen, would take away President Bashir’s excuse for maintaining such a negative attitude."
"Another very important point that the Commission’s action will address is the role of women and children."
"We talk about this subject all the time here in Europe: we worry about the victims of human trafficking and forced prostitution and we have even set out a European roadmap for children’s rights."
"Naturally, we cannot shut our eyes to the rights of women and children outside Europe in such a tragic case as Darfur."
"Personally, therefore, I hope that this Parliament will stand firm in its measures on Darfur precisely so as to provide special protection for women and children, who are, as always, the victims most at risk."
"– I have received 6 motions for a resolution in accordance with Rule 103 (2) of the Rules of Procedure(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the report by Mr Sajjad Karim, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the EU's economic and trade relations with India [2006/2034(INI)], (A6-0256/2006)."
"Mr President, as the geopolitical centre of gravity shifts to Asia in the 21st century, if you look at India you see the future."
"Considering its size and complexity, India’s stable and vibrant society remains a monumental achievement."
"Its commitment to democracy, pluralism and the rule of law guarantees consistency in trade relations."
"Yet, for a country approaching a fifth of the world’s population, India counts for less than one fiftieth of world trade."
"As India’s largest trading partner and principal source of foreign investment, the EU is poised to help India reap the benefits of liberalisation."
"With our shared history and commitment to secular government and religious pluralism, the EU and India are natural partners."
"We became strategic partners in June 2004, yet it was another year before a joint action plan was agreed."
"Even today, the Commissioner lacks the authorisation to turn the work of the high-level trade groups into a concrete deal."
"In the meantime, President Bush has succeeded in brokering a quite frankly worrying US-India nuclear deal."
"The Commissioner claims India as his destination of choice – and of course I mean Commissioner Mandelson here – yet has fuelled EU obsession with China."
"India poses equal, if distinct, challenges for the EU and the Commission must reflect that as it lays out its new strategy by working with stakeholders to mirror its China consultation."
"The Doha round remains the chief mechanism for shaping equitable globalisation."
"The multilateral trading system is a most just and effective way of expanding and managing trade and it shields the weak from the use and abuse in the unilateral scramble for trade domination."
"However, a Doha deal does not preclude bilateral WTO-plus arrangements."
"Only through greater openness to partnerships that go beyond what a lowest common denominator WTO deal could now provide, will the EU begin to address the global competitiveness agenda of the future."
"A free trade agreement with India must be central to the Commission’s new global Europe strategy."
"This House must back the Commissioner 100% as he makes the case to the Council for a negotiating mandate to deliver bilateral FTAs, opening markets and securing fairer trading conditions in new areas of growth throughout Asia."
"India must match our resolve and bolster its promises for Helsinki."
"India has proved itself adept at juggling global players to boost competitiveness."
"It is time for a deal with its most obvious partner."
"Deadlines must be set so that we can achieve common ambitions in the areas that will dictate the terms of the 21st century: protection of intellectual property rights, open markets for services and investment, and effective trade defence instruments."
"No strategy for economic growth is complete without addressing the growing crisis of climate change."
"The impact of growth in Asia on energy supply is phenomenal."
"India’s future growth is dependent on meeting spiralling energy needs."
"Severe shortages and over-dependency on petrol and coal are driving up costs and pollution."
"An effort to develop nuclear energy is symptomatic of that crisis."
"However, even if India did develop nuclear energy it would meet only 2% of total energy requirements."
"It would also constitute a climb-down from Gleneagles pledges to halt climate change and promote energy conservation."
"Both India and the EU have long traditions of promoting renewable energy."
"India has built the world’s fourth largest wind power industry, developed biogas digesters and solar cells and supported the development of renewable energy in Asia."
"We must work together to define the global energy architecture through innovation and sustainable energy development whilst meeting climate change benchmarks."
"India’s economic growth is booming at 8% and is set to double in a decade."
"Dotcom benefactors make up India’s rich list, cashing in as India becomes the global hub for ITC development."
"Yet India’s economy remains full of paradoxes."
"The uneven distribution of the benefits of globalisation has left nearly four million people living on less than one dollar per day."
"The EU must ensure that the benefits of our trading relationship are shared with Indians – all of them."
"International trade can be a powerful driver of economic growth and poverty reduction but it is not a silver bullet."
"To continue to lift people out of pockets of poverty, India’s trade reforms must complement development policies."
"Linking external and internal policies is not aided by India’s infrastructure, which displays characteristics of a developing nation while seats of enterprise dominate the skylines of Mumbai and Bangalore."
"Investment must focus on rural areas, providing better water supplies and sanitation, improving transport links and the quality of grid power output."
"India is committed to the Millennium Development Goals and its own five-year plan exceeds UN expectations, but there is increased doubt that India will meet four out of the eight goals on schedule."
"Serious concerns remain over child labour and the spread of HIV/AIDS has a potential to disrupt India’s progress."
"Trade relations cannot be divorced from human rights and development concerns."
"We have a duty to India to reverse those trends."
"EU assistance must be directed to lagging regions and under-represented social groups."
"Capacity-building efforts must focus on the poorest states, enabling them to use funds effectively."
"Foreign investment must provide funds for education and rural health."
"As India moves from developing to developed, it bears regional responsibility and sustained growth."
"It must take its neighbours with it. SAFTA will bring manifold expansion in the region."
"True, it has not been smooth sailing and Indo-Pak disputes have stalled progress, but strong leadership in the region has led to trade now being used as a confidence-building measure, particularly over Kashmir."
"Europe must look at Asia and consider its astonishing growth as an opportunity rather than a threat."
"The EU needs more confidence about its ability to manage change and remain competitive."
"Inevitably it will require some restructuring and a change of mindset."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Karim, and the International Trade Committee, for the excellent work that has been done."
"The report is comprehensive, addressing almost all possible aspects of EU-India economic and trade relations."
"This report is also timely, as it takes place ahead of the forthcoming EU-India Summit in Helsinki on 13 October 2006, and we will take its recommendations into consideration."
"Our cooperation with India is manifold and it is difficult to address it exhaustively in this speech."
"Therefore, I will point to some of the main features that respond to your concerns and also update the House in more detail on the trade and investment issues."
"Generally, our cooperation is good and is making progress."
"Regarding the environment, for instance, last year India hosted the first EU-India forum on waste management, which was followed by various visits by and meetings of the working party on that issue."
"The holding of the second Environment Forum is under discussion."
"Regarding employment and social issues, the Commission and the Indian Labour Minister agreed in a bilateral meeting a work programme for 2006 and 2007 based on the Joint Action Plan."
"A draft memorandum of understanding is to be signed, or initialled, at the forthcoming Helsinki Summit."
"More broadly, following a bilateral meeting between Commissioner Almunia and the Indian Finance Minister, the launch of regular macroeconomic dialogue has been proposed."
"The business side has not been forgotten and thanks to Commissioner Mandelson, who pushed forward the idea with his counterpart Trade Minister Nath, the EU-India CEO Round Table, allowing active business-to-business dialogue, is now ready to be launched at the Business Summit on 12 October 2006."
"Our development cooperation is concentrated on sector support for elementary education, health and family welfare."
"Poverty alleviation has been the central objective in all projects."
"The Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for 2007 to 2013 reaffirms that commitment with an approximately 65 to 70% allocation to the health and education sectors."
"Encouragingly, our State Partnership Programmes with Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, amounting to a total contribution of EUR 160 million towards supporting water management, education and health, have been signed and can now be implemented."
"Turning to trade and investment relations with India, I welcome the fact that the conclusions of the report adopted by the International Trade Committee fully support the Commission's approach."
"More specifically, the Committee has called on the European Union to enter into a free trade agreement (FTA) with India."
"India is keen to launch a free trade agreement with the European Union as soon as possible."
"This has been the Indian position for a long time, pushed by Prime Minister Singh himself."
"I welcome the committee's first comment that negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) are not incompatible with bilateral WTO-plus negotiations."
"The European Union seeks to build on and complement its commitment to the multilateral WTO trading system with a new generation of bilateral FTAs, in particular with key growing markets in Asia."
"The European Union continues to see the WTO as the fundamental platform on which to build global liberalisation."
"There will be no retreat from multilateralism."
"An EU-India FTA can build on WTO multilateral liberalisation by addressing areas, such as trade and services, public procurement markets, competition policy and regulatory harmonisation, that are related directly to EU trading strengths not yet fully addressed by WTO rules or standards."
"We have made sure that the economic case for an EU-India FTA is watertight and that there is a similar level of understanding and ambition on India's part, which is necessary for any negotiation to work."
"To that end, I welcome the committee's support for the High Level Trade Group's work."
"On 19 September 2006, the High Level Trade Group finalised its report to the EU-India Summit on 13 October 2006, which recommended that an expanded-trade partnership be developed through the negotiation of a broad-based trade and investment agreement."
"The summit will recommend that both EU and India move towards negotiations for such an agreement."
"Although we will not be launching an FTA at the summit, we will, however, be making positive signals that we are heading in that direction."
"We do not just want to launch but to prepare the ground for successful negotiations."
"This may mean further work on some of the more sensitive issues after the summit, so that we improve understanding of each other’s expectations and possibilities for movement."
"Accordingly, I share the committee’s views that there is a need to deepen discussion on services negotiations, intellectual property rights and public procurement."
"Finally, I also share the committee’s concern about the low level of intra-regional trade in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and its recommendation to SAARC to review opportunities to expand trade and investment in the region."
"We are following closely the problem of Pakistan’s non-implementation of schedules under the South Asia Free Trade Agreement and addressing this informally with this country."
"Mr President, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Karim on his excellent report on India."
"It is a complex report, as is only to be expected, since presenting an overview of economic and commercial cooperation between the European Union and India, whilst also highlighting the challenges facing the latter, is a complex task."
"I believe the rapporteur has dealt with it very well."
"I appreciate the significance of the economic and commercial issues contained in the report, but I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur for supporting the opinion of the Committee on Development, and viewing India not just as a country undergoing dynamic economic development, a country with great potential and an important trading and economic partner for Europe, but also as a country with a particularly complex social structure, and a country of great inequalities in terms of development levels and in the distribution of profits gained."
"At the same time, India is a country struggling with major problems that are typical for developing countries, such as poverty or illiteracy."
"As I emphasised in my report for the Committee on Development, the main thrust of the strategic partnership between the European Union and India must continue to be work aimed at attaining the Millennium Development Goals and the war on poverty."
"I would like to draw attention to two significant development policy issues which affect cooperation between the European Union and India."
"Economic growth in India has averaged 6% a year over the last ten years."
"Nonetheless, almost 30% of India’s population, some 400 million people, are still living below the poverty line, existing on less that a dollar a day."
"The level of illiteracy is almost 40%."
"It is vital that economic and trade cooperation between the European Union and India helps to redress this unfortunate imbalance."
"Our efforts must be directed at improving the lot of the poorest sections of society and at promoting best practices in the regions with the highest economic growth."
"Cooperation in the fields of health and education should also be deepened."
"Mr President, this document is basically economic in nature, but it contains a far broader message for both partners."
"That message relates to political, social, educational, scientific and developmental matters."
"We overcame minor differences between political groupings to reach common positions which were often the result of compromise."
"India can assume from this resolution that the whole of Europe is united in its desire to cooperate with a country with such a great historical heritage and economic potential."
"Of course, for our part, we shall highlight the difficulties affecting the people of India."
"In line with European standards, however, these difficulties should be openly discussed and gradually resolved."
"In order to achieve successful cooperation involving entrepreneurs and citizens, shared common values and aims need to be established."
"If that is not the case, all that will emerge will be declarations signed by governments and politicians, and we have seen plenty of ineffective documents of that sort drawn up by this House."
"We are hoping for genuine cooperation that draws on the experience of past relationships, mainly between the United Kingdom and India."
"We trust, however, that it will develop into a cooperation partnership , free from the fetters of the past, which may be read as a reference to colonialism."
"This document will serve as a basis and a springboard for a healthy exchange benefiting both partners."
"As shadow rapporteur, I move that it be adopted as it stands."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, and also thank the rapporteur for this excellent report, which touches on all the issues that are relevant when talking about India."
"The Commissioner mentioned one specific point to which I think we should give in-depth consideration, and that is that India might finally become a geopolitical centre in the 21st century."
"I think he is right about that and the European Union and the Commission will have to make up their minds."
"You cannot say ‘either India or China’; that is not the right approach."
"But we will certainly have to focus, because to deal with both countries and many more countries to come as regards bilateral agreements might be something that is impossible for the Commission whilst making sure that the multilateral round flourishes."
"So I would like to point out to the rapporteur and the House that my Group will be a little more cautious when it comes to a free-trade agreement."
"We are not against a free-trade agreement; quite the opposite."
"We already argued in favour of a free-trade agreement and regional agreement in 2002, when I presented my own report to this House, but I think we should first have an in-depth debate and discussion on the issue."
"The Commission will produce its new policy report on 4 October, in only a few weeks."
"So we will not support a free-trade agreement at the moment, because we want to have a debate in our Group first and we want to be clear that Parliament will be fully involved in the debate and the consultation process."
"It is important and relevant to see a shift from the multilateral to the more bilateral agreement and to make sure that there is some coherence when it comes to trade policy."
"That is one of the reasons why tomorrow we are not going to support the idea of a free-trade agreement at this stage."
"I am happy also that Mr Karim touched on the various high-tech issues."
"I think it is absolutely essential that we focus more on India and cooperate more closely with it."
"Now, everything I said is not on behalf of Glyn Ford, who is the shadow rapporteur."
"He apologises to Mr Karim for not being here."
"He has to go back to England, but he will certainly follow up the issues and discuss them in detail."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for clearly emphasising the importance of the financial sector to the development of the Indian economy."
"This is a factor which is crucial for Indian and European Union economic cooperation."
"The volume of investment is quite dependant on the confidence of investors in the target countries and applied standards of regulation of financial markets and accounting."
"Thus it would be a good idea to invite the Indian business community to take its cue from the accumulated expertise of the European Union in ensuring proper investor protection."
"I would like to ask the Commission to further promote the experience we have acquired and the European Union financial regulation model that we have been developing and applying so that the Indian business community can take advantage of our expertise in the field."
"To that end, the work of the Commission must be further coordinated so that Commissioners working in different fields can communicate on a larger scale and so that cooperation with third countries would not only be a task for those engaged in the field but also for all other Commissioners."
"One of the major challenges is that the Indian financial sector is not sufficiently liberalised."
"It requires huge investments, especially for expanding business activities to rural areas."
"Without development of rural areas, Indian progress is simply unfeasible."
"But the development of the Indian financial sector will not be possible without input from the major world and European banks."
"Therefore, we should promote cooperation and invite the Indian regulators to take part in joint European Union and third country expert groups in drafting relevant legislation to ensure that appropriate conditions for common work are provided for in the early stages."
"I would also like to support bilateral dialogue, full-fledged economic cooperation between the European Union and India, and reaching common agreements, particularly since multilateral negotiations do not always properly take relation-specific requirements into account."
"Mr President, during our previous part-session, we had a report on EU trade with China in which we were severely critical of China’s human rights violations."
"Today, the subject is trade with India."
"The report is excellent."
"I was able to concur with most of what it said, and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will, of course, vote in favour of the report."
"I wish, however, to concentrate here on one big issue: that of why human rights problems are not accorded importance in the report."
"They are discussed, but in very general terms."
"Moreover, the worst problem - and probably one of the world’s most extensive human rights problems – is almost not mentioned at all."
"I am thinking, of course, of the Dalits, who are casteless."
"They are mentioned, but in conjunction with the Adivasis, as if all that was at issue was a general problem involving minorities."
"The Dalits are a despised underclass in several countries, but they are, in particular, India’s problem."
"They are not only poor and socially excluded."
"The situation is worse than that."
"They are treated as if they were not human beings at all."
"They are untouchable, detested by the other population groups and at the bottom of the pile socially."
"They do have rights, but only on paper."
"In reality, they have no rights, and they do the dirtiest and most dangerous jobs."
"That, moreover, is of course what is interesting in this case."
"It is they who, in industry and agriculture, work with chemicals so poisonous as to be banned in most of the world."
"Without instructions or protection, they spray the fields with deadly neurotoxins."
"In factories, they stand bare-footed in acid baths and colour our textiles."
"No one else would tolerate these things, but the Dalits are forced to do so."
"What is more, the EU deals in Indian products without asking candid questions about how they were made."
"It is a nasty business for India, but it is almost more awkward for Europe, which is well aware of what is happening. Often, we ourselves have sold them the dangerous products."
"Thousands of people are harmed and many die, and they are Dalits."
"The Dalits have no voice and no trade union. We ourselves are obliged to be their voice if the outrages are to be brought to an end."
"The problem needs to be on the EU’s agenda, and it is disgraceful that it is not clearly included in this report."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I offer Mr Karim and all the Committee on International Trade my heartfelt thanks for the excellent work that they have done on this report."
"India is the world’s most populous democracy and, with a growth rate of 9% in 2005 alone, its rapid economic development as well as its geopolitical characteristics represent yet another challenge to the European Union on the world’s markets."
"In many respects it is a fascinating challenge and it may bring potential benefits for Europe, but there are also possible risks."
"In India, 400 million people live on less than a dollar a day."
"Sixty-five per cent of the population work in the agricultural sector, with its antiquated structures and methods."
"Nuclear power is used just as a deterrent in the long-standing war with its neighbour Pakistan, but it is little used to promote ecologically sound development, and that makes the country dependent on energy from abroad and forces it to look around the world for the energy sources it needs for its development."
"India is a country of great wealth and great poverty, and even today it is difficult for women to find work, apart from the most menial duties, and particularly skilled work, which means that it is difficult for women to be accepted as entrepreneurs."
"It is not a simple matter to talk of India on account of its vast size and all the variables that that entails, but India also represents a major hope for improving the distribution of international trade."
"India is also a great country with an extremely fast-growing GDP and a highly competent class of people able to keep up with the new international challenges in the field of advanced technology."
"The economy is moving ahead in many regions, and the gates have been opened to foreign investment, although Europe seems so far to have been excluded."
"India only accounts for 1% of Europe’s total trade."
"Hence we see a need to form a strategic partnership between these two great blocks, in order to create a more fertile climate for cooperation, with better mutual understanding to bring down the barriers between us by adhering to mutually agreed rules."
"The recent disagreements in the Doha Round in Geneva led to a few difficulties, but India and the European Union should accept the responsibility of revitalising a multilateral framework."
"As a country at an advanced stage of development but with profound social imbalances, this Asian giant needs a stronger European presence that can help it achieve more balanced growth."
"On the European side, there has to be a fair, open approach aimed at reinforcing Europe’s presence in India and duly supporting our initiatives in that part of the world."
"What is happening, as should also happen in connection with the growing economic expansion of China, is that Europe is seeking a strategy for itself in relation to the rest of the world."
"We must not, however, ignore the scourge of child labour, in many cases involving very young children."
"This is extremely common in the Indian economy, which lacks minimum standards of social protection for the weakest sections of society; the caste system also makes it difficult for part of the population to live and to grow."
"Therefore, while we have the utmost respect for the traditions of this great country, we need to call on the Indian political and economic classes and the companies that operate in India to adopt a highly responsible position and to use every means to fight the problem of children who work rather than study, promoting instead the expansion of literacy, which is the real hope for people in the future."
"Mr President, economic analysts are of the opinion that, by 2015, India, which is considered to be an ‘Asian tiger’, will have become the fourth most powerful economy in the world."
"India will therefore become a strong counterbalance to China in trading terms."
"In the first quarter of this year, the rate of growth of the Indian economy increased to over 9%."
"As it moves on from being a developing country and comes to be recognised as a developed one, India is aspiring to catch up with China and take the lead in Asia."
"We should, therefore, attach particular importance to trade relations with India."
"The European Union is already India’s main trading partner."
"Trade with Member States of the European Union accounts for over 22% of exports from India."
"India’s industry has risen to global challenges and welcomes science-based development as a business strategy."
"The large numbers of young, well-educated Indians who are cheap to employ and speak competent English represent a great asset to their country."
"They should become an advantage in terms of our bilateral relations."
"There are other factors, however, that the Union ought to draw to India’s attention."
"Over 390 million Indian citizens are living on less than a dollar a day and the statistics for child labour in India are amongst the highest in the world."
"This has to change."
"The war on poverty must become a key feature of the strategic partnership between the European Union and India."
"We should also strive to ensure that India is better represented at the IMF."
"In addition, it would be appropriate to launch an initiative aimed at drawing up a free trade agreement with India."
"This would strengthen our strategic trading partnership for many years to come."
"Mr Karim has drawn up a good report that deserves our support."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party, and I should like to congratulate Mr Karim on the welcome approach taken in his report."
"As a representative of the European Parliament and a member of the Committee on Development, I can only be delighted that India has signed up to the Millennium Development Goals and that, through its actions, the Indian Government has shown for some time that it can be a reliable partner for possible future interaction and collaboration, not least in the commercial arena."
"I feel, however, that the efforts made so far in the fight against child labour, dumping – especially in the textile and footwear industries – and piracy, and to steer development along ecologically sound lines have been feeble and insufficient."
"The Union has a duty to support and encourage India so as to resolve such substantial problems by means of long-awaited and far-reaching structural reforms."
"Asia’s largest democracy has a responsibility to implement well-defined social reforms in order to overcome today’s caste-based society, which has considerable adverse effects both on access to education and services and on the more general condition of women’s lives."
"Fairness and equal opportunities should, therefore, be seen as targets to be achieved in the medium term through serious commitment and a tangible effort, while the economic field requires suitable financial reforms that will abolish non-tariff barriers and import duties and open up the market."
"If the system were improved, it could and should lead to the development of long-term peaceful relations with its neighbouring countries, not least by increasing trade with Pakistan. It should also encourage trade on the internal market as well as synergies among the various regions, which are today characterised by enormous socio-economic disparities."
"On these bases and within this framework, we have to promise our full, staunch support for this country. Having been on its knees for a long time, it is now ready to get up and play its part on the world stage."
"– Mr President, the size and dynamic rate of growth make India an important trading and economic partner of the Union."
"As we all know, India is the only large, dynamically developing economy in Asia where the European Union has a leading position in terms of foreign trade and outgoing foreign investments."
"Nonetheless, bilateral trade is uneven, as India is only the Union's tenth trading partner."
"At the same time, however, it should be stressed that India is the biggest beneficiary under the Generalised System of Preferences, with preferential access to the Union's market."
"Despite the spectacular increase in bilateral cooperation, the volume of trade and investments is below the current potential."
"In my opinion, the results of exploratory contracts on a bilateral trade and investment agreement are a positive development."
"However, an actual agreement will depend upon strong political will on both sides."
"Under no circumstances, however, should such a bilateral agreement be interpreted in terms of a negation of our attachment to multilateralism."
"Within this framework, attention will need to be paid, among other things, to the high import duties and extensive technical barriers maintained by India."
"Issues of common interest, such as more effective protection for intellectual property and geographical indications are especially important."
"Finally, one important parameter of the broader strategic partnership is further support for synergies in the sector of science and technology."
"In addition, as the Commissioner mentioned, the prospects for strengthening intraregional relations between the Union and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation need to be investigated and broadened."
"To close, I should like to congratulate Mr Karim on his creative contribution to the work of the Committee on International Trade and the European Parliament in general."
"Mr President, let me add my congratulations to Mr Karim on an excellent report."
"As his report clearly demonstrates, when we are discussing India, the first problem is to decide which India we are discussing."
"Is it the India with nearly four million households earning over EUR 150 000 a year and with more graduates than any other country?"
"Or is it the India with 390 million people living on less than a dollar a day, where two out of five of people are illiterate and where the so-called IT revolution only touches one in fifty Indians?"
"I hope, as a Parliament, we are interested in both."
"If India overcomes its infrastructure problems, most notably its persistent power cuts and poor transport networks, then I believe that within a generation it has the potential to be Europe’s largest trading partner, more important than China or the United States."
"I therefore welcome what Commissioner Borg said about the High Level Trade Group’s recommendations."
"I believe we should intensify our trade and investment relations with India."
"However, at this stage, I agree with Mrs Mann and Mr Papastamkos that we should stop short of a free-trade area, because we would not want India to be used as an example to denigrate the prospect of a successful DDA outcome."
"We must put our eggs in the DDA basket first and foremost, and anything else should be seen as a digression from that."
"Mr Papastamkos rightly points out that 77% of Indian goods come into the EU market duty-free through the GSP."
"The GSP places an obligation on India to improve its core labour standards."
"India must do more to tackle child labour and bonded labour, and must sign up to ILO Convention 98 on the right to organise and the right to collective bargaining."
"India signed up to the Millennium Development Goals and the EU, with our cooperation, should help by facilitating universal education, Eurohealth programmes and policies to get young people from poor areas into work."
"I believe that trade and development go hand in hand, but only if we work at it."
"It will not be automatic."
"We must have the political will to deliver on both."
"I welcome the report’s emphasis on both those aspects of our relations with India."
"Mr President, the economic and trade relations between the European Union and India are of paramount importance for both partners, and it is for that reason that both the EU and India must make every effort to remove any unnecessary obstacles, not least in the framework of the World Trade Organisation."
"India must do all it can in the G-20 in order to restore the Doha Development Agenda."
"The fact is that the multilateral trade system offers a country such as India enormous potential."
"That is why that country will need to make a reasonable offer in the form of a reduction of its import tariffs."
"Moreover, the issue of import tariffs must certainly be raised at bilateral level."
"Time after time, the Commission has underlined the importance of sound bilateral agreements, and that is what I am doing now."
"Both tariff and non-tariff-related obstacles constitute a considerable barrier to European enterprises."
"I would call on the Indian authorities to end this protectionist policy."
"Mr President, the EU is India’s biggest trading partner, and as such has a natural interest in the country’s economic development."
"Recently, the news has been good."
"India’s economic growth has been rapid, there has been commitment to a reduction in child labour, and India is one of the most proactive countries as far as action to combat dumping is concerned."
"India is also trying to reform its financial position, and is planning to remove restrictions on the rupee."
"Furthermore, the current human rights dialogue between the EU and India has got off to an encouraging start."
"India’s National Human Rights Commission has been working meticulously."
"At the same time, there have also been worrying developments."
"The gulf in living standards between the cities and the countryside is growing, and the environmental load is increasing."
"Nearly 400 million Indians, approximately a third of the country’s population, live on an income of less than a dollar a day."
"The massive growth in the economy is very unevenly spread: 40% of the population are illiterate."
"Ever-continuing discrimination based on the caste system in the country contributes to the unequal distribution of wealth and even the dwindling opportunities for economic growth."
"The worst off are the casteless Dalits, whose rights the authorities do not monitor closely enough."
"I appreciate the fact that the world’s largest democracy is actively aiming to correct these shortcomings that can be seen in its society through legislation."
"Positive discrimination is an example of this."
"Legislation is not enough, though: there also needs to be more effort put into implementation."
"Good policy decisions should be systematically put into practice by the local authorities."
"If the situation continues, much of the Indian people’s potential and many of their skills will remain untapped."
"At the same time, I would make a serious request to the Council that it should put the following issues on the agenda of the EU-India Summit in Helsinki: the status of India’s disadvantaged, its environmental problems and how prepared it is to cope with natural disasters."
"Furthermore, the dialogue on energy which was begun in the spring should continue, because the main determining factor in India’s future economic growth is its ability to meet its demand for energy, one that is growing at a staggering rate."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with only a few weeks to go before the next EU-India summit, we must pay tribute to Europe’s commitment to put more effort into its cooperation with India."
"This great democracy is not only one of our privileged partners in Asia, but it is also an actor with ever greater responsibilities, both regionally and internationally."
"It is for that reason that I am grateful to my fellow Member, Mr Karim, for pointing out that our relations with India are not limited merely to the commercial field, but that they are bolstered by extensive cooperation in a vast number of areas."
"India has embarked on major reforms in relation to the promotion of the Millennium Development Goals, even though that may at times appear insufficient."
"It has committed itself to protecting the environment, to applying the international standards on labour law and to combating poverty and AIDS."
"Initiatives such as those must be encouraged and supported by a strong political will and by financial resources that are sufficient to meet the needs of this continent country."
"Enhanced university cooperation between India and the European Union is indeed crucial, but we must ensure at all costs that we counter any possible brain drain, as that would deprive this country of its greatest asset."
"Let us not forget that our relations must be guided by the notion of partnership and of mutual exchange."
"We therefore cannot regard India merely as a huge pool of cheap labour."
"The optimistic view that we have of our future cooperation with India must not conceal an ever difficult reality."
"As this report highlights, certain sectors of the Indian economy are very fragile."
"I am thinking, in particular, of the farming sector, which is suffering from the effects of the uncontrolled liberalisation of trade."
"That is why I am surprised – and I agree in this respect with what various Members have said – that the conclusion of a free trade agreement should have been proposed."
"Not only would a decision such as that be premature, but I must point out that the European Union has committed itself to acting first and foremost within the context of the Doha Round."
"To talk from now on about supporting bilateral negotiations would run counter to the principles that we have been upholding for months and would be a very bad sign for the multilateral structure that we earnestly desire."
"I shall conclude."
"If our aim is indeed to have trade work in favour of development, then our trade relations will have to be conceived in a concerted and gradual manner within a rational and solid framework with our partner."
"Mr President, the EU’s strategic partnership with democratic India is of vital importance for both the EU and India."
"I welcome the strengthening of political and economic dialogue and engagement as well as discussions on human rights at the India-EU Summit on 13 October."
"However, given the astonishing recent growth of India’s economy and its emerging global big-power status, our partnership must now deepen."
"Therefore I strongly favour a bilateral India-EU free trade agreement."
"That would have mutually beneficial results as our economies are complementary, as India needs our high-tech finished products and we need their services and basic machinery."
"We are already India’s biggest trading partner, at some EUR 40 billion annually, and we collaborate now on high-tech projects such as Galileo and ITER, demonstrating the sophistication of India’s 8% annual growth economy."
"I also call for enhanced regional cooperation and economic integration of India and Pakistan with SAARC and SAFTA, which enhances the confidence-building measures between the two states which, until recently, were on the verge of war."
"The line of control between the divided regions of Jammu and Kashmir could eventually be just a line on the map, if people, goods and services could flow freely."
"Pakistan should desist from its restrictive positive list of freely traded goods and change to a more liberal negative list as expected by MFN and SAFTA rules."
"India is fast becoming the prime south-Asian geopolitical player and it is high time that the UN Security Council admitted the largest democracy in the world to its ranks as a permanent member."
"China is our second largest trading partner, but the EU does not share the same fundamental values with it as we do with India."
"That fact needs greater recognition in this House."
"Coming from Britain, with our traditional links to India, I commend the Karim report and call on the Commission to develop a much deeper political and economic India-EU relationship culminating in a bilateral free trade agreement."
"– Mr President, I too wish to take my turn in congratulating Mr Karim on the truly important report which he has presented to us."
"However, I should like to touch on another matter."
"Obviously we all support the development of a strategic partnership with India."
"India is a strong emerging economy, a new geostrategic pole in Asia as a whole."
"However, if this relationship is also to be to the benefit of the European Union, it is not enough for us to welcome the statistical advantage which the European Union has over India in terms of balance of trade, in terms of direct foreign investment and in terms of the transfer of technology."
"We also need a common strategy for the European Union which will go beyond the individual national interests of the Member States."
"The recent Mittal-Arcelor case demonstrated that we must not continue at European level to follow this division between the individual interests of the European Union."
"India, as we have said, is a very important factor."
"However, we must also see the other side."
"India at the moment has signed a nuclear energy agreement with the United States, which shapes a new framework and a new power correlation in Asia."
"We must call for India to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"It is vital to our future relations with India."
"On the other hand, we must understand that India bears a serious share of the responsibility for the failure of the Doha Round within the framework of the World Trade Organisation."
"It is India that is abusing the anti-dumping rules; it is India that is using social and environmental dumping."
"All these issues must be put to India if we really want an operational, effective and democratic multilateral trade system."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Karim on the excellent and extensive report on the EU’s economic and trade relations with India."
"We neglect the relationship with India, with its opportunities for both India and Europe, to our mutual cost."
"In the future, if the EU concentrates more of its efforts on economic policy instead of other distractions, I see the potential for a massive free-trading alliance."
"The United Kingdom, with its historic links, will play a key role in this development."
"I am therefore delighted that the British Conservative Leader, David Cameron, is devoting particular attention to relations with India."
"He seized the opportunity while with the business community in Mumbai recently to set out his views on globalisation."
"He also touched on the challenge of terrorism."
"Terrorism is the curse of our age."
"If afflicts many European countries."
"It has become a tragic fact of life in India as well, not just in Kashmir but in Mumbai where 200 people were murdered in July and in Malegaon on 8 September 2006, where some 40 people were killed."
"The precise responsibility for these attacks is still unclear, but there is strong suspicion of external involvement."
"Post-9/11, Pakistan has helped the democracies to fight terrorism along its western border with Afghanistan, but it has done precious little to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism on its eastern border with India or to control the extremist madrassas that provide the hotbed in which terrorists are cultivated."
"In order to proceed with the welcome and ongoing peace process between India and Pakistan, Pakistan must implement the solemn assurances it has given to stop all cross-border terrorism and to deliver on the words of President Musharraf in this Parliament on 12 September 2006."
"As one of the great democracies, India attracts the rage of extremists."
"This threat can be defeated only by the concerted efforts of our nations and agencies working together in close cooperation."
"I welcome the opportunities we have for deep engagement with India and for India’s wider regional role."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur most sincerely for his report."
"Two years ago, Parliament and the Commission opened a new chapter in relations between the Union and India, calling them a strategic partnership."
"At that time, I represented the European Parliament on a mission to India to prepare for the summit, confident that India was to become a strategic partner for us."
"It seemed an obvious choice."
"The two largest democracies in the world account together for over 1.5 million people, and are in a position to create a new world economic order."
"At the time, we promised each other growth in terms of mutual investments, trade exchanges, youth exchanges and cooperation between businesses and institutions of higher education."
"That all seemed eminently sensible."
"Are we working towards it?"
"The European Union wants to keep its place at the head of the world pack, though it is currently falling somewhat behind."
"Surely, therefore, its most important partner and market ought to be a country with a population of a billion, sustained economic growth above 7%, and where 50% of the population is under 20 years of age?"
"Has this become a reality?"
"Unfortunately, it has not."
"What became of our strategy for youth exchange and investment?"
"It never came about because a couple of countries took it into their heads that Russia should be our strategic partner."
"Russia is a country with a population of over 150 million, where the average age is close to 50; a country that is prepared to blackmail Europe by threatening to cut off gas and energy supplies."
"I call on Parliament and the Commission to review their policy and remain true to the agreements signed within the framework of a strategic partnership between the Union and India."
"Mr President, despite economic growth of between 5% and 7% per year, India remains a country of great contrasts."
"Sixty-five per cent of the population are farmers, and almost 70% of them live in rural areas."
"Although India comes close to the top of the list in terms of gifted engineers, IT specialists and scientists, about one third of its people are illiterate, and a large proportion of them are living in poverty."
"From the point of view of cooperation, these contrasts represent a unique mix of advantages for India, as it can draw on both an unskilled and a highly qualified cheap labour force."
"India has a population of over 1 billion and is the fourth largest economy in the world."
"Therefore, it ought to be an attractive partner for the Union where trade and investment are concerned."
"This potential is not fully exploited by European Union companies, which seem to have a strong preference for China."
"The Union’s trade with India amounts to less than 20% of its trade with China."
"These figures suggest that there is a great deal of under-exploited potential, but it is essential for the high duties on goods imported into India from the European Union to be lowered and for non-tariff barriers to be reduced."
"The Union has already declared itself in favour of significant concessions within the framework of WTO negotiations."
"The Indian authorities should strive to limit bureaucracy, as it hampers foreign investment."
"The lack of investment in transport and energy particularly hinders development, although these could be attractive areas for foreign investment."
"The Union could draw on its past experience to help resolve the problems associated with the significant imbalance in regional development in India, where the west and south of the country differ greatly from the east and the north."
"As we develop trade relationships, we must also promote respect for human rights in India."
"This is an important subject which should be raised at the forthcoming summit in October."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, direct foreign investment is an important factor in any country’s development."
"I come from one of the new Member States and I can definitely confirm that direct foreign investment has played a significant role in the current dynamic economic growth that we have experienced in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Indeed, the same applies to India, which is the third most attractive country in the world in terms of foreign investment, with Europe being one of the biggest investors, accounting for investments of more than EUR 1 billion in 2004."
"Despite this positive trend and many other improvements, however, foreign investors in India continue to face considerable problems."
"They have to struggle with municipal, regional and national bureaucracy, with oblique and frequently changing regulations, to the point where they are completely unable to invest in many sectors, one example being agriculture."
"I should like to call on the Indian authorities to alleviate this situation and to make it easier for foreign investors to enter the Indian market."
"As evidenced by the successful example of Central and Eastern Europe, this will be beneficial not only for investors but also for the countries into which investment flows, which in this case means India."
"Mr President, thank you for your comments, from which it is clear that we all attach great importance to comprehensive relations between the Union and India."
"Only last week, on 19 September 2006, the EU-India High Level Trade Group finalised its report to the 13 October 2006 EU-India Summit and concluded that an expanded trade partnership should be developed through the negotiation of a broad-based trade and investment agreement."
"This forms the basis for the High Level Trade Group's recommendation to the EU-India Summit."
"It augurs well for an agreement at the summit that there is a strong case for launching bilateral FTA negotiations and that the parties are ready to take the necessary steps to start negotiations."
"The areas forming the basis of bilateral EU-India relations, as covered by the three EU-India Subcommittee meetings, range from economic policy, dialogue and cooperation, including on industrial policy, science and technology, finance and monetary affairs, the environment, clean development and climate change, energy cooperation, information and communication technologies, civil aviation, maritime transport, space technology, agriculture and marine policy, customs, employment and social policy, business cooperation and development cooperation, to trade and investment and the bringing together of peoples and cultures."
"Many of those areas will no doubt form the subject of discussions at the EU-India Business Summit on 12 October 2006 and the Political Summit on 13 October 2006, with a view to making progress in all areas of EU-India relations."
"It is in our mutual interest to build on a rich history of experience and partnership with India."
"The issue of the free trade agreement with India presents us with a number of possibilities."
"An agreement with India would present various advantages, such as the consolidation of the European Union's privileged position in an important and growing market."
"India is the only major emerging economy with the European Union as both its largest trading partner and its largest investor."
"Whilst there have been sizeable reforms, access to India's market is still very restricted, with applied tariffs in certain sectors at over 30% and many caps on foreign direct investment (FDI) in the services sector."
"The reduction of tariffs for EU companies and the liberalisation of trade in services would secure access to a rapidly growing market and thereby contribute to competitiveness."
"A secondary benefit would be to lock in India's economic reforms to the advantage of its and the region's long-term economic growth."
"The visibility and economic benefits of an FTA with the European Union would support India's programme of reforms and provide a more stable investment climate."
"The Doha development agenda does not preclude bilateral free trade agreements, and the conclusion of such free trade agreements does not and would not prejudice the completion of the Doha development agenda."
"The European Union and India remain committed to the rules-based multilateral trading system."
"The successful outcome of the DDA multilateral trade negotiations remains their foremost trade-policy priority."
"India and the Union will continue to collaborate closely on mutual interests and to play leading roles regarding the DDA."
"In the speech which Commissioner Mandelson delivered in Berlin on 18 September 2006, he indicated that the central strand of the October trade policy review would argue that the EU should seek to build on and complement its commitment to the multilateral trading system with a new generation of bilateral free trade agreements with key growing markets."
"While Europe continues to be highly competitive in global export markets, European companies are losing ground in the highest technology products and the fastest growing markets."
"In rapidly growing regions such as Asia, the European Union is underperforming."
"There is now a case for new bilateral free trade agreements designed to deliver more open markets."
"FTAs can build on WTO multilateral liberalisation by addressing areas, such as trade and services, public procurement and competition policy, that are not yet fully addressed by WTO rules."
"In this respect, the deepening of EU-India bilateral trade relations supports the larger multilateral trading regime."
"Finally, as many of you have said during the discussion, strengthening EU-India relations represents a great hope: that of reducing the wealth gap existing in that country, of improving the conditions for workers and ensuring better standards of protection for all workers, in particular for women and children, and of improving the quality of life of the Indian people in general which, as has rightly been pointed out, is still such that 190 million people live on less than USD 1 a day."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"The sitting is now suspended. You may come to the Conference of Presidents, which starts at 5.30 p.m. and is open to all Members, in order to hear an exchange of views with the Prime Minister of Lebanon, Mr Siniora, on the situation in the Middle East."
"First, let me congratulate Mr Karim on his report on EU-India trade relations."
"In contrast to last month’s debate on EU-China relations, his work and report have been a model of cooperation and consensus and my Group and I will be supporting his report."
"I only have to apologise that I will be absent for tomorrow’s vote, as I will be attending the Labour Party Conference in Manchester."
"I have one general comment and two specific points on the report."
"First, we in the PSE Group do not want any hint that a bilateral FTA can substitute for a successful completion of the Doha Development Round."
"We know India is committed in this regard, but not all MEPs share that commitment."
"Secondly, while I offered a guarded welcome to back liberalisation, I share some of Mr Markov’s concerns as to the social impact on small farmers and businesses as preferential lending will end."
"If Mr Markov’s amendment had been more judiciously phrased it would have gained my support."
"Thirdly, I do not welcome India’s involvement in ITER."
"I believe the whole ITER Programme is mistaken and would have been delighted if it had gone to Japan so they would have wasted more of their money and we less of ours."
"I can only commiserate with the people of India."
"Given the strong ties which exist between my own Member State and India, I am naturally keen that the EU does all in its power to help India realise its enormous potential for economic development."
"Having had the privilege to visit India on a number of occasions, I have been deeply impressed by the rate of economic development there over recent years and particularly in key 21st century industries such as information technology."
"I am pleased at the progress which was made in building dialogue at the sixth India-EU summit last year."
"Improving economic and trade relations will prove to be of mutual benefit to both the EU and India, but it is essential that a key objective of our contribution to economic development is the eradication of poverty."
"This must be maintained as a top priority of our strategic partnership."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on his report."
"The next item is the report (A6-0254/2006) by Mrs Breyer, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on perspectives of women in international trade (2006/2009(INI))."
"– Madam President, I would take the liberty of tabling a procedural motion at the start of our debate on Mrs Breyer’s report."
"My remark concerns the translation, into the various official languages of the European Union, of the motion for a resolution on women and international trade."
"I have worked with the Slovak, English, German and French versions, and there are a few paragraphs that have been translated in a totally different way."
"I would be pleased if the services could usefully check the quality of the translations."
"Thank you; that is, of course, a very important point."
"The services will check to see that everything is indeed in order."
". – Madam President, I can do no other than endorse the point of order, for there are considerable differences between one translation and another."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although I would have liked the Commissioner with responsibility for trade policy to be here to listen to this evening’s debate, for the subject is very much one of his own, I do hope that this will not be the last time that it is debated in this House."
"Globalisation and the liberalisation of world trade are not gender-neutral, and so I am glad to be able to present this own-initiative report on ‘perspectives of women in international trade’ on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"The relationship between gender and trade is a new subject not only for women, but also for governments and those who make trade policy, and also for us in this House, so it is high time that we address it and debate the question of what influence global trade has on equal opportunities policy and vice versa."
"In the report, you will find many suggestions for practical things to do about the gender blindness of international trade, and I would like to emphasise the fact that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality adopted it unanimously."
"It highlights the need for coherence between the objective of European equality policy and the goals of trade, development policy and aid programmes if equal opportunities for women and men are to be promoted."
"Of all the poor in the world, 70% are women; their gender means that they do not have the same opportunity to acquire property, land or education, and they suffer many kinds of discrimination on the labour market, and their situation can only be made worse by market liberalisation and the extension of international trading relations that take insufficient account of the structural discrimination against women."
"To well-educated women, globalisation has brought new vocational opportunities, but liberalised markets have made poorer women’s living conditions even worse."
"Microcredit and development aid will amount to no more than a drop in the ocean if we do not make a start on making fundamental changes to these global economic structures."
"Trade policy involves the EU in representing the interests of the Member States at many levels and in negotiating treaties, for example as part of the WTO negotiations."
"Although it, in the past, set milestones for equality of opportunity in Europe, there is a yawning gulf when it comes to realising this principle in global trade policy."
"The Committee on Women’s Rights is unwilling to tolerate this silence any longer."
"As a first step, we demand gender mainstreaming in international trade policy, with explicit monitoring and assessment mechanisms, the latter of which might, for example, involve ranking the Member States in terms of their promotion of gender equity on the labour market."
"In order that the objective of equality should not be voided of all meaning, a department for gender equity and trade should be set up within the Commission, with one of its functions to be the provision of gender-disaggregated statistical data."
"We call on the Commission to present an annual progress report on equality in international trade, and also to set up a fund to help women get access to loans and education."
"Politicians without money are no more than poets, so, as a responsible trade policy can be brought about only by transparent flows of funds, we demand the introduction of gender budgeting, that being a budget policy that takes gender justice seriously, something we regard as indispensable at every level of trade policy."
"The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality intends to organise a hearing on the subject next week."
"The intention is that the EU should become a beacon of equality in international trade policy, just as it has already become for equal opportunities for women in Europe, and that the Commission should play an active part in countering discrimination against women, which will involve ensuring that European companies with overseas production centres and also benefiting from EU market access programmes do not have a hand in the inhumane exploitation of women."
"It is also important that the EU, before entering into trade agreements, should undertake a gender-specific analysis of the position of women."
"We in the EU must not promote businesses that use women while committing flagrant breaches of their rights."
"We know that international trading organisations, businesses and structures are dominated by men."
"If women are to achieve equality with men in terms of their access to power and occupying of decision-making positions, then quotas are still indispensable; effective quotas that represent more than lip-service will help to establish gender parity in international trade relations, and so I am glad that the Committee on Women’s Rights has drawn on an initiative taken in Norway, where companies quoted on the stock exchange have been required, with effect from 2006, to increase to 40% the percentage of women on supervisory boards."
"If this House adopts the resolution on women in international trade, it would be a great triumph and an important step on the road to gender justice."
"We will have to bring pressure to bear on the Commission to get it to do as Parliament demands."
"I wish to thank all Members for their positive attitude towards this report, their support for it and their suggestions, and I hope that we may be able to achieve a satisfactory outcome when we vote on it tomorrow."
"Madam President, my colleague, Commissioner Mandelson, regrets not being able to be here for this very important debate, but he has had to travel to the United States for multilateral discussions."
"The European Commission welcomes the report of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
"For the European Union, the purpose of global governance is to make possible development that is socially, economically and environmentally sustainable."
"That is why we wish to promote policies that provide sustainable responses to gender-based issues, whether they are countries’ domestic policies in some cases backed by international aid, common policies such as those forming the building blocks of the European Union, or international commitments."
"Trade liberalisation has provided new opportunities for many women in developing countries, providing new employment and in many cases reducing the gender gap in wages, leading to greater empowerment and social standing of women in society."
"Nonetheless, the rapid changes in national economies that can result from globalisation also provide challenges to policy-makers to ensure that the benefits and opportunities of globalisation are maximised and the short-term costs in certain sectors are minimised."
"The European Commission believes that clear social conditions underpin sustainable productivity growth and promote the efficient production of high-quality goods and services generating a net added value."
"Policies that mitigate the adverse effects of a changing economy on specific groups of people or regions, good social services and social protection accessible to all, social dialogue, the respect for fundamental social rights including core labour standards, minimum standards for working conditions and for ensuring workers’ upstream involvement in managing change – all these play a crucial role."
"The European Commission promotes core labour rights in EU trade policy."
"Core labour standards are defined by the ILO to include Convention No 100 on equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value, and Convention No 111 on discrimination in the workplace."
"In the multilateral context, a reference to core labour standards was included in the declaration of the first World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in Singapore in 1996."
"Regrettably, WTO members did not agree to include this issue as part of the Doha Development Agenda."
"Nevertheless, the Commission is committed to addressing trade and social development, core labour standards and commitment to meaningful dialogue between the WTO and the International Labour Organization, both in the EU’s own trade policy review and the trade policy reviews of other countries."
"As part of this process, the International Convention of Free Trade Unions’ reports on core labour standards are prepared ahead of each trade policy review."
"The Commission is also strongly in favour of observer status for the ILO in the WTO."
"The European Commission has also pursued social development objectives in regional, bi-regional and bilateral arrangements."
"All its most recent agreements recognise and promote social rights as part of the universal objective of decent work for all."
"The Commission has, for example, entered into dialogue and cooperation with countries such as Chile, South Africa and bi-regionally with the ACP countries, the Gulf Cooperation Council, Mercosur and other regions."
"The European Commission remains of the view that the discussion and pursuit of social issues should not be used for protectionist purposes and it rejects any unilateral sanctions-based approach."
"The objective is to further social progress with a view to promoting benefits for all."
"Since 1998 the EC has also been granting trade preferences under the Generalised System of Preferences, special incentive arrangements to those developing countries that assure the respect of the core labour rights as defined by the ILO and comply with international recognised standards on sustainable forest management."
"Currently, some 180 developing countries and dependent territories are granted GSP."
"In the framework of the new GSP scheme, adopted on 27 June 2005 by the Council, a GSP-plus initiative for sustainable development provides additional tariff preferences for countries that have signed and effectively implemented UN and ILO conventions on human rights and labour rights, including those on gender equality."
"A total of 15 countries have ratified the core conventions and received GSP-plus status."
"A gender helpdesk currently operates under the RELEX family of the Commission."
"The services of the gender helpdesk are part of a larger effort to build capacity and knowledge to promote gender equality and fully implement the strategy of gender mainstreaming."
"A tool kit has also been published to give practical help to Commission staff on how to mainstream gender issues."
"The EC is also developing a close relationship with the International Labour Organization on trade-related matters aimed at promoting core labour standards through assessment, capacity-building and enforcement in developing countries."
"In 2005-2006 the Commission has been funding an ILO pilot project aiming to develop decent work indicators in developing countries for examining the relationship between decent work and trade liberalisation."
"Case studies have been undertaken in the Philippines and Uganda."
"The data gathered include disaggregated statistics on employment, wages and working hours for women and men."
"These data provide a more sophisticated picture of decent work than previously available."
"The Commission will explore the potential to use these indicators in future aid programmes with developing countries to help them manage social adjustment to globalisation, and the report will be submitted to the European Parliament."
"The European Commission will also look into the potential for using decent work indicators as part of trade sustainability impact assessments."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, I am grateful to our fellow Member, Mrs Breyer, for her motion for a resolution, which was unanimously adopted within my committee."
"The globalisation and liberalisation of the economy do not just make successes out of people."
"That is why I ask what place the weakest have in society and what resources there are to promote a solidarity economy."
"Politicians and economists must be creative in their efforts to ensure that men and women can really flourish and must promote the common public good without excessive government interference, which would harm the national economies."
"Paragraphs 15 and 26 mention the classification of the Member States."
"That is provocative."
"However, since 1951, this classification has appeared in the International Labour Organisation conventions signed by the Member States of the European Union."
"The paragraphs that deal with the relations with third countries emphasise that women, as economic players, must be recognised in all of the activities they carry out in terms of personal, family and educational development and in all of the duties they perform within society."
"The unpaid and informal work done by women deserves greater recognition in European policies."
"This resolution also reminds us that we, in the West, must avoid at all costs any form of neo-colonialism and that we must respect the cultures of our economic partners, while ensuring the abolition of all forms of discrimination between men and women."
"That is why I encourage my group to endorse this resolution in the hope that, in the not too distant future, the political declarations on equality between men and women will finally be reflected in economic life."
"Madam President, as a result of the roles and duties traditionally ascribed to women and men in certain societies, women continue to be deprived of access to education and proper health care."
"They are also being denied the means to improve their financial situation."
"This is supported by statistics, according to which 70% of those living in poverty in the world are women, which is a very high proportion."
"In spite of these figures, many people still fail to appreciate that a lack of equality between the sexes clearly has a negative impact on development in the long term."
"This is because lack of equality between the sexes means that women do not have equal access to the market means of production and that, in relation to social and political issues, they are not part of the decision-making process."
"This situation has a negative impact on long term development."
"International trade can also help to ensure that the economic potential of the whole of society is exploited by promoting the involvement of women in the economic, social and political spheres."
"In this respect, cohesion between the aims of European policy on gender equality and the aims of its trade and development policy is particularly important."
"Ensuring that women can play their rightful part in the economy is crucial if we are to strengthen the position of women and overcome structural discrimination."
"To this end, the European Commission should strive not only to include the issue of gender equality in international trade strategies, but also to introduce transparent systems for their monitoring and control."
"By setting a good example, which I trust will become the norm in time, the European Union can demonstrate to third countries that women must not be treated as second class citizens and must have the opportunity to benefit from full access to the market, to credit and to capital goods."
"In addition, it is important for both the institutions of the European Union and the Member States to include gender equality and equal opportunity issues in the aims identified within the framework of all European funding programmes."
"The Member States should make an effort to develop national political measures that will foster gender equality and increase female employment."
"The Norwegian Government’s decision to bring in a law requiring 40% female representation on the boards of joint stock companies is a splendid example to follow and should be emulated by other Member States."
"It should also become the subject of a regulation at Community level."
"Women must have an equal right to participate in economic life, especially in the poorest countries."
"Potentially helpful measures include universal access to so-called ‘micro-credits’, which would help to combat poverty amongst women, promote self-sufficiency and raise their social status."
"In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that it is important to ensure that women are appropriately represented at government level in the Member States of the European Union and in international organisations."
"This would ensure that gender issues and problems which primarily affect women are taken into account within the framework of trade negotiations at global level."
"I should also like to sincerely congratulate Mrs Breyer on a very well prepared document."
"Madam President, one of the basic truths of our society is gender inequality."
"This gender power structure is present in every aspect of our society and it hampers growth and every kind of sustainability."
"Of the people living in poverty in the world, almost three out of four are women, so equal opportunities for women and men is not just an issue of human rights or some sort of luxury."
"When every other problem is solved it is crucial for our common future."
"This report by my colleague Mrs Breyer, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, is a very good starting point for the urgent work ahead in the specific area of trade relations in the world."
"As she points out, women in general experience more difficulties in gaining access to education, property, credit, other resources and factors of production, as well as political decision-making bodies, and these inequalities restrict women’s ability to use the advantages of trade liberalisation."
"For instance, a large number of women throughout the world are denied opportunities to improve their economic and social conditions and, at the same time, many of them have the added responsibility of caring for children and the household."
"A majority of the farmers in the world are women!"
"A structural change in the EU’s common agricultural policy is an important strengthening of these women in third world countries."
"However, gender inequality is not just something that exists in poor countries: the representation of women in politics and business is also very low in the Member States of the Union."
"In order to raise the discussion of quotas to a new level, we must consider that this instrument can be used in a number of different ways."
"As I see it, the quota instrument should be used only when every other way has been tested and proved unsuccessful."
"Like the rapporteur, I welcome the Norwegian Government’s decision to impose by law a 40% quota for female representation on the boards of joint stock companies."
"But, basically, this report addresses a number of issues concerning the systematic and thoroughly unjust gender inequality affecting international trade relations."
"It includes a number of very precise suggestions, which I believe could really make a difference in a political world so much characterised by words and empty promises."
"It will make for good reading in the Commission and in the Council."
"Finally, let me just say:"
"I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Breyer for her excellent report and for the fact that she has raised an incredibly important issue concerning trade and the ways in which WTO and GATS agreements, together with IMF decisions, affect people's lives and ability to provide for themselves."
"In the same way as the agreements are often beneficial to industrialised countries and harmful to developing countries, women and men are, in different ways, placed at, respectively, a disadvantage or advantage by trade agreements."
"By tradition, world trade is men’s arena."
"The board of the IMF consists entirely of men, and 91.7% of the World Bank’s board is male."
"Trade and gender are connected in a host of ways that we need to study if we are to understand how people in different places, of different genders and from different social classes are affected by trade agreements."
"Gender is relevant because gender relations affect the distribution of, and access to, resources, work, income and power."
"Gender affects our behaviour as economic actors."
"Men and women react differently to economic changes."
"Financial institutions are not only dominated by men."
"More importantly, they continue and maintain gender structures in the economy."
"Men’s and women’s work is valued differently."
"Women’s work in the reproductive sphere is unpaid and has been rendered invisible."
"These factors mean that women and men are affected differently, and a gender analysis is therefore incredibly important if we are to be able to design a trade policy that promotes equality and breaks down patriarchal structures."
"Women’s role in the economy must be made visible."
"Trade policy negotiations must take practical account of all the conventions, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women."
"Madam President, like other European Union documents, the report on prospects for women in international trade confirms that liberalisation, globalisation, and the free market are a paradise open only to very rich, well-educated and powerful individuals who are totally bereft of scruples."
"This is borne out by one of the report’s conclusions, which states that only highly qualified women benefit from trade liberalisation, and that the rest of the male and female population, which is generally not affluent, tends to be exploited and subjected to propaganda."
"This is all the more disturbing because it is happening behind a façade of lofty ideals such as human rights, equal rights, equal opportunities for all, equal treatment in the workplace and many other popular slogans that are, on the whole, light years removed from reality."
"World trade influences women’s social status today in the same way as it does for all of those who are involved in some form of economic activity."
"Trade liberalisation has had its benefits and its drawbacks."
"The benefits associated with trade liberalisation and globalisation as far as women are concerned include, in particular, new and often well-paying jobs."
"Employed women generally become more independent and self-confident, their social status improves, and they become more aware of their rights."
"Compared with men, however, their compensation is in most cases 20 to 50% lower for the same work."
"In the majority of instances, trade liberalisation benefits only big business."
"As female entrepreneurs are most often employed in the management of small- and medium-sized companies, they effectively benefit from the opening up of markets only to a limited degree."
"What has the World Trade Organisation done to further gender equality policy and make it a part of the WTO agenda?"
"The answer is, very little."
"According to the WTO, trade is a neutral area, based on the assumption that trade and market liberalisation are gender neutral, which means that gender equality policy has no direct involvement with this area."
"In this context, I think the WTO should pay more attention to gender equality in the future."
"It is interesting to note that almost all WTO Member States have signed the Beijing Platform for Action."
"Its implementation, however, is more than a formality."
"It is necessary to keep in mind women’s contribution to international trade."
"Women in general, and educated, multilingual women in particular have excellent communication and negotiation skills, and as managers they employ methods that are different from their male counterparts."
"Even though the participation of women in private sector trade is remarkable, we need to increase the number of women working in international organisations, such as the WTO, International Monetary Fund, World Bank and other institutions dealing with trade and business."
"This should ensure that women are not only part of the production process but also part of the decision-making process, and not only at lower levels but also in executive and managerial positions."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, every day thousands of people, mainly women and children, die due to poverty."
"The figures are startling: 2.5 billion people living on less than USD 2 per day, and, as I said, most of them are women."
"Poverty lies at the root of the trafficking of women and children, sexual slavery and gender-based violence."
"It leads to the non-completion of schooling, to child labour, to increased numbers of children in danger, to illegal immigration, to fundamentalism and to terrorism."
"Without financial independence, there is neither freedom nor equality."
"Women, and especially young women, are easily recruited by international criminal gangs, who promise them well-paid jobs in wealthy countries only to throw them into forced prostitution."
"Women do not generally benefit from globalisation, which tends to favour workers with good qualifications. Rather, they tend to suffer the detrimental consequences of the liberalisation of trade."
"This is a most timely report, on which I should like to congratulate Mrs Breyer."
"It contains important proposals, of which I wish to highlight the use of microcredit as a means of reducing poverty."
"Microfinancing instruments have proved effective in combating poverty and it is women who have benefited most and benefited best, and have succeeded in improving their families’ economic situation."
"Unemployed women and those on low incomes – that is to say, women without access to the usual financial institutions, as is the case with most women in developing countries – have benefited particularly."
"Studies have shown that women can take part in economic decision-making."
"Further studies show that companies with women on their boards have gained better results."
"Let us, too, follow the example of Norway, as mentioned earlier."
"– Madam President, not very long ago now, a report on trade and poverty put in an appearance in this House, and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality tabled a number of very good amendments to it, all of which were adopted."
"It is with that in mind that I would like to thank Mrs Breyer for this own-initiative report, which is the logical response to the imperative need for the issue of the relative roles of trade and women to be once more addressed."
"Nothing will be done about the problem of the unequal treatment of women for as long as there is no radical rethinking of economic and trade policies."
"Do you remember trade agreements?"
"There was the Agnoletto report, which stated that human rights clauses should be incorporated in all international treaties."
"Since there are both individual and social human rights, it follows that it is justified – to say the least – that all trade agreements should include clauses on human beings’ social rights, namely the right to education, the right to training, and the right to free health care."
"If you want those things – and we do – then you cannot, of course, want to implement a European services directive that makes them into market commodities and hence dependent on people’s ability to pay for them."
"It is quite clear that that approach is eventually going to be taken to GATS, so that women in certain countries will be denied what opportunities they currently have, for those countries will not have the financial resources."
"Turning to the subject of quotas, these are always crutches, but they can be bridges."
"That I can tell you from my own experience as a member of the left-wing PDS party in the Federal Republic of Germany, which applies a 50% quota to all its parliamentarians, and that is something that should be brought in everywhere, for if it were, we and our society would have achieved a major advance."
"Madam President, the role and perspectives of women in international trade is something that has yet to be sufficiently analysed or promoted by the governments or those responsible for commercial policy."
"Little is known about the impact of trade on women, and neither do we know anything about the effect of trade on gender inequalities."
"We have seen very few examples of concrete policies in the sector for promoting equality between men and women."
"This lack of knowledge is due to the lack of sufficient data differentiated by gender in the statistics on trade and also the lack of a gender perspective in economic models and analyses."
"It is possible and necessary to contribute to gender equality by means of trade."
"In this regard, we applaud, for example, the Norwegian Government’s decision to impose by law a 40% quota for women’s participation on the boards of directors of limited companies."
"In my country, Spain, too, a law is being negotiated, known as the equality law, which includes making it obligatory for there to be a balanced presence of men and women on the management boards of commercial companies, a balanced presence meaning that there must be no more than 60% of either sex and no less than 40%."
"We therefore applaud Mrs Breyer’s amendment urging the Commission also to draw up a legislative proposal of this nature."
"I would like to take this opportunity, Mrs Breyer, to congratulate you most warmly on your work."
"Madam President, even if we speak frequently about gender inequality issues, the role of women in international trade is neglected, and that is why I would like to congratulate the rapporteur because she raised that very important issue, which is very rarely debated."
"Women are often negatively affected by the process of globalisation, as we heard, and I absolutely agree on that."
"They do not have the same access to education and employment, and are not properly involved in trade."
"They are often excluded from the decision-making process and from services."
"As we know, only highly educated women benefit from liberalised trade, and women all over the world often suffer from the side-effects of globalisation and liberalisation."
"That is why we all agree that equal treatment should become a reality, and in order to achieve it, clear monitoring of employment policies is necessary, together with collecting gender-disaggregated data."
"Trade can be identified as one of the six priority areas for development policy."
"Achieving gender equality is the key to development in general."
"The strategy of gender mainstreaming is a long-term, step-by-step approach, based on integrating gender issues into both the political and the practical areas."
"Development effectiveness requires that gender analysis should be systematically integrated into the conception, implementation and evaluation of all development strategies."
"Development effectiveness makes it appropriate to envisage specific activities aimed at ensuring adequate attention to gender issues across the mainstream of Community financial instruments, which should increasingly assume responsibility for these key questions."
"Strengthened women’s representation and participation in economic and political life contributes significantly to poverty reduction and development and creates more hope for a better future for the next generation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, economic liberalisation provided the basis for Estonia’s rapid growth."
"Liberalisation is now the motor for the economies of Europe and the world, but success has its price, which is increased emotional and economic pressure on families, the uncertainty of labour relations and social stratification."
"Globalisation affects women more than it does men, as has been mentioned here."
"Women bear a disproportionate share of unpaid work."
"Their role in making political and economic decisions, however, is unjustifiably small."
"This argument, which until now has taken place mostly on the level of emotions and beliefs, requires more facts."
"The compilation of a scientific ranking of gender equity in the labour market would be an effective measure for the reduction of inequality, but one must also find the facts on one’s own."
"I have for some time called on Estonian society to set the objective of 40% female participation in the councils of companies."
"What is possible in Norway could become a reality throughout the world."
"The report also states the same position."
"Europe’s message should be simple and unanimous – gender inequality is a thing of the past."
"That is indeed the message of the report, which is an excellent document from which to move forward."
"Madam President, I thank the honourable Members of Parliament for their comments on this significant area which touches upon many important facets over and above trade issues."
"I should like to refer to some points raised during tonight's discussion."
"As to the issue of European companies that profit from EU market access programmes, within the framework of EU cooperation policy that should not contribute to the exploitation of women employees, I must underline that recent EU cooperation agreements include commitments to the ILO core conventions on labour standards."
"The EU has included commitments to the ILO core labour standards in all its recent bilateral trade agreements and the GSP and the GSP-plus, which provide trade preferences to developing countries that ratify ILO conventions."
"On the impact of trade liberalisation, I should like to underline that this has provided new opportunities for many women in developing countries, providing new employment and, in many cases, reducing the gender gap in wages leading to greater empowerment and social standing of women in society."
"The evidence suggests that over one million women in India have increased their social standing as a result of trade openings."
"The majority of these are from poor backgrounds."
"Let me now turn to the inclusion of gender equality in international trade policies, the European Union has been a strong supporter of the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises and more generally of the integration of decent work and social issues in the OECD investment activities."
"We remain in favour of observer status for the ILO in the WTO, though we have to acknowledge that there is resistance from other members."
"On gender-impact assessments, gender has been included in recent trade sustainability impact assessments."
"As quality of gender data increases, the trade SIAs will be strengthened in the future, and certainly progress can be made in this area."
"That is why the Commission will explore the potential of decent work indicators, including data on the work of women and men."
"As regards the question of gender budgeting as a standard tool in budgetary policies, the Commission will respond in writing."
"On the issue of gender budgeting more generally, that is an issue that covers many different areas of operation."
"However, we look forward to hearing about the progress made on this issue from the European Parliament and we will follow the committee’s work with interest."
"With reference to the 40% quota for women on boards of joint stock companies, as in Norway, I must point out that this is primarily a matter for the individual Member States."
"Finally, with regard to the formation of a formal trade and gender desk within DG Trade, I must underline again that within the Commission DG RELEX leads on the monitoring of human rights in third countries."
"DG Trade liaises regularly with the RELEX family on human rights with regard to trade agreements, such as GSP, and liaises with the International Labour Organization and DG Employment on labour rights with regard to trade agreements."
"The European Union, in fact, withdrew GSP from Myanmar for serious and systematic violations of the ILO core labour rights and this shows that the system currently in operation works well."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0266/2006) by Mr Guerreiro, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry (2006/2110(INI))."
". – Madam President, I should first like to thank all the members of the Committee on Fisheries who made this report on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry possible."
"The report was adopted unanimously. I also wish to thank all of the organisations in the sector, who, by staunchly protecting fisheries and the workers in the sector, have helped the report to include a range of proposals that we feel address the serious social and economic crisis facing the sector."
"We hope that Parliament will support that result in tomorrow’s vote."
"Just a few days ago, at a meeting with a delegation from the Committee on Fisheries in the Algarve, representatives from the sector gave a description of the situation, which can be summed up as follows: the fishing industry is facing a serious economic and social crisis that has been getting worse over the years."
"This difficult situation has been exacerbated by rising production costs, in particular the cost of fuel, along with the stagnation of first-sale prices, all of which threatens the financial viability of many firms and has had a terrible impact on crews, whose wages depend on income from catches and, to a large extent, on the cost of fuel."
"The common fisheries policy has fallen short, by promoting the regular, significant scrapping of vessels, resulting in thousands of fishermen leaving a sector that is of strategic importance to some Member States."
"What is needed is to reverse the common fisheries policy pursued to date, in that it should acknowledge the particular characteristics of each country’s fishing industry and the right to fish sustainably while allowing fish stocks to recover."
"The policy should be aimed at feeding the people, full employment, improving the social conditions of the workers, and ensuring the sustainability of companies."
"The sector will move forward if practical measures are put in place: emergency measures to address the sharp rises in fuel prices, such as the creation of the guarantee fund, direct temporary support to offset the cost of diesel fuel and petrol, and an increase in aid under the rule."
"There should also be a range of measures to guarantee the income of those working in the sector, for example in the setting of first-sale prices, which entails a review of the current rules of the common organisation of the market in fishery products."
"Studies should be carried out aimed at identifying measures to increase the value of fish, with a view to channelling the added value into the manufacturing sector without the consumer being penalised."
"Support should be provided for modernising and renewing national fishing fleets, which would mean a definitive end to the policy of the indiscriminate scrapping of vessels."
"There also needs to be a targeted support programme for traditional, small-scale inshore fishing."
"These were the measures proposed by the sector at its meeting with Parliament."
"Although it has described the situation in the industry as serious, the Commission has proposed measures that fall well short of addressing it."
"The difficulties currently facing the fishing sector are rooted mainly in the problem of the cost structure, as costs are high in relation to the income obtained."
"These costs have suddenly been exacerbated by the steep rise in the cost of fuel, which is why the proposed solution of reducing fishing effort and adapting – in other words, cutting – the fleet will not solve the problem."
"What is needed is to improve the economic situation in the sector, which above all means addressing the problem of the balance between falling incomes and rising operational costs in the sector."
"Similarly, given that successive restrictions on fishing have served to worsen the economic situation in the sector, albeit this is not the only factor, it is difficult to understand why they would be even considered, let alone accepted, as measures to improve the economic situation in the sector."
"As the sector itself has highlighted, extraordinary situations demand extraordinary measures, and that means exhausting all possibilities and stretching the financial limits of the Community budget this year, not least because what is at stake is a common Community policy, the common fisheries policy, which, to be consistent, should be responsible for funding its own costs, within the framework of the European Fisheries Fund."
"I shall finish by stating once again that the fisheries sector has potential and a future and it should not be pitted against aquaculture."
"New priorities demand more resources and new resources."
"Madam President, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Guerreiro, for his report, and the Fisheries Committee for having taken up this important subject in the form of an own-initiative report."
"It brings a significant contribution to the ongoing debate on the economic situation of the European Union fishing sector."
"I also noted with satisfaction that the Conference of Committee Chairmen expressed its appreciation of the Commission’s communication on the economic difficulties of the sector."
"The Conference of Committee Chairmen welcomed the positions expressed by the Commission in its communication, in which it envisages a number of possibilities for aiding the sector in the short term, in the existing context of Community legislation on State aids; in particular, our willingness to examine the national rescue and restructuring aid schemes, submitted by Member States in the two years following publication of the communication."
"I shall therefore also touch upon some of the recommendations of the Conference of Committee Chairmen, which converge largely with those of the report we are discussing."
"We share the same concerns and objectives regarding the fishing sector."
"We agree with many of the proposals and assessments contained in your report, although we have different views and perspectives on some others regarding, for instance, the short-term support to be given to the sector."
"Let me state from the beginning that I strongly disagree with the statement that the Commission appears to take advantage of the current economic crisis to reduce the size of the fishing fleet."
"By calling a spade a spade, by highlighting the state that the Community fishery is in because of years of over-fishing, we are not taking advantage of anything."
"I also find unfair the suggestion that we have done too little, too late."
"The imbalance between fleet capacity and available resources and the oil price increase are objective causes of the current difficulties faced by the sector."
"The Commission has done everything possible to help the sector, taking into account the parameters of Community legislation and the need to ensure that the aid actually contributes to fishing sustainability."
"No mandatory capacity reductions are foreseen under Community law."
"Indeed, our challenge has been to balance the necessity to help the segments most affected by high oil prices with the need to address long-term structural problems."
"We have, therefore, sought to design instruments to rescue and restructure fishing enterprises in difficulty, to help them adapt and become profitable within the context of high oil prices."
"It is no use giving aid to fishing enterprises in difficulty if they do not, or cannot, undertake the restructuring that will make them profitable again."
"For that reason, we have excluded from the rescue schemes all forms of operating aid, which apart from going against Community legislation, will only prolong the problem without solving it."
"Action can be taken in the short term by Member States willing to provide support for financial and physical restructuring of fishing enterprises in difficulty, in the framework of national rescue and restructuring schemes."
"That is precisely meant to allow fishing enterprises in difficulty to obtain loan capital and bail them out, as requested both in your report and in that of the Conference of Committee Chairmen on the work programme of the Commission."
"The Community is strongly committed to these rescue and restructuring schemes, since Community funds will be available mainly through the European Fisheries Fund, to cofinance the restructuring of fishing enterprises, as well as to alleviate their social consequences."
"Socio-economic support can indeed be provided through the EFF, as requested in your report."
"The new EFF will also provide for more advantageous conditions for scrapping vessels, which was a concern expressed both in your report and that of the Conference of Committee Chairmen."
"Besides EFF support, we have worked hard to establish new rules for aid, in collaboration with the Commission’s other services, in order to facilitate the handling of small State aid schemes by Member States."
"This goes in the direction of your request, which point was also made by the Conference of Committee Chairmen."
"You must appreciate that our proposal already represents a tenfold increase on the former threshold, which was fixed less than two years ago."
"We have also noted the request for a specific treatment of the long-distance fleet, expressed both in your report and that of the Committee Chairmen."
"We are prepared to consider if, and under what conditions, a special register for this segment of the fleet would be justified."
"Beyond the rescue and restructuring of fishing firms in difficulty, we must create in the long term an environment that is conducive to their sustainable success."
"The communication therefore highlights some policy areas that I want to develop in the coming years to create this more favourable environment."
"I am not going to repeat them here, but I would like to highlight some areas where our views converge."
"We fully agree on the need to better involve fishermen in the management of fisheries."
"That is crucial for the success of the reformed common fisheries policy and I am determined to move in that direction."
"Due attention will also be paid to the financing of regional advisory councils’ operation."
"In line with your recommendations, we have taken serious steps to strengthen the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) at international level."
"Our 2002 action plan is being updated and a new piece of legislation is being considered."
"That has been given high priority in our agenda."
"We share the view that small-scale coastal fishing has specificities that deserve to be taken into account."
"We have done it extensively, both in the rescue and restructuring schemes and in the EFF."
"We have launched a study to assess objectively whether more can be done."
"We also agree with you that special attention needs to be paid to marketing, with a view to increasing the added value of fishing products for fishermen."
"As mentioned also by the Conference of Committee Chairmen, research should also be pursued in the Seventh Framework Programme to help address some of the most important challenges of the sector."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank you once again for your contributions and interest."
"They demonstrate how much we all strive to ensure a sustainable and healthy future for the fishing sector."
"I am looking forward to a fruitful discussion with you."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, the fishing industry uses a great deal of energy, and as such it has been especially badly hit by the rise in fuel prices, a problem that has worsened an already precarious economic situation."
"A challenge such as that faced by this sector requires solutions that, in trying to improve the situation, do not make matters worse."
"I refer to responses such as across-the-board regulations that are cannot be properly monitored or that are ill-matched to the specific conditions of the sector that they are regulating. Rather, what are needed are regulations that take account of particular situations in all their complexity."
"It is generally held that the best way forward is to reduce fishing effort, to use more selective methods, and to introduce positive discrimination in favour of local, small-scale fishing, which is the best way of keeping fish fresh."
"In the case in question, however, these general objectives may have to be achieved by means of an increase in the engine capacity and the size of the vessels, which will afford more comfort and safety at work, and by means of investment in diversification into activities such as tourism."
"An overly detailed, centralised legislative fabric, far removed from its practical implementation and its actual impact on the situations it is designed to regulate, leads to a proliferation of illegal, unreported and unregulated catches within and outside the Community area. This in turn widens the gap between the imagined world of the legislation and the real world of the European fish market."
"The common fisheries policy needs to be thoroughly decentralised and local fishermen, their representative bodies and the fishing communities must be much more involved in this policy and in improving fisheries management."
"According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation’s manual on preserving the quality of fish, the key principle of a sustainable fisheries policy is to prevent the tragedy of the commons; in other words, if something has no known owner, be it buffalo or fish, everyone will rush to exploit it and will eventually destroy it."
"Consequently, it is only by extending responsibility to fishermen and involving them directly that we can think of improving their economic situation on a sustainable basis."
"I agree with the rapporteur’s idea that in regard to improving the economic condition of the fishery sector we need to table the proposals for the attainment of objectives both in the immediate future and in the follow-up monitoring of the measures aimed at triggering material changes in the medium- and long-term."
"Since the sector is especially sensitive to the impact of natural conditions, we must develop a system of compensation for losses incurred due to factors beyond our control."
"It is necessary to develop a national and Community-level state insurance system that would help the fishery sector survive in the face of natural crises."
"Similar measures have already been put in place in other sectors."
"I would like to say that I fully support the short-time measures proposed by the rapporteur."
"As for long-time measures, sufficient investment in the framework fisheries research program is of paramount importance, especially with a view to enhancing energy efficiency."
"The European Fisheries Fund should continue aiding the upgrading and modernisation of the European Fleet."
"In this respect I would like to draw your attention to the need to thoroughly consider the proposals included in the previous resolutions of the European Parliament."
"."
"Madam President, fishing-dependent communities in Scotland have suffered a drastic downturn in their economic wellbeing in recent years, directly as a result of political decisions made under the common fisheries policy – decisions made with the active cooperation of the Scottish and the UK Governments."
"Large numbers of vessels have been forcibly scrapped, the remainder are forcibly restricted to ports for half of each month; and, on top of all that, fuel prices have drastically increased."
"The effect on fishing communities, on the families who depend upon the catching and processing sectors, has been very serious and very stressful."
"Regrettably, Scotland’s coastal communities continue to suffer while its own Government repeatedly declines to make use of available opportunities to make financial assistance available."
"Our rapporteur takes the view that greater decentralisation of the CFP would be an improvement, and I agree that would be a step in the right direction."
"However, ultimately, I regret to say that the CFP is destined to fail; and the scrapping of the CFP, coupled with a change in government in Scotland, is the only hope for fishing communities in the long-term future in Scotland."
". – Madam President, allow me to congratulate my colleague, Mr Guerreiro, on his report, which is remarkable and very thorough."
"Let us be clear."
"Fishing in general, and small-scale fishing in particular, are, in Europe, in danger of dying out."
"If nothing is done, there will no longer be any small-scale fishermen in 15 years’ time within the territory of the European Union."
"If there are no longer any small-scale fishermen, then all of the tourist and economic activity from sales by auction and specialist catering will also disappear."
"Without the presence of those who are, first and foremost, sea lovers, the odds are that the Member States’ territorial waters will be abandoned, in that case, to the atrocities of the hooligans of the sea, who fear neither God nor man."
"How can one fail to understand the desire of some people to see fishing disappear when it is clear that the disappearance of certain fishing ports could offer new prospects of developing the pleasure-boat market, something that would not leave the particularly influential economic and financial interests indifferent?"
"In order to support my argument and to prove that the aim is indeed one of putting paid to fishing, I invite you to refer to the scandalous and criminal decision taken by the Commission, which, on the pretext of a distortion of competition and at the very time when the price of diesel fuel has not stopped rising, has put an end, in France, to the fund for the prevention of risks to fishing, with the result that the entire profession has been put in a very difficult position."
"As the report recommends, this fund for the prevention of risks to fishing should have been extended to the entire Union, not banned by the Commission."
"It also seems necessary to me to demand central buying offices for supermarkets, with the prices taking account of the real costs incurred by small-scale fishermen."
"To conclude, I believe that, if we are to reverse the trend and save European fishing, it is important for us to adopt this report and, above all, for the Commission very swiftly to implement the proposals it contains."
"."
"Madam President, I welcome this motion for a resolution, which highlights the detrimental effect that high fuel prices are having on the fishing industry, resulting in job losses and severe problems in fishing communities."
"I agree with the proposal that a guarantee fund should be set up to ensure the stability of fuel prices in a level playing field for the Community."
"I agree that the Commission paper of last spring is insufficient, particularly in relation to short-term aid."
"That temporary tie-up funding is part of a rescue and restructuring package severely curtails its usefulness as a support measure; and that the aid ceiling has only increased to EUR 30 000 over 3 years is also very restrictive and inequitable in relation to other sectors."
"The fishing industry is in crisis and the Commission paper has not helped."
"It remains to be seen whether its medium- and long-term measures will be any better."
"I support recommendations that a review of the common organisation of the markets would provide for greater assistance to fishermen and their organisations to become more involved in the marketing and production of fish."
"I also agree that fish imports from outside the EU should be subject to the same conditions and should at least be legal."
"I agree that the EFF reduced funding is insufficient."
"This will be a problem for the restructuring of fishing fleets by implementing decommissioning schemes."
"Madam Chairman, I share the disappointment expressed in this report at the inadequacy of the Commission’s response to the crisis in the fishing industry, but I will not pretend to be surprised."
"For the Commission, socio-economic pressures are, I fear, something to be exploited rather than alleviated, because fundamentally, in pursuit of the common fisheries policy the Commission desires savage reduction in fishing effort."
"Mr Commissioner, deny it as you will, but is that not the truth of the matter that these socio-economic pressures help you attain that goal?"
"There can be no doubting the depth of the crisis, with, across the EU, a 35% fall in jobs in ten years, falling prices, falling catches, a 40% dependence on imports, and a 100% hike in fuel prices in the last two years."
"There is no doubt about any of that, but there is much room to doubt the worth of the Commission’s response."
"Such permitted assistance as there is in that response, is for many regions, particularly in the United Kingdom, likely to be more theoretical than real because of national governments’ resistance to match funding or any form of state aid."
"Here, Commissioner, we come to a matter I would like you to focus on: a glaring flaw in the common fisheries policy."
"How can you deliver a common fisheries policy if some governments avail of options and some do not?"
"Oh yes, we all get to share the downside of binding CFP regulations and quotas and restrictions, but not all get to share the upside which flows from permitted assistance."
"The result is a fisheries policy of disparity, not of commonality; and until the Commission and this House find a way to address that issue, even its modest proposals here will accentuate the difference between the haves and the have-nots under the common fisheries policy."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for being here."
"Like all of my fellow Members, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on this timely report, since, as previous speakers have said, there is no denying the serious economic situation being experienced by the fisheries sector, which has mainly been damaged over the last two years by the rising prices of fuel."
"Precisely when we need to tackle this situation, however, the lack of commitment and support contained in the Commission’s Communication is regrettable, since it only provides for measures offering a long-term solution and, even then, they are the most painful solutions for the sector, such as restructuring of the fleet."
"Given the current situation, however, we also need short-term solutions, and the Commission has ignored these completely."
"Not only is the minimal aid announced ridiculous compared to that offered to other production sectors, but also the Commission is still failing to fulfil its promise to publish the regulation authorising it and which we have been waiting for for more than two years."
"This is inexplicable given that, furthermore, this type of aid is exclusively national and does not therefore imply any additional cost to the Union’s budget."
"As Mr Guerreiro has said, we have just returned from a visit to the Algarve and, a few months before that, we were in Greece."
"We are all aware of the fisheries situation in our own countries, and I therefore believe that this document offers the minimum support we politicians must provide for the fisheries sector at this time."
"I too would therefore urge that it be approved tomorrow in plenary."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the exceptional work in his report."
"As you know, the fishing industry makes an important contribution to the prosperity and to the economic and social fabric of coastal and island areas and to the maintenance of their cohesion."
"It also makes a contribution to the supply of fisheries products with a high organic value, to the employment of a large number of workers in related industries and to the maintenance of local cultural traditions."
"I think that it would be a good idea to create a Community support programme for coastal and small-scale fisheries using traditional methods, especially in my country, Greece, where it is the basic source of income for thousands of families in island and remote areas."
"There should also be direct Community aid due to the increase in fuel costs."
"To close, I agree with the rapporteur that the eco-labelling could significantly promote product differentiation and provide a fundamental incentive for a sustainable fishing trade."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the points made in Mr Guerreiro's report have the merit of being a positive response to the demands made in recent years by fishing operators, and therefore they should clearly be taken on board in the Commission’s decision."
"The report comes out strongly in defence of employment levels in this sector, which comprises 90 000 vessels and employs some 190 000 workers in Europe."
"Previous fisheries directives led to considerable job losses, with the result that Europe now imports 40% of its needs."
"Over the last 10 years, 35% of jobs and 20% of vessels have been lost, in an industry concentrated above all in regions with a weak and particularly fragile economy."
"One of the most important points in the report that I should like to highlight is its appeal to the Commission to guarantee and support the operation and adoption of measures to remedy the high instability of fuel prices, both by creating a guarantee fund for the sector with Community participation, and by implementing the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance in order to reduce operating costs to a minimum."
"The period for rescue aid must be extended to 12 months, and the ceiling raised from EUR 30 000 to EUR 100 000."
"The European Fisheries Fund must continue to grant aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet, in particular to allow the replacement of engines, so as to guarantee crew safety and environmental protection."
"The role of research in this area must not be forgotten either."
"Research needs to be performed and developed to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs and ensure protection for fish stocks and fishing systems."
"If we just bear those points in mind, we can help those parts of the weakest regions in the European economic system that have close links with fishing to protect their jobs and to continue supplying Europe’s consumers."
"– Madam President, congratulations to the rapporteur on his report."
"The fishing industry is in a bad way and is shrinking constantly."
"It is estimated that over the last 10 years the number of fishermen has fallen by 4 to 5% per annum, the number of vessels has fallen by 20% and the quantities landed have fallen by 28%; the only thing that has increased has been the cost of fishing."
"For example, fuel costs have risen by 100%, while fishermen's incomes have fallen by 25% since 2004."
"Support measures need to be taken."
"I am delighted that the Commission has been the first to establish the need to take support measures."
"I am less than delighted that the measures provided for are inadequate."
"We need to make use of every possibility for granting aid from the Community budget for the remainder of the 2006 financial year."
"We need tax relief, because otherwise fishing undertakings will not be able to compete with undertakings from third countries, as they have triple the operating costs."
"We need to increase compensation and we need to increase the period of support to 12 months."
"We need – as we all acknowledge – to have measures to protect the seas, but we also need to support Community fishermen who, in the last analysis, are the only ones fishing under environmental protection rules."
"In the long term, the replacement of engines without reducing their power must be supported."
"The sea conceals many dangers."
"We do not want our fishermen to drown; that is why they must have new, safe engines for their protection."
"Coastal fishing must be supported due to its important social role."
"We need to take measures to combat pollution of the seas and measures to combat illegal fishing, so as to protect fish stocks."
"Finally, the fishing industry must be saved, because fishermen are an important part of tradition, civilisation and European culture."
"In addition, may I remind you, they provide consumers with healthy food."
"Madam President, in general terms, we take a positive view of this Commission Communication, since we believe that it responds to the sector’s demands in that it seeks solutions to ensure the viability and sustainability of the fisheries sector and to guarantee that it has a viable future."
"We also welcome the immense work of the rapporteur, Mr Guerreiro."
"We would also say to the Commission that we believe it to be necessary to improve and extend some of the measures contained in that Communication, such as those relating to improving marketing and those relating to research into the development of more efficient energy use."
"We also need more ambition when it comes to promoting innovative actions to increase the presence of fishermen in the commercial chain and improve their living and working conditions, as well as their level of training."
"I am therefore in favour of the Commission’s proposal to carry out a review of the current COM."
"Improving the marketing of fish and fisheries products would increase their added value, Commissioner."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the Commission communication on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry, which, in itself, is indicative of the fact that something must be done to help the sector, with the emphasis on the weakest areas of the common fisheries policy (CFP)."
"The purpose of the CFP is to guarantee and preserve the balance between the economic and social development of fishing communities and the sustainable management of fishing resources."
"It should be noted that, with respect to both aspects of this common policy, the fishermen and their communities are often in a situation that is as vulnerable as, or more vulnerable than, the situation in which many of the threatened species find themselves."
"I am not suggesting that we need to jettison the sustainability of resources in favour of the sector’s economic viability, because that would lead to the collapse of environmental sustainability and of these fishermen’s future."
"The Commission communication makes its diagnosis, yet fails to provide the solutions that the sector needs and that are largely mentioned in the report by Mr Guerreiro, whom I take this opportunity to congratulate."
"The consequence of the balance between the two strands of the CFP is that we must invest in promoting more selective methods, in small-scale fishing, in aquaculture, in scientific research and in socio-economic aid."
"This aid must compensate for the permanent loss of income arising from the disappearance of jobs, and for the reduction in income resulting from recovery plans and from far-reaching changes in cost-effectiveness due to external circumstances."
"That is precisely the case of the current difficulties arising from the rise in fuel prices."
"The Commission must do more in this area. Similarly, some Member States should make better use of existing opportunities."
"Thought must also be given to the process of setting the price of fish."
"It is unacceptable that fishermen should simply take what they are given as regards price-setting, when the price to the consumer is sometimes double that of the first-sale price."
"Thought must be given, moreover, to support for producer organisations, albeit within existing legislative frameworks, in order to ensure greater fairness and to protect those who sustain the sector."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, we all agree on the economic and social importance of the fisheries sector in the EU and on the Commission’s diagnosis that the situation is critical."
"Similarly, no one doubts Mr Borg’s sensitivity to the problem or his desire to minimise the impact within the limits of currently available resources."
"The responses put forward by the Commission, however, fall well short of what was needed and the sector considers them disappointing. This is particularly true of small-scale coastal fishing, which is the most socially vulnerable part of the industry."
"If there had been any doubts, they would have been completely dispelled by the missions undertaken this year by the Committee on Fisheries in Greece, Italy, France and, in recent days, Portugal."
"The Commission communication and the report before us – and I take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur – are right to warn of an unsustainable situation that must not be allowed to go on."
"We cannot have a common policy that imposes Community-level restrictions and then leaves it to the Member States to cherry-pick the problems they solve depending on the funds they have available."
"The Community must respond quickly to the problems of fuel prices, which several previous speakers have mentioned, the stagnation of the price of fish, and the renewal of the fleet without increasing capacity."
"I therefore hope that Parliament adopts the report and that the Commission ensures that it is put into practice."
"Madam President, fishing is an important part of the Union’s economy, yet it has been in crisis for many years."
"There is an imbalance between excessively large catches and the resources available."
"Greater exploitation of the fishing grounds has contributed to the problem of overfishing, which is now common and occurs in most waters."
"The increased cost of fuel leads to higher operating costs."
"We should remember that many economically weak regions are dependent on the fisheries sector."
"On the one hand, we have environmentalists and the views expressed by many scientists, drawing our attention to the disastrous situation of the resources in our seas and oceans, and on the other hand we have to think about the fisheries, the fishermen and their families."
"We need to find a golden mean, so that we can have our cake and eat it."
"Both short and long-term measures are called for if we are to overcome the difficulties afflicting this sector."
"These measures include fishing quotas, restrictions on fishing time, a wide range of subsidies and other forms of assistance."
"Difficult changes and adjustments must therefore be devised."
"Intervention by the European Union is required if we are to tread the straight and narrow path of sustainable development."
"Scientists, civil servants and fishermen must all unite in order to overcome the difficulties in this sector."
"It was unfortunate that at its December Summit the European Council cut funding for the European Fisheries Fund from around EUR 4.9 billion to EUR 3.8 billion for the period 2007-2013."
"The Union’s fishing industry really needs these financial resources."
"Fisheries could be viewed as maritime versions of farms."
"They do more than simply supply consumers with healthy food and represent more than a source of income for people living in coastal areas."
"They are also part of a rich culture and heritage."
"Much like farming, fishing is dependent on nature."
"It is therefore necessary to understand the specific nature of fishing and consider the ecosystem as a whole."
"Only then will we be able to pull the fishing sector out of its state of crisis."
"."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Members for the various points they have raised."
"I will try to respond to some of them."
"Firstly, with regard to the need for a guarantee fund, the basic problem with guarantee funding is that it can amount to operating aid, which is not permissible under competition rules."
"We are looking further into this and welcome any proposals from Member States on how such funds may be operated in accordance with competition rules."
"The Commission could approve such schemes at national level if they guaranteed reimbursement of all public aid under commercial conditions."
"As regards the long-term aim to help the industry adapt to high fuel prices, the Commission places a high priority on research and development for more fuel-efficient and more environmentally friendly fishing techniques."
"Significant funds are being provided to support such work under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research."
"Renewable energy, in particular biofuels, represents one such measure."
"Research on the design of new, more selective or more fuel-efficient fishing gear is encouraged and can be funded under the framework programme, with initial acquisition of such equipment also financeable under the European Fisheries Fund."
"The European Fisheries Fund, agreed to last June, provides for engine renewals and, in this regard, small-scale vessels are treated more favourably."
"In fact, regarding small-scale coastal fisheries, we have catered for specificities in the rescue and restructuring scheme and in the European Fisheries Fund."
"One example is the acquisition of new engines or engine renewal."
"We are studying what else can be done in order to help small-scale coastal fisheries."
"Regarding the comment by Mr Allister and others that the Commission is taking advantage of the increase in fuel prices to reduce the fleet, let me repeat the facts as I know them."
"There have been years on end of over-fishing and this has caused falling catches."
"This means a vast over-capacity today: we have vessels with a capacity vastly exceeding what can sustainably be caught."
"Those are the facts."
"The vast majority of stocks are being fished in a completely unsustainable manner."
"Acknowledging this will help us find solutions for the long-term benefit of future fishermen."
"If we continue to bury our heads in the sand, we will only prolong the agony before fisheries die a natural death through continued over-fishing."
"We agree that special attention needs to be paid to marketing with a view to increasing the added value of fishery products for fishermen."
"We are actively looking at this and the renewal of the common organisation of the market should answer the sector’s concerns in this area, in particular by helping the sector to improve first-sale prices."
"The ceiling of 30 000 proposed by the Commission is a balanced and reasonable compromise."
"The Commission has proposed raising the ceiling from the previous amount of 3000 to 30 000."
"The review of this threshold has been carried out in the light of the specific characteristics of fishing enterprises, independently of the sector’s current difficulties."
"It was commented that the Commission was proposing too little too late."
"I acknowledge that the communication was issued later than desired, but one has to appreciate the complexity of the situation we are dealing with and the constraints of Community legislation, in particular regarding competition rules."
"This is why it was important to describe carefully the rules and conditions necessary for designing rescue and restructuring schemes."
"Many fishing enterprises will benefit from the measures proposed if Member States take up the challenge and prepare the necessary framework swiftly."
"These measures are substantial: financial restructuring, renewal of engines and of fishing gear and aid to temporary cessation."
"According to the guidelines, state aid for the rescue and restructuring of SMEs in the area of fisheries can cover up to 75% of the total cost of a rescue and restructuring plan."
"May I suggest that we work together and do our utmost to make the best use of these possibilities."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"– We are all aware of the difficult situation in which the fishing industry finds itself, in view of the ongoing and, in some cases, serious depletion of fish stocks, the cuts imposed on fishing activities and the rising costs of certain production factors."
"The industry plays a major role in our development economy, in the sustainable management of marine resources and in the achievement of full employment in coastal communities."
"In order to support and promote the sector, it is essential, in our view, to invest in modernising the fleet, training fishery workers and improving the living and working conditions of seafarers."
"We cannot just push for a restructuring of the sector without taking into account the damaging effects on full employment: the measures called for by the Commission are reasonable but insufficient."
"In short, I fully support the report’s specific and detailed proposals."
"Mr Guerreiro’s report on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry worries me a lot."
"The way in which the Community’s fishing fleet conducts its activities will lead to the oceans becoming irrevocably depleted of fish, and all to protect an industry that is uncompetitive internationally."
"Allow me to give an example."
"At the beginning of September, the Commission presented a proposal on fishing in the Baltic Sea."
"The ICES, or International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, again repeated the demand for a total ban on cod fishing in the eastern Baltic, but the Commission believes that it is enough for it to be reduced by 15%."
"This shows very clearly that the EU does not put the environment first but, rather, seeks the best for industry."
"The last remark requires qualification, however, because the fishing industry will die out once the seas are depleted of fish."
"A global view of what is just should be adopted when the EU’s fisheries policy is discussed."
"The rapporteur says explicitly that the EU’s fishing fleet is forced to compete with third countries’ fleets."
"The latter have much lower costs, and their products are consequently cheaper."
"By introducing tax relief, which is definitely not something for the Community to do, Mr Guerreiro wishes to distort the international market and thus deprive poor people of their only means of income."
"That is frightening and, at the same time, very tragic."
"The EU is, however, showing its true face in this case: that of an uncompetitive economy that is prepared to do anything to protect its production, at the same time as excluding the world’s poor."
"The next item is the report (A6-0265/2006) by Mr Albert Jan Maat on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a management plan for fisheries exploiting stocks of plaice and sole in the North Sea (COM(2005)0714 – C6-0034/2006 – 2006/0002(CNS))."
"."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Maat and the Committee on Fisheries for the preparation of this report concerning the Commission’s proposal for a long-term plan for the management of plaice and sole fisheries."
"This is an important topic."
"Since the Commission first began discussing the long-term management of these stocks and fisheries in 2004, there has been a significant worsening of the state of these stocks."
"In particular, the size of the sole stock is now declining rapidly due to low numbers of incoming young fish."
"High fuel prices and lower catch rates have combined to create a very difficult situation for this sector and this fits very well into what I have been saying before."
"The Commission’s proposal is intended to reverse this trend by leading to more efficient and more profitable fisheries and I am keen to see it adopted soon so that fisheries can begin to recover and to improve."
"I thank you, therefore, for this report and I now turn to the specific amendments that you propose."
"I can support Amendments 2, 3, 4, 5, 18 and 21."
"However, I should mention that the Commission has already begun a debate, as requested in Amendment 4, with the regional advisory councils concerning the implementation of maximum sustainable yield management and has also already arranged for the impact assessment foreseen in Amendment 5."
"The final text should reflect the fact that these measures requested by Parliament have already taken place."
"I can accept in principle that there could be a two-step approach in long-term plans, and that different measures would apply in situations where stocks are outside safe biological limits from those applicable in situations where stocks are within those limits."
"Therefore, I can accept the principles behind Amendments 1, 7, 9 and 10."
"However, it is important to improve the state of the stock and the finances of the industry."
"More consultations with the sector and the Member States concerned will be needed to refine the details, as will careful consideration of the results of the impact analysis."
"I fully support provisions to revise long-term targets at periodic intervals of about five years in order to take account of changes in the environment and the ecosystems."
"However, I am not in a position to accept Parliament’s amendments intended to provide stability for the industry by setting TACs that are stable for three-year periods."
"Stability for the industry can better be provided by limiting changes to TACs between years."
"The North Sea RAC has revised its opinion on this topic and in its latest advice no longer advises such a measure."
"Therefore, I cannot accept Amendment 8, the second paragraph of Amendment 9, nor Amendments 10, 11 and 24."
"Concerning Amendment 12, I can accept the widening of scope to include a wider definition of fishing effort for plaice and sole, though a more precise legal wording may be necessary."
"However, here again, I cannot support a proposal that effort limits be adapted only at three-yearly intervals."
"Concerning Amendment 13, a legislative text for a long-term plan must define clearly how efforts should be adjusted in order to achieve the targets of the plan."
"Parliament’s text does not seem clear enough from a legal and technical point of view."
"Advice from scientific committees indicates that significant amounts of cod are caught and are discarded."
"As the plaice and sole fisheries exert mortality on cod, it is necessary to keep this mortality under review and to adjust relevant efforts if necessary."
"This is why I am not in a position to accept Amendment 14, because it would create a non-equitable situation in comparison with other fisheries sectors that also have an impact on cod and are subject to cod-recovery measures."
"Amendment 15 asks for a change in the log-book tolerance from 8% to 10%."
"However, the 8% figure was adopted in the Council as a common value in other long-term plans after a long discussion."
"I believe this figure should be retained for plaice and sole as for the other long-term plans."
"The practical implementation of Amendments 16 or 17 would require that fisheries inspectors be able to distinguish between plaice or sole caught in the North Sea and fish of these species caught in other areas, a task which does not seem possible."
"I can accept the principle and intentions behind Amendments 6, 19, 22 and 23, but I believe it should be implemented in a different way."
"The Commission is preparing an evaluation of technical measures and the regulation of fishing gears should be reviewed as soon as possible in that context."
"If either plaice or sole enters into biologically very high-risk situations, the Council should be more cautious in setting fishing opportunities."
"This is consistent with the guiding principles of the common fisheries policy and will provide additional protection to stocks that are in their most vulnerable state."
"For this reason, I cannot accept Amendment 20."
"In conclusion, I thank Parliament for its careful scrutiny of this document."
"Raising and addressing the issues I have just mentioned will, I am sure, improve the quality and efficiency of the regulation that is eventually agreed in order to achieve the objective of improving the profitability of the fishery and the state of the stocks of plaice and sole, as well as reducing discarding."
"."
"Madam President, I am indebted to the Commissioner for starting this debate on a good note, for I notice that he is meeting Parliament half-way on a number of issues."
"Whilst I share his concern with regard to the development of the plaice and sole stocks in the North Sea, it is at the same time becoming clear that this is not related to the fishing effort, but may be attributable to climate changes that cannot always be fully explained."
"To make it absolutely clear, though, I do share his concern in this respect."
"I am pleased that he is nevertheless moving towards Parliament in a number of areas."
"One important point of criticism that I made with regard to the Commission’s working method was that the proposal was tabled before the North Sea Regional Advisory Council had issued its recommendation."
"That does not strike me as going about things the right way."
"It appears to me essential that, if we want to retain a support base for fisheries, we should accord these Regional Advisory Councils a fully-fledged place in the debate and that we get them to make a contribution prior to the debate as well."
"I am saying this emphatically because those Regional Advisory Councils not only involve fisheries organisations, but also the Word Nature Fund and other nature organisations."
"That is precisely the sort of thing that injects stability and provides a support base for policy in a certain region."
"With regard to the application of the objectives for Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), I am pleased that the Commission has just now issued the communication on that subject which was still missing prior to the management plan for sole and plaice, although it had, in fact, already presented the MSY objectives."
"My criticism is mainly to do with the fact that that did happen for sole and plaice, but not for a number of other management plans, for example the Gulf of Biscay."
"It also strikes me as the right way of doing things if we in this House have a fundamental discussion about the application of the MSY objectives before these are introduced for a certain fish species."
"I welcome the fact that the Commissioner is taking a few steps in the right direction, but there may need to be more consultation in a number of other areas."
"I also hope that the Council will as yet move a little closer in the direction of Parliament to ensure that we in any event end up with a balanced approach."
"The Commissioner has stated that the establishment of three-year quotas is a problem for him after all, because they do not allow any adjustments."
"I would question that, also because sole and plaice fisheries may well be the best controlled fisheries in Europe, and also on the basis of the way in which the fisheries organisations use these."
"I would draw your attention to, among others, the producer organisations in a number of ports that work closely together and where there is excellent cooperation between the Member States, the authorities, the inspectorates and the fisheries organisations themselves."
"It would, in fact, be appealing, also for the European Commission, in time, to switch to a three-year Total Allowable Catches (TAC) scheme after all."
"I may be prejudging the discussion on the communication about the Commission’s MSY objectives, but the point that is essential in my view is that Regional Advisory Councils will be given a dominant role in Europe's decision-making, that they, every time the Commission tables a proposal, will be given a hearing beforehand, and that their opinion will be taken into consideration in the argumentation of the proposals."
"After all, we will increasingly have discussions in Europe, also within fisheries, in which, seemingly, a large number of Member States take hardly any interest."
"Indeed, the number of Member States is no longer 6 or 15, but 25."
"And how could a Hungarian Fisheries Minister contribute to a discussion, say, about shrimps in the North Sea or a Dutch Fisheries Minister about fisheries around Cyprus?"
"There are, of course, general policy lines, but in order to keep a support base for fisheries, it is essential for these Regional Advisory Councils to be accorded an important role, also in future, also in the implementation of the plans."
"That is why this point receives a great deal of attention in my report too."
"It can provide a support base for the fisheries decisions."
"Even more important, however, is the following. We are often in a fix with scientific recommendations for the establishment of quotas and subsequently – let us be honest about this – find out that the Council plays under one hat."
"That is why scientific recommendations are drafted conservatively to take the Council’s outcome into consideration."
"We must put a stop to this!"
"We must ensure that the sector and scientific institutions cooperate much quicker and at a much earlier stage in order to weigh up the plans effectively."
"I should once again like to express my thanks to the Commissioner for meeting us half-way on a number of issues."
"Parliament’s position will be apparent in tomorrow’s vote."
"I am firmly convinced that the Commissioner will place Parliament’s contribution at the heart of the Council’s discussion."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Maat for his report."
"I believe that when we look at fisheries, especially at catching plaice and sole – and basically they are mixed fisheries because other species are being caught, cod included – we have to be much more radical than we are at the moment."
"The Commissioner knows that full well and I have raised the issue of discards in general with him several times."
"Let us land all the fish that are caught, instead of having so many species quotas with the result that a lot of healthy fish are discarded."
"Of all the problems with the common fisheries policy, throwing healthy fish overboard is the one that the general public in Europe see as particularly ridiculous."
"I also think we must be sure that powers are devolved to the North Sea Advisory Council and that the Commission takes notice of it."
"Mr Maat made the point that it is no good the Commission coming up with a proposal before it has taken note of what the North Sea Advisory Council has said."
"That gives people the impression that the Commission is not listening."
"I also think that with the age-old problem of stocks in general there is always a conflict between the scientific advice and what the fishermen believe the stocks to be."
"It is not always easy to come to a conclusion."
"My final point is – and I stress the need to be more radical – that I think the way forward is to look at the total quotas of fish caught and see if we cannot change that into days at sea and fishing effort, so that we can land all the fish caught."
"Ladies and gentlemen, first of all let me thank the rapporteur for his good and important work."
"In my country, Estonia, fishing is more than just an industry or a means of earning a living."
"Fishing is an integral part of our culture."
"In a country surrounded by water on three sides, it could not be otherwise."
"I know families that have been involved in fishing for many generations."
"For them, fishing is not a business project, but a way of life."
"Industrial fishing has brought the lives of coastal fishermen to the brink of disaster."
"According to the World Wildlife Foundation, the flounder and sole mentioned today are among the most endangered fish species."
"Half of the flounders caught using beam trawling prove to be undersized and must be thrown back."
"Most of these fish perish."
"Such waste is incomprehensible to fishermen whose families have been in the business for generations."
"It is clear that the use of wasteful fishing methods should be ended sooner rather than later."
"I hope that the European Commission will be able to conduct the relevant research as soon as possible and present proposals for the rapid replacement of existing fishing methods with naturally sustainable methods."
"I am well aware that the nature of fisheries does not permit as quick a response as would be possible in information technology management, for instance."
"I concur with the report’s recommendation to establish three-year fishing quotas instead of one-year quotas."
"This will ensure continuity in the fisheries."
"In ensuring continuity and sustainability, close cooperation with organisations that are familiar with local conditions will be very important."
"Of these, the rapporteur emphasises the North Sea Regional Advisory Council."
"The attempts to restore fishing stocks in the Baltic Sea, which feeds fishermen from five Member States, would be much more successful if they were supported by regional cooperation."
"As regards the Baltic Sea, I would like to emphasise here today that the Baltic Sea region deserves a separate entry in the European Union budget, as has long been the case in the Mediterranean region."
"."
"Madam President, given the state of our seas, the Commissioner’s first priority should be to save the fish."
"When safe biological limits are being exceeded, we all expect action and I commend the action that is being taken."
"I also commend the attempt to move towards a policy of achieving maximum sustainable yields."
"I do not see how anyone can be opposed to that."
"It is like apple pie and motherhood."
"The difficulty is how we move from the present disaster to future perfection, without disrupting the lives and occupations of fishermen to an impossible degree."
"That is my doubt about this particular policy."
"The purpose of the Regional Advisory Councils is to try and ensure that fishermen are integrated into the process."
"So when their advice seems to be being ignored, it may be the wrong advice."
"Perhaps that is the Commission’s fault for not communicating the message."
"It is the opportunity for greater long-term prosperity."
"Fishermen, as we all know, need to be included in the process."
"I agree with the Commissioner when he says that we must go for only one-year quotas."
"The danger is that if we set a quota at the wrong level, in three years’ time there may be no more fish to set the next quota for."
"We think of sole and plaice as extremely good fish that are a great pleasure to eat, but future generations will not experience that pleasure if we do not now accept our responsibilities."
"I think that Mr Maat’s report is, for the most part, sound, but I would criticise precisely the same things as the Commissioner."
"Amendment 8 about having a three-year quota would have precisely those implications pointed out by Mr Davies."
"It could not be adapted in time and would be inappropriate."
"The same applies in the case of cod."
"There is a connection here, which means that Amendment 14 cannot be approved either."
"If the number of days at sea is to be limited for the reason stated, the restriction will have to apply to these vessels too, as there cannot be exceptions where this matter is concerned."
"When it comes to Amendment 15, involving a ten per cent, instead of eight per cent, margin of tolerance, I would point out that, with modern computer technology, there would be no complications in having an eight per cent margin."
"We could manage to calculate eight per cent instead of ten per cent."
"Increased flexibility would damage stocks."
"The same applies to Amendment 20."
"Increased flexibility for the Member States in determining when they need to take measures would not work."
"Attempts to obtain increased flexibility would actually lead to reduced flexibility, as, if fish stocks are depleted, there is no flexibility at all left."
"There would then be no fishing quotas, no days at sea and 100% unemployment among professional fishermen."
"That, presumably, is what no one wants to see."
"Madam President, for centuries British fishermen looked after their fishing grounds – the waters up to 200 miles off the coast."
"They achieved a sustainable industry by care, not by chance."
"Then we joined the EC, and that all changed."
"The wretched CFP, with its bureaucratic plans, crazy quotas and enforced discards has reduced stocks to their lowest level ever, closed fishing ports and reduced the UK fishing fleet to a quarter of its size."
"Many species are down to danger levels – plaice and sole today, something else tomorrow."
"And to think that the CFP was not even in the Treaty of Rome: it was invented overnight to let Edward Heath have something to give away in exchange for the right to sign!"
"Now, in answer to the desperate shortage of fish in the North Sea, all we hear about is too many boats chasing too few fish – I’ll say!"
"They are mostly boats from Spain, which has a fleet as big as the rest of the EU put together."
"No wonder the Norwegians said no!"
"They saw it coming, and with their fishing industry such a boost to their economy, they were right."
"Norwegian stocks remain in good order."
"Are there any lessons for the CFP there?"
"This report will do nothing."
"While the management plan acknowledges the North Sea Advisory Council, it ignores its findings."
"It is inconsistent in departing from similar decisions in areas like the Bay of Biscay, and it is based on a maximum sustainable yield before that is even defined."
"This report is well named, for ‘exploitation’ is exactly what has happened to the once abundant North Sea fisheries."
"Tell me: who benefits from the destruction of the richest waters of Western Europe?"
"Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur for taking on the Commission and for taking it to task in relation to its glaring omissions and its oversights."
"On the one hand we have the Commission’s explanatory memorandum openly acknowledging that the North Sea Regional Advisory Council is a principal forum for advice in relation to the management plan for the preservation and regeneration of plaice and sole stocks in the North Sea."
"Then, on the other hand, in its document the Commission makes no further reference to the NSRAC’s opinion."
"I should be very grateful if the Commissioner could tell me who is or was responsible for drafting the Commission’s management plan."
"How can the Commission justify omitting the body or agency it openly recognises as an authority on North Sea fisheries and then studiously ignore the NSRAC?"
"As has been stated and restated time and time again, forums such as the NSRAC were established in order to canvass and to utilise the wide body of expertise and opinion among people on the ground, people on the coalface, people who know the industry and to counteract the perception that Brussels or Strasbourg make policies which are often seen as ‘about you, without you’."
"Is it any wonder that people turn off Brussels or Strasbourg?"
"The NSRAC has provided a bridgehead for bringing fishing interests, biologists and environmentalists together, getting them to agree collectively on ways of conserving stocks of plaice and sole."
"The proposals, if adopted, would increase the level of plaice stocks to above the precautionary levels of three to five years."
"I have to say that the rapporteur has other reservations about the Commission’s approach, with which I agree, but time restraints do not permit me to elaborate on them, except to make a brief reference to the issue of MSY – maximum sustainable yields."
"The Commission’s proposal to launch a debate on MSY in advance of agreement by the Council and Parliament simply is not on."
"It is simply not acceptable, Mr Commissioner."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the honourable Members for their contributions."
"Let me start by trying to clear the air with regard to the North Sea Regional Advisory Council."
"The Commission has held a series of consultation meetings and exchanges of views since June 2004."
"I do not believe that any other fisheries issue has been the subject of such extensive dialogue with the RACs."
"After the North Sea RAC decided to reserve its position until the Commission had made a specific proposal concerning long-term management targets and reference points, the Commission stated that it would put forward a proposal and even inform the RAC of its technical content at a meeting in November 2005."
"A discussion has since proceeded in good order on the basis of the Commission’s proposal."
"I am pleased that the North Sea RAC has recognised that many elements of the Commission’s proposal are valuable and appropriate."
"Regarding maximum sustainable yields, a number of stocks were brought into long-term management plans some years ago, which included low-target fishing mortalities, such as mackerel, herring and, more recently, haddock."
"These plans have proved valuable and helpful to the industries concerned."
"I believe similar benefits can be extended to the flatfish sector."
"Discussions concerning the maximum sustainable yield should also take place, but that is a wider-scale issue."
"The immediate concern is to provide the flatfish fishery with a sound economic basis."
"With regard to the point raised concerning TACs for three years, I must again underline that a three-year TAC would not help to recover the stock, simply because adjustments cannot be made in good time."
"How can one make adjustments mid-course if there is an urgent reason to reduce the TAC?"
"The North Sea RAC has revised its position and it no longer advises such a measure."
"I can accept the argument that a three-year TAC will give greater security to fishermen, but not the argument that a three-year TAC would mean greater sustainability."
"With regard to discards, we are actively considering what can be done to solve this problem."
"It is one of the top priorities for the remainder of my mandate."
"I cannot agree more with Mr Davies that fishermen need to be integrated into the process."
"We are doing our utmost to meet with and consult all fishing representatives."
"That brings the debate to a close."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the report (A6-0263/2006) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 on the removal of fins of sharks on board vessels (2006/2054(INI))."
"– Madam President, without taking up any of my speaking time – since this has nothing to do with the issue we are dealing with, but is more a point of order – I would like to put a request to the Presidency of this Parliament arising from an incident in which I have just been involved."
"Barely a quarter of an hour ago, I left the Chamber for a moment and went into the aisle behind us here and found myself happily looking at the waters in the canal, when I found myself quite literally swept aside by an entourage, which I then discovered was surrounding the President of Lebanon."
"So far, it was nothing we have not seen a million times in this House."
"The thing that shocked me, President Borrell, was the attitude of the two people, parliamentary staff, who were leading the entourage."
"First they made gestures at me."
"Then they shouted at me: ‘Mettez-vous sur le côté! [move to the side]’, they told me, and I do not know whether you are aware, but the ‘’ behind us here is made up of boards with holes in which women’s high heels can get caught, and it is therefore very easy to fall over."
"I tried to avoid going ‘’."
"I pointed out to them – I must put it like this – that I was a Member of Parliament, but I can assure you that it did not do me much good."
"They practically swept me aside until I was where they wanted me to be: ‘To the side immediately!’."
"Madam President, since we are talking about staff of this House, and given the unfortunate timetable for these night sittings, I would ask you whether it is possible to find other ways to treat Members or, perhaps, other routes by which visitors can leave."
"Having said that, Madam President, I shall move on to the matter in hand. I shall move on to fish belonging to the taxon Elasmobranchii, which are generally highly vulnerable to exploitation given their life-cycle characteristics."
"The practice known as finning, involving the removal of fins and disposal of the body, is prohibited on board Community vessels, both in maritime waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of Member States and in international waters and those of third countries."
"Nevertheless, given that these species are often caught as by-catch, on 26 June 2003, the European Union adopted a Regulation on the removal of fins of sharks."
"The Regulation allows sharks to be handled on board the vessel, with fins separated from bodies, provided that that is designed to achieve greater efficiency in the use of the entire shark, with the fins and the rest of the animal stored on board separately."
"In order to ensure that is not practised, the quantity of fins must correspond to that of bodies and, to that end, a ratio or proportion compared to the total live weight is established, and in 2003 that ratio was set at five per cent of fin compared to live weight."
"This five per cent was decided upon on the basis of United States legislation designed for a different reality and for species of shark that are coastal and have different presentations."
"The scientific reports of the ICES and the ICCAT indicate that that ratio is not applicable to the pelagic species caught by the Community fleet, whose fins are far larger than those of coastal sharks."
"I would like to point out that the current 5% in the regulation in force and the 6.5% that I am proposing for a single species – in this case the Prionacea glauca – are in line with the most recent scientific reports."
"In any event – and I address this to the Commissioner – the main objective of the Community legislation must be to reinforce the prohibition of but – and I say this to him too – in order to ensure that the rules are effective and accepted by all of the parties, they must reflect the specific characteristics of fleets, the morphology of the different species and calculation methods that include cutting techniques and presentation methods used."
"Furthermore, Commissioner, this is a very specific and identifiable fishery and, therefore, the recognition of these issues would enable us to prevent situations in which the European Union’s longline fleet is prejudiced. That fleet is currently obliged to throw away a proportion of the fins in order to comply with the rules, since more than 80% of the catches are of a species that I have already mentioned, Prionacea glauca, whose ratio, as we have said, is 6.5%."
"I would say to the Commission that not using realistic conversion factors poses a risk to the European Union since it leads to errors in the estimates of catches, estimates that are obtained indirectly from the international market in fins in Asian countries, where they appear as being of European origin."
"At the same time – I address this also to the Commissioner – the updating of this percentage, I would repeat, on the basis of the data and the scientific reports, would enable the Community immediately to lead the review that, in accordance with the recommendation of the Community’s own Scientific Committee, is going to take place within the ICCAT and that will probably be followed by other RFOs."
"I would stress that the increase requested in no way implies an increase in the catch of sharks nor a relaxing of the measures intended to prevent the practice of ."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Miguélez."
"I take good note of your complaint."
"I shall pass it on to the head of Parliament’s security service so that he may take the appropriate action."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos and the Fisheries Committee for the opinion on the Commission report on the operation of the so-called Shark Finning Regulation."
"I am pleased to note that the rapporteur praises the clarity and conciseness of the Commission’s report and shares the view that this regulation is achieving its objective."
"Let me assure you that the Commission is committed to monitoring the application of this regulation to ensure its proper implementation, including of Member States’ obligations regarding control and reporting."
"The Commission will also continue to promote the prohibition of shark finning in international forums."
"In addition, the Commission will continue in its endeavours towards the adoption of measures based on scientific information and other considerations within Regional Fisheries Management Organisations."
"I would also recall that the prohibition of shark finning practices is not the only way to ensure a sustainable fishery for these species."
"A more comprehensive set of management measures is required."
"We have already taken some measures in this respect."
"I refer, in particular, to special efforts to improve scientific knowledge and data collection, to establish catch or effort limits for certain species, including deep-sea species, to prohibit drift nets that may catch some large pelagic sharks and to control and limit fishing capacity."
"As rightly pointed out in Parliament’s motion for a resolution, the Commission has identified numerous actions to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010 and beyond, including Community plans of action for sharks and sea birds."
"My department is currently looking into the request for the presentation of a Community plan of action by mid-2007."
"While it is too early to have a clear overview of the detailed work programme for 2007, it is clear that a formal, complete and detailed plan of action requires a comprehensive assessment of the situation and of the possible measures, together with an early consultation of all interested parties, which will take time and resources."
"The desired timeframe seems rather too ambitious, and setting too short a timeframe for preparation and consultation could even be counterproductive."
"I would prefer to be less prescriptive in terms of deadlines."
"However, I can assure honourable Members that my department will undertake to complete the plan of action at the earliest possible date."
"Returning to the report’s core concerns, I have taken good note of the proposed calls for the Commission to present amendments to the Shark Finning Regulation, especially with a view to reviewing the 5% fin weight versus live body weight ratio on the basis of a species-dependent approach, and to revise the possibilities for separate landings of fins and carcasses, as well as to report again on the operation of this regulation within two years."
"When deciding on this regulation, the Council did not consider it appropriate to adopt a species-specific approach regarding the fin to body weight ratio."
"I think the reasons mentioned in the debate then are still valid now."
"A single 5% fin to live body weight ratio applicable to the whole shark-catch of a vessel is a realistic, feasible, controllable, simple and proportionate method of preventing shark finning practices from spreading."
"The Commission’s report also confirms this."
"I am not, therefore, of the opinion that amendments to the regulation should be proposed at this stage."
"Firstly, because the regulation was only recently adopted and is working well overall."
"Secondly, because the Commission believes it would be unwieldy to start revising the fin to body weight ratio or introducing some species-specific approach to the Shark Finning Regulation without new measures to ensure sustainable shark fishing."
"The much broader exercise of preparing a Community plan of action for sharks will necessarily include a reassessment of developments under the Shark Finning Regulation and its possible need for review, especially on the basis of the national annual reports, which are available for all those interested."
"It is at this point, therefore, that we will be able to consider once more the situation with respect to body-fin ratio and make any recommendations accordingly."
"Parliament’s necessary full involvement in a proposal for a plan of action will also provide another opportunity for Parliament to be informed about and to play a role in developments on shark finning matters."
"The Commission will continue to monitor the situation."
"You can rest assured that I am always ready to act and to present all supporting evidence if new information becomes available indicating significant changes in the situation."
"I am committed to advances in the area of shark conservation and other aspects of marine biodiversity, and will inform you in due time of the progress made."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos."
"First and foremost, it should be clarified and highlighted that the practice of finning has been regulated by the EU since 2003, meaning that sharks cannot be caught solely for their fins."
"In other words, this type of fishing is centred on a species, just as any other, which means that sustainability is just as important for this species as for any other."
"The issue of encouraging more catches does not therefore form part of the objective of this report but falls instead under the scope of quotas or perhaps recovery plans on the basis of the usual scientific reports."
"What is under discussion here is the fact that the Commission communication has acknowledged the positive effect of the 2003 regulation and compliance with it."
"A more contentious issue in this debate, however, is the weight of fins as a percentage of the total weight of the shark."
"According to ICCAT reports, the total use of the fins by the Community fleet differs, for example, from the US fleet’s partial use."
"We must therefore look into the possibility of changing the percentage, on the basis of these reports, which have proposed an increase from 5% to 6.5%."
"This is the crux of the matter."
"To ignore this issue would be to confuse the total use of fish with the preservation of a fishing resource."
"We must indeed preserve the resource, but that must be done by other means."
"The nub of this debate is that, by ensuring that rates of use reflect reality and scientific reports, we will be able to plug all gaps."
"The compromise reached between the three main political groups implies that Parliament realises that this is the way to proceed, in line with the existing studies carried out by recognised bodies, to which the EU belongs, and in accordance with the law, thereby contributing to genuinely sustainable and regulated fishing."
"Mr President, I am delighted that the UK Government was one of the key supporters of Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 concerning the disgusting practice of removing shark fins on board vessels."
"The regulation is designed to prevent shark finning, where shark carcasses are thrown overboard after high-value shark fins have been removed."
"You could call this ‘slit and chuck’."
"Without their fins, the sharks suffocate to death."
"The practice of shark finning is known to endanger the survival of several shark species."
"Only today American researchers using fish auction records from Hong Kong have calculated that the trade in shark fins kills 26 million to 73 million sharks a year."
"Against this background, I am appalled and disappointed that this report threatens an increase in shark finning."
"Paragraph 5 of the report requests an increase of the 5% fin- to live-weight ratio to 6.5%, particularly for blue sharks."
"Paragraph 3 of the report incorrectly implies that ICES and ICCAT support an increase in fin- to live-weight ratio for the blue shark."
"A paper was submitted to ICES in 2005, but ICES has not considered this paper or issued an opinion."
"The same goes for ICCAT, where scientists have reviewed fin to carcass ratios but have not recommended an increase of the ratio."
"Amendment 1 is placed first on the voting list, and I recommend support for it."
"I fear that the European Parliament may not give its support to any of these amendments, a retrograde step, and I ask colleagues to say no to ‘slit and chuck’."
"Mr President, we can argue whether a 5% ratio of fin weight to body weight is appropriate or whether a larger proportion is needed."
"I have no doubt that an increase would be wrong, but no doubt the Spanish and Portuguese fishing interests would argue the other way."
"I hope Parliament will be able to support my proposal for a study based on best scientific evidence before any decision is made."
"I hope it will do that not simply because it represents a compromise in those positions but because it is the most appropriate way forward."
"So far as I am concerned, the whole shark fin regulation has always been too weak."
"It was far too weak when we introduced it."
"Enforcement is problematic to say the least and, as in so many aspects of fishing, varies from one Member State to another."
"It certainly needs to be reviewed at regular intervals."
"The idea that we should just have one review and that is the end of it, as originally intended, is simply nonsense."
"I hope the Commissioner will support the idea of more regular reviews, just as I support him in opposing the idea that quotas should be set for long periods of time."
"The real issue here is so much bigger."
"We face the prospect of the extinction of many shark species – slow-breathing creatures that have lived on this planet for many millennia longer than our own species. The risk is that with this particular regulation we are simply playing at the edges."
"We are killing too many sharks."
"We have to stop that."
"We need the Commission to come forward with a shark management action plan."
"We have heard from the Commissioner why it will take time to do that, but I seem to remember joining with other Members of Parliament in calling for this some three years ago."
"I hope that the Commissioner will be able to finish this debate by telling us exactly how much work has already been done over the past three years in preparing the groundwork for publication of the shark management action plan."
"My impression is that absolutely nothing has been done."
"I hope the Commissioner can correct that impression."
"Mr President, I hope that the Commission will maintain its firm position in the face of the attempts to reduce the requirements for the cutting off of the fins of sharks."
"With this proposal, sharks may be even more threatened than they are already."
"According to the scientific studies, it is not at all clear how far the ratio should be increased; there is even one study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature that restricts the ratio to 2%."
"We must seek out all of the scientific information available, because this amendment is intended to change the rules in order to increase the percentage of weight of fins compared to the bodies of sharks, and in that way more and more catches would be thrown back into the sea."
"Sharks are being wiped out in the oceans in order to satisfy the Asian whim of making soup from their fins, and that is not a good thing."
"It is difficult to monitor what happens at sea, and there is sufficient evidence to suggest that many Member States are not controlling compliance with Community legislation."
"To besiege an animal even further, when two thirds of its species in Europe are already on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List, is not a good idea."
"Mr President, the UK, Germany and Belgium fought very hard to implement a ban on shark finning in 2003."
"They received wide support in the Council."
"Spain and Portugal now appear to be the only Member States pushing for an amendment to the regulation in respect of the 5% ratio of fins to live weight of shark catch."
"They say that the current regulation is unrealistic, particularly for the blue shark, which is the main target of their fishery and which they claim is in great abundance in EU waters."
"I think the strong international market for shark fins, mostly as we have just heard for the Asian shark fin soup market, coupled with the relatively low value of shark meat, has motivated Spain and Portugal to support this drastic amendment."
"It remains a fact that the 5% ratio of fins to live weight contained in EU legislation is the weakest in the world, as Mr Davies told us."
"The proposal in this report for a 6.5% ratio would quite simply allow more sharks to be killed."
"It would send all the wrong negative signals to the international community."
"The higher the ratio, the more likely it is that the illegal practice of finning will recur."
"That is why I have tabled an amendment which proposes that the figure be lowered to 2% of live weight."
"That would ensure the protection of sharks in EU waters, increase that protection and fall in line with international standards."
"The IUCN, the World Conservation Union, has confirmed that the blue shark is endangered and will be placed on its red list as a vulnerable species when that list is updated later this year."
"In such circumstances, it would be madness to permit more of these sharks to be killed."
"Indeed, we should be seeking to impose a strict regime of TACs and quotas on blue sharks to offer the species additional protection."
"Mr President, firstly I wish to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos for all the work she has done in preparing this own-initiative report."
"The corresponding Commission report is clear in reiterating that finning is prohibited within the Community, and in its conclusion that the percentage equivalence ratio of shark fin to body weight does not need to be altered."
"The rapporteur disagrees with this percentage ratio figure, and she is of the opinion that it should be increased from the level of 5% to 6.5%."
"This is the main issue of disagreement with the Commission report, and with some of us."
"Mrs Miguélez Ramos argues that some scientific evidence favours her 6.5% ratio position, but let me say respectfully that other scientific evidence supplied by at least equally reputable sources supports the view that the 5% figure is in fact more than adequate."
"The latter scientific evidence further supports the view that if the ratio is indeed increased, this will result in the enhancement of the very practice we want to stop, i.e. finning."
"Such a practice, coupled with the general failure of implementation of the relevant Community regulation, will, in my view, lead with mathematical accuracy and in the not-too-distant future, to the endangerment of the very existence of certain shark species."
"In this respect, please note that an increase from 5% to 6.5% may seem small at first glance, but in reality it is not."
"It in fact represents an increase of 30%."
"In other words, potentially 30% of the shark catches could end up in finning."
"Much as we wish to help increase the profits of our fishermen, it is our primary concern and duty to prevent the extinction of any shark species."
"I therefore urge you to support Mr Davies’ amendment tabled on behalf of the ALDE Group and aimed at maintaining the ratio at 5%, as proposed by the Commission and as supported by the Commissioner in his speech here tonight."
"Mr President, I am surprised by Commissioner Borg’s statement that legislation that is recent cannot be modified."
"I believe that legislation that is not good must be updated."
"That is precisely what the 2005 Report of the ICCAT says about ratios for sharks."
"According to that report, the ratio applied to Prionacea glauca is wrong."
"Furthermore, the scientists of the ICCAT argue that it should be corrected."
"There are two reasons for this: the first is that data on landings based on an incorrect coefficient may lead them to make the wrong estimates; and, secondly, that the inconsistency in the ratio hinders the work of controlling the fleet, since, because it is impossible to comply with the rule, the control makes no sense."
"Commissioner, this is demonstrated in the report that you have sent to this Parliament."
"Commissioner, Mr President, I wish to ask that we update and correct the legislation once and for all, because otherwise we are creating a serious lack of confidence in the sector as a result of having rules with which, as I say, it is impossible to comply."
"I would also like one of the people who have spoken here, claiming that there are scientific reports, to tell me of at least one, supported by the international scientific community, that contradicts what the ICCAT said at the last plenary meeting of the Regional Fisheries Organisation that regulates all of these very species."
"I would ask that we act rationally, that we do things properly, that the coefficients be reviewed and that we choose those that can be fulfilled by the fleet."
"I must also say that the problem of over-fishing will not be resolved by means of ratios."
"It will be resolved by means of quotas for sharks."
"Mr President, I also welcome the Commissioner's statement at the beginning that he wants at least to remain at the 5% level of finning for the present."
"I believe – along with Mr Stevenson, and we have tabled an amendment to this effect – that instead of leaving it at 5% we need to reduce it to 2%."
"To take it up to 6.5% would only encourage the catching and finning of more and more sharks."
"Over 70 million sharks are taken each year and we really need to reduce the number."
"To increase it to 6.5% would be crazy."
"We in Europe very much want a sustainable fisheries policy."
"We also want high welfare standards."
"If you increase the percentage of shark fins that can be landed, the chances of increasing the number of sharks caught and of finning are greater."
"We need to set an example to the world."
"In most parts of the world the percentage of fins that can be landed by fishing is lower."
"I therefore urge the Commissioner to go further and reduce the percentage of fins that can be landed."
"However much more valuable shark fins are than the rest of the body, it is absolutely right that the whole of the body should be landed and used."
"It is crazy to carry on as we do when nearly 50% of the 130 species of shark are now endangered."
"We must take action."
"Madam President, I should like to thank honourable Members for their contributions."
"The only problem that has been raised substantively relates to the whole issue concerning 5% versus 6.5%."
"In this regard, I should say that the ratio between fin weight and body weight varies significantly depending on the shark species concerned."
"Scientific information was already available at the time the regulation was adopted, especially as regards the blue shark."
"The Council, however, did not consider that a species-dependent approach was appropriate, and the maximum 5% fin- versus live body-weight ratio set in the regulation was certainly not presented as being based on scientific considerations alone."
"The 5% fin- to body-weight requirement represents the only current restriction on a number of shark species caught in fisheries, notably the blue shark."
"This should not be reviewed, at least until other management measures are in place to reduce their fishing mortality."
"I have no problem with further research, but this has to be done before any amendments are proposed."
"Again, I have no problem with regular reviews."
"I have made reference to an overall consideration of a Community plan of action for sharks, when we will have ample time to discuss this and other issues concerning conservation of sharks."
"On the point raised by Mr Davies concerning the plan of action, the EU has not yet formalised a plan of action for sharks."
"Nevertheless, many of the actions that would constitute such a plan of action are already incorporated into Community legislation or other initiatives under the CFP."
"The EU has taken considerable management action with regard to sharks, for example the improvement of data collection for large pelagic shark species, the establishment of catch limits for certain shark species, skates and rays in the North Sea, deepwater sharks in the north-east Atlantic, prohibiting trawl fisheries within littoral areas in the Mediterranean, banning the use of driftnets that may catch large pelagic sharks, prohibiting shark finning and establishing specific conditions under which only the removal of fins of sharks may be authorised – which is what we are discussing today – and the control and limitation of fishing capacity."
"It is important to note that many of these measures apply to EC vessels, irrespective of whether or not they operate in EC waters."
"Such measures should also be promoted in the international context, especially in other FMOs where we support measures to ensure appropriate management in respect of high-sea fisheries."
"The Commission’s departments are currently reflecting on whether a formal plan of action for sharks should be developed in the very near future and I am favourably inclined to doing so."
"However, considering the importance of the work to be done, the necessary collection of information, reflection and consultation and assessment of possible measures, it would not be realistic to set the finalisation date of any comprehensive Commission proposal for a plan of action for sharks within the time limit indicated in Amendment 8."
"Thank you very much. The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"The next item is the report by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto in agricultural products and foodstuffs (COM(2005)0671 C6-0033/2006 2005/0279(CNS)) (A6-0253/2006)."
"Mr President, thank you for the opportunity, even if it is fairly late, to speak about our proposals for new import provisions for organic products."
"And thank you, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for the valuable report."
"With more than 150 000 holdings on 4.4 million hectares, an estimated turnover of almost EUR 11 billion in 2002 and a clear tendency to further growth, this is a very important sector."
"Considering the very wide range of products on the market and the number of processed products that contain one or more imported ingredients, it is clear that imports are vital for the development of the organic sector within the European Union."
"We need to be sure that consumers are confident that the products that they buy as being organic really are so, whether they are imported or produced within the European Union and that there is no unfair competition for European organic producers."
"At the same time, we need to make firm arrangements for our trading partners so that organic production can continue to increase."
"Since 1992, imported products have been able to enter the European Union either from third countries that are recognised by the Community as providing equivalent official guarantees – there are now seven countries on that list and about the same number of applicant countries – or through Member State authorisations for the entry of specific consignments."
"The latter system derogates from the common rules, which expire at the end of 2006."
"With this proposal, we want to fill the gap between that date and 1 January 2009, the date of entry into force of the overall proposal we have submitted, which contains exactly the same provisions on imports as we have on the table tonight."
"There is no difference between what we are proposing now and what will be included in the main proposal entering into force on 1 January 2009."
"We propose to keep the third country list as it is, but to replace Member State authorisations with a permanent Community system."
"Finally, our proposal provides for direct access for fully compliant products in order to respect our international trade obligations."
"I have noted that the report calls for extra guarantees on this last possibility of direct access."
"I do not think that our positions on this issue are very far apart."
"We want to go as far as we can in requesting guarantees from third country operators that are willing to take that route, but without putting ourselves in a position where we could be challenged by the WTO system."
"Therefore, I can partially accept Amendments 1 and 2."
"To a great extent, I can agree in principle to your other amendments, but I would prefer to keep this proposal as concise and simple as possible, setting out all the main rules needed, but not more than that."
"Further details should, in my view, go into the future implementing rules."
"I have also noted with pleasure the great willingness to support the development of the local control bodies in third countries."
"This is a policy element that I support, but it does not belong in this regulation."
"Commissioner, I would ask for your understanding."
"I am very sorry, but we must work within time limits that are already entirely stretched."
"The rapporteur has five minutes."
"I am going to ask him just to use four."
"– Mr President, since we are still here at this hour – you have to be, we have to be, and the Commission is here too – we should not spend a quarter of an hour arguing."
"It really does not matter whether the clock is striking midnight or quarter past;"
"I intend to make full use of my five minutes."
"We, Commissioner, are pretty much in agreement where our assessment of the situation is concerned; the organic market is going through a boom, with a shift from the producers who formerly marketed their products directly, from shops specialising in them and in health foods to chain stores who now want to cash in and exploit the boom in the organic market."
"If they get into the business, they will demand a cut of 10% or 20%, a quite considerable sum that the European producers cannot afford."
"Your attitude to the existing regulation is inconsistent."
"At one point, you say that you want to change what it says about transactions with third countries, which amounts to a revision of it."
"You want a whole new regulation to deal with what is at the heart of this one, and that is what we have found questionable, since your way of dealing with most – almost every third article – of the draft regulation involves you saying that the details will be sorted out through the comitology procedure, that is to say, in the implementing provisions."
"We find that too imprecise."
"What we, in this House, asked you to do was to make improvements; that is why we have put forward only a working paper rather than a report."
"As far as imports are concerned – that is to say, the relationship with the third countries – we see it as necessary that the products be obtained in the quantities that the chains need; the problem is that their production in those countries is not in line with EU standards, and so the rules applicable to this urgently need to be tightened up."
"We support that, even though, where the core regulation is concerned, we have misgivings as to whether you are perhaps not being too accommodating to the demands made by the chains, who are no longer interested in the names of the producers or the names of traditional organic farming associations, but want to get people buying anonymous food so that they can market it under their names."
"Here, then, there are divergent tendencies; we may well have our misgivings in one case, but in this one we are on your side in that we would like to see the EU’s standards maintained in third countries."
"Although reference has been made to the notified third countries, it is still the case that 70% of imports reach us by way of what are termed import permits, which involves scrutiny, not of the production process, but, basically only of the accompanying documents that certify that something is ‘organic’."
"We all know that paper is patient; so we also need to see to it that the European Union’s standards apply in these countries."
"According to you, we have gone rather further in our amendments, but that is not so, Commissioner; the fact is that we are in agreement with you."
"We are seeking greater precision in certain areas, and would like the European Parliament to have a hand in this notification process in the same way as the individual countries are to be involved in it; we would like to see this documented in a report from the Commission detailing how far you have got with the compilation of the data and how far the notification has progressed."
"We would also like to see a database set up to contain the data thus collected on the third countries, so that the risks can be monitored by means of checks – which, since we know the sort of people we are dealing with here, will have to be targeted – the object being to ensure that no cheating is going on."
"We would like this report to take into account the criticisms we have made, and hope that you will not hold back from this House any of the data you have compiled."
"We would not want to see a repeat of what happened with the study on qualified market access, where all that was left at the end was market access full stop and qualification got lost somewhere along the road."
"All that we are looking for now – since you have mentioned the WTO – is an example of something that will take us towards trade, too, being ‘qualified’."
"."
"Madam President, I should like to join in the rapporteur’s protest."
"A Commissioner who is always present and regularly attends the committee meetings is being silenced this evening after five minutes!"
"We had to wait for her fellow-Commissioner, Mr Frattini, for 10 minutes during this afternoon’s vote, and he was given 15 minutes’ speaking time."
"This Commissioner is always present, whatever time slot she is given."
"The fact that we hold debates on agricultural policy at 11.30 at night is nothing to do with her, but with your agenda."
"I join in that protest and I will also report this to the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development tomorrow."
"I will presently turn to the subject in hand, but I would first like to repeat my strong condemnation of the silencing of a Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development who did not ask for this time slot, but who is nevertheless here and seriously engaging with us in debate."
"The time at which she is here is not of her choosing but is the choice of your Bureau."
"The Commissioner said that she understands Parliament’s wishes."
"The essence of the subject we are discussing today is that import products must meet the requirements of production in the European Union."
"That is essential and that has been clearly stated in the report."
"My group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is pleased with the outcome in the Agricultural Committee and what has been discussed there is reflected in amendments."
"I should like to add a remark of a political nature."
"In the forthcoming world trade agreements, it is essential that import products meet the same requirements as European products."
"That applies not only to organic agriculture but also to agriculture as a whole."
"I hope that we in this House will give sufficient backing to the Agriculture Commissioner on that point, also giving our support in the discussion at Commission level involving her fellow-Commissioner Mr Mandelson."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report, and I shall advise my group to vote in favour of the report as amended in the Agricultural Committee."
"Thank you very much."
"I would ask all of the Members to appreciate that the interpreters are due to finish work at twelve."
"We can hold on a few minutes longer, but not much more."
"I do not want to run the risk of our not having interpreting tomorrow and you should not run that risk either, and I would therefore ask you simply to remain within the time allotted to you."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said that he was going to speak for the five minutes allotted to him and that is what he has done."
"He has spoken for precisely the five minutes allotted to him."
"You therefore have no reason to protest."
"Mr President, I shall restrict myself to the allotted time."
"At the end of 2005, the Commission presented two legislative proposals: a proposal for a Regulation on organic production, which will replace the current one from 2009, and the proposal that we are debating now on the import scheme."
"With regard to imports, improving the Community system was desirable and urgent, particularly in order to simplify definitively the system of authorisation of imports from third countries in which there is no or was no general equivalence in terms of organic production and in order to facilitate access to the market for organic products, which currently have a weak administrative structure."
"My group believes that the modification proposed has those laudable objectives."
"Nevertheless, I would like to draw attention to the fact that we cannot and must not allow it to reduce the guarantees to the consumer of the imported organic product – as the Commissioner herself has said quite rightly – or to create unfair competition for European operators."
"I believe that those are the risks that we may run."
"Inspection procedures that take account of these risks and that are based on clear rules have become crucial, and it is therefore essential to regulate the recognition and accreditation of certifying bodies at European level."
"In this regard, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work that has been done within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Having said that, however, I would like to say briefly that we are only talking about one part of the legislation on organic products."
"The report on the regulation is in deadlock because, amongst other things, the rapporteur alleges that she has not received all of the documentation from the European Commission."
"I would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission to do everything it can to put an end to this situation and to allow the work on the report to continue and to complete the parliamentary procedure so that we can establish clear, simple and effective rules for this market and clear up the uncertainty currently faced by organic producers."
"."
"Mr President, I wish to offer my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur for his excellent report on the Commission’s proposal to amend the current regulation relating to third-country farming and importation into the EU of organic products."
"It is clear for everyone to see that there is a worldwide growing demand for organic produce, and the EU Member States are no exception."
"The importation of organic products from third countries can thus be a very lucrative enterprise, but the current practices involving such importation are, sadly, not sufficient to necessarily guarantee the quality of a product."
"We therefore very much welcome this much-awaited Commission proposal."
"At the same time, we recognise that the proposal has a number of weak points and gaps, which the rapporteur has detected and seeks to correct through a number of amendments, all of which we find both rational and fair."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has complemented his effort by also putting forward a series of valuable amendments."
"We have no strong objections to any of the amendments, but we wish to draw attention to the fact that the main problem relating to safeguarding the strict adherence to the regulations shortly to be made into EU legislation is that of implementation."
"This in fact is the weak link in bringing together many EU legislatures with application effectiveness."
"And we fear that, despite the undoubted improvements to be effected by the numerous amendments, this legislation will still be crippled by inefficiencies in actually and properly implementing it."
"Hoping that time proves me wrong, I once again congratulate the rapporteur on a job well done."
"Mr President, today’s debate on the draft concerning the labelling of organic agricultural products is in line with the general global trend of an increased demand for healthy food."
"We are currently having to deal with surplus food production in the countries of the European Union."
"We are also witnessing a noticeable growth in the number of cases of illnesses caused by the consumption of food saturated with chemicals."
"Consumers are therefore choosing to buy food that is more expensive but safer."
"It is not possible to produce such food in many countries because of the poor condition of significant areas of land."
"Neither is it possible to produce such food on large farms."
"This situation represents an opportunity for countries where the soil is relatively undamaged and which have small or medium-sized farms."
"It also represents an opportunity to at least partly resolve the problem of unemployment in rural areas."
"Of course, we also have concerns regarding the introduction of unhealthy food into the European Union."
"Deception is very common in international trade."
"We may shortly be overwhelmed by so-called healthy food, originating from China for example."
"The appearance on the European market of theoretically healthy food produced from genetically modifed plants poses an additional risk."
"In order to deal with both cases, we should introduce provisions placing an outright ban on the importing of organic produce from outside the Union unless there is complete certainty about the quality standards under which it was produced."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even in his absence, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report, which really is a very good one."
"For many farmers, organic farming represents an alternative mode of production."
"The advent of genetic engineering is prompting a constant increase in demand for organic products from monitored and certified farms."
"Organic foods account for some 5% in terms of quantity of the turnover of the retail trade in food, with consumers opting for organic products not only because of their richer flavour, but also out of a sense of responsibility for the environment and for animals and in order to make a real contribution towards keeping the countryside intact and diverse."
"If strategy is to be based on quantity, then countries like Austria – from which I come – can never succeed in tough competition with the big agricultural countries; we must instead go all out for quality – the highest possible quality – products from a high-quality environment."
"A high proportion of Austrian agriculture is organic – organic farms accounting for 11.2% of the total – and we are very pleased about that."
"The total organic food turnover in Austria amounts to some EUR 450 million per annum."
"Confidence in organic products can be maintained only if stringent checks are carried out in all areas, in other words on all products, whether originating from the EU or from third countries."
"Only then is there any guarantee that consumers will be willing to pay the higher prices demanded for these products."
"Mr President, organic food production is becoming increasingly important in my constituency in Ireland."
"Over the years, Irish farmers have taken great pride in high quality food produced naturally."
"Going organic has been a logical development for many of them."
"I am involved in several amendments."
"One seeks to limit organic seeds to less than 0.1% GMO contamination, adding another safeguard to the original regulation which only specifies that the parent plant, not the seed, should have been produced organically."
"The amendment to Article 16 reinforces the definition of organic agricultural products."
"The Commission’s proposal allows for a series of exceptions from organic production rules, such as the case of setting up organic farms or solving livestock management problems."
"This would lead to products that are not organic and not GM-free being on the market labelled as organic."
"Instead we need to amend this article to control abuses, only allowing for exceptions in specifically stated and unusual conditions, such as an outbreak of avian flu."
"If we are going to ask consumers to choose organic, we are going to have to ensure that what they buy is actually organic."
"– Mr President, my congratulations to the rapporteur."
"We pay a high price nowadays, because much of our diet consists of unhealthy products, many of which are contaminated with various agrochemicals."
"We need to adopt a Mediterranean diet, using products without a lot of fats and pesticides."
"Organic products are starting to guarantee a better diet, which is why they have been growing over recent years and quite right too."
"The European Union, in a bid to protect consumers, has laid down proper production rules and strict controls and, in my opinion, quite rightly so."
"However, I still have doubts about organic products imported from third countries, as to whether they are produced to the standards which apply in the European Union."
"The certificates which accompany organic products from third countries must refer each time to the specific consignment."
"Undertakings in third countries producing organic products for export to the European Union should be inspected once a year."
"The European Union wants organic products, but for reasons of consumer protection and equal competition with our farmers, all these controls are needed, because otherwise we shall not have results."
"We shall simply help the supermarket chains to get richer at the expense of consumer health and at the expense of European farmers."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for a very good report and the Commissioner for being here at such a late hour."
"I should like to ask you, Mr President, to give the Commissioner enough time to sum up properly at the end of the debate."
"As she is good enough to come here at this time, we should finish our debate properly."
"Concerning organic farming and organic products, I want to stress that people are increasingly buying organic produce, which is to be welcomed."
"However, they naturally expect those products to be organic, not to be produced with chemicals or chemical fertilisers."
"One of the problems with organic food is the difficulty of testing it to see how it has been produced."
"It is very important, therefore, to monitor production in the countries from which we import organic produce."
"One problem I foresee with organic production generally, not only in Europe but also outside, is that one of these days a TV documentary will be shown following this food production process from beginning to end that finds that the food is perhaps not as organic as it is believed to be."
"That will turn people off the whole process."
"It is important, therefore, that people are absolutely certain when they buy a product imported from outside the European Union that those high standards of organic production have been met."
"This report and the Commission’s work are therefore very important, not only for imported organic food but also with regard to ensuring a completely level playing field across Europe in terms of the definition of organic products."
"That way, consumers can buy them with great confidence and we in the farming community can produce them with great confidence."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner again and shall leave her a few seconds to sum up."
"I should like to raise five issues relating to organic farming."
"The first issue is the labelling of organic products, which means the use of a Community logo for organic products or a national or regional logo, together with information on the place of origin and similar data."
"The second matter relates to the conditions in which the organic product is produced, the standards applied and the monitoring carried out."
"It is essential to have a list of substances whose use is permitted in organic agriculture, such as plant protection substances, fertilisers, substances used to improve soil quality, enhancers and substances used in processing."
"Organic food production takes place in a safe and clean environment that is free from antibiotics, growth hormones and genetically modified organisms."
"The certification control system should be subject to compulsory accreditation and continuous monitoring."
"Thirdly, there is the issue of the value of organic food and its promotion."
"Consumers need to be made aware of the advantages of organic products in order to increase demand."
"Better marketing and awareness-raising measures are required to increase the consumption of organic products."
"Fourthly, organic farming meets consumers’ needs and expectations regarding food quality."
"Organic farming provides an opportunity for farmers to increase their income."
"It is also an opportunity to strengthen regional and local development, notably in less developed areas."
"Finally, support for organic farming by means of subsidies for organic farming and support for the creation of a system of appropriate distribution and promotion."
"This is the weakest link in the relationship between producers and consumers."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, and the rapporteur for his report."
"Mr Parish has made the point that consumers place great faith in the word ‘organic’ and in organic produce, and we need to ensure that those who want to buy organic are actually getting what they believe is a very pure product."
"But the truth is – and I am indebted to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland for this gem of information, which I think we in this Chamber probably all know about – there is no recognised scientific test to differentiate organic and conventional produce."
"It means that we need to make sure that from the seed onwards there are checks and balances in the system."
"We probably have it right on paper, but it is in terms of implementation where this may fall down."
"People are paying higher prices for organic produce."
"On the Irish market less than 1% of food is organic."
"We import 70% of our organic needs and again I have to refer to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, because there are over 70 countries listed."
"Some of them I would not have thought would be in the organic league I have to say, but they are on the list and I think that because they are on the list we need to reassure consumers, certainly in Ireland and across the EU, that if they buy organic produce from those countries, they meet the same standards of organic produce from within the European Union."
"I think a paper trail is great and the EU is very good on that."
"My biggest concern relates to who is monitoring the control bodies and who is checking the auditors."
"This is a concern I have across all of our legislation and it is perhaps something that the Commissioner might address in the short time she has available to her."
"But yes, the organic sector is growing."
"It is a small sector, but I share Mr Parish’s concern that any crack in confidence will destroy it."
"It will destroy the market for producers, it will ruin consumer confidence and it is something we should seek to avoid."
"My fear is that some organic produce being imported into the EU is anything but organic."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Members for all their comments, although some of them seem to be related more to the general regulation on organic products."
"I hope that next time we have a discussion on this issue we will have a bit more time so that I can go into more detail."
"Regarding Amendment 13, a meaningful report cannot be drawn up before the first list of control bodies has been functioning for longer; in any case, not before the date of entry into application of the full regulation on 1 January 2009."
"The idea of training of local certifiers is a good one, and we will have to find ways of planning this training."
"Training support and technical assistance is also foreseen in the official food and feed control regulation."
"The idea raised by the rapporteur of a databank seems to be difficult to implement, but I would be willing to look further into it."
"The requirement for the control bodies to be accredited in the context of the list of third countries in paragraph 4 is not applicable, as there is governmental supervision in these cases."
"For the control bodies that are listed in paragraph 5, I agree in principle to the request for formal accreditation, but adequate governmental supervision should also be acceptable as an alternative in that situation."
"We should also be able to show some flexibility to local bodies in developing countries and in countries at an early stage of development, from whom it is not always feasible to have international accreditation."
"I agree with the idea of the supervision of control bodies – I think that it is crucial and essential."
"But we would prefer a more general wording on supervision."
"More detailed rules can be set out in the implementing rules; but, as mentioned in my introduction, I would prefer to have a very simple and concise proposal."
"To conclude, Amendments 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15 and 16 are partially acceptable or acceptable in principle."
"The other amendments cannot be accepted."
"Thank you for the debate."
"I think – maybe not in the letter, but at least in spirit – we are heading in the same direction."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Please forgive me."
"Please appreciate our time limitations."
"Despite everybody’s efforts, we have finished almost a quarter of an hour later than planned."
"I would like to thank the interpreters for their understanding, allowing us to finish the debate with all of the limitations that I regret having had to impose on them."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0216/2006) by Mr Ransdorf on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on nanoscience and nanotechnologies: An action plan for Europe 2005-2009 [2006/2004(INI)]."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor on the issue of nanotechnology with some trepidation, because we have seen that the original plans in this area, from the point of view of the budget, have not been fulfilled."
"We have seen expenditure cut by 38%, and, even though in the last framework plan there was a substantial increase from EUR 140 million per year to EUR 600 million, this figure still falls short of what we would have wanted, especially given the EU’s dynamism in this area."
"We are still in a great position in the area of fundamental research and publication – the EU is ahead of the United States in the field."
"As regards patents, however, the United States’ worldwide share is 42%, whereas the EU stands at 36%."
"We have also seen that when it comes to getting products onto the market, the EU works more slowly."
"US federal expenditure is approximately equivalent to that of the whole of the EU in the area of nanotechnologies and nanosciences, and the individual Member States have unequal spending levels."
"In fact, only Ireland spends more per head of the population than the United States."
"I wish to stress the fact that opinion polls carried out in 2001, based on a sample of 16 000 people, showed that very few people in the EU are informed about nanotechnologies."
"In this regard, I should like to quote two great scholars."
"The first is Johann Wolfgang von Goethe."
"In Faust, Mephisto says: ‘Despise reason and science, and you are mine, all mine’."
"I do not wish to take the same position as Mephisto, but, in any event, I should warn against cutting spending in this area in comparison with other countries."
"The other great scholar I wish to quote – and I hope this makes him happy, even though he is not here today – is Günter Verheugen, who last week listed the ten priorities for the Union in this area, one of which is of course preparation of staff, that is to say, investing in educating the public so that it is ready for the new technologies."
"We cannot move forward without such change, because public opinion in the EU is often not in favour of these technologies."
"Some safety issues are of course exaggerated, for example, some proposed amendments tabled to this report by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"Amendments 3 and 6, for example would mean the virtual collapse of a whole framework of progress in research into nanosciences and nanotechnologies in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"It is unacceptable that an entire complex research programme should be dismantled on the grounds that there can only be investment in areas where there will be no exposure for people and the environment."
"I believe that the European public, the European citizens, should be given safety guarantees, but it is not possible for us to wipe out an entire complex research plan."
"Let me say that it is vitally important to emphasise the social aspect of nanotechnologies."
"They represent a huge opportunity for creating new jobs, for increasing investment in people, and for strengthening the whole area of medicine and health science."
"In this regard, nanotechnologies represent a huge opportunity."
"They are comparable in scope with microelectronics in the 1960s, 70s and 80s."
"Just like microelectronics, nanotechnologies permeate every area of people’s lives."
"They have major implications in the field of energy, for example, in terms of the possibilities of new lighter, more reliable and more robust materials."
"The possibility also opens up of building transport equipment that will use less energy."
"Demand for materials and energy can be cut substantially by means of using nanotechnologies."
"This, ladies and gentlemen, is the challenge that we have to meet head on if we are to guarantee that the European Community remains competitive on the world stage."
"Ladies and gentlemen, these are my introductory remarks and I look forward to the debate."
"I should like to thank Mr Potočnik and Mr Verheugen of the Commission, the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and Mr Renzo Tomellini, head of the nanosciences and nanotechnologies unit."
"Mr President, I am here today to talk about the big issue of small technologies."
"Over 2000 years ago, the ancient Greek politician Demosthenes said: ‘Small opportunities are often the beginning of great enterprises.’"
"I believe he was right."
"And I mean enterprise in every sense of the word – not just as a business, but as a project and a voyage of discovery."
"Nanotechnology has already shown that it holds a lot of promise."
"It not only offers new solutions to many current problems, but also opens up new innovation opportunities, boosting the economy and creating jobs."
"Nanotechnology is already making a difference in many areas."
"For example, new medical treatments are being developed for severe diseases such as brain tumours and Alzheimer’s disease; it is helping the environment through more efficient catalysts, better batteries and more efficient light sources; and smaller, lighter and better-performing materials, components and systems are being created."
"But nanotechnology could also make a huge contribution to major global challenges such as how to tackle threats to the environment, how to make better use of resources and create less waste, and how to improve energy generation technologies."
"Europe is in a leading position in the world today, partly thanks to the Commission’s framework programme."
"European industry should now reap the benefits of that knowledge through innovative products and processes."
"But to follow through, we need to take action on several fronts, which are outlined in the Commission’s communication Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies: An Action Plan for Europe 2005-09."
"These include the need to increase investment, boost interdisciplinarity, create necessary infrastructures, expand human resources and foster innovation."
"Much progress has already been made in implementing the action plan: Commission funding for research in nanosciences and nanotechnologies has steadily increased to about EUR 470 million in 2005."
"In fact, the Commission has now become the world’s largest single public funding agency for nanotechnology."
"It accounted for 30% of public funding of nanotechnology research in the European Union last year."
"Significant funding increases are expected over the duration of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The Commission has proposed expanding funding for nanotechnology, with a new emphasis on developing infrastructures and projects assessing the risk of nanotechnology for humans and the environment."
"That is a key area, because, as well as the benefits, we must also recognise the potential risks."
"These must be carefully assessed."
"Some concerns have already been raised about new applications."
"The action plan addresses these too."
"Special projects and publicity in many languages will provide information and communication."
"There are projects to engage the public – presenting both sides of the argument; brochures explaining how nanotechnology works; and even DVDs explaining the issues in simple terms for children."
"In addition, the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies is working on an opinion on the ethics of nanomedicine, which we expect to be delivered to President Barroso soon."
"The Commission is committed to ensuring a balanced approach."
"What is fundamental is to have a high level of public health, safety, environmental and consumer protection."
"To do that, in Europe we need to identify the safety concerns, collect data for a health and environmental impact assessment of the product, and act at the earliest possible stage through adjustments, where necessary, of risk assessment procedures for nanotechnology."
"The Commission is also looking at the European legislation applicable to nanotechnology."
"We are assessing how adequate and appropriate that legislation is to deal with the increasing use of nanotechnologies."
"We also need to consider potential regulatory issues."
"Lastly, we are active in many international fora, addressing new issues and seeking to develop a code of good conduct."
"I am very happy to note that the European Parliament, through the report of Mr Ransdorf, fully recognises the important role to be played by nanosciences and nanotechnologies and welcomes the Commission’s action plan."
"I find it very positive that the report calls for increased public investment in related research and development, particularly in developing relevant infrastructures and nanomedicine."
"It is equally important that it stresses the importance of creating the right climate for innovation in Europe as well as emphasising the importance of ‘speaking with one voice’ internationally in this highly promising research area."
"I am very happy to note that the report has enjoyed a very large measure of support from the three parliamentary committees that have discussed it."
"To conclude, I hope I have given you a brief outline of the Commission’s balanced and growing nanosciences and nanotechnologies policy."
"Together, we can all benefit from that exciting new enterprise."
"I thank the European Parliament for its support so far and hope you will continue to support the Commission in further developing the European dimension of nanoscience and research."
"."
"Mr President, I am pleased that Mr Ransdorf has incorporated many of our committee’s suggestions into his report."
"It is clear that nanosciences and nanotechnologies represent one of the fastest-growing industries of the 21st century."
"Nanotechnology has the potential to have an impact on a number of industries and it has a predicted market of nearly one trillion euros within a decade."
"However, Europe has been slow to realise this potential and thus holds a small market share in research and development and education and, as a result, industrial innovation in this field."
"It is imperative that the EU adopt this plan to support nanoscience development, education and vocation within the Member States."
"Furthermore, an emphasis on nanoscience and nanotechnology is critical to reaching the goals set by the Lisbon Strategy."
"With regard to the report, I should like to highlight a few goals that have been incorporated and identify an important point that unfortunately has not been addressed adequately."
"Firstly, nanoscience and nanotechnology is permeated with ethical issues."
"As such, I am pleased that the report has included our committee’s suggestion to maintain high ethical principles and has welcomed public reviews on non-therapeutic human enhancement and privacy."
"In addition, I support the Commission’s proposal to respond to the dynamic nature needed for proper regulation in this field."
"Secondly, the proposal has a strong emphasis on patents."
"Reform, as well as global incorporation of the patent system for nanoscience and nanotechnology within the Member States, is crucial to Europe’s success in this field."
"Reform must include a decrease in cost for the patent process, as well as an increase in accessibility of patents for SMEs."
"Furthermore, to promote global compliance with patent recognition and protection, we should emphasise the importance of fulfilling WTO regulations, especially in China."
"However, protection of intellectual property rights, both internationally and within Europe, has not been developed sufficiently in the report."
"Member States are called upon to coordinate actions regarding IPR and act within OECD and UNESCO."
"This is too weak to protect IPR in this field."
"These organisations deal more with promoting good practices than with ensuring action."
"Thus, real standards could prove more effective."
"With strong growth projected in the field of nanosciences and nanotechnology, it is important that the EU accept the Commission proposal to adopt new approaches to this industry, from education to R[amp]D. Such actions will contribute to heightened competitiveness and development in our Member States."
"."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Ransdorf, my colleague and Vice-President of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, for his excellent report."
"I would like to affirm my Group’s general support for his report and for the Commission’s proposal."
"Nanosciences and nanotechnologies are very important for the future of the economy and society."
"They hold huge promise for industrial and other applications."
"It is a very exciting technology in all sorts of areas."
"As a measure of the priority we are giving to nanosciences and nanotechnologies in Europe, I note that this topic is a significant theme in the Seventh Framework Programme."
"I welcome this action plan."
"Having said that, I wish to enter a note of regret at the rather negative and fearful approach characterised in the Verts/ALE Group’s amendments."
"It is a pity to react against imagined risks, merely because they are in something that is so small as to be difficult to identify, or even, dare I say, to understand. Or perhaps that just applies to simple souls like myself."
"I would urge caution, therefore, on the requirements for labelling in advance of scientific evidence and on applying the precautionary principle."
"If we always applied this principle, then innovation, invention and inquiry would all go out the window and we would make no progress at all."
"I also want to enter a reserve on the issue of whether nanoparticles should be included in REACH."
"Let us be quite clear that many known particles are part of existing chemical stock and should therefore be treated under that category."
"We have enough problems with REACH without adding to them on a very small level."
"Finally, I shall end on a note of optimism and remind colleagues of the old saying ‘out of little acorns grow huge oaks’."
"I hope my party at home is listening to that remark."
"."
"Mr President, nanoscience deals with phenomena in solid state material at nano level, namely at the scale of 10-9 of a metre."
"Nanotechnology is based on this research."
"It is a particularly promising area of technology and represents a potentially positive trend that may dramatically increase the likelihood of progress in many areas of our lives."
"Amongst others, the automotive and aviation industries could benefit."
"One of these benefits could be the manufacture of smooth abrasion-proof coatings containing nano particles."
"There could also be benefits for our health, in the form of medicinal products or cosmetics."
"In addition, there may be useful spin-offs for the energy sector, in the form of fuel cells or nano-porous hydrogen absorbers and efficient solar batteries."
"I could also mention ICT technologies exploiting optical and spin states that facilitate further compression of information to be read with blue lasers, and to biotechnology, including DNA research and bioinformatic systems."
"To these examples one could add sensory or construction materials such as nano-composites or fibres and fabrics whose surfaces are activated by electron compounds."
"At the same time, unfortunately, permanent damage to the environment may be caused, and the atmosphere may be polluted by the long term presence of aerosol gases that are difficult to monitor."
"There are two kinds of nanotechnology."
"The first is known as ‘top down’ technology."
"Amongst other things it involves the transition from the macro to the nano state, for instance by the grinding of powders, and the development and activation of their surfaces through increased potential."
"Nano-diamond coating materials are one example of such technology."
"The second group is known as ‘bottom up’ technology and allows the molecular level to be set."
"The creation of highly integrated spintronic devices is one example of this."
"Unfortunately, we have few technologies available that use tunnel microscopy or self-organising phenomena."
"Biological information systems form part of this group."
"In conclusion, it should be stated that scienctific policy in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology should first take account of the fact that, as it stands, the development of ‘top down’ technology in the European Union allows for the creation of at least a few and perhaps more than a dozen technological platforms."
"Secondly, ‘bottom up’ technology requires further intensive cutting edge research in the area of basic science."
"And thirdly, a method of researching current pollution levels should be devised as a mater of urgency."
"I am referring to the current pollution of the atmosphere with nano particles that is not a result of nano technology."
"This is something more than PM 2.5, which passes easily into our bodies through cell membranes and whose catalytic action can be harmful to health."
"Who knows, perhaps the cancer epidemic may be linked to the permanent presence of nano-aerosols in our environment."
"It is a presence that is difficult to define, may be growing and has a range of sources."
". – Mr President, let me start with warm congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Ransdorf, who really has got stuck in to the subject and tried to cover every aspect of it;"
"I also appreciate his philosophical reflections at the beginning of his speech."
"We Europeans have to be aware of the fact that we will not remain leaders in a range of markets and technologies for ever, and that there are many markets in which we have already lost it, and along with it the power to control many technologies; one thinks of the pharmaceutical industry, more and more of which is moving away from Europe, and microelectronics, a sphere in which more and more of the discoveries are being made in Asia."
"Although, in nanotechnology, we Europeans are ahead of the world and are, technologically speaking, the tops, this has to be qualified by saying that we focus not only on the technology, but also on people, and that is a characteristically European approach, one that is brought out in this report – at any rate in the form in which it was adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"That is the form in which it must remain."
"The report in its present form strikes a balance between high-tech and the bounds of ethics as well as between industrial policy and the interests of the consumer, both of which are equally important and must be balanced."
"If we are to stay ahead, real support must be forthcoming from the European Union, and that can be done not only through the Seventh Framework Programme for Research but also – and this is at least equally important – through standardisation and the application of norms."
"What is needed for global competition is a globally binding framework, and this is where we can do as we did with GSM technology, where we Europeans were active in moving the process forward and achieved a certain position on the world market."
"The big problem with the whole nano-debate, though, is that the subject is too abstract; people have no conception of what it is about, and so, once more, the door is wide open to those who make it their business to spread fear throughout Europe, whose attitudes are reflected in a number of amendments tabled here, just as they were when we were considering software patents, and also, to some degree, with REACH."
"We cannot afford the same thing with nanotechnology, to which the scaremongers in the fear industry are becoming the principal obstacles."
"What we need at the moment, though, is every job we can get; it is because we must not blow out of the water the Lisbon Strategy that is on our lips every day that we have to make nanotech more real to people."
"Nanotechnology is already creating jobs;"
"I myself have visited firms working in this field and find it utterly fascinating."
"There is enormous scope available in the semiconductor industry, in the automobile sector and in medical technology."
"By all means, let us have risk assessments, but let us not go overboard about them."
"Can anyone among you confirm to me that they do not use a mobile phone in view of the known risks involved?"
"If consumers see the potential gain as greater than the potential damage, then they will use the technology; that is what is absolutely crucial, and that is why people need to be able to have the information on the basis of which they can come to their own decisions."
"We in the European Parliament are playing our part in ensuring that they get it."
"STOA, this House’s Committee for scientific technology options assessment, is organising nano-cafés, which are happening in Brussels on 18 October, and you are all warmly invited."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to say that we Greens are not opposed to nanotechnology, but things have to be done properly."
"Otherwise, we will never have the consumer confidence needed, we will not be able to take advantage of the great potential benefits of this technology, and investments will have been squandered."
"Those who spurn precaution are not friends of nanotechnology. Quite the opposite."
"At the moment, we are stepping on the gas of nanotechnology without first ensuring that we have emergency brakes or even knowing whether the steering is working."
"Nanoparticles are being used widely in sensitive consumer products such as cosmetics, detergents, paints and textiles."
"Our worry is that we may be paving the way towards a great health scandal in the future."
"These fears are not without foundation."
"The European scientific committee has stated, and points out in its opinion of 28 and 29 September of last year, that there are significant gaps in the knowledge required to assess the risks, for example with regard to the definition of nanoparticles, their detection and measuring, data, doses, responses, evolution, the persistence of nanoparticles in human beings and in the environment and all aspects of environmental toxicology."
"That same committee stresses that we do not even have methods for evaluating the risks."
"We are talking about elements that have a very different value."
"The main problem is that the uncontrolled release of nanoparticles may be considerably more dangerous than that of conventional particles, because nanoparticles are much more chemically reactive and are easily oxidisable, and radicals that are highly reactive and harmful to the human body may be produced."
"Nanotubes may behave in the human body in a manner similar to asbestos fibres."
"We all know what happened in the case of asbestos."
"Once they are released into the environment, we know very little about how nanoparticles behave and react, and the European Union must do everything it can to promote research in that area."
"Nevertheless, at the moment just a tiny fraction of investment in research is directed towards precaution, and we have no regulation whatsoever."
"We do not have a legal framework for the use of these products."
"Our policy cannot be to market these products first and then ask questions later."
"We need a policy of precaution in order to be able to move forward definitively with this technology."
". – Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that Parliament is devoting attention to the issue of nanosciences and nanotechnologies."
"I wish to express my appreciation and support for the report before us, which confirms that this is one of the key technologies of the 21st century."
"It is therefore appropriate that nanosciences and nanotechnologies should figure among the EU’s priorities."
"There are both negative and positive aspects to this issue, however."
"On the positive side is the support that upcoming technologies have gained across the whole of Parliament."
"As the report correctly says, the development of nanotechnologies presents an extraordinary opportunity."
"Europe is currently keeping pace with the world."
"I saw evidence of this a few days ago during a visit to the northern Czech town of Liberec."
"The results of work carried out by Liberec Technical University and a company in the town were, in terms of the research and application of nanotechnology, absolutely world-class, including the manufacture of exceptionally high-quality machinery."
"I should also like to point out that this is one of the smaller Czech towns and not a potential science centre, like Prague or Brno."
"Nanotechnologies also represent an opportunity, in my view, for smaller countries, and generally for smaller organisations."
"The development of nanosciences and nanotechnologies naturally requires substantial support, not only in the Czech Republic but also across Europe as a whole."
"The rest of world is already aware of this."
"Who do you think is among the most actively interested in the conclusions of the work of scientists and technical experts in Liberec?"
"Naturally, it is people from other continents – especially from North America, but also from South East Asia."
"Which brings me to one of the negative aspects of the development of nanotechnologies in Europe, and this is what I feel to be the insufficient protection of intellectual property in relation to the application of the results of research in other sectors."
"Another issue is financial support, which, in my opinion, is insufficient, complicated and difficult to obtain."
"The report also points out that the United States already accounts for 37% of the world’s expenditure, whereas Europe's spending stands at 24%, less than that of Japan."
"The planned funding of nanosciences and nanotechnologies as part of the Seventh Framework Programme also lags behind that of the US."
"To conclude. I should like to mention what I personally feel is a further significantly positive effect."
"Nanosciences and nanotechnologies offer very good prospects for young people with an interest in science and technology and in studying at university."
"We must not pass up this opportunity to give the development of science and technology in the EU fresh impetus."
"We must ensure that we are present when the prefix ‘nano’ – meaning ‘dwarf’ or ‘gnome’ – gives birth to a giant of the 21st century."
"Nanotechnologies are without doubt of great significance for the future of mankind."
"Progress is rapid, and the technology will have a dramatic impact on nearly every field."
"There is a deep-rooted notion in this House that all important phenomena such as this must be controlled by the EU."
"In every report it is stressed that organisation, legislation, supervision and funding must be the responsibility of the EU."
"In every report the importance of the EU not lagging behind the USA, Japan and China in terms of global competition is pointed out."
"Yet we never see any convincing analysis of what it is about the market that cannot sort itself out of its own accord and therefore requires official measures."
"We never see any convincing analysis of the level at which such official measures should be taken."
"Every single time, the reports are based on the idea that the European Parliament is perfect in its proficiency and therefore can and should charge the Commission and the Member States with the task of complying with its instructions."
"The European Parliament calls on and reminds everyone of the problems faced by the world and of how they are to be solved, stressing and emphasising these."
"For example, the rapporteur, Mr Ransdorf, wants Parliament to establish that nanotechnologies ought to be geared to the development of hydrogen energy."
"I contend that the European Parliament is guaranteed to be incompetent to decide a matter of this nature."
"Nanotechnologies are developed with the most speed and efficiency when not controlled from on high by international bureaucracies."
"It is the international research community, businesses and the national institutions that are best placed to experiment and compete in the field of nanotechnologies, and it is private and state organisations within the nation states that are best placed to produce information material about nanotechnologies in keeping with the values and experiences of their own peoples."
"The role of the EU in this context should be restricted to setting up a patent-monitoring system for this field, establishing ethical and environmental policy standards and possibly providing funding of very large-scale projects along the lines of fusion research."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Europe needs a consistent system of cutting-edge infrastructure, research and development in order to remain competitive in the field of nanosciences and nanotechnologies."
"Nanosciences and nanotechnologies can play a positive role in achieving important economic, social and environmental goals, and I hope that they will be able to meet the needs of the citizens and thus contribute to the well-being of the nations."
"There are undeniable facts that we cannot overlook: a whole host of technological advances are just round the corner thanks to the way in which atoms and molecules have been aggregated to form new materials."
"It is vital that more funding be granted to this area of research so as to guarantee the competitiveness of the European industrial system, but there must always be respect for inalienable ethical principles and public health and environmental criteria."
"I agree with some of the amendments tabled by Mr Hammerstein and Mrs Breyer, and they are: Amendment 1 to paragraph 2, which is a useful and sensible recommendation on the assessment of potential risks to human health and the environment and the subsequent social and ethical implications and which takes nothing away from the original text;"
"We cannot overlook the fact that there appear to be many toxicological risks linked to nanotechnologies, a point that is also upheld by countless experts interviewed by the prestigious MIT periodical ‘Technology Review’."
"The report does, however, also consider this side of things."
"As regards the new paragraph 5a, I believe, instead, that it is only right to advise caution in terms of a satisfactory risk assessment and to guarantee the traceability and labelling of, and accountability for, products based on nanotechnologies."
"However, although I agree about the limitations of research, I find the text to be slightly vague and so I shall abstain, just as I shall abstain on the proposed new paragraph 17."
"To conclude, the nations and Europe have to be competitive in the field of nanosciences, and the effort proposed seems minimal – a half-hearted commitment – in terms of trying to bridge the gap that already exists between us and both the United States and the Far East."
"The report rightly considers both the economic and strategic perspectives of the knowledge triangle and the requirements in relation to sustainability and people’s health."
"I shall therefore vote in favour of Mr Ransdorf’s excellent work."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today the European Parliament, with the report by Mr Ransdorf, whom I congratulate, is sending out an important and specific message: that nanotechnologies, with their surprising potential and development prospects, are at the centre of the European Union's development policies."
"Our researchers in this sector are not lagging behind researchers anywhere else."
"On the contrary, one could say that they are the first in the world."
"Thus, here too, the bet which we are being called upon to win is to develop and exploit economically the knowledge produced."
"In order to win this bet, we need, as in other knowledge sectors, to link our wealth of human resources with production promptly and effectively."
"We need cooperation between the state and the private sector."
"Universities, research centres, industry, companies and banks need to come together and cooperate closely and with vision."
"We need, above all, to advise and prepare the citizens for the revolution which nanotechnologies will bring to their everyday life."
"They will change the world as we know it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, nanotechnologies and nanosciences are to the 21st century what the Internet was to the 20th century."
"We cannot afford to again experience the European paradox which we have seen in the past."
"In the past, the Internet, a clearly European idea, was developed by America better than anyone."
"It is time, as the European Union, for us to prove that we know not only how to develop new ideas, but also to exploit them for the benefit of European citizens."
"Mr President, Mr Potočnik, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report and stress that the European Union must continue to attach importance to scientific research and technological development in nanosciences and nanotechnologies, which, furthermore, are one of the thematic priorities of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as previous speakers have said, nanosciences and nanotechnologies are seen as key technologies for the 21st century, with significant repercussions for our industry."
"This is a multidisciplinary field which opens up a whole range of new opportunities and of solutions to citizens’ and companies’ real needs, and it is therefore expected to make a great contribution to the European Union's achievement of its sustainable development and competitiveness objectives."
"The European Union is certainly the leader in this sector, although it invests considerably less in R and D in this field than the United States or Japan."
"I agree with the rapporteur’s opinion that the European Union must strengthen this leadership in order to consolidate and enhance our position in a highly competitive world context and in a very promising sector."
"To this end, it is not sufficient simply to increase investment in R and D. At the same time we must guarantee the excellence of research, ensure that we have sufficient qualified personnel, greater coordination of resources and better coordination of policies with the Member States, and continue to improve the business environment, mainly by modernising our SMEs and creating new ones on the basis of knowledge, so that excellent R and D in nanosciences and nanotechnologies is converted into new products and new processes."
"The European technological platforms linked to nanosciences and nanotechnologies contribute to establishing common research objectives and priorities that are of interest to industry."
"I would also like to stress the importance of international cooperation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must not place obstacles in the way of scientific progress. We must support our researchers, since it is they who are more aware of the pros and cons in this field than anybody else."
"What certainly is the case though is that, in order for the citizens to have faith in science, knowledge of scientific progress must be disseminated in a comprehensible manner and the public’s awareness must be improved, so that there is greater understanding of the real challenges and implications for our lives."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Ransdorf for his report and I should also like to thank Mr Potočnik for his presence in this House."
"Nanotechnologies are extremely important, and none more so than nanoelectronics, which enables us to achieve ever greater gains in efficiency while consuming less energy than we currently do with microelectronics, as is also confirmed by the platform’s work."
"Nanotechnologies signify the intelligent use of common materials, for example through filtration and catalysis, of materials that may enable us to avoid the difficulties linked at times to the scarcity of rare elements."
"I should, however, like to point out that the fears about the consequences for people’s health are not unfounded."
"The nanometric size of the particles requires consideration to be given to the risks associated with a new kind of toxicology."
"According to the available evidence, these particles can pass directly through the cell membranes and therefore may attack the nucleic acids."
"I think it only right for resources and energy to be devoted to this issue."
"I should like to conclude by addressing the Commissioner: we need to reform the European Patent Office, as it currently lacks satisfactory controls."
"Parliament must be able to have its say; the work can no longer just be intergovernmental, but must become part of the Union’s activities."
"The overall issue of advancing and safeguarding science is in fact a Union issue."
"– Mr President, what are policy-makers supposed to do about nanotechnology?"
"We cannot allow ourselves to become no more than promoters who uncritically accept hype, and nor can it be our function to go into the roadshow and nanocafé business in an attempt at allaying people’s real fears."
"We cannot allow ourselves to be no more than carriers of advertising for nanotechnology."
"Politicians are there to see to it that consumers and the environment are protected."
"Nanotechnology is used to put on the market products such as cosmetics, cleaning materials, and textiles, which are aimed at private consumers and virtually unregulated."
"As Mr Prodi has just said, there is no legal framework applicable to nanotechnology."
"When the Commission’s scientific committee admits, as it did on 29 September last year, and I quote, that ‘there are considerable gaps in terms of risk assessment, of characterisation and of the measurement of nano-particles."
"Little is known about the relationship between dose and effect, nothing at all about where in the human body nano-particles end up and how long they remain there, and little about the degree to which they are toxic to the environment’, then we cannot ignore that and bury our heads in the sand; on the contrary, is it for you, you in the Commission, to create a permanent legal framework to protect all consumers."
"Have we really learned nothing from our experience with asbestos?"
"We have just heard that nano-particles are capable of crossing the blood/brain barrier."
"Knowing as we do of these risks, surely we have to put protective mechanisms in place?"
"We cannot simply allow these products to be put onto the market and tested on consumers; we cannot allow consumers to be treated as guinea pigs!"
"It is no part of the role of policy makers to be placard carriers for nanotechnology; their role, on the contrary, is to put in place a comprehensive legal framework for their regulation, control and measurement – all the things, that is, to which your own expert opinion makes reference."
"Anything else would be to do a disservice to nanotechnology, which can make headway on the market, and be economically sustainable, only if we make it plain that account must also be taken of the interests of the consumers and of the risks involved."
"If Europe is to be a good place in which to site a business, it must also be a good place in which to be a consumer, and there is a lot missing in that respect."
"I see it as positively irresponsible that the Commission, even though it knows what is missing and is aware of the lack of any methodology for assessing the risks, wants to allow the marketing of consumer goods aimed at private citizens and their households, without the certainty of every risk having been removed."
"I again appeal to you, as a matter of urgency, to do something about this."
"We have as yet had little to say about the dangers, the ethical problems, about enhancement, about the enrichment of nano-particles in human beings, for we have long believed that these were the stuff of science fiction, but these perils are drawing closer."
"What I expect of the European Union is that it should give the USA an answer, and our answer, the European response to nanotechnology, far from being that we are willing to follow technology in a lemming-like fashion, must be that we will take a socially responsible approach and consider the risks involved."
"– Mr President, it is vitally important that attention be given to nanotechnology."
"The production of new material at the molecular level results in the creation of new characteristics, the effects of which on human health and on the environment are as yet unknown."
"The Commission has produced a proposal for an action plan to run until 2009, which is full of high expectations of the economic and social benefits, but the Commission regards the public's ethical misgivings and concerns mainly as obstacles, and so, Commissioner, in that respect, I have to tell you that the action plan is particularly unbalanced."
"The same, unfortunately, can be said of the Ransdorf report, even though it does, to some extent, act as a counterbalance."
"What, then, is missing?"
"What is absent, above all, is the willingness to consider concerns other than safety risks, not least the issue of whether or not new technologies are desirable, or issues to do with people’s convictions about life in general."
"The benefits and possible adverse effects must first of all be considered, in order to prevent choices being made solely on the basis of economic value while the technology is still at an early stage in its development."
"Secondly, we in the European Union must concentrate more on international coordination, not only as regards toxicity tests and risk assessments across the whole life cycle, but also as regards legislation on standards, labelling and liability, with those who market nanoparticles being liable for any damage caused by them."
"Finally, one has to consider the desirability or otherwise of patents relating to nanotechnologies and nanomaterials, particularly with regard to basic and general technology and to materials capable of being used in a wide variety of different ways."
"Can the Commission have a critical analysis done of this?"
"It might then consider the question of to what extent the patents and licenses would put poorer countries at a still greater disadvantage and what might be done to counteract this."
"Mr President, the results of research into nanotechnology and its applications indicate an enormous potential for producing materials with beneficial properties."
"The way in which these materials are exploited will have an impact on progress in the fields of industry, the economy and health protection in the 21st century, as well as improving our standard of living."
"The race to make further progress in the field of nanoresearch and nanotechnology has begun and the European Union cannot afford to lose it."
"The report indicates a range of obstacles to be overcome."
"These include legal and formal issues, protecting intellectual property, coordinating research and making it available to the public, setting up interdisciplinary research groups, training, obtaining additional funding from private investors and the safe use and management of new materials."
"All these activities should be monitored and supported by Parliament."
"I should like to thank Mr Randsford for a sound and much-needed report."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report, which sets out very precisely the trends in this dynamic sector of science and technology."
"The changes brought about by nanotechnologies are comparable with the technological revolutions of the past and may perhaps even outstrip them."
"The possibilities unfolding before us give rise to a series of challenges."
"The report reacts to some of these, while leaving others unanswered."
"The conclusion from the text before us is that our global partners and competitors are aware of the importance of nanotechnologies and related research."
"This is clear from the sums earmarked for this research and from the conditions created for it."
"Although the Commission had intended to raise the volume of funding from the Seventh Framework Programme earmarked for nanotechnologies, it did not actually do so substantially, according to the rapporteur, who compares the public and private resources of Europe, the United States and Japan in this regard."
"Europe lags behind the United States as regards both generating competitive infrastructure and adopting standards on intellectual property."
"The issue of patenting inventions in the area of nanosciences and nanotechnologies is moving ahead slowly in Europe and the report emphasises the need to reform the European patent system in order to help science and innovation as a whole."
"What is sadly missing is a timetable."
"One aspect of the use of nanotechnologies missing from the report is that of their possible use for the military."
"The fact that these technologies are not the subject of any restrictions may come back to haunt us."
"The free transfer of these technologies is likened by Thomas van der Molen in his report to providing a nuclear reactor to all countries on the understanding that none will be used for developing nuclear weapons."
"I believe that in the near future we will have to take the area of nanotechnologies into account too, and address this question."
"– Nanotechnologies have potential, but anyone seeking, uninformed, to release such technologies onto the consumer market, unregulated and without safeguards, really does jeopardise such potential."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wants knowledge to come first, then regulation protecting the environment and health and then marketing."
"That is the right order."
"Nanoparticles do not have the same toxic characteristics as ordinary particles."
"Coal dust is not hazardous, but nanoparticles in the form of carbon clusters cause serious brain damage in fish within 48 hours at concentrations as low as 0.5 ppm."
"Nanotubes are capable of destroying mitochondrial DNA, while nanoparticles on the skin can migrate to the brain and the lymph nodes and damage our bodies."
"Our immune system is simply not adapted to cope with nanoparticles."
"The EU’s own research shows that non-biodegradable and biologically incompatible nanoparticles can be life-threatening and that all inhalation and ingestion of these should be avoided."
"Mr President, the main focus of the report is on the benefit of nanoscience and nanotechnologies and the need for Europe to be at the forefront of their development, in line with the Lisbon objectives of greater productivity and economic growth."
"While laudable, this leads to one major gap: the recommended increases in research in nanotechnologies are preceding legislation to regulate these technologies."
"Legislation should, at minimum, keep up with research."
"In the hurry to get ahead of China and the United States, we may see regulation including risk assessment as being something that could hold us back."
"However, there are questions on non-therapeutic human enhancement, privacy, equity, patenting, military applications, safety and health and the environment, which we need to answer first."
"Regulation in this case should ensure that we do not in our haste create very difficult problems."
"If it is good regulation, it will serve research and make it more focused and effective."
"‘Look before you leap’ has always been a good and useful maxim."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Ransdorf, for his committed report, in which he has handled this important issue with a great deal of awareness and sensitivity, and it now needs to be found its right place within the framework of the European institutions."
"On the one hand, there is fundamental research, there is the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, the Europe Research Council, and the technology platforms – where we have done something of lasting value – and I would like to congratulate Commissioner Potočnik on the prospective great success of this Seventh Framework Programme."
"There is also the Joint Research Centre, which could do more to deal with what has become known as the anxiety industry, and its objectivity would certainly be a sound basis on which to monitor these new technologies."
"The ‘European Institute of Technology’ proposed by the Commission under President Barroso could make it its business, by means of a top-down strategy, to communicate the insights of fundamental research to the education and training sectors, or a bottom-up strategy might be employed to extract this knowledge from the educational institutions, but also and in particular from small and medium-sized businesses and to present it on such a platform as ‘eBay’, with the possibility of the net being used to exchange ideas, express aspirations and guarantee better communication in the twenty or more European languages."
"The fusion reactor ITER could also play a role in this respect, for it is in research into fusion and plasma that nanotechnology presents a whole new challenge as a means of advancing energy efficiency, minimising losses due to wear and tear, and of developing strategies for fighting against corrosion, not least in the generation of energy."
"There are many possibilities in many others fields, cleaning being one of them."
"I would like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Ransdorf, for his very accurate report highlighting the shortcomings in nanotechnology development, as well as the enormous opportunities and promising future of this sector."
"The European Commission’s action plan outlines preconditions for the continued support of this sector and calls on Member States to put more emphasis on it within the context of developing a knowledge-based economy."
"Nanotechnology forms an integral part of various technological disciplines and will, in the near future, have a major positive impact on virtually every branch of industry, and these facts alone necessitate the implementation of an action plan in order to ensure a high degree of coordination and support."
"I would now like to mention some of the problems facing this important area of research and development."
"I believe that research and development of any extent at all in the area of nanotechnology would in itself meet the criteria of excellence."
"However, in many instances this formal requirement, in combination with the requirement for a so-called critical mass of resources, blocks the participation of smaller university research and innovation centres, as well as innovation centres in small and medium-sized enterprises backed by national and European support programmes, such as the Seventh Framework Programme or the upcoming Framework Programme for Competition and Innovation."
"In this regard I would like to draw your attention on the one hand to the need for better cooperation between the small and large organisations that are active in this area of research and development, and on the other hand to the need to enhance the internal competitive environment."
"The other problem I would like to highlight is funding."
"We continue to witness a deterioration in the amount of funding available for research and development, and this applies also to nanotechnology."
"It only remains to be stated that despite our capable scientific and innovative potential we are clearly behind the US in this area."
"In addition to the Seventh Framework Programme, a solution might be sought, primarily for smaller research and innovation projects, in venture capital, where the potential for more efficient institutionalisation by means of public-private partnerships is often underestimated."
"I believe that the European Commission, along with the European Investment Fund, could play a better coordinating role through the JEREMIE Programme, accompanied by specific and clear recommendations to Member States regarding the creation of efficient incentives financed from public funds, including the structural funds."
"Nanoscience and nanotechnology have a great potential to make further contributions to the prosperity of mankind."
"However, politics too should act in line with technological development, be it with various initiatives or with legislative measures."
"Here we have to promote development and put into place legislation which prevents abuses and limits risks."
"In this light, the document drafted by the Commission is very important."
"However, we are rather late in dealing with this matter."
"Parliament, the Commission and the Council are close to finalising negotiations on the Seventh Framework Programme."
"This programme includes some essential elements of the Action Plan, such as research, innovation, and, to an extent, human resources."
"I sincerely hope that Parliament has been engaged in serious negotiations and has advocated an appropriate role for nanoscience, both by defining the subject areas for research and by attempting to secure a substantial increase in research funding."
"In this regard, there is one area which remains open and which the Action Plan defines as essential in securing the critical mass for infrastructure."
"It involves connecting universities, research organisations and industry and recommends that this objective be met through the use of existing mechanisms."
"In the meantime, a lively debate has been sparked about what is called the European Institute of Technology, which is a further development of this idea concerned with securing the critical mass with an emphasis on human resources."
"We have to take account of the well–considered conclusions that have already been reached about nanosciences and nanotechnologies when deciding on the development of future mechanisms for securing the critical mass."
"In this respect, I would like to stress that we need to facilitate cooperation both with those groups that have already demonstrated research excellence and with those that have a great potential to achieve excellence over a relatively short period of time."
"Nanosciences and nanotechnologies can serve as one of the test areas for establishing an ever closer relationship between the three sides of what is known as the knowledge triangle."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a splendid piece of work."
"– Mr President, according to the latest survey by the World Economic Forum, the capacity to innovate accounts for some 30% of the highly-developed countries’ competitiveness, and that is particularly true in the case of nanotechnology."
"Its use in medicine, for example, opens up possibilities of improved treatments for cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, which, together, account for two-thirds of deaths in Europe."
"This is a field in which Europe’s research institutions and businesses are world leaders; in the Netherlands alone, the nanotech industry achieves a turnover of EUR 20 billion, and the government is investing record amounts in it, for example in the ‘Centre for Molecular Medicine’ in Eindhoven."
"As an example of a pro-active strategy, with the sort of attitude that world development and competition are crying out for, businesses are doing likewise."
"The need for choices to be made, for investment, and for support to be given to European basic infrastructure – all these things are expressed well in the Ransdorf report."
"It follows that the task for the Commission, for the Member States, and for the regional authorities is to work together with industry and SMEs to ensure that this is put into practice in industrial production in this part of the world."
"The Seventh Framework Programme for research and development, the European technology platforms and the 'regions of knowledge', together with the Structural Funds, have laid a good foundation, particularly where finance is concerned."
"Then there are the risks."
"These must, of course, be considered, particularly at the global level within UNESCO and the OECD."
"Finally, this autumn sees Commissioner Potočnik embarking on a roadmap for research infrastructure, which should reveal which regions, areas or clusters really do have the potential to meet the challenge of global competition."
"Investment is not about a global ‘brain drain’, but should, on the ground, result in a ‘brain gain’ – a gain for the European economy and for the prosperity of Europe’s people."
"."
"Mr President, I should like, in a telegraphic way, to respond to and summarise what I think is the message from today’s debate concerning innovation, funding, risks, ethics and the regulatory framework."
"I shall take them one by one."
"On innovation, there is no doubt that nanosciences and nanotechnologies have a very high potential."
"Nanosciences are very much like information technology."
"So a breakthrough in this area would provide results for all sectors."
"That is why it is very important to pay close attention to innovation."
"If we were to compare ourselves to the United States, we would find that in many areas we are not lagging behind."
"However, the one area in which we are truly lagging behind is information technology."
"If you look at how much money we provide for innovation, research and development, you would find that even structurally, not just globally, we are lagging behind."
"We should not make the same mistake when it comes to innovation."
"We are trying to engage European technology platforms, joint technology initiatives – in which we are very active – and the companies from that area."
"I agree that the intellectual property issue, IPR, is also important and that is why it has received special attention in the action plan."
"Let me now turn to funding. We have two themes which are dealing with that very seriously."
"One is, of course, nanosciences and nanotechnologies and the other is information and communication technologies."
"However, there is more than that."
"There are also the questions that will be dealt with in the European Research Council, in the people programme, in the capacities programme, and in infrastructure – the things connected with regional development."
"So it is very hard to compare the money that was devoted today to FP6 with the money that will be used in FP7."
"What I can tell you is that the funding will be increased considerably in comparison with the existing situation."
"Again, if we compare the funding in Europe to that in the United States, we must not forget that the framework programme is 5% of European public funding."
"Therefore, it is obvious, if you compare how much public funding is provided for nanosciences, that it is 30% of that public funding in Europe."
"Obviously, we are giving it proportionally much higher attention than the Member States are doing."
"That has to be clearly underlined."
"Secondly, in normal circumstances, two thirds of funding should come from the private sector, where we have to focus our attention."
"So here one of the things we found out – and it was published in August 2006 – was what the decisive elements are according to the companies doing the research in the area of Europe: first, the existence of the market; and second, the knowledge pool, not the wage level."
"The wage level is almost irrelevant when we talk about knowledge and research and development."
"These are the areas which need attention."
"Thirdly, concerning the risks, it is true that we do not know everything and it would be hypocritical to say that we do, because it is not true."
"However, we know a lot, and I agree with all those who said that we need to pay proper attention to that in FP7."
"In the action plan we have also paid proper attention to the questions connected with the risks."
"Informal collection of inputs for further projects under FP7 has recently been completed."
"It is also extremely important that the way in which we approach questions of risk should be transparent and that we educate people in the proper way."
"Concerning ethics, it is quite clear that we have to maintain the high ethical standards and principles that we have always followed and pay proper attention to that."
"Finally, on the regulatory framework, regulatory issues again form an integral part of the action plan."
"They are concentrated there and the Commission is working in close collaboration with research DGs and DGs active in regulatory aspects, and with external experts, with a view to addressing various uncertainties with regard to potential hazards and exposure, to addressing gaps in knowledge, and to further developing guidelines and methods."
"The adequacy of existing and future legislation with regard to nanotechnology products is also being examined carefully."
"To summarise, without any doubt we need a balanced approach, which is transparent, with a high level of care for public health, safety, the environment and consumer protection, but aimed at exploiting the huge potential of nanosciences and nanotechnologies in research and innovation."
"Today’s report was a very good opportunity to underline all these components of our approach and I should like to thank honourable Members for their attention to these issues, for the support given to our work and for the concerns they have raised."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report by Mr Hutchinson, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on ‘more and better cooperation: the 2006 EU aid effectiveness package’ (2006/2208 (INI)) (A6-0270/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report I hope we are going to vote in favour of today follows directly on from the three Commission communications that constitute what is referred to as ‘the 2006 aid effectiveness package’ and the report is therefore more broadly about pursuing the objective of improving European development cooperation."
"So much for the context."
"As for what is at stake here – or even, I might say, constitutes the challenge – this could not be clearer: how are we Europeans significantly to improve the actual aid we provide to the countries of the South?"
"In other words, how are we to set about ensuring that the aid we grant to the countries of the South is converted much more systematically into practical progress such as will genuinely change the lives of millions of people living in humanly unacceptable conditions?"
"There is now a collective awareness of the fact that we could provide better aid, and political commitments have been made enabling us to give this issue priority status in our development cooperation policy."
"We have a European consensus on development and also a new strategy for Africa."
"That is excellent."
"Moreover, the legislative and technical arrangements are being put in place."
"If I may say so, all that remains for us to do is to give practical expression to all this."
"The many issues that we have dealt with in this report include the following: the actual definition of development cooperation and, therefore, of what each Member State is legitimately entitled to include under public development aid; the minimum level of aid to be obtained if our commitments are to be honoured; the untying of aid, a process that Member States – a number of them, in any case – are clearly reluctant to apply; the absence of indicators enabling real progress in improving European aid to be assessed; or, again, the concern of actors on the ground who note a certain reluctance to involve beneficiary countries in the strategies and programmes intended for those countries."
"In addition to these specific issues that give us some grasp of how far we still have to go in improving our aid in practical terms, the three Cs – complementarity of actions, coordination of programmes and coherence of policies - also constitute a framework within which to work and a particularly important template for interpreting the action that we shall have to take over the next few years where cooperation is concerned."
"When it comes to complementarity of actions, whether these be taken on a sectoral or geographical basis, the fact is that distribution of the work gives rise to some resistance and a number of difficulties."
"By adopting an open and bold approach, we should be able to overcome these problems."
"The debate cannot be reduced to a clash between Member State protectionism and Brussels centralism, useful though it undoubtedly is to guard against excessive centralism."
"This is characterised by a top-down approach to programming and, in particular, by reduced participation by the partner countries and by civil society in defining strategies and priorities."
"The fact remains that centralised coordination between Member States and the Commission would offer undoubted advantages and would, in particular, make it possible to avoid the present situation in which a multitude of different actors do the same thing in the same country or region."
"For example, the atlas of donors clearly shows the existence of forgotten crises or of what are known as orphan countries, together with post-tsunami-type situations in which the beneficiary countries are incapable of absorbing a huge quantity of aid provided on a one-off basis."
"Although coordination has been talked about for years, huge challenges remain when it comes to harmonising procedures and doing a better job of coordinating the EU’s various cooperation programmes."
"What is more, not only do the various Community policies themselves need to be internally coherent, but there also needs to be a coherent approach to policy-making in the various geographical areas in which our development policy applies."
"This precise point appears on the agenda of the Finnish Presidency, which has decided to devote a large part of its work to the matter."
"If, therefore, we thought it wiser to confine ourselves in our report to emphasising the importance of this aspect while waiting to see what the near future holds for us, I should like to take this opportunity to raise this issue which I think is vital and ultimately has bearing on the very basis of any cooperative initiative or even, indeed, of any political project."
"As we know - because it is regularly talked about - boats continue, every day and even as we talk, to reach the Spanish coasts – which is to say our own coasts - with hundreds of people on board attempting to flee a fate that they have decided to reject at peril of their lives."
"This situation obviously raises issues about border controls, the management of migratory flows and policy on integrating immigrant populations."
"In addition, it strikingly raises the issue of how effective our cooperation policy is, as well as the issue of how well that policy ties in with our other policies."
"I do not wish to descend into caricature, but what kind of cooperation is it – and one lasting more than 40 years – at the end of which the populations that we were claiming to help have only one aspiration: to flee the conditions under which they live at any price?"
"Let us not mince our words."
"To me, this situation sounds like failure."
"What, indeed, can the countries of the South make of a cooperation policy through which a sum of EUR 50 billion per year is granted when it is combined with a policy requiring them to honour a debt whose annual reimbursement represents four times that sum?"
"How can we continue to state in every possible way our determination to facilitate the development of the countries of the South while, at the same time, we continue to foist on them the free-trade rules that they are incapable of obeying under the conditions we impose on them?"
"How can we agree to combating poverty when, at the same time, nothing is done to fight against the structural causes of that poverty?"
"The truth is that, however effective it might be, development cooperation policy will never by itself succeed in responding to the many challenges posed in the countries of the South."
"It is with precisely that thought in mind that there is a need to improve development cooperation, as such cooperation will be more effective in proportion to the degree to which it succeeds in making Europe aware of the need to conduct an overall policy focused entirely on the pursuit of a common priority objective: the emergence of a fairer world characterised by greater solidarity."
"."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of my colleague, Mr Michel, who is unable to be here this morning."
"I wish to begin by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Hutchinson, and the Committee on Development for a constructive report on aid effectiveness, a topic of key importance for the EU development policy."
"Improving both the quantity and the quality of our aid is certainly one of the core commitments set out in the European Consensus for Development, the latter having been endorsed by all Member States, the Commission and Parliament in 2005."
"The Consensus is a crucial document for all of us."
"First, it opens a new dimension for joint work between the 25 Member States and the Commission."
"Secondly, it highlights, for the first time in EU history, our collective European vision, principles and objectives that govern our development policy."
"Thirdly, it sets out the comparative advantage of the Commission and the objective of redeploying Member States’ activities in order to achieve better and highly necessary synergy."
"As demonstrated during all the debates on the European Consensus, the Commission should promote the impact of Europe in development and push the European aid effectiveness agenda."
"The European Union must be a leading force in international fora dealing with aid effectiveness, in particular in the OECD/DAC, where the Commission enjoys full statutory membership."
"A strong EU makes for a strong DAC."
"It is with this in mind that Commissioner Michel has proposed a package of concrete deliverables on aid effectiveness, which were endorsed by the Council in spring 2006."
"The Commission’s approach to aid effectiveness is based on lessons learnt from the field, good practices and expectations from the partner countries."
"It is rooted in the principles of harmonisation, ownership, alignment and management by results, as in the Paris Declaration."
"Parliament has made it clear in previous resolutions and again in this report that it supports the Commission in its efforts to strengthen the coordination and coherence of both Commission and EU actions in the development field."
"The report highlights three important areas in which progress needs to be achieved in 2007 and I would like to comment on them briefly."
"First, strengthening complementarity and the division of labour: these issues are crucial for the Commission."
"The EU Donor Atlas has indeed underlined the gaps and duplications in donor activities which hamper the impact of aid."
"In order to address these weaknesses, the Commission launched a process with Member States aimed at adopting operational principles for a better division of labour between EU donors."
"Discussions are currently ongoing and this initiative should be rendered operational with Council conclusions in 2007."
"Second, the joint programming of aid: the EU now has at its disposal a joint framework adopted last spring."
"This framework foresees the drawing-up of common diagnostics and analysis in partner countries, in close partnership with Member States involved, to establish common operational solutions."
"Partner countries and civil society play a major and active role in this process."
"Far from being excluded from these discussions, civil society is strongly involved in the country diagnostic set up in order to ensure its full ownership."
"This approach is fully in line with the approach used in EC programming."
"Thirdly, a few words on an essential tool for improving the division of labour and coordination, that is, cofinancing."
"In 2007, the Commission will bring forward specific proposals on how to strengthen the use of cofinancing as a tool to support the division of labour amongst donors, as well as to assist those Member States building their development capacities."
"Parliament has been persistent in its well-founded requests to the Commission to ensure coordination among Member States in order to strengthen the effectiveness of financing for development."
"As you can see, the Commission has clearly adopted a proactive attitude and will, in close collaboration with Member States, use all tools at its disposal to make greater aid effectiveness a reality."
"I can only advocate that the European Parliament uses the joint meeting on development with the national parliaments next October as an opportunity to expand support for these initiatives."
"Indeed, it is important for the EU to ensure that its political ambitions match its financial status as the largest global donor."
"In this respect, Parliament has a crucial role to play in helping Member States to accelerate their reforms and make the necessary cultural changes implied by this new joint working dimension."
"Success on this front is of major importance for reaching our development goals, as well as taking the lead on the global development agenda."
"Let us recall that the ultimate objective is to succeed in the fight against poverty."
"It is only by acting together and by making the best possible use of all the means at our disposal that success can be guaranteed."
"Thanks to the European Consensus, we now have all the necessary tools to achieve this goal."
"We must make sure that these commitments remain high on our political agenda and that we do not miss this real opportunity to turn our ambitious political commitments into reality."
"It goes beyond politics; it is a matter of collective credibility."
". – Mr President, our thanks must go, in the first place, to Mr Hutchinson for this important report."
"If development aid is to be effective, that presupposes that the EU’s approaches to aid and trade will be mutually coherent."
"If we want to achieve the Millennium Goals in 2015, aid and trade must – as they indeed can – complement one another, but the lamentable reality is that they often do not."
"Aid and trade policies – including agriculture – still, all too often operate in isolation from one another, and that is surely one reason why it will take another century for us to make poverty in Africa a thing of the past."
"At the moment, little is being said about the coherence of Europe’s policies."
"Commissioner Mandelson’s negotiators preach free trade subject to global rules, while the people under Commissioner Michel work for development and try to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and policy on agricultural subsidies runs counter to what either camp is aiming for."
"I regard the various policy fields as comparable to ‘ships that pass in the night’."
"In this situation, alas, it is all too often the development aspect that gets squeezed out; for example, trade considerations loom far too large in economic policy agreements, the renowned – or sometimes, perhaps, notorious – Peas."
"When it comes to development, those who seek aid are all too often pointed towards existing funds, and there is far too little evidence of a truly integrated approach, which really would involve extra money and new development plans being put on the table, despite the fact that it is the EPAs, taking as they do enhanced local cooperation as their starting point, that could help to make aid more effective."
"In this respect, we have to take it as read that, in the development field, precautions have to be taken to protect the weaker negotiating parties, so that honest agreements and a realistic timeframe can emerge from the EPAs."
"If trade is to really ‘take off’, then such things as, for example, the reform of the taxation system with the replacement of duties paid when crossing borders, stronger public and social service institutions, better education and health care, are indispensable."
"The current lack of coordination and coherence is not merely inefficient but also unacceptable on the grounds that it goes against Article 178 of the Treaty."
"One of the reasons for this is that the knowledge and expertise of the trade experts, or, conversely of the developers, often impinge on each other’s area of work, and another is the lack of willingness to tot up the real costs and benefits of integrated development and, together – which means in the Council, too – to seek new funding for it."
"Moreover, it is often the case that European policies – in such areas as agriculture, trade and development, among others – have the effect of working against each other, export subsidies enable agriculture to dump its products in North Africa, with a consequent increase in unemployment there."
"Those in charge of immigration complain about the flow of economic refugees from the region and do little by way of providing aid, preferring instead to work on sound agreements on the regional labour market."
"The only thing that could make a substantial improvement to the situation would be a coherent European agenda from the Commission and the Council."
"Global trade is important and of great benefit in enabling developing countries to escape from the vicious cycle of poverty; much is to be gained by a good combination of aid and trade, and the process of combining the two must not be allowed to stand in the way of these countries’ development; it is in this way that we will be able to achieve the Millennium Goals."
"What I am calling for is a coherent European agenda; the new development cooperation instrument can provide it with a framework."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like firstly to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hutchinson, on the quality of his work on this important subject that is so crucial to our future."
"I congratulate him."
"2005 was full of decisive events relating to the issue of development aid."
"If matters are now really getting under way, let us translate our words into deeds."
"On this basis, we can only welcome the efforts made by the European Union and by a number of Member States substantially to increase development aid."
"Although, however, it is obvious that financial resources are indispensable to effective aid, that cannot be enough."
"Thus, development practices must be stringently monitored if the implementation of these policies is fully to be measured."
"Development aid must be as ambitious in terms of quality as it is in terms of funding if there is to be an appreciable reduction in poverty."
"With this in mind, I would emphasise the importance of putting innovative funding mechanisms in place, enabling stable and predictable resources to be made available."
"In view of this, I welcome the creation of Unitaid at the last United Nations summit."
"This will enable developing countries to access medicines more easily."
"At a time when this mechanism is still in its early days, let us now hope and pray that it will show how effective it is and secure the commitment of countries in addition to those that, on the model of France, are already involved."
"The European Union must play the role of conductor with a view to bringing about a better distribution of the tasks under the heading of development aid."
"Such coordination must take place both at European Union level and on the ground, with the beneficiary nations also being involved."
"The package of measures designed to bring about effective aid constitutes a first stage."
"The European Union and its Member States have the same ambitions in terms of development."
"Let us, therefore, together take up the challenge of bringing about effective and transparent aid while remaining faithful to our commitments."
"."
"Mr President, the day before yesterday, when we met with the President of Liberia and we tried briefly to describe to her the main efforts that the European Parliament is making in the field of development cooperation, we emphasised that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament had a double commitment: to free up more resources for this task – which we see as a priority amongst the European Union’s responsibilities – and to achieve maximum efficiency in the use of the available resources with a view to achieving tangible results when it comes to meeting an increasingly serious and inescapable challenge."
"In this regard, the report prepared by my friend and colleague Mr Hutchinson is a document of very great significance, in terms of its rigour and profundity and given the time at which it is being produced: a time when public opinion in the European Union is becoming aware of the fact that, both on the basis of the principle of solidarity, and given the exodus of emigrants fleeing from under-development towards our countries, Europe has no alternative but to apply all of its efforts to the development and stabilisation of the countries of the South."
"The Hutchinson report and his extremely laudable motion for a resolution, which we shall surely approve by an overwhelming majority, are not just one more document amongst the many we debate in our Parliament."
"Since I entirely agree with its proposals, I shall not reiterate its content now."
"I will say that it is of particular relevance on a day such as today, when it appears that just a few hours ago we reached a good conclusion in the negotiation on the new legal instrument for the funding of our development cooperation."
"I will also say that the report is a piece of true doctrine and that it contains very many ideas and proposals that the Council and above all the Commission will have to take into account in order to increase the effectiveness of our work in the field of cooperation."
"We in the European Parliament, in our Committee on Development and, of course, in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament must commit ourselves to ensuring that Mr Hutchinson’s proposals do not remain a mere statement of good intentions and that they do not come to nothing."
"We must work to ensure that they are a kind of guide for our actions, that the efficiency we achieve in this field contributes to obtaining more and better objective results, which furthermore justify allocating more significant and generous budgets in a field that is no longer a secondary or peripheral matter or a mere means of easing our consciences, and that this area is transformed into a truly major priority within the European Union’s policies."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, before all else, to thank Mr Hutchinson for his outstanding report, which my group will endorse unreservedly."
"As long ago as the year 2000, the UN General Assembly set itself the task, one that Members belonging to every grouping in this House have taken very seriously over recent years, of making success measurable, setting goals and showing where progress has been achieved."
"For us, too, the Millennium Development Goals are the yardstick whereby we assess the effectiveness of what we do on the development policy front."
"We found the United Nations’ interim report alarming, in that it showed that the targets set had not been achieved, and, while that sort of failure gives well-paid Europeans a guilty conscience, to millions of people living in poverty it means death, and for millions of young women a whole life without education."
"That should be a good enough reason for the Commission to review the effectiveness of its aid provision, and certainly gives us enough justification for looking further into its self-analysis, so let me again congratulate Mr Hutchinson on the good work he has done in spelling out very clearly to the Commission what it should be doing."
"Having said that, though, let me take this opportunity to consider the role of this House, for we too, to some degree, share responsibility for this failure."
"It is evident that we have, for years on end, been agreeing to budgets that did not do what they were meant to do, but were we in any kind of position to reach better decisions?"
"Do we possess sufficient information to perform our monitoring role?"
"I doubt it."
"To date, the Commission has produced no convincing evidence of having managed projects in such a way as to achieve the eight Millennium Development Goals, and the budget data on the basis of which we have been required to take decisions are superficial."
"In 2005, we called on the European Investment Bank to carry out a benchmarking exercise in respect of its lending, that is to say, to evaluate every loan in terms of its contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"The funds over which we have control cannot at present be benchmarked in this way, and, since there is no institution that could take over from us the overall monitoring of what is done with the money, we should also demand that we, as Europe’s Parliament, be given permanent input right along the line of development cooperation, in other words, to have a say in the programming of the European Development Fund."
"Proposals need to be made at both the national and regional level, containing definite targets and milestones for the progressive achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and we will, in future, want to see from the Commission country-by-country and region-by-region reports, divided up by sector and project, along with reports listing the project promoters and the firms of consultants involved and detailing the funds that have been remitted to them."
"The 65 important proposals contained in the Hutchinson report make clear the fact that this House does indeed possess competence that should be drawn on in future, but I believe there is a second pillar of competence, alongside the governments of the objective regions, in the form of the institutions that operate in those regions, which need to be far more involved."
"According to one approach, individual donors in a particular region should take on leadership roles in specific sectors; not only does this come in for praise in the report, but we too could consider the possibility of making use of the financial clout that the European Union wields – greater than that of the United Nations – in taking over the leadership in respect of one of the eight Millennium Development Goals, and the one I would propose is water."
"The European Union could commit itself to ensuring, jointly with local partners, the supply of drinking water to the continent of Africa and the disposal of its waste water."
"That would do us more credit than the latest scandal involving the poisoning of drinking water by European companies, and so we should call on the Commission to produce a timetable stating by which dates it should be possible to provide all the major cities south of the Sahara with sustainable systems for the supply of drinking water and the drainage of waste water, and should insist on regular interim progress reports relating to the performance of this task."
"I want the Commission to tell us whether or not it possesses the structures that might make a master plan for such a task possible in the first place, and whether it agrees that the international community needs that sort of specialised centre."
"Better ways must be found of bringing together those who work in the field with policy-makers and donors, and what I would suggest is that the Commission should organise, every other year, an international conference on African development with the specific objective of making policymakers and donors aware of what is needed and of what has been learned in practice."
"One possibility is that there could be an exhibition detailing successful and unsuccessful projects, with the former being honoured."
"This would also be an opportunity to recruit new specialised workers in the field of development cooperation, particularly from among young people."
"Mr President, whenever people are asked to identify the dominant global superpower, they all name the United States."
"It is, however, the European Union which provides over half of the public aid in the world and is the biggest donor in the world."
"Unfortunately, this achievement does not translate into European leadership in the international arena."
"We say ‘Union’ but we think in terms of ‘Member States’, as the European Council’s decisions from December 2005 in Brussels clearly state that 80% to 90% of new aid to developing countries must come from the Member States."
"We should ask ourselves whether, in the future, we will be prepared to view debt reduction for specific countries, most recently Iraq and Nigeria, as a form of development aid."
"It is an easy solution for the Union but, in effect, it reduces the actual amount of aid provided to developing countries."
"Nonetheless, leaving debt cancellation aside, there was a five billion increase in the actual aid provided to poor countries last year."
"Some refer to this sum as ‘only five billion’, and others say ‘as much as five billion’."
"In conclusion, speaking as a representative of a new Member State of the European Union, the new and poorer countries of the Union find themselves in a completely unfamiliar situation."
"We are part of the European Community and wish to accept the obligations involved."
"Our countries need to understand that there are those in the world who are even poorer than us."
"– Mr President, I, too, should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very good report."
"In its 65 points, he addresses the many areas and factors that will be necessary to provide more and better aid."
"He discusses the innovative sources of financing for development and the need for an approach involving debt relief, in order to give the developing countries greater room for manoeuvre in the fight against poverty, and, of course, he also stresses that there needs to be consistency between the various policy areas."
"Our aid will only be effective if there is greater consistency between the policy areas."
"It is clear that efficiency must not undermine the necessary accountability."
"Precisely at a time when ever greater resources are being devoted to development cooperation as direct budget aid, sufficient resources are needed to build an independent and critical civil society."
"If the donor countries want to make their aid more effective, they are in many domains dependent on non-governmental organisations in order to ensure that the aid provided is actually used to reduce poverty, and that it does in fact reach the poor and disadvantaged in the partner countries."
"The Member States must keep to the commitments they have made regarding the funding of development aid, in other words 0.56% of their gross domestic product in 2010 and 0.7% in 2015."
"In this connection, it is important to note that debt relief should not be included in these calculations."
"According to the most recent figures from the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, in 2005 the European Union identified debt relief for Iraq and Nigeria, in particular, as development aid, despite the fact that the Monterrey Consensus explicitly states that financial resources provided for debt relief should not come from development aid funds that are normally intended to be directly available for developing countries."
"The European Parliament therefore calls on the Member States to draw up an accurate list each year, clearly showing the contributions provided directly for development aid."
"As the rapporteur said, aid from the European Union and the Member States must be coordinated in a complementary way and be consistent."
"Many of the partner countries are overwhelmed by the number of donors: parallel projects often result in an unnecessary duplication of structures and sometimes even hinder progress."
"It will only be possible to solve this problem by means of better coordination between the development cooperation of the Community and that of the Member States."
"The report proposes a working group in which representatives of civil society should be involved."
"Specific case studies should be used to show what is already working and where a great deal of work still needs to be done."
"I welcome the rapporteur and support the main point of the presentation."
"The European Union is able to become, and in fact must become, a leader, not only in terms of the scope but also in terms of the effectiveness of aid."
"We can continue to express our regret that the amount of aid to third countries is insufficient, but first we need to be sure that whatever aid is at hand is used effectively."
"We need to better coordinate the provision of aid, abandon the redundant formalities and strengthen control in order to be able to respond to the ever-changing situation."
"The role of the European Commission should only intensify in this respect, in particular when coordinating the provision of aid."
"This is quite significant for the new Member States, since their contribution to aiding developing countries is gradually increasing."
"In this sense Lithuania is already changing its status within the World Bank by its transformation from a beneficiary country to a donor country, a situation which will largely facilitate my country’s involvement in the Bank‘s development programmes."
"A factor of crucial importance is public support, as to date it has not been as substantial as it should be."
"We need to promote the perception among new Member States that by aiding developing countries we also help ourselves."
"In these times of globalisation, the world reminds us that poverty and hunger, unrest and natural disasters in Africa or Asia also impact stability and standards of living in Europe or America."
"However, beneficiary countries also need to demonstrate their capacity to properly manage the funds entrusted to them."
"Maximum attention to the issue should come from the Members of Parliament, and from both the EU and from beneficiary States."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 12 noon."
"Mr President, the explanatory statement in Mr Hutchinson’s report begins with the dramatic assertion that, throughout the world, 11 children die every minute as a result of hunger and poverty."
"It is indeed hard to find a better reason for tackling the issue of the effectiveness of European Union development aid."
"One cannot but agree with the statement that it only makes sense to increase development aid funding if there is a significant improvement in the effectiveness of this aid."
"I am convinced that the citizens of Europe will support an increase in funding for development aid."
"They will not, however, tolerate waste, inefficiency, a lack of transparency and sham activities, hence the importance of improving efficiency."
"It is crucial that only actual aid should be classed as such."
"I therefore support the view that reducing poor countries’ debt should be kept separate from expenditure on development aid."
"Indeed, the HIPC initiative has not provided a permanent solution to the problem of the indebtedness of poor countries."
"On the other hand, it is essential for the greatest possible amount of financial aid available to be sent directly to the beneficiaries."
"It is important not to create the impression that a large proportion of these funds is used to pay middle men such as civil servants and advisers."
"The provision on achieving deeper, decentralised cooperation and working directly with local authorities in developing countries should therefore be recognised as being worthy of support."
"Mr President, I would like to put a point of order."
"Lívia Járóka, a Member of this House who has been nominated for the ‘MEP of the year’ award for her determined campaign for Roma rights, has been the subject of racist and misogynistic emails of the sort that I regard as completely out of place in this House."
"This is intolerable, and I would like the House to take note of it."
"I believe that the applause is indicative of our fellow Members’ approval of what you have said."
"– Mr President, I am in complete agreement with what Mrs Bozkurt said."
"I find it quite indecent that a Bulgarian observer is attempting to trample all over Mrs Járóka's dignity: that is precisely what his -mail does."
"I expect the presidency to take firm action in this matter."
"He does not belong in this House."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I wish to protest at the address made by Prime Minister Siniora of Lebanon to the Conference of Presidents yesterday."
"He made a totally biased, one-sided address and there was no catch-the-eye opportunity to reply to what he said."
"It was all stitched up by the political groups – fair enough, perhaps."
"But I would ask the Conference of Presidents, in the interests of fair and balanced reporting, to issue an invitation to the Prime Minister or Foreign Minister of Israel, so that we can hear the other side of the story."
"All that will be passed on to the competent bodies."
"The next item is voting time."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to insert after the word ‘tandem’ the following text: ‘with trade negotiations; notes that consideration of items on the positive and negative lists is currently before the SAFTA Council’, and then we proceed with the text as is."
"Are there any objections to the inclusion of this amendment?"
"That concludes voting time."
". My British Conservative colleagues and I have supported this report, but we fundamentally disagree with paragraph 58 of this report, which calls on Member States to work towards 'a single voting constituency', i.e. one seat representing the EU at the International Monetary Fund."
"However, as this paragraph is merely a 'recollection' of a previously held position we are able to support the report."
"It is well known that the June List opposes aid being placed under the auspices of the EU."
"There are a number of reasons for this. Aid policy, like foreign policy, is a national matter and, as such, ought not to be delegated to Brussels."
"We are opposed to most of the report, including the calls for increased budgets."
"The rapporteur also involves himself in other strictly national matters, such as the monitoring and supervision of bilateral aid."
"There is also a proposal for the Commission to carry out strategic planning of aid given by the Member States. That is completely unacceptable."
". I congratulate our rapporteur on this report, which has a number of excellent initiatives to better target aid."
"The EU has a great story to tell on international development, often considerably more impressive than most Member States."
"However, we could do better, much better, and this report has a number of good ideas which I am happy to support."
"It is the June List’s fundamental view that matters relating to fishing should be handled within the framework of existing international organisations."
"This means that the EU should not operate a common fisheries policy or prescribe fishing quotas."
"Sustainable fishing is a precondition for the continued existence of the fishing industry."
"Experience shows that the EU does not prioritise sustainable fishing."
"As an example, the fishing quotas prescribed for cod in the Baltic Sea have been subject to extensive criticism by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, amongst others."
"I welcome this detailed report on the possibilities and challenges which face the EU and India in seeking closer bilateral trade relations."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur’s call to stress the strategic importance of trade relations with India, given its impressive economic development and its status as a leader of the G20 at the World Trade Organisation."
"As the country prospers internationally, the gap between the rich and the poor within its borders is widening and I therefore support this report’s emphasis on tackling trade and development issues together."
"India has a responsibility to its citizens to enforce core labour standards and meet environmental standards."
"At the same time, the EU as a global leader and a principle trading partner of India must work with the Indian authorities to ensure that the Generalised System of Preferences can continue to support Indian industry and that a delicate balance can be found between the need to enforce international rules on intellectual property and making sure that traditional knowledge and access to medicines for poverty-related diseases can be maintained."
". Whilst voting for the report, the EPLP wishes to record that it welcomes the role of the North Sea Regional Advisory Council as a provider of advice and an important element in consultation under the CFP."
"The EPLP also regrets that the report did not more closely acknowledge the link between actions taken in managing plaice and sole stocks in the North Sea and the scope of the cod recovery plan."
"North Sea cod stock recovery levels are poor and it is vital that all aspects of fisheries that impact upon it remain under the scope of the cod recovery plan."
"The Commission is seeking to amend Regulation EEC No 2092/91, currently in force, which lays down rules on the import of organic products, with a view to tightening up the procedure for the recognition of imported organic products. It falls short, however, of what is required."
"Hence the series of amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development with the aim of protecting both consumers and producers at national level."
"Consequently, emphasis has been placed on the need to control products imported from third countries, in order to ensure that the product has been obtained in accordance with production standards equivalent to those applied to organic production in the Community, and that this is reciprocated."
"It would not be fair for EU farmers and consumers if third country produce did not have to undergo the same checks as those faced by EU farmers."
"The competent national authorities, moreover, must at least be involved in the process of recognising third-country control bodies."
"The fight against fraud will only be effective if there is control and recognition on the part of the national authorities of the importing countries."
"The June List understands that there is a need to set identical requirements for organic products from third countries, as for those produced within the EU."
"However, the monitoring systems for this must not generate unduly high costs, and account needs to be taken of the subsidies received by EU producers in order to produce their organic products."
"We are sceptical about the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s proposal for an amendment, advancing the idea of stricter requirements applying to organic products from third countries and wonder whether there are hidden protectionist motives behind the committee’s amendment to the proposal for a regulation."
"We are not, therefore, prepared to support the committee and have thus voted against its amendment and motion for a resolution."
"– Seventy per cent of organic products imported are imported under 'import licences'."
"Controls are carried out on the basis of documents and not by on-site sampling."
"This procedure is considered fair."
"It is therefore essential to ensure that organic products put onto the market with the EU-wide organic label should be produced, without exception, in accordance with the principles and conditions set out in Regulation (ΕEC) No 2092/91."
"This being so, the amendments proposed by the rapporteur improve the conditions and controls of imports of organic products into the ΕU from third countries, so that imports will be more or less the same as domestic products, because the Community regulation setting out the conditions of production of organic products in the countries of the ΕU is much stricter than the Codex Alimentarius."
"We also agree with the proposed regulation on the production, labelling and importation of organic products."
"However, we disagree on the point which states that certification may be done by accredited agencies in return for reasonable certification fees."
"We believe that the public interest cannot be effectively protected by private agencies, even if they are accredited by the corresponding government agencies and spot checked by them."
"The public interest is effectively protected by government agencies which provide free certification to organic farmers, constituting a free service and development incentive for organic farming."
". I am delighted to congratulate my group colleague on this report."
"Organic food is a growth market in Scotland but confidence in the standards applied in the sector is of paramount importance if we are to see the sector develop."
"This report goes in the right direction, but we as the EU need to go further and officially underline support for organic farming and ways to protect it and promote it."
". When it is used for non-military purposes and is not forming part of the trend towards oppressive security, the Galileo programme – the European satellite and radio navigation programme – is an important instrument aimed at delivering a public service."
"Accordingly, it should be a great opportunity for cooperation, scientific and technical progress, and for the exchange of, and access to, information, without affecting the citizens’ rights, guarantees and freedoms."
"Galileo could help put an end to dependence on the US-controlled GPS system, which is administered by the US military. The latter in fact blocks access and use when they carry out their military attacks on peoples and countries."
"We therefore regret that the majority in Parliament voted against the amendments tabled by our group, which were aimed at condemning the use of Galileo for military purposes and which emphasised that the programme should enable equal access for all users. Furthermore, the public should have access to the information available free of charge."
". Galileo is the ideal Community project for meeting the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The European satellite and radio navigation programme is a fresh technological challenge that is set to bring more growth for the European economy and business opportunities."
"It is therefore up to us to ensure that it is not just another mere project."
"This first European infrastructure, which is to be managed by the Community, is a crucial factor in achieving the Lisbon Strategy."
"Given that Europe is full of SMEs, this is a time of great opportunity."
"The Community’s institutions must therefore guarantee their good governance, must ensure transparent, effective rules for public-private partnerships and must make sure that we derive the maximum benefit from this project."
"Consequently, we must take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the project and this can only be done if we realise that this is the right way forward."
"– Mr President, I voted against this joint motion for a resolution on the grounds that it is an example of politically correct discourse about immigration, political correctness being a dogma that holds sway in this institution and questioning of which is as prohibited as was that of religious dogma in the Middle Ages."
"At a time when our Mediterranean borders – one thinks of Lampedusa and the Canary Islands – cannot hold back the floods of economic migrants, Europe is still unwilling to admit that we cannot – and it was a Socialist Prime Minister who put this so aptly – bear the misery of all the world on our shoulders."
"Although we in Europe are willing to accept those immigrants who are prepared to assimilate, we have to tell those who are not that they must go back to their countries of origin."
"We must also call an absolute halt to immigration, while at the same time putting in place an ambitious development policy aimed at reducing the pressure on people to leave the developing world, and making it clear that there is no room in Europe for Islamic fundamentalism."
"Last Sunday, in a referendum, the people of Switzerland overwhelmingly opted to retain their own identity."
"The Swiss are a free and independent people, and Europe would do better to follow their example than to bow the knee to the intellectual terrorism of the immigration lobby."
"The Swedish Conservative delegation has chosen to vote against the resolution by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats as we are stout opponents of the minimum common list of safe countries of origin as referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 9."
"We also believe that this version of the resolution places too little emphasis on the fact that any measures to combat illegal immigration must be compatible with the safeguards and the fundamental rights of the individual laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"We do not entirely oppose paragraph 4 (on an obligation to inform other parties when applying more liberal rules), but we are sceptical towards it, as it could be a first step towards total supranationalisation of the asylum and immigration sphere."
". The Tampere Council set out an ambitious political programme for Europe, namely to build a common European area in which issues of freedom, security and justice would be addressed on a perfectly level playing field."
"The balance that was sought at the time, however, remains too fragile today."
"What we are seeing is a trend towards placing security concerns ahead of human rights. The fight against terrorism and against illegal immigration have clearly dominated the Justice and Home Affairs agenda."
"The new Hague Programme of 2004 lacks a vision for the future."
"The issue of immigration is crying out for Community decision-making – that is to say, the legitimacy that comes from Parliament’s intervention in the codecision process – and needs a binding Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Immigration policy must be a Union policy based on humanitarian concerns, prevention and cooperation with countries of origin."
"What is needed is commitment and solidarity between the Member States, based on shared responsibilities. Otherwise the policy will not be a fair one."
". I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the EU common immigration policy (RC-B6-0508/2006), given the need for the Union to adopt a proper common immigration policy and to remove all obstacles to the kind of European asylum system in which shared rules on protecting the fundamental rights of immigrants and asylum seekers in the EU could be defined."
"The EU must take a cross-cutting approach that opens up channels for legal immigration, and encourages the integration of migrants into the host society. This approach must be based on legal integration into the labour market, the right to education and training, access to social services and healthcare and the effective involvement of immigrants in the social, cultural and political life of the host country."
"It is also vital to support the development of countries of origin in order to address the underlying causes of migration."
"In the opinion of the June List, the EU’s common immigration policy is one of the primary causes of the tragic situation to which many migrants expose themselves when, in the hope of a better life, they embark on what can quite properly be called a life-threatening journey to the EU."
"It is absolutely right for it to be pointed out in this resolution that the Dublin II Regulation has been, and continues to be, a failure."
"The Regulation has meant that countries in the southern and eastern parts of the EU, primarily, have been given the ability to decide the fate of migrants without taking any account of the immigration policies and needs of the other Member States."
"It is highly peculiar, as well as unacceptable, that the EU should have been experimenting with a common migration policy for a decade."
"All these political experiments have undermined the Member States’ right of self-determination in relation to migration whilst at the same time causing great suffering amongst migrants."
"The solution to the situation we face today is not to give the EU even more powers in the area of immigration so that it can continue its failed immigration policy, but to give back to the Member States their right of self-determination."
"The resolution contains some points that we welcome. For example, it acknowledges the unfolding tragedy and points out the need to open up channels of legal migration, along with the need for effective integration and for development plans in the countries of ‘origin’."
"We feel, however, that it fails to condemn the EU’s repressive, securitarian policy, which criminalises illegal immigration, whereby measures are taken to seal off borders, to set up detention centres and to expel immigrants."
"We are also opposed to the creation of a common immigration policy, as this is not the right response to the questions and problems at hand, as evidenced by the results of other common policies."
"The reality of migration varies across EU Member States and any decision on this policy should take account of the sovereignty of each individual country, although this of course does not stop countries from cooperating on this issue."
"Rather than a common policy, what is needed is a different policy and other measures that effectively protect the rights of immigrants – such as the ratification of, and compliance with, the UN Convention on the ‘Protection of all migrant workers and their families’ – and that address the underlying causes of immigration."
". Although this motion is on the topic of a common approach to immigration in Europe, it can be supported because of its strong reaffirmation of the competences and responsibilities of individual Member States and because it underlines the need for cooperation not harmonisation."
". Every day, the number of dugouts and makeshift boats from Senegal, Mali, Mauritania or The Gambia beaching on the coasts of the Canary Islands is that little bit greater."
"A total of some 300 000 Africans appear secretly to enter the EU each year."
"European leaders are necessarily having to wake up to the extent of this phenomenon and are beginning to get worried about the disastrous consequences – which they do not, for all that, condemn - of the iniquitous Schengen agreements and of the way in which the mass regularisation in Spain and Italy of the status of undocumented immigrants (more than 1 150 000 foreigners have had their status regularised by Spain since 1985) has acted as an extraordinary incentive to other potential immigrants."
"For the moment, the European Union is confining itself to lecturing Spain for having been, in its view, unduly ‘lax’ in regularising the status of immigrants."
"There is obviously no question of changing the laws on immigration and the right of asylum on the model of Switzerland, where 68% of those who went to the polls have just voted in favour of a new law on immigration and more stringent conditions of access to the right of asylum, so equipping themselves with one of the most restrictive sets of laws in Europe."
"The time of submission and passivity must come to an end."
"The way, now, to stem this tide of immigration is to re-establish the borders, introduce zero immigration and put a stop to naturalisations."
"It would seem that European leaders are concerned about illegal immigration."
"About time too!"
"True, it is only since 1995 and the disastrous Schengen agreements that the Front National has unceasingly exposed, and warned against, the inevitable harm caused by the abolition of the EU’s internal border controls."
"It was not until Spain had seen a record number of more than 25 000 African immigrants land in the Canary Islands since January and not until Italian coastguards had, over a period of nine months, taken more than 12 000 immigrants to refugee camps on the small island of Lampedusa to the south of Sicily that all the European governments and Europe’s municipal worthies began to worry about the irresistible and exponentially increasing upsurge in migration."
"Europe is openly revealed as being powerless to manage its land and maritime borders."
"It is not, moreover, Europe’s token Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders, conspicuously slow and lacking in staff and resources as it is, that will offer an effective response to the flood of immigration."
"Let us re-establish Europe’s internal borders and stop regularising the status of illegal workers in a way that only encourages further immigration."
"Those are the essential preconditions for putting an immediate stop to this tidal wave of immigration."
". – We voted against the two resolutions proposed to us."
"They outlined, with certain nuances, the difficulty in controlling the entry and movement of illegal immigrants, but never mentioned the fact that this difficulty stems precisely from the abolition of national borders."
"The resolutions take up the idea, shared by Mr Sarkozy, of the complete abolition of unanimous voting in the field of justice and home affairs, that is to say the complete abolition of the Member States’ sovereignty on their own soil."
"This is one more example of European integration being used as a solution to the problem it presents."
"Those who, like the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are trying today in this Parliament to contain immigration are in reality creating more problems than they solve."
"We should not have accepted the Schengen Agreement with the abolition of permanent controls at internal borders and we should not have accepted the Treaty of Amsterdam or, rather, the communitisation of the bulk of the policies on asylum, visas and immigration, including the fight against illegal immigration."
"We have opened the floodgates to uncontrolled immigration and, at the same time, deprived the Member States of their powers, only to transfer them to an inevitably paralysed Union."
". Immigration is a sign of economic vitality, and plays a role in bringing in active, resourceful people."
"Illegal immigration, on the other hand, is organised crime, which threatens the lives of applicants and feeds a parallel, inhumane labour market."
"For this reason, the idea of extraordinary legalisation is a case of good intentions and a bad outcome."
"This is a small prize for illegal immigrants and a major triumph for smuggling rings."
"We must accept the key issue of how much the market can take in, if we want immigration with a positive impact."
"This will only be achieved, however, with clear, practical rules that facilitate legal immigration and prevent illegal immigration, which is a Europe-wide problem."
"I should therefore like to take this opportunity to say that the element of protecting the external borders that we share must be taken on board when the armed forces are re-equipped."
"Lastly, I wish to say that I do not believe that the solution lies simply in stepping up implementation of the law."
"The path of fighting unbridled immigration, poverty and the terrorist threat involves exporting wealth, economic prosperity and our model of liberal democracy."
". – The massive influx of illegal migrants into the Canary Islands has reminded the public and the governments of the serious and complex problems presented by illegal immigration."
"I should like to point out to my fellow European Members that this is not a new phenomenon as far as the French overseas departments, and particularly Mayotte, Guyana, Martinique and Guadeloupe are concerned, because they are near to some of the poorest countries on the planet."
"Mayotte is only a few nautical miles from the Comoros, and the Guyanese border is an area of equatorial forest that is difficult to control."
"The outermost regions, which include the Canaries and the French overseas departments, would therefore gain significantly from there being a common immigration policy."
"It is vital, in my view, that the European Parliament emphasise five aspects of this future policy: better targeted development aid; the development of partnerships with the countries of origin; the securing of borders and the fight against human trafficking; the strengthening of the return policy; and the more effective integration of legal migrants into their host countries."
"We need legislation that is clear and that identifies specific and operational priorities."
"The European Union can no longer make do with declarations of intent."
". The situation in Darfur deteriorates before our eyes, and it is heartbreaking how powerless we are in the face of such aggression."
"I have followed closely the negotiation of this resolution, and do support it, albeit I would like to see us do more."
"The June List is strongly in favour of the realisation of the internal market."
"In order to bring this about, the EU has to have a common trade policy towards other states."
"Nevertheless, it is not the job of the EU to raise objections to India’s domestic political affairs."
"The rapporteur finds fault, , with the Indian bureaucracy, with the structure of the public sector and with the regional policy of the Indian central government."
"The June List champions the cause of national self-determination and sovereignty, irrespective of whether the state in question is in the EU or anywhere else in the world."
"We have therefore voted against this report."
"Furthermore, we also do not rule out the idea of India having views on the EU’s trade and agriculture policies."
". This important report on the EU’s relations with India covers a great many points, some of which we do not accept."
"Although there are some concerns expressed in the report that we share, it forms part of a strategy of liberalising world trade within the framework of the WTO or via the proliferation of bilateral or multilateral agreements on free trade, within the framework of competition and ties with the USA, to which we are firmly opposed."
"The report promotes the so-called 'Doha Development Agenda' and the pursuit of negotiations, which are currently deadlocked, on liberalising trade and markets around the world."
"The report, once again, emphasises the need for the EU to urge India and the G20 to ‘realise’ that ‘the European offer on agriculture must be followed by a reasonable offer by the G20 on non-agricultural market access and services’, which is unacceptable."
"Hence our vote against."
". I voted in favour of Mr Karim's report on the EU's economic and trade relations with India."
"As I see it, the very important social aspects have been included, and there is also a focus on the social chasm between rich and poor, and between the south and west and the north and east."
"I should particularly like to emphasise the importance of the International Labour Organization (ILO) for all Indian workers."
"Although the report calls on foreign investors to discharge their political responsibilities, by applying the International Labour Organization's core labour standards, I should like to stress that this should, of course, also apply to Indian employers, in order to create consistent structures within India so that inequalities can be addressed and work quality can be improved."
". The own-initiative report before us has the considerable merit of reminding us of the importance to our future of an appropriate strategy towards relations with India."
"The BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) are a key factor in understanding the current state of play in world trade, although we should not be considering drawing up identical strategies as regards Brazil, Russia, China or India."
"Far from it, in fact."
"Our relations with the BRIC countries should be pursued in such a way that globalisation, economic development and the growth in world trade should be factors in prosperity for all, or at least for the maximum number of people, and this means employing separate strategies."
"Democratic, populous India is different from non-democratic, populous China and our neighbour Russia."
"If we want to be a successful project, one of our priorities should consist, on the one hand, of seeing our future in relation to the development of these countries and, on the other, of drawing up appropriate strategies for relations with each of them."
"India is of major importance, and in geographical, political and economic terms, the country’s situation requires special attention, as we expect it to be an important ally in the future."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the MEPs from the Czech ODS party refused to back the report by Mrs Breyer on perspectives of women in international trade."
"This report is a piece of left-wing, feminist agitation that cannot bring any positive results."
"We are completely opposed to the theory of gender equality and to all of the requirements based on this mistaken approach to human society."
"We look upon people as individual citizens with individual rights and freedoms guaranteed by the State and not as collective groups pre-determined by gender and with collective rights."
"Equality before the law has long been a reality in all countries."
"In the EU Members States all men and women enjoy freedom and make use of it in various ways as they see fit, and an example of this would be the way that women devote more time to looking after children more than men do."
"The requirement for equality between men and women conflicts with the idea of freedom."
"Consequently, we cannot under any circumstances support quotas for women in the boardrooms of public companies, as proposed in the report."
"I also disagree with the rapporteur’s belief that the liberalisation of world trade will bring men and women the world over fresh opportunities for fulfilment and greater wealth."
"We therefore voted against the report."
"We have voted against the report on perspectives of women in international trade."
"Free trade increases wealth and reduces poverty."
"In recent decades, globalisation has led to dramatic improvements in standards of living, not least amongst women and children."
"Free trade creates a larger number of formal employment positions whilst also, in contrast to what is claimed in the report, providing women in informal employment with increased security and a route out of poverty."
"In this report, the focus is on form instead of substance."
"Equality is important, especially in terms of the working world, where a situation in which women receive their own wages contributes considerably to their becoming independent and gaining control over their own lives."
"More globalisation, and not expanded EU institutions, is the correct way to increase the autonomy of women."
". We voted in favour of this resolution because, in spite of some areas to which we had objections, it takes a positive view of the role of women and of the fight against discrimination, namely in the field of international trade."
"We must point out, however, that the report ought to go further in that it failed to criticise the liberalisation of international trade and the detrimental impact that this has on the people of less developed countries, and in particular on women."
"It should also have criticised the efforts of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to block a more progressive view of the fight for women's rights."
"Furthermore, it should have condemned the disgraceful actions of multinationals, which use women's work in one country until they find another country in which they can make bigger profits, turning a blind eye to the impact on women of increased unemployment and worsening living conditions."
". – I refused to take part in the vote on the Breyer report which, taking as its basis the necessary promotion of women in all areas of the economy, has become a hotchpotch of ideas that mixes up the best and, above all, the worst."
"I voted in favour of this report, as it recognises the vital yet often overlooked role of women in supporting economies across the world."
"It finds that inequality continues to exist between women and men both within and outside the European Union in terms of their opportunities to pursue education and work."
"At the same time, the report draws attention to the important fact that so-called 'women’s work', including caring for the family and providing social care, has been traditionally unrecognised and unremunerated."
"The fact is that women already contribute significantly in economic terms in both the public and private spheres."
"Many international trade and development policies have in the past failed to recognise the extent to which women in developing countries engage in income-related activities and control the household budget."
"I therefore welcome and support calls for policies to encourage greater economic participation by women with the aim of further improving their status and boosting their income and assets."
"I also support the report’s recommendation that EU Member States should follow Norway’s example in providing for a 40% quota in female representation on the boards of its joint-stock companies."
". The relationship that exists between gender issues and trade is not only economically important, but also sadly reflects a culture found in various parts of the world, where women are still on the margins of society."
"The report maintains that the growth of trade has made it easier for women to enter the modern industrial economy and to do so more quickly than before."
"Allow me to make an observation: all too often statements of principle do not correspond to reality; in fact, female entrepreneurs continue to encounter huge problems, partly because they often represent small and medium-sized enterprises or distributors and the craft industry, sectors that are being increasingly affected by the globalisation of markets, a process that all too often lacks clear and common rules."
"What is in fact required is not only more economic aid, but also more structural aid, in order to support women in the world of work and enterprise and to take a firm stand against this pseudoculture that sees women’s social and economic rights – as sanctioned by the Beijing Platform for Action – ignored or even labelled obstacles."
"Despite our vote in favour of the report, I must point out that the Union’s political and practical task is to tackle, with courageous proposals, the negative aspects that penalise a broad cross-section of women, especially in the poorest countries, but also in the EU Member States."
".I must congratulate my fellow Member, Mrs Breyer, on her report."
"Indeed, I can only endorse its conclusions, which recommend, and I quote: ‘radically changing the European Union’s trade policies’."
"It has taken a report by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for the rights not just of women, but of all workers, to at last be taken into account in the current globalisation process sought and undergone by Brussels."
"The rapporteur is almost naïve in her apparent discovery that competitive pressure in an increasingly globalised economy leads to a reduction in salaries and operating costs, to unemployment, to relocations and to the closure of businesses."
"The figures are in fact very worrying: 70% of the 1.3 billion people who live in poverty worldwide are women."
"However, I must admit that it is worth stressing here that gender inequality, particularly in Asia and Africa, where women are humiliated, scorned and considered inferior to men, obviously creates difficulties in the economic, commercial, social and political fields."
"Above all, it is quite clear that it is the very status of women that needs to be reviewed immediately in all of those countries in which Islamic law very often prevails."
".Between economic difficulties, the exhaustion of stocks and finicky controls, European fishing is in a bad way."
"Mediterranean fishermen are being hit hard."
"It is high time the European Union learnt its lessons from this finding."
"This report includes several positive guidelines, which represent the fruits both of our joining forces with the fishermen from my region and of the support of my political group."
"Firstly, it calls on the European Commission to review its work and to formulate more specific and more ambitious proposals in order to respond to the seriousness of the crisis hitting the sector."
"Secondly, it supports the professional fishermen’s organisations and their role (co-management) in applying the CFP and in improving the management of the resources."
"Finally, it integrates several of our amendments aimed at safeguarding small-scale fishing in the Mediterranean."
"With this in mind, I shall vote in favour of this report, as it constitutes a strong political signal paving the way for an ambitious EU policy."
"I would, however, have liked the European Parliament to have gone further in terms of demanding a specific programme for Mediterranean fisheries."
"Our amendment on this subject has been rejected."
"We will not stop there."
"We will continue the fight alongside the fishermen from my region."
". With this vote, Parliament has ratified the main proposals adopted unanimously in the Committee on Fisheries, aimed at improving the economic situation in the fisheries sector, and this is something we welcome."
"These proposals from representatives of the fisheries sector have been on the table for a long time and were designed to tackle the current economic and social crisis, which has been exacerbated by the steep rise in fuel costs."
"We welcome the inclusion in the final text, on the basis of our proposal, of the definition of clear priorities for fisheries resources and fishing, with adequate funding from the Seventh Community Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities."
"We also welcome the fact that, in spite of pressure from the main countries known as ‘net contributors’, such as Germany, the call to increase funding for the European Fisheries Fund has been retained; this against a backdrop, noted in the resolution before us, of insufficient resources to fund the instruments of the common fisheries policy."
"It is now up to the Commission to table initiatives aimed at putting those funds in place."
"We regret, however, that the call to set up a public insurance policy for the fisheries sector to deal with unexpected events was removed. This is especially disappointing given that Parliament has called for such a policy for other sectors such as agriculture."
"– The fishing industry is important both to the food chain and to local economic development."
"In remote areas especially, such as the Aegean Islands in Greece, survival depends on fishing, which also helps to maintain local cultural traditions."
"Over recent years there have been numerous problems, in coastal fisheries in particular, partly caused by the COM, vessel scrapping programmes, the reduction in first-sale prices to fishermen, with no concomitant reduction for consumers, and increased costs due to increased fuel prices."
"As a result, the industry is in crisis, incomes are falling drastically and areas are being abandoned."
"The Commission communication identifies the difficulties in the industry, but the solutions it proposes are not viable."
"They not only fail to resolve the problems; they also create more."
"In addition, no provision whatsoever is made for the subsidies needed for the industry, as the rapporteur rightly points out."
"On the contrary, it proposes a reduction of fishing effort and fleet adjustment; in other words, a cessation of activity resulting in unemployment for a large number of small and medium-sized fishing undertakings and the concentration of the fleet among a few large undertakings."
"This policy of the ΕU and the governments is condemnable, because it creates a cartel in several industries, which exploit producers and consumers."
". The VVD delegation has voted to adopt the Guerreiro report on the grounds that our party wants to see the economic position of the fisheries sector improve."
"We are aware that many involved in the fisheries sector have faced economic insecurity over recent years as a consequence of rises in the price of fuel."
"We are also, however, advocates of a sustainable fisheries sector, and so we oppose the renewal and modernisation of the fisheries fleet except in so far as it is done on the basis of sustainability."
"We are also opposed to the payment of compensation on the grounds that this would constitute an artificial subsidy to the fisheries sector."
". I welcome this Commission communication, which recognises the tough economic climate that the EU fishing industry has to contend with."
"It is very well to say that the scrapping of vessels and the removal of extra capacity will lead to increased profitability, whereas in reality many a coastal community has been devastated by such a move."
"This is as true for the coastal community of the Algarve in Portugal, which we visited a few weeks ago, as it is for traditional fishing communities on the island of Ireland."
"I accept that a balance between fish resources and fleet numbers needs to be gained, but I do not accept that this should be at the expense of small fishing fleets, which account for over 80% of the European fleet."
"We need a level playing field for conservation measures taken against small fishing fleets and those taken against deep-sea fishing."
"I believe the CFP has not been successful as a Community instrument in protecting those traditional fishing fleets and the communities to which they belong, and it is time to change the policy to achieve a better balance."
". The report acknowledges the economic difficulties facing the sector."
"However, to maintain a consistent position on the major problems facing the fishing industry – over-capacity and over-fishing – the EPLP wishes to record its disagreement with the position adopted by the report on four issues:"
"1."
"Scrapping and decommissioning – the EPLP believes that this should be an option within strategies to deal with fisheries over-capacity."
"2."
"Proposed increase in aid, payments that can be paid to the fishing industry for measures that would otherwise be deemed to distort competition or increase capacity – the report called for an increase to raise the level to EUR 100 000."
"The Commission suggested EUR 30 000 and the EPLP advocates a more cautious approach."
"3."
"Engine replacement and the European Fisheries Fund – the report has been overtaken by the compromise agreement on the EFF but the EPLP maintains its view that there should not be subsidy for vessels or engine replacement."
"4."
"Subsidy/compensation mechanisms – the report suggests these but does not acknowledge the role this plays in fuelling over-capacity in fishing."
". This report calls on the Commission to match the rules on shark fishing with what is actually happening in the Community, as regards the ratio of fin weight, currently 5%, to dressed weight of catch."
"This limit has been transferred directly from the reality of the USA and is not appropriate for the species fished by EU Member States, for example, the blue shark, which is caught mainly by Portuguese fleets in the waters off the Azores."
"As such, we agree with the rapporteur that this limit should be raised to 6.5%, in accordance with existing scientific studies and with requests from various Member States, whose fleets have been affected by the current deadlock in the Commission."
"This situation was mentioned in the report by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas."
"In the case of Portugal, 11 surface longliners for catching swordfish and pelagic species, to which the 5% ratio applies, are in jeopardy."
"In view of the fact that, even in amendments that have been tabled, there is a degree of contradiction between scientific and technical findings, we feel that a technical forum involving scientists and people working in the sector should be held, with a view to reaching a scientific consensus and to clarifying whether the limit needs to be changed and by how much."
". The EPLP warmly welcomed Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 on the removal of shark fins on vessels as important for fish conservation purposes."
"The regulation is designed to prevent shark finning where shark carcasses are thrown overboard after high-value shark fins have been removed."
"The practice of shark finning is known to endanger the survival of several shark species."
"Against this background the EPLP is appalled and disappointed that the Miguélez Ramos report before us threatens to increase shark finning."
"Paragraph 5 of the report requests an increase of the 5% fin to live weight ratio to 6.5%, particularly for blue sharks."
"Paragraph 5 of the report incorrectly implies that ICES and ICATT support an increase in the fins to live weight ratio for the blue shark."
"A paper was submitted to ICES in 2005, but ICES has not considered this paper or issued an opinion."
"Likewise in ICATT where scientists have reviewed fin to carcass ratios but have not recommended an increase of the fin to carcass ratio."
"The EPLP supported those amendments which would help to get rid of the barbaric practice of shark finning."
"- Amendment 1 which would suspend any change in the fin to carcass ratio pending a review; (…)"
".I voted in favour of the Ransdorf report because it highlights the importance of nanosciences and nanotechnologies in fields as diverse as medicine, surgery, energy, electronics, metallurgy, and so on. However, I voted against the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and against certain paragraphs that, using the precautionary principle as a pretext, are aimed at making people think that nanotechnologies are dangerous, because they manipulate the smallest particles - atoms and molecules."
"That is ridiculous."
"Where the Americans see opportunities, Europeans want first to protect themselves against any risk imaginable!"
". – The emergence of new sciences always brings its share of enthusiasm, hope, questioning and even opposition, and nanotechnologies, as sciences that relate to atom-sized objects, are no exception to the rule."
"As a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am naturally inclined to support the work of researchers on nanosciences and on the control of the assembly of atoms."
"Theirs is revolutionary work that conceals a huge potential of technological applications in areas as diverse as vehicles, foodstuffs, medicines and regenerative medicine."
"We need to strengthen Europe’s position on nanotechnologies in the face of global competition."
"More than EUR 610 million in funds must be released each year from the 7th FPRD."
"It is also vital that we give clear answers to the citizens, who are worried about the possibility of nanoparticles being toxic to the environment, the food chain and the body."
"The public’s support is not given as a matter of course; it is earned and it requires education, patience and transparency."
"That is why the Union and the Member States must avoid making the same mistakes on this issue that they made on the GMO issue, where unclear information and measures led to a large number of Europeans becoming suspicious of, and rejecting, a science that was nonetheless promising."
"The next item is the debate on the Commission statement on the ASEM Summit (Helsinki, 10-11 September 2006)."
"."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, who is unable to be here this afternoon."
"I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity to report on the successful outcome of the Sixth Summit of the Asia-Europe Meeting held in Helsinki on 10 and 11 September."
"The summit was attended by all 39 ASEM partners, including the Commission, 35 of them at Head of State or Government level."
"The very high attendance testifies to the great importance attached by partners to the Asia-Europe relationship as ASEM enters its second decade."
"Foremost among the deliverables of the summit was the decision to admit Bulgaria, Romania, India, Mongolia, Pakistan and the ASEAN Secretariat to ASEM."
"The opening to South-East Asia is an historic development which will significantly reinforce ASEM’s collective weight in promoting multilateralism and advancing shared policy goals in the international arena."
"Under the overarching theme of ‘Global Challenges – Joint Responses’, President Barroso stressed the borderless nature of the challenges and threats facing today’s world and the need for a concerted response."
"Global issues such as terrorism and health threats could only be tackled through the multilateral international system, with the UN at its core."
"To preserve an open and fair multilateral trading system, it was essential to resume the Doha negotiations as soon as circumstances permit."
"However, appropriate economic, education, employment and social policies had to be adopted to improve society’s capacity to adjust and enhance social cohesion while pursuing productivity growth."
"The development of a knowledge society was another essential element in ensuring sustainable growth and global competitiveness."
"The President joined other partners in giving strong support to intercultural and interfaith dialogue."
"Harmony in diversity was possible, and there could only be zero tolerance for intolerance."
"The President shared with others deep concern at the progress of climate change, and called on partners to work together to achieve efficient, clean and sustainable energy use and the reduction of emissions."
"It was significant that the summit was able to adopt an ambitious Declaration on Climate Change, containing a common undertaking to fully implement commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention and its Kyoto Protocol."
"Leaders engaged in really open and frank discussions on major regional developments including the Korean Peninsula, Burma/Myanmar and the Middle East."
"In the presence of the Burma/Myanmar Foreign Minister, Member States expressed deep disappointment at the lack of progress towards democracy in the country since the Hanoi Summit in 2004."
"Looking forward, the summit adopted a Declaration on the Future of ASEM, identifying areas on which ASEM should focus its work to prepare for the next summit in Beijing in 2008 and beyond."
"In addition to the bilateral summits with the Republic of Korea and China, President Barroso had meetings with the President of Indonesia and the Prime Minister of Singapore, and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner met the Foreign Ministers of Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines."
"Much of ASEM’s value lies in its ability to bring into play all relevant stakeholders."
"The President of the Asia-Europe Parliamentary Partnership addressed the leaders at the summit for the first time, and representatives of NGOs, business communities and trade unions also met alongside the summit."
"The Helsinki Summit has given ASEM a fresh vitality as it enters its second decade and, with the enlargement, an even greater capacity to influence the international agenda."
"The Commission will continue to fulfil its role in seeking to realise the forum’s full potential."
"– Mr President, I wish to extend my especial thanks to Commissioner McCreevy for his update on the summit held in Helsinki."
"The emergence of the geostrategic and geoeconomic role of Asia and the dynamic appearance of strong emerging economies are shaping the new international framework within which the European Union is being called up to face up to the serious political, economic, energy and environmental challenges being created by globalisation."
"Today, Asia is giving dynamic presence to and affecting the international system and is helping to shape the new power correlations of the 21st century."
"Nor is it a coincidence – even at a symbolic level – that the new UN Secretary General will come from Asia."
"The need, therefore, for the European Union to effectively develop the new Asian environment is now becoming more urgent."
"The institutionalisation of the annual summits is contributing towards dialogue and multilateral cooperation in crucial sectors for the future of mankind, such as peace, security, energy, the environment and economic and social development."
"From this point of view, the ASEM summit in Helsinki had positive results, because it confirmed certain basic principles of multilateral cooperation and highlighted the basic priorities for meeting the new international challenges."
"However, we must not delude ourselves or cultivate major expectations, because the European Union does not have an integrated common strategy for Asia, with policies and mechanisms that will affect developments."
"The national strategies of the Member States do not add up to a stable basis for the common European strategy."
"In addition, the strong Asian countries – over and above the framework of general pronouncements – have already formulated and are consistently following their national strategic agenda in the fields of energy, trade and the resolution of international and regional problems."
"Furthermore, multilateral cooperation and the rules of conduct are being cited on their terms, for example, in the fields of environmental protection, workers' social rights and women's and children's rights."
"I wish to comment in particular on the fact that the European Union may record a positive statistical balance in its economic and trade relations with the countries of Asia; however, this cannot conceal the unfortunate fact of Asia's shortcomings in the protection of human rights and democratic freedoms and defence of the principles of tolerance and diversity."
"The recent coup in Thailand and the democratic deficit in numerous countries of Asia confirm this."
"In addition, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism is jeopardising stability and security as a whole."
"I have a feeling that at every summit there is a surfeit of wish lists and a lack of clear commitments and objectives being laid down for implementation."
"That is why the European Commission could table some ideas with us for the operational follow-up to the summits and the need – in my opinion – for relations between the European Union and Asia to be institutionalised."
". – Mr President, the importance of political, economic and cultural dialogue between Europe and Asia cannot, of course, be underestimated, and I am still surprised that the two major groups in this House have nevertheless decided not to bring in a resolution following on from the ASEM summit in Helsinki on 10/11 September."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament is in fact making a great deal of sense in what it has just put forward, and it is sad that we have not been able to express it in a resolution."
"This dialogue does of course give priority to economic cooperation, of which I am very much in favour as a means of further strengthening economic ties – in the shape of both trade and investment – between the European Union and Asia, which has enormous economic potential, with South Korea, for example, having achieved impressive results."
"Fifty years ago, it was still a developing country, but now some 97% of its people between the ages of 25 and 34 have completed at least secondary schooling – the highest percentage in the industrialised world."
"Investment in education brings an abundant return in the shape of an expanding and flourishing economy."
"Our economic programmes need to be extended to include the promotion of contacts between, and joint ventures involving, small and medium-sized businesses in the European Union and Asia, as well as cooperation between such bodies as local authorities and universities."
"I also rejoice to see that the Commission is now seeking to give serious consideration to the possibility of concluding bilateral trade agreements with Asian countries, certainly with Singapore, and possibly also with Thailand."
"You might, of course, also consider such countries as Malaysia and Indonesia in the absence of any global trade agreement."
"I see that as a good way of moving forwards."
"If, though, you are going to have dealings with Asia, you cannot, of course, consider the economy in isolation from other matters, and it is, to my mind, unthinkable that this House should keep silent in the face of the recent in Thailand, where, on 19 September, a military body calling itself the ‘Council for Democratic Reform’ overthrew the democratically elected government, one about which we may well have had serious doubts, but, even so, if you want to be rid of that sort of government, a military coup is not the answer."
"We see, then, that Thailand, a country that really was on the way to being a stable democracy of the kind that would be an example to the world and certainly to Asia, has taken a step backwards."
"The Parliament buildings and the law courts have been closed, foreign television stations can no longer operate, and the local channels, under military control, are broadcasting patriotic songs."
"Even the weblogs of people in Thailand have been shut down and subjected to censorship."
"It is clear that there is good cause to be very worried about this, and the European Union, in dealing with this state of affairs, must put democratic values first and foremost."
"I therefore find our treatment of Taiwan highly incorrect."
"Finally, human rights must also feature in this sort of dialogue."
"There are indeed disturbing things going on in the Philippines and in Myanmar, and I am glad that these are being talked about."
"I do, however, want to congratulate the Commission – and, in this instance, the Council too – on the ASEM summit."
"We have, in the past, taken a highly critical line, particularly of the Council’s stance and of its failure to be present at this summit."
"This time, though, there was something of an improvement, and I hope that that will continue."
"I wish the Commission success in its efforts to this end."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the debate on the Commission statement on future action in the field of patents."
"."
"Mr President, intellectual property rights (IPR) are at the heart of a knowledge-based economy."
"Innovation is the key to Europe’s prospects of becoming more competitive on a global level."
"Protection of intellectual property is of crucial importance, because IPR not only rewards investment in new products and services but also ensures the transfer of technology stimulating further innovation."
"The recent consultation on the future of the patent system in Europe delivered one simple message: the legal framework should offer an affordable patent protection for all businesses, small and big, ensure legal certainty and be applied for the benefit of all players."
"A solid legal framework is therefore essential."
"I must repeat that we need to keep up."
"Compared to our major trading partners, Europe is losing ground."
"The Community patent remains blocked in the Council, but recognising the economic importance of patents, I felt that it was not a good thing to leave the entire patent agenda in limbo."
"So, earlier this year, as you know, I launched a broad consultation of all interested parties on future patent policy in Europe."
"The consultation has shown that industry favours the Commission’s effort to simplify the patent system in Europe and to make it more cost-effective."
"There are two major issues here: languages, or translation costs, on the one hand and the jurisdictional system on the other."
"There is strong support for the introduction of a Community patent."
"However, industry is not enamoured of the political compromise reached in the Council in 2003 on the Community patent."
"It rejects the proposed solutions on both language and the jurisdictional system because they do not achieve the cost reductions and simplification of the patent system that industry is calling for."
"At the same time, there is also a strong call for the improvement of the existing European patent system, established by the Munich Convention, by the successful conclusion of a European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) on jurisdiction, and by the ratification and entry into force of the London Agreement on language arrangements."
"It is interesting to note that no single initiative for the improvement of the EU patent system has received unanimous support from stakeholders."
"Different stakeholders highlight different aspects, and many suggest that a package of different measures is needed, which should be implemented in parallel."
"I am therefore convinced that we need to take a multi-faceted approach."
"In order to succeed, we should tackle all the patent issues in one package."
"That package will have to respond to stakeholders’ criticism and needs."
"We will only succeed if we can demonstrate that what we propose will have added value compared to the status quo in particular, regarding costs of patenting (translation costs) and legal certainty (jurisdictional system)."
"We are currently working on the options for the way forward and will present them in a communication and action plan, which the Commission should adopt before the end of this year."
"A key component of this work concerns the jurisdictional issue."
"At present, although business has a one-stop shop where it can acquire a patent (the EPO), it may find itself defending the patent on several fronts at once."
"That is because the patents granted by the European Patent Office are in fact a bundle of national patents and can only be enforced by national courts."
"The possibility of multi-forum litigation concerning the same invention naturally adds cost, but even more importantly it creates uncertainty, as different courts in different countries can deliver diverging interpretations on the same patented invention."
"We need to tackle that issue as a matter of urgency."
"The current ‘patchwork’ may prevent patent holders from being able to enforce their rights and it discourages candidates, in particular SMEs looking for efficient and affordable patent protection, from using the European patent."
"Europe is, at present, unable to offer innovative businesses an optimal solution when it comes to protecting their intellectual property."
"We cannot aspire to be the most competitive economy in the world if we do not find workable solutions for patent application and protection."
"The Community patent and the initiatives to improve the European patent, that is, the London Agreement on translations and the EPLA, are not mutually exclusive."
"They both aim for the same goal: a better, cheaper, more reliable patent system."
"That is why I want to pursue both."
"We face similar challenges in designing the jurisdictional arrangements for the Community patent: we need to find a unified system that provides judicial independence and gives clarity and reliability to patent users while avoiding both over-centralisation and fragmentation."
"In order to achieve that objective, the Community needs to get involved in the EPLA, which addresses shared responsibilities between Member States and the Community."
"It goes without saying that Parliament will have to contribute when the Community proceeds with the required proposals, in order to take this issue forward in the near future."
"I am aware of some critical voices against the EPLA."
"Let me just say that I see the EPLA as a practical initiative to bring greater unity to the case law on patents in Europe."
"And legal certainty is what our industry, big and small alike, need."
"There are hundreds of thousands of patents granted by the EPO."
"Even if we had a Community patent, there would be a need to streamline the jurisdiction process for EPO-granted patents."
"It is up to us to get involved in this initiative to ensure that it serves the competitiveness of our economy."
"I recognise that there are legitimate doubts and concerns: the cost of litigation under the EPLA, the impact of the rules of procedure, which we have yet to see, and the independence of the EPLA judges from the EPO."
"But I am convinced that the best way to confront these problems is by engaging actively with the process and by securing an outcome that is satisfactory and fair to all concerned and in full conformity with EU law."
"Of course, neither the Community patent nor the EPLA are a panacea."
"There will always be businesses – the smaller ones – that prefer to deal with their national patent offices, or to use business models that do not rely on patents."
"We need to look at ways in which we can help and support them."
"And, of course, we need to ensure that large companies do not abuse their position, either by unfairly exploiting their own patents or by unfairly ignoring the patent rights of others."
"The consultation threw up many such issues, for example, the possible mediation mechanisms that could precede litigation, the need to create technology markets that would enable businesses to trade their IPR more successfully, and the idea of exchanging best practice between national patent offices, especially in terms of the special needs of SMEs."
"I will be responding to all these issues, in cooperation with my colleagues in the Commission, and therefore intend to propose a comprehensive strategy."
"Faced with a 21st-century global and knowledge-based economy, we urgently need to find a solution to the patent issue."
"I count upon Parliament’s support in finding a comprehensive solution to these rather complex issues."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for two years now, I have been one of the two rapporteurs in the European Parliament's steering group for the Lisbon process."
"As you know, we launched the Lisbon process together in 2000, and, since then, we have worked tirelessly to point out, in declarations of the Heads of State or Government and in Parliamentary resolutions, that the development of the European patent system is one of the most important preconditions that will enable us to reach the goals defined by Lisbon."
"I was impressed by Commissioner McCreevy's emphasis on the importance of this matter."
"Our goal must be to achieve a simple, cost-effective patent, applicable throughout Europe if at all possible, which gives not only big business but, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises the opportunity to protect their innovations in the internal market: indeed, it is medium-sized enterprises that hold the greatest number of innovative patents."
"The decisive issue is that we must make changes in Europe's current fragmented patent landscape, with the aim of drastically reducing consultancy, procedural and translation costs, which are a particular burden on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"That is the decisive goal that we must achieve."
"Of course, people can already obtain protection for their inventions throughout Europe, but, in practice, they have to do so in all Member States, either directly through the national patent offices or indirectly through the European Patent Office, with the bundle of patents that has been mentioned."
"In the event of disputes or infringements they must, in theory, launch proceedings, incur legal costs and so on in all these countries."
"This must be resolved and made more viable and practicable, particularly for SMEs."
"The internal market needs to be developed further in this respect."
"Under your predecessor, Mr Bolkestein, an admirable proposal for a single European patent regulation to establish a Community patent was set in motion."
"However, when Article 308 is the legal basis and unanimity in the Council is required, it is difficult to reach agreement."
"In this particular case, agreement could not be reached in the dispute about languages: there are currently 20 official languages that the Council is demanding; after the next enlargement there will be 22."
"The industry is quite rightly saying that nobody needs that sort of patent: it is so exorbitantly expensive that it is of no use and practically no economic value."
"The competitiveness of the European patent would push us a long way back in global terms and not guarantee the necessary quality."
"A patent of this kind would only be of benefit to very big, rich businesses that could afford that kind of thing, and perhaps not even to them."
"For medium-sized businesses it would be completely unusable."
"Therefore, the Regulation is stuck fast, and the Council is not shifting."
"My suggestion of continuing with harmonisation, which you were so good as to include in the consultation, Commissioner, was also rejected by all parties, primarily following our experiences with the second reading of the Directive on computer-implemented inventions, which showed that there was a risk that legislation could be enacted that would not improve the current patent system, but would make it considerably worse."
"So, we have made no progress with harmonisation either."
"What, then, is left for us to do?"
"What is left is that we must carry on and further develop the currently existing patent system."
"There are, however, institutional problems in this regard: on the one hand, the European Union's fully legitimate claim that the Member States should not legislate in areas that, at any rate, actually lie partly in its sphere of competence and belong to the internal market; and, on the other hand, the Member States' keenness to make progress."
"I take the position that we must try to link these two problems together to solve them."
"In my view, one conceivable option would be for the European Union to be involved in some way – to be decided by negotiations – in the European patent agreement and, in return, for the European Union to clear up the institutional concerns regarding the European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA)."
"This could be one way in which we could improve the situation while agreement cannot be reached in the Council regarding a Community patent."
"With regard to the lobby's publicly expressed criticisms, in my view, the claim that the introduction of a single European patent court within the meaning of the EPLA would make it easier to patent software is, to put it mildly, nonsense."
"It is pure speculation for which there is no evidence – one of those matters comes under procedural law, and one under substantive law."
"Nor is the EPLA more expensive."
"It must be clear that apples are being compared with oranges here."
"If the EPLA is in place, it will not be necessary to pursue legal disputes in all the countries involved: one court, the second instance, so to speak, will reach a judgment that is equally binding on all signatory States."
"I am most grateful to Commissioner McCreevy for the way in which the consultation was conducted."
"I gather from the Commissioner's public comments that he, too, has obviously drawn the right conclusions from the results of the consultation."
"I should like to say, both personally and on behalf of the great majority of my group, that we share and support this position."
"There is no alternative."
"Otherwise, the grand project of developing the European patent system is doomed to failure."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, there are not very many of us in this Chamber, which does not mean to say that we are not deliberating serious issues – far from it."
"I am going to address you on behalf of three political groups and of even more than that, just as my fellow Member and friend, Mr Lehne, also did."
"Commissioner, this debate is due to the initiative of the European Parliament and it was born out of our desire to respond positively to your consultation."
"We thank you for it and we congratulate you on it."
"After the difficulties that we encountered concerning the patentability of software, we were pleased that the Commission – with you yourself acting as intermediary - is launching a procedure aimed at restarting discussions and preparatory work on the European patent."
"Commissioner, we clashed swords; we disagreed on several points."
"I have just listened to you extremely carefully."
"I can say that I agree with virtually everything you just said."
"I totally agree, but there is one argument that you have not mentioned, and, because of your silence, that is the one that I am led to wonder about and that, while we are still without a solution, currently leaves those that I represent in a rather negative state of uncertainty."
"Let me explain myself a little more."
"All of us in this Chamber, as Europeans, want the Community patent."
"I have that in common with my fellow Member and friend, Mr Lehne, who just spoke with his customary eloquence."
"We all know that this patent has come up against enormous difficulties and that it is at a standstill."
"The main reason for this standstill is language-related."
"In reality, the four factors causing this standstill are the language problem, the cost problem, the problem of the legal consistency of the judicature and the sovereignty problem - the one about which you have not spoken."
"I truly believe that the real means of breaking the political, cultural and intellectual deadlock at the Council regarding the European patent is mainly connected with solving the language problem."
"Unlike my fellow Member, Mr Lehne, I am not just a European Member who is in favour of Europe; I am also French."
"Nobody is perfect, you will forgive me for that."
"I should like to state in this House that I believe that the ratification of the London agreement – something that my country has not yet officially endorsed, although I advise it to do so – would be an opportunity for us all to overcome our linguistic arrogance and the hostility that it creates and to learn to live together, in the knowledge that one language dominates the others worldwide."
"We may not like it, but that is how things are; it is convenient."
"That is what would potentially break the deadlock on the start of plans for a Community patent."
"We would therefore agree to the resolution resulting from these debates saying so."
"The second problem is one of cost;"
"I will hardly touch on it, except to say that three-quarters of the cost factor are language-related – that is the problem that I am going to address – and that the remaining quarter is modest, that the EPLA probably needs to be improved and that it is outrageous to think that we might see the ratification of an agreement that many experts say would increase costs."
"We do not need that."
"The only problem about which you have not spoken is that of knowing which legislative sovereignty will define and develop over time the field of what is patentable and what is unpatentable."
"This Parliament will be extremely sensitive to anything to do with the patentability of living matter, which is a significant problem for civilisation."
"Moreover, as regards software, we cannot ratify the EPLA, because the EPLA gives a professional group of judges a partly international, partly European function: that of making changes to the case law as they see fit, without any legislative control or sovereignty having a bearing on their actions."
"This is what we do not accept: the idea that European sovereignty will play no part in defining the scope."
"Therefore, since the EPLA is a body of autonomous jurisdictions blocking and holding up the implementation of the European patent, we reject the EPLA and we advise you …"
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as you know, I attended the patent consultation day."
"I made my own submission and I have read many of the others and I think that what you have just given us is a very fair summary."
"I would also like to thank you for having moved that consultation day to a day that did not clash with a Strasbourg session, so that I and other MEPs were able to attend."
"It was a very useful exercise, because it has shown the extent of the problems with the Community patent proposals."
"Translations, as we knew, were a problem but now it shows that the need for a litigation system, with specialist judges that are accessible within Member States, is another."
"We all want single market considerations to prevail and that leads eventually to having a Community patent, but the consultation shows that there are steps that can be taken to improve the process."
"The EPLA initiative by Member States, which is optional, embraces some of those steps."
"It is still work in progress, so now there is an opportunity for you to participate and I welcome the fact that you say you are going to take that opportunity."
"That can only be helpful in working towards a goal in which there is eventually a single or merged European and Community patent system."
"Maybe you can help to fix some of the criticisms of EPLA."
"One fix I would like is to minimise court fees, rather than force litigants to bear all the costs of judges’ salaries and the establishment costs of the appeal court."
"A second fix I would like is the retention of national patent courts, instead of phasing them out after seven years."
"Surely they could remain, in the same way that national patent filings have now coexisted with European patents for nearly 30 years."
"On the other hand, the possibility of having nationally based courts of first instance and a panel of judges, with at least one who is technically qualified and at least two who are legally qualified and from different Member States, might be superior to the current ECJ arrangements, were they to apply to a Community patent."
"Mr Rocard and some others have criticised EPLA, since it would allow EPO Board of Appeal members to become technical judges."
"That objection is based solely upon not agreeing with particular decisions in one or two areas of technology."
"It takes no account of the publicly available record showing that technical boards of the EPO are independent of both the EPO examining division and EPO practices."
"It ignores the fact that, in the EPLA structure, such technical judges would be in the minority among national judges who have been praised by those of the same persuasion as Mr Rocard for their stance in those areas of technology."
"However, I question whether we would want them to be able to have the two jobs at once – I do not think that was intended – and I think that could be clarified."
"Also, the appointment of judges via representatives from Member State governments follows the precedents of many institutions, including the ECJ, so I do not think there is huge substance in these arguments and it would certainly be a mistake for the Commission to miss out on contributing to and learning from the EPLA process."
"Mr President, I rise to speak on behalf of my colleague, Evelin Lichtenberger, who is unable to attend this afternoon."
"We always speak about a competitive, knowledge-based Europe, but some people put so little trust in Europe’s potential that they prefer to strengthen a non-EU body – the European Patent Office – to the detriment of European Union interests."
"If what we want is harmonised jurisdiction, why do we not pursue that aim through EU directives?"
"That would be the most obvious way to proceed."
"Some people are afraid to face the democratic process."
"After the software patent fight, apparently there are people who are worried about the amendments that the European Parliament would propose."
"Therefore they want to proceed as undemocratically as possible."
"They want to put the fate of Europe’s companies in the hands of the patent bureaucracy instead of elected policymakers."
"Furthermore, the cost of litigations would be tough to meet for SMEs because every litigation concerning an EPO patent would go directly before a new international court – a real own-goal for Europe’s competitiveness."
"I should like to draw your attention to the fact that some big multinationals such as Nokia and GlaxoSmithKline are very concerned about such a proposal."
"If this proposal neither helps SMEs nor is welcomed by big countries, who will help?"
"What we can infer for sure is that it will only increase the work for some patent lawyers."
"Europe does not need merely more patents: it needs more high-quality patents that foster real innovation."
"The number of patent applications filed at the European Patent Office per year has, over the last seven years, increased by about 60%."
"However, that number does not correspond to an increase in innovative activity, therefore giving us cause for concern over an extension of the scope of Patent Office subject matter."
"We will keep repeating to our colleagues, and especially to the Commissioner, that only a Community framework creates the conditions for an effective, competitive European patent law at international level."
"."
"Mr President, last year Parliament rejected by 684 votes to 14 an attempt to impose patents on software, because, like books and all written materials, software is best described as ‘ideas in symbolic form’ and should continue to be subject only to copyright."
"Parliament was also persuaded that patenting software would stifle invention, cripple small businesses and harm the economy, and yet this year the Commission returns with an even more sweeping proposal, which would permit software to be patented."
"The proposal is for a single patent court, whose judiciary would be appointed by the same board as that which appoints judges to the present appeals court of the existing – purely advisory – European Patent Office."
"The Commission has a seat on the Board and, under this proposal, would acquire voting rights as well."
"This raises serious doubts about the independence of the new court, especially when we consider that the EPO has no scruples about issuing patents for software and that this proposal commits a single patent court to following the precedents set by previous EPO decisions."
"By the proposal’s own admission, litigation in this new court will be two to three times more costly than litigation in national patent courts, which this proposal will also abolish, thus putting appeal to this court beyond the reach of all but large corporations."
"I thought the computer-implemented inventions directive was bad until I saw this proposal."
"If it goes through, I shall gladly take the Leninist view that worse is better."
"Nevertheless, we should say no again and ask the Commissioners what part of no they do not understand."
"Mr President, the significant increase in patent applications is adding to the impact of unclear patent law."
"That is why solutions are needed which will enable the process of harmonising patent law to begin."
"Accordingly, a clear definition of what can and cannot be patented is required."
"It is important not to resort to using patent law in isolation from the innovations themselves, because by its very nature a patent implies that free competition is restricted to a certain degree."
"A harmonising directive would be the best solution from the point of view of the Community’s interest, but Parliament rejected the Commission’s previous proposals."
"Other solutions must therefore be sought."
"One idea mooted is for all Member States of the Union to accept and ratify the EPLA Convention."
"It should be borne in mind, however, that we can only support this Convention when it meets the criteria deemed essential by the Union."
"Amongst others, these criteria include drawing up a clear definition, as far as is possible, of what may be patented ensuring the independence of ruling bodies and guaranteeing the total impartiality of the judges who rule on patent protection and the validity of patents."
"The costs relating to the protection of patent rights must also be balanced and easy to implement."
"These are the reasons why we are not in a position to adopt the Convention at present."
"Its implications may be difficult to assess, because although it is obvious that the EPLA concerns institutional solutions, the potential impact on substantive law should not be overlooked, particularly where the practices of the European Patent Office are concerned."
"That is why I am asking the Commission to provide a detailed impact assessment for each of the proposals submitted here."
"Nonetheless, it is most important to make it clear that Parliament does want a change of patent policy."
"The kind of change we have in mind, however, must satisfy the needs of both large businesses and small and medium-sized European firms."
"– Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr McCreevy on his work on the creation of an internal market, particularly with regard to patent law."
"Nevertheless, I must point out that we Members of the European Parliament are here representing our constituents, and the reactions I have received from constituents from the industrial sector in my country to this proposal have been negative."
"They are negative for various reasons: the issue of languages – I believe that the solution proposed is much worse than the one we have in the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, which offers greater language plurality – and the issue of jurisdiction, which has already been discussed here."
"We have our own jurisdiction, which is that of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the Court of First Instance, and the creation or multiplication of jurisdictions outside of the European Union raises a series of problems that we must take into account."
"My feeling is that this proposal may be doomed to failure, like previous proposals, as a result of not taking these factors into account."
"We need to make progress on patents, but, in order to do so, we must have a broad political base."
"Firstly, I would say that, at the moment, jurisdictional procedures which extend beyond the structure of the European Union do not inspire confidence − we have great confidence in the wonderful institutions of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance − and, secondly, that the issue of languages is not a trivial matter."
"I know that many people have a language of a more universal nature, but within the European Union we have sought solutions to the language problem, because the European Union includes diverse cultures, diverse models and diverse legal systems, and they must be able to co-exist."
"I hope that the Commissioner and the Commission in general will reflect on this issue and will be able to offer us a proposal that is acceptable to the whole of the European Union."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your efforts at getting this slow-moving vessel steaming ahead again."
"We have spent more than thirty years talking about patents, and it is particularly strange that so many Members should be critical of your ideas, even though almost all the EU’s Member States are signatories to the Munich Convention."
"By so doing, they are implying a lack of confidence in our Member States; that I find in itself a pretty strange kind of deadlock, and I also think that there is something odd about the fact that a Community patent still cannot be discussed at Council level."
"At the present time, the EU has no democratic control over the European Patent Office, and that is of course much to be regretted."
"We go along with your way of thinking, and it would be good if the EU were to do as it did at the Hague conference, were to take part as a political and economic organisation, so that we, as part of it, could have influence on what happens. If that happens, then intergovernmentalism is no longer the order of the day, and the community method will have been adopted."
"We would be happy to see the EU taking part in the Munich Convention in the same way, so that the Commission – and, perhaps, Parliament too – might be able to exercise ongoing democratic oversight over what goes on."
"Together, then, with the Group of the European People’s Party and with the Liberals – and I hope that the Socialist Group will join us in supporting this – we have brought in a resolution endorsing your position and with the intention of examining what options are available."
"We see that as the only solution if the Council is going to keep sitting on this for so long."
"We are not talking here about the rules governing languages or about the costs, and we certainly have no desire to suspend the national courts, but there must eventually be a special chamber at the European Court of Justice with specialist judges capable of determining how patents should be dealt with across Europe in the event of cases coming to trial."
"As for the computer-implemented inventions to which Mr Rocard referred, we do not want to open that particular Pandora’s box again;"
"I agree with him that doing that would be a very tedious business."
"We can also see that mistakes may well still be being made within the EPO, and, for the simple reason that we cannot correct them, it is important that we follow this up."
"I was very struck by the words of an Irish Commissioner, who recently said, in Finland: ‘No more fine words about Lisbon; we are now going into action’."
"I hope that that is what you are going to do, for you, Commissioner, were the person who said that."
"."
"Mr President, I have listened carefully to the debate this afternoon."
"We all agree that the situation is not perfect and we all know that there are different views as to the right solutions."
"I am convinced that in an ideal world the Community patent the solution, but in the real world there is no prospect of agreement on the Community patent in the near future."
"So should I sit around doing nothing, just waiting for something to turn up?"
"Well, that would certainly be an easy way out, but it would also be grossly irresponsible, because nothing will happen unless we take the initiative."
"The consultation delivered some clear and important messages."
"There is an overwhelming desire for a patent system that is simpler and more cost-effective and maintains the highest standards in the quality of its examination and grant procedures."
"All the stakeholders went to great lengths to convey their views to us."
"Now, quite rightly, they expect action."
"And I agree."
"I believe the time has come to make a concerted push to improve the patent system in Europe."
"As policymakers and regulators, it is our duty."
"Currently, we are at a standstill."
"We have to take the first most difficult step in one direction or another."
"There no perfect solution."
"No single element will provide all the answers."
"We need to combine different instruments to meet the different needs of different stakeholders."
"As I said in my introductory remarks, the Community patent and the EPLA are not mutually exclusive initiatives; indeed, our aim should be to ensure that they converge."
"In both cases our goal is the same: a better, cheaper, more reliable patent system."
"I am not blind to the potential drawbacks and dangers of the EPLA."
"But we have a better chance of getting the right outcome for Europe’s business if we actively engage in the negotiation of the agreement."
"The patent strategy now contains more than just our future plans for a Community patent and EPLA."
"There is a whole range of framing and supporting measures that we need to consider, most of them directed at smaller companies."
"Our objective is to produce a system that meets the needs of all stakeholders at all levels – national, European and Community –and provides a fair balance between the diverse interests involved."
"I would like to make one final point."
"As a politician for 30 years now, I am not easily surprised."
"But this week I have been mildly surprised."
"I was mildly surprised that the outline for our future strategy, which I set out in a speech in Helsinki some weeks ago, has been used by some to make assertions that the Commission wishes to bring the computer-implemented inventions question back on to the agenda."
"Now I am used to hearing strong arguments and to links being made, but this one leaves me quite perplexed."
"I have stated before this House on various occasions that as long as I am Commissioner for the Single Market and Services the Commission will present initiative and will not carry out any work on this."
"Some might like that, others might disapprove."
"But this Parliament rejected the common position last year."
"I respect and accept that decision and will do absolutely nothing to turn it around."
"Let me reassure you that I am a man of my word."
"When drawing conclusions from the consultation exercise, computer-implemented inventions were not in any way on my mind."
"That will remain so for the rest of my mandate."
"Please note that the deadline for tabling motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure is 12 noon on Monday 9 October 2006."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 12 October at 11 a.m."
"I have grave doubts about the proposals for a system of patent courts that would be at arm’s length both from democratic institutions and from proper judicial review."
"The draft resolution on the European Patent Litigation Agreement could, if implemented, place patent disputes in the hands of these who have a vested interest in a very wide use of patents, it would lead to extra costs for SME, cause an explosion in litigation and potentially restrict innovation in Europe."
"Supporters of the EPLA make reference to the USA’s central federal patent court, but this system has led to excessive use of patent, and a considerable volume of litigation and malicious threats of litigation."
"– Mr President, it is not even 4 p.m. and this week's topical and urgent debate, which would only have lasted an hour, has been cancelled."
"In other words, we would have been finished at 5 p.m."
"There were important matters to discuss, such as the coup in Thailand and the situation in Moldova, but the Conference of Presidents arbitrarily decided that there would be no topical and urgent debate."
"I should like once again, at the close of the sitting, to protest strongly against this."
"We were told that this was the second sitting in September, but that is incorrect: we held the August plenary session at the beginning of September, and this is now the September plenary session, so to speak."
"As such, it is our right to hold a topical and urgent debate at each regular sitting in Strasbourg."
"I would ask to you pass this protest on to the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents."
"Your comment will be passed on to the Conference of Presidents."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 28 September 2006."
"Tribute"
"I must begin this sitting by passing on some bad news."
"Firstly, it is my sad duty to inform you of the death of Mr Antoni Gutiérrez Díaz, who was a Member of the European Parliament for many years, from 1987 to 1999."
"As you are very well aware as am I, since I got to know him very well within the context of Spanish political life he was a member of the Communist Group and then the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, of which he was Vice-President from 1992 to 1994."
"Mr Gutiérrez Díaz was also Vice-President of our Parliament from 1994 to 1999 and President of the Committee on Regional Policy, Regional Planning and Relations with Regional and Local Authorities from 1992 to 1994."
"To those of us who knew him, his death is a great tragedy."
"I believe that political life has lost one of its best representatives."
"I would ask that we observe a minute's silence in memory of our late colleague."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Statement by the President"
"I have further bad news to communicate to you. It was with sadness and indignation that I received the news of the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya."
"I believe that the European Parliament must pay tribute to this journalist, to her courage and her exceptional determination."
"As you know, following the news of her murder I issued a press communiqué urging the Russian authorities to do everything in their power to ascertain the causes and perpetrators of this horrendous event as quickly as possible."
"We hope that in identifying the culprits Russia will demonstrate the state of democracy and freedom of expression there."
"This event, on the eve of the Lahti meeting, is clearly of particularly crucial significance to us."
"On my own behalf and on behalf of the whole of the European Parliament, I would like once again to express our sincerest condolences to her family and friends."
"I also believe, however, that this is a good opportunity to remember that the murder of journalists is not, unfortunately, something that happens only on the odd rare occasion."
"On the contrary, many people lose their lives defending freedom of expression and information."
"It has happened in Russia today, but it happened in Lebanon the day before yesterday, in many Latin American countries, in many African countries and in many South-East Asian countries."
"People who produce information and create opinion often do so at risk of their lives."
"This latest murder is no more or less tragic than any of the many other cases we have seen."
"I believe, however, that the case of Anna Politkovskaya's death and the cases of the 63 journalists murdered and more than 120 imprisoned warrant an expression of our respect for these people."
"I would ask that we observe a minute's silence in tribute to Anna Politkovskaya and the 63 journalists who have been murdered while carrying out their work."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting"
"Mr President, thank you for making this statement on the occasion of the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya."
"Russia has become one of the deadliest countries for journalists, and her cruel death..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Kelam, I am afraid I cannot give you the floor."
"Mr Kelam, I cannot give you the floor at this point."
"We are asking whether there are any comments concerning the Minutes."
"You will have the opportunity to express your views on this during the one-minute questions."
"For the moment, however, we are in the process of approving the Minutes."
"Are there are any comments concerning the Minutes?"
"Mr President, I have a mandate, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, to extend the topic of ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"This is not the right time, Mr Kelam."
"You can do it at another time, but I cannot give you the floor now."
"I am sorry, Mr Kelam."
"I am sorry."
"This is not the right time to speak on behalf of the groups."
"We are currently approving the Minutes."
"With regard to the Minutes, are there any comments?"
"(FR) Mr President, if that presents a problem, then I myself am also presenting a problem."
"We are calling for a change to the agenda, in fact to an item of the agenda."
"That is all, and we would ask you to make the change straightaway."
"Excuse me."
"It is very clear what the Minutes means in Spanish."
"It is extremely clear."
"We are talking about the approval of the Minutes, and I imagine that the interpreters are able to translate what we are talking about for you."
"Do you have any comments with regard to the Minutes?"
"If you do not, you will have the opportunity to speak about other items on the agenda later."
"Mr President, I do not want to delay the proceedings, but Question Time at the last part-session was a shambles."
"I would ask you to ensure that it does not happen again."
"Question Time is being moved around far too often and Members are not being given the opportunity to do their duty."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much. We shall try to ensure that it is not a shambles this time, at least in your judgment."
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)"
"Action taken on Parliament's resolutions: see Minutes"
"Documents received: see Minutes"
"Written statements (Rule 116): see Minutes"
"Texts of agreements forwarded by the Council: see Minutes"
"Membership of Parliament: see Minutes"
"Membership of committees and delegations: see Minutes"
"Agenda"
"With regard to the agenda for today and tomorrow, the corresponding corrigendum has been distributed, drawn up with the agreement of the political groups and including the following changes, as well as those that were announced on 28 September:"
"- Wednesday:"
"From 3 p.m. to 4 p.m., we are adding the statements by the European Union's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission on the nuclear test by North Korea."
"We welcome Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner who are here for that purpose."
"With regard to the oral questions on footwear from China and Vietnam, I must point out that the Council will not take part in that debate."
"(DE) Mr President, we are, in principle, happy with these alterations, and particularly happy that Mr Solana has found ways and means of getting here."
"We are, however, very far from happy with the fact that the Council's willingness to agree to be present only to a very limited extent means that a great deal of today's agenda has had to be put off to another day."
"Although this also happened under the Austrian Presidency, we did manage to come to an arrangement."
"I ask that the Presidencies of the Council be reminded that a provisional agenda is not final, and that it can of course happen - as it has on this occasion - that we have to respond to events as they happen."
"I would also ask the governments of which the Council is composed to ensure that they are able to be present for the sittings in Brussels at least until the evening."
"That is absolutely vital, for if they cannot, we cannot get through all the things that are - and indeed have to be - on the agenda."
"I would ask that this be communicated to the Council and that it be urged to be more visibly and more frequently present in this House."
"(Applause)"
"There is a change of title concerning the Council and Commission statement on the Informal Meeting in Lahti."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance asks that the title read as follows: Council and Commission statement on the Informal Meeting in Lahti, EU/Russia relations following the murder of Mrs Anna Politkovskaya, with a motion for a resolution on her murder and freedom of opinion in Russia."
"You will be aware that, according to our Rules of Procedure, this amendment must be approved by plenary if the President sees fit to put it to the vote."
"Given the circumstances, I believe it appropriate to do so and I am therefore going to ask plenary to give its opinion on the proposal of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"Does anybody wish to speak?"
"(DE) Mr President, we have no objection to a change of title, nor, indeed, to a resolution, but we do think it premature to adopt a resolution within the space of a day before matters have been clarified, so I would ask that consideration be given to such a resolution being adopted at the next plenary session, when there will be a sound basis for it."
"We will of course be stating our own position on it, and by then we will have more detailed information."
"For that reason, then, I would keep the two separate."
"You propose separating the decision on the change of title from the decision on whether to debate a resolution."
"In that case, let us vote solely on the change of title for the time being."
"(Parliament approved the change of title)"
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Swoboda, we do indeed have only one day available to us, and the reason is that we have been asking for this ever since Anna Politkovskaya was murdered, but certain groups have been standing in the way, and hence it is only today that this vote has made it possible, for, right through the preparations, certain groups - your own included - have said 'no' to this addition."
"Yes, it is difficult, and we are quite happy that it should be done next week, but I ask you to admit that it is your fault, for it is you who have stood in the way of this issue being debated the whole time."
"That is something that has to be said."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, our group's Mr Kelam has tried to raise this issue; it may be that he made the attempt at the wrong point in the proceedings, but, now we are discussing the agenda for today's sittings, it might be not merely appropriate but also a matter of courtesy to allow Mr Tunne Kelam to take the floor and speak, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to this agenda and the alteration of this item on it, rather than going straight ahead and allowing votes on a single motion on this subject after so many other views have been expressed on it."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Rack, the President and the Bureau are trying to apply the Rules of Procedure strictly."
"The Bureau had only received one proposed amendment to the agenda in writing in this regard before the beginning of the sitting."
"Mr Kelam will certainly be able to speak at the appropriate time, but this is not it."
"(DE) Mr President, it sometimes happens that unfortunate events make things take a turn that we would not have wished."
"One example is this sad case of the murder of a journalist, which we will be debating."
"This sad murder is not something about which we should be at odds with each other."
"We will have the debate, but I would echo what Mr Cohn-Bendit said and recommend that we agree to wait until the next part-session before adopting a resolution; that will be a fitting response to this sad event."
"If nobody objects, we shall discuss whether or not there will be a resolution during the next sitting."
"Mr Kelam, do you wish to add anything?"
"Mr President, I apologise for attempting to speak at the wrong time, but I had a mandate from the PPE-DE Group to propose that we should extend the first item on today's agenda to include a discussion on the murder of the Russian journalist, Anna Politkovskaya."
"I am satisfied that has been done."
"Furthermore, the PPE-DE Group proposes that the House should adopt a resolution on freedom of the press in Russia, which is a burning topic."
"I think it was rightly said that this horrible murder should not divide this House."
"We need to be united in order to send a very clear message in support of a woman who many say was the last independent investigative journalist in Russia."
"I hope that this House will support the proposal."
"The death of Anna Politkovskaya was not planned and so we could not plan our reaction to it."
"We need to react immediately."
"(Loud applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr Kelam."
"I believe that it is clear."
"We have followed our Rules of Procedure to the letter."
"I do not believe that the Presidency has shown any lack of consideration by giving you the floor at the appropriate time, Mr Kelam."
"Mr President, you did not take a vote on whether we should have a resolution at this part-session."
"I request that we take a vote."
"A proposal was submitted to the effect that we react immediately with a resolution, and you did not take a vote on that proposal."
"(Applause)"
"Come on, ladies and gentlemen, let us not play cat and mouse."
"There was a proposal from Mr Poettering, and I asked whether there was a consensus on it."
"Nobody rose at that point to speak against."
"You must pay attention to the debates, Mr Saryusz-Wolski!"
"There has been a proposal, and I asked whether there was a consensus on it."
"Since nobody has expressed any objection, I have continued with the agenda."
"The subject is closed."
"(The order of business was adopted)"
"Future action in the field of patents (motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"Nuclear test by the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea (debate)"
"The next item is the Statements by the European Union's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission on the nuclear test by North Korea."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have asked me here this afternoon, together with the Commission, to give a brief assessment of what happened early on Monday morning, when the North Korean Government may have carried out a nuclear test."
"I say that it was very probably a nuclear test, as we cannot, from the information available to us at present, be completely certain that it was indeed that."
"The most likely explanation is that a nuclear device made from plutonium was detonated, plutonium no doubt coming from the Yongbyon nuclear reactor constructed in North Korea in the 1980s and 1990s."
"In all probability, it was a nuclear test and was therefore an act which we condemn, which we condemn in the strongest terms and which we also condemn because of the degree of irresponsibility it shows on the North Korean Government's part."
"That nuclear test is not just a threat to the region around North Korea but also an act of aggression against stability and security across the world."
"It is not inconceivable that such an act may have implications for the global arms race generally."
"I would like to begin by saying that countries in the area have reacted calmly and responsibly."
"I have had an opportunity, over the last 48 hours, to talk to all countries involved in the region: to South Korea, to China and to Japan."
"I have also talked to Russia and the United States of America. All countries have shown the same firmness in response as we Europeans are showing, but also the same calmness, lest the situation get out of hand."
"I would like to point out very clearly that this reprehensible act came just a few days after the election as Japanese Prime Minister of Shinzo Abe, who immediately upon taking office, in a gesture which does him credit, visited Beijing, which the previous Prime Minister had not visited for years."
"After Beijing, he went on to Seoul, embarking on a full tour of the countries most affected by the North Korean threat."
"In the middle of that kind, good-neighbourly trip, North Korea decided to carry out its nuclear test."
"With regard to the condemnation expressed by all countries in the area and with responsibility being the watchword, I should highlight yesterday's meeting at the Japanese parliament, where Prime Minister Abe stated very clearly that Japan would not respond by developing nuclear weapons."
"That, I think, shows great responsibility on the part of the Japanese Government, which we should all commend."
"Emphasis should also be placed here on the constructive response by the People's Republic of China."
"As you will be aware, China was leading the 'Six Party Talks' which, although stalled since before the summer, were regarded as a positive way of trying to resolve the North Korean nuclear proliferation problem."
"As I said, I have recently been speaking to all political leaders in the region, including the future Secretary-General of the United Nations, who is at present still in office as South Korea's Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"I told them all that North Korea poses a threat to peace and security, not just within the region; and, I should add, not just in its nuclear activities but also in its attitude towards missile proliferation."
"As you will be aware, North Korea is continuing to produce, and maybe illegally exporting to other parts of the world, technology for missiles to deliver either nuclear or conventional warheads."
"It is important also to point out that this act by North Korea is an act directed against its own population. North Korea is a poor country, where most of the population go hungry and do not enjoy the living conditions we would all wish them to have; yet their government goes on spending millions of dollars on an arms race and on achieving a nuclear capability of which it has no need whatsoever for the development and well-being of its people."
"I would add that the response of the United Nations Security Council, since Monday night, has been correct, and that the reaction of the European Union's Member States has also been extremely correct."
"It is important to point out that China has also made constructive statements concerning its willingness to cooperate on approving a tough resolution which clearly condemns North Korea's conduct and will prove effective in avoiding proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons."
"I would like to say, lastly, that the European Union, which voiced its unanimous and urgent condemnation of Monday morning's act at the appropriate time, has also to consider its commitment to and attitude towards North Korea."
"As I said earlier, this is a poor country, with which we have increasingly tenuous relations, but with which we do still have a humanitarian link, to which I am sure Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner will be referring."
"We shall be keeping a close watch on developments over the days ahead, and I shall personally remain in touch with the political leaders of all countries in the region."
"I would like, Mr President, before drawing to a close, once again to condemn in the strongest terms on behalf of the European Union what was very probably a nuclear explosion carried out by North Korea."
"Mr President, Secretary-General, High Representative of the Council,"
"the nuclear test which North Korea claims to have conducted at Gilju on the morning of 9 October is an extremely serious matter, which I unreservedly condemn."
"As the High Representative just said, not only does it threaten regional stability in north-east Asia, it also constitutes the latest in a series of challenges by Kim Jong-il to the international nuclear non-proliferation regime."
"Following the announcement of its intention to carry out such a test last Tuesday, North Korea has proceeded in defiance of the near-unanimous advice and wishes of the international community."
"This action increases North Korea's international isolation and it is difficult to see how it can serve the interests of the country's long-suffering population."
"As ever, North Korea's motives are very opaque."
"It does not seem unreasonable, however, to regard this as a deliberate escalation and provocation by the DPRK, possibly to test the ability of the international community to remain united."
"The European Union has spoken out very clearly in response to this nuclear test and I am pleased to note that the international community has been swift, resolute and united in condemning these actions."
"The very forceful and clear-cut position of China is particularly significant and welcome."
"I have just come back from a trip to Singapore and Malaysia, and I can assure you that my colleagues are most concerned by this act by North Korea."
"I am pleased that we will have an opportunity to discuss the EU's response at the General Affairs Council next week."
