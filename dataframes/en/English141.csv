"Although this agreement, arrived at within the framework of the new codecision procedure, does not address all of the concerns of the European Parliament, it is the basis of a common understanding with regard to the budgetary priorities for the Union."
"In the light of the new challenges facing the Union, it has become crucial for a facility to be in place that enables the Commission to introduce changes to the budget when the funding set aside is insufficient to reach the strategic objectives, namely within the framework of the priorities established within the EU 2020 Strategy."
"In the same way, it will be the task of the European Parliament and the Council to find common ground for a rapid and effective response, creating the conditions for a more egalitarian and competitive Union, able to face up to the new challenges."
"The outcome of the budget debate for 2011 was foreseeable, taking into account the responsibilities of the Council and the main political groups within this Parliament, whether in the definition and acceptance of the current multi-annual financial framework, or in the approval of subsequent budgets which this will have to cover."
"But what this agreement does not remove, indeed it reinforces them, are the many reasons to be critical of this budget that we have left out here."
"In view of the worsening of the economic and social crisis, unemployment and the living conditions of millions of people - to which the plans for real social terrorism that the EU intends to impose on Member States contribute a great deal - we are all going to find out once again what the true meaning of the much vaunted European solidarity is: a budget that does not go beyond 1% of community (Gross National Income) GNI, unable to perform its function to redistribute wealth, unable to ensure economic and social cohesion, and that, without a doubt, will accentuate the harmful effects of the policies that the EU is pursuing."
"Once again we reiterate that there is an alternative to this budget, and that is not only possible, but also truly necessary."
"An alternative that would involve a significant strengthening of the community budget, based on fair contributions from Member States, in line with their GNI."
"I welcome the agreement between the European Parliament and the governments of the 27 Member States, especially, because in the absence of this agreement the payments which Irish farmers will receive next year would be delayed."
"The threat of the introduction of a provisional budget for 2011 mobilised the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to intensify discussions, the result of which - the draft budget which was voted on today - can be considered a pragmatic compromise."
"The negotiations held between the institutions led to inclusion of most of the proposals being advocated by Parliament."
"We have obtained the Council's assurance that it is willing to cooperate during establishment of the Financial Framework for 2014-2020, which will be a practical fulfilment of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Parliament has also reached agreement on this matter with the Prime Ministers of Hungary, Poland, Denmark and Cyprus, in other words with those Member States which in the next two years will hold the Presidency of the EU Council."
"We are also pleased with the Council's decision to maintain the flexibility mechanism in the European Union budget at a level of 0.03% of EU GDP."
"These funds will allow the financing of crucial expenditures which were not foreseen during negotiations over the previous Financial Framework, such as the European External Action Service and the Galileo system, for example."
"A concession on the part of Parliament is postponement of the debate on future sources of finance for the European Union, something for which the European Commission has also called."
"The idea of relieving national contributions to the Union budget fell in the face of determined opposition from a group of Member States which was afraid of the reaction of public opinion."
"We will undoubtedly return to this debate in the summer of 2011, when the Commission will present several new options for financing the EU."
"in writing. - (on behalf of the UK Conservative delegation) The UK Conservatives today voted against the 2.9% increase in the budget because we believe that, as national capitals look for ways of cutting their own deficits or improving their fiscal situation, it is not appropriate for MEPs to demand an increase in European spending."
"The EU budget cannot, as some MEPs argue, be used as a supplement to national budgets in a time of austerity; rather, it should reflect the difficult situation in which EU Member States find themselves."
"That is why the Conservatives originally tabled an amendment calling for a long-term freeze in payments at 2010 levels, a move that would do much to assure citizens that the EU is doing its bit to bring long-term public spending under control and onto a more sustainable footing."
"Today's adoption of the 2011 budget has highlighted the European Parliament's double failure."
"The budget that it adopted is too small: +2.91%, which falls far short of its first reading (+6%) and of the Commission's initial proposal (+5.8%)."
"The amounts adopted are exactly the same as those proposed with no real room for the Council to negotiate, hardly reassuring in terms of the negotiability of future budgets."
"Ever since the Treaty of Lisbon was implemented, Parliament has acted with the Council in codecision on budgetary matters: by not getting any precise commitment to date on the role that we, as MEPs, will have in preparing the next financial framework and on providing the necessary reflection on new own resources, we run the risk of allowing the Council to become lord and master over the future of the European project."
"So, given the positioning of certain Member States, there is a real risk that this project will flounder."
"What dismays me the most is the attitude displayed by the European right as they were more than determined at the start of negotiations to drop out the minute the telephones began ringing from Heads of State or Government."
"Everyone will make their own mind up about the political consistency of such a reversal."
"I welcome the adoption, by a clear majority of votes, of the EU budget for 2011."
"The agreement reached between the European Parliament and the EU Council has allowed the use of a provisional budget to be avoided - something which could undermine pursuit of EU cohesion and agricultural policy."
"This is particularly good news for Polish local governments, farmers and business people, who in increasing numbers are making use of Union funds, because despite the economic crisis payments will rise by 2.91% compared to 2010."
"I am also pleased by the increase in resources for the priority areas adopted by Parliament, including youth, education, research and innovation."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the new budget and I am delighted that the European institutions have finally found some common ground."
"Through this vote, the European Parliament aims to provide the European Union with a stable budget, which can be introduced immediately in early 2011, thus avoiding having to use the system of provisional twelfths which would have threatened the implementation of many European policies."
"However, I do deplore the lack of flexibility that this new budget imposes as well as the choice made by certain political groups, especially the Socialists, to jeopardise ITER, the only fundamental long-term research project in which the European Union plays a leading role, by deferring the vote on its funding."
"By foregoing EUR 600 million of credits available to finance ITER against a backdrop of crisis where European public money is scarce, the Socialists have displayed their irresponsibility and inconsistency and are jeopardising a strategic project that creates jobs."
"I am pleased that despite the many complications, it has been possible to agree and adopt the EU budget for 2011 after the modifications made by the Council."
"This is very important, not only in view of the fact that a provisional budget has been avoided, but principally in view of the fact that we can be sure of the programming of expenditures related to cohesion policy, which is extremely important for the residents of the EU, and above all for the beneficiaries of Union funds."
"In addition, I would like to emphasise that resources for cohesion policy have been increased by 10%."
"It is important that we have reached a political agreement."
"In doing so we have demonstrated European solidarity, and this now gives us financial stability in 2011."
"Today I voted in favour of the 2011 budget."
"After lengthy negotiations, we have managed to reach an agreement that satisfies Parliament."
"Indeed, Parliament is waiting for the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon to be implemented."
"The treaty makes provision for our institution to be involved in negotiations on the next long-term budget and this change should be accepted at every level."
"Furthermore, Parliament wanted to maintain some reserves in the 2011 budget."
"A case in point is the sum of EUR 425 000, set aside in the 2011 budget for the European Police College (CEPOL), which can now only be released under certain conditions."
"The agency will therefore have to implement MEPs' recommendations following Parliament's refusal to endorse implementation of the agency's budget, so that a decision can be made on full allocation of the CEPOL budget in 2011."
"The 2011 budget, the first that Parliament has been entitled to scrutinise, has only gone to show what little power our assembly has."
"Not content with validating neoliberal counter-reforms and with working for the financial markets instead of for the citizens who elected them, it even goes so far as to capitulate in the name of urgency."
"I will not facilitate this despicable exercise with my vote."
"in writing. - (PT) After intense negotiations, it was finally possible to reach an agreement for the 2011 budget; it was not the ideal budget, but it is nevertheless a document that will enable the objectives proposed by the EU to be achieved."
"This community budget for 2011, adopted today in part-session, strengthens funding for the priorities defined by the European Parliament, such as education, innovation, and the peace process in the Middle East and Palestine."
"in writing. - Taking into account the countless number of bureaucrats in the European Parliament, as well as in the European Commission, this resolution brings the European Community closer to the well-considered and effective distribution of EC resources in the course of time."
"I have carefully examined other statements in the report and am glad to discover that certain persons in Parliament understand the need to use money in time, not when it is too late."
"I voted in favour."
"in writing. - (DE) As was the case with the last proposal to increase the budget for 2011, I have also had to oppose this one in the interests of the citizens of Europe."
"It is impossible to understand how the EU can afford to raise its budget when austerity programmes are being introduced all over Europe."
"The latest increase is justified on the grounds of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the new institutions that it has created, such as the European External Action Service."
"With great foresight the Freedom Party of Austria voted against the Treaty of Lisbon, which, while it brought a few benefits, primarily resulted in an increase in red tape and in costs for the citizens."
"Therefore, I have opposed the budget for 2011."
"I support the European Parliament's vote on Wednesday 15 December 2010, which adopted the 2011 budget during its sitting in Strasbourg following on from the debate which took place on Tuesday."
"The budget adopted includes increased funding for most of the priorities set out by Parliament, whilst respecting the global limits set by the Council."
"During this year's budgetary negotiations, my fellow Members of the European Parliament also entered into agreements with the Council and the Commission on a number of political demands concerning the budget."
"in writing. - (IT) The draft budget amended by the European Council does not fully reflect the needs and requirements outlined by Parliament, but the European Union cannot be left without an approved budget during the first few months of 2011."
"This is why, during the trilogue held on 6 December, the Commission, the Council and Parliament found the right compromise for a budget that may be implemented in full from the very beginning of the 2011 financial year."
"I voted in favour, because the responsible stance is consistent with Parliament's efforts to give citizens of the Union adequate financial resources, as confirmed by the approval of the joint statement on payment appropriations."
"I voted in favour of Parliament's resolution as I considered that, despite the draft budget amended by the Council not entirely satisfying the real need for a Union budget that is sustainable, coherent and effective, Parliament's objective of providing the Union with a budget that is able to be implemented in a full and predictable manner starting from the beginning of the financial year was achieved."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Parliament's resolution as I agreed that, although the draft budget amended by the Council does not entirely satisfy the real need for a Union budget that is sustainable, coherent and effective, Parliament's objective was to provide the Union with a budget that can be implemented in a full and predictable manner starting from the beginning of the financial year."
"It was a very special moment, last month, when all the political groups stepped up to the plate to achieve a political agreement, beyond the 2011 budget, on the future financing of the EU."
"So, after all the hullabaloo they caused during the negotiations, the three main political groups gave in on the final straight."
"The European Parliament, despite drawing on its new powers, has just passed up on the chance to impose itself in its role as a decision-maker on budgetary matters."
"The Belgian Prime Minister's letter shown to us by the Belgian Presidency and which guarantees that the Treaty will be respected (sic) and that Parliament will be involved with future discussions does not offer any guarantee for a good political outcome."
"Our vote against reflects this missed opportunity and the rendezvous clause that will follow."
"The best instrument for achieving this is, using the same method as the Convention, to bring together European and national parliaments, national governments and the European Commission."
"As for the ITER mega project, which requires and will continue to require extortionate levels of funds, we are not sorry that it has been deferred."
"We will again try and demonstrate the financial waste that it represents as soon as it is back on the table of the EP Committee on Budgets."
"We are about to approve the European Union budget for 2011, which is being done, for the first time, in accordance with the new regime of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I am pleased with the affirmation of the role of the European Parliament in this matter, and support the main priorities highlighted in the document that we are voting on today."
"In 2011, special attention needs to be paid to the theme of Youth, Education and Mobility, a priority that has been taken into account in all sections of the budget."
"We need to invest in our young people and in training for all European citizens, namely through the Lifelong Learning, Erasmus Mundus and Eures programmes."
"It is also essential to promote investment in research and innovation, and the role of SMEs as an engine for making our economy more dynamic."
"Considering the importance of the policy of cohesion as an overarching element of all European policies, I welcome its planned inclusion in the document that is key to the successful implementation of this policy."
"Because of the reasons set out and because I believe that the European Union is going through a period that requires more effort in terms of making Europe stronger and more competitive, while retaining the need to strengthen inter-institutional dialogue, I am voting in favour of this draft presented by Parliament."
"in writing. - (DE) I have voted in favour of the report."
"In its negotiations with the Council, Parliament has shown its teeth."
"Last year, in the context of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Council made significant concessions to Parliament."
"In this decision on the budget, Parliament has moved towards the Council's position."
"This compromise seems to be workable."
"in writing. - The 2011 budget has been decided in challenging and unstable times."
"At a time when we are seeing severe cuts being made to budgets in member states, it is now more important than ever to make sure Europe is providing the resources to deal with the effects of the crisis."
"The benefits of EU funding can be seen across my constituency, and provide help for those who will suffer because of the current 'slash and burn' policy being implemented in the UK."
"However, there are parts of this budget I cannot agree with."
"For example I do not think it is appropriate to vote in favour of wasteful agricultural subsidies and an increase in entertainment expenses."
"I believe it is important in these uncertain economic times to show restraint in spending."
"It is for this reason I chose to abstain on budget 2011."
"in writing. - Labour MEPs have voted against the budget package because, at a time when such severe cuts are being made to domestic public spending, we do not believe it is appropriate for the EU budget to increase."
"We certainly don't support the way that many governments are risking their economies by slashing public spending."
"But that does not mean we should automatically support an increase in overall spending by the European Union."
"The EU will be doing a lot of important work next year, in many cases providing support to those areas that will be hardest hit by domestic cuts."
"However, where new expenditure is required, we believe it would have been possible to find savings to free up money for important projects."
"Given the current pressure on domestic economies, these budget negotiations could have been an opportunity to persuade EU leaders to tackle wasteful EU expenditure in areas such as agricultural subsidies, which often undermine the economies of the very countries that the EU's international aid budget sets out to help."
"However, this budget package leaves those subsidies virtually untouched."
"Against this background, Labour MEPs could not support an increase in the EU budget."
"Given that the Netherlands has requested assistance in respect of 613 cases of redundancy that have occurred in two companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 46 (wholesale trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles) in the NUTS Level 2 region of Northern Holland in the Netherlands, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the European Commission's proposal and with the respective amendments made by the European Parliament."
"I also agree that the functioning and added value of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should be evaluated in the context of the general assessment of the programmes and various other instruments created by the Inter-Institutional Agreement of 17 May 2006, within the framework of the 2007-2013 multi-annual financial framework mid-term review process."
"in writing. - (PT) Assistance to workers made redundant due to restructuring and relocation should be dynamic and flexible so that it can be implemented rapidly and effectively."
"In the light of structural changes in international trade, it is important that the European economy is quickly able to implement instruments for supporting workers affected by such changes whilst also giving them the skills required to return swiftly to the labour market."
"Financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis."
"It is also important to emphasise that this assistance is not a substitute for the responsibilities that normally lies with the companies, nor is it intended for the financing and restructuring of companies."
"Bearing in mind that the Netherlands submitted a request for assistance in relation to 613 cases of redundancy that have occurred in two companies within Division 18 (wholesale trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles) of NACE Rev. 2 in the region of Northern Holland, I am voting in favour of this Report or, to put it another way, in favour of mobilising the EGF to support the Netherlands."
"The financial and economic crisis that we are going through, combined with the constant changes on the labour market caused by alterations to the structure of international trade, have resulted in countless victims of unemployment which, in many cases, is long term."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was created to respond to situations like these."
"In this case we are talking about the mobilisation of little more than two million, five hundred thousand euros for the Netherlands to support 613 cases of redundancy in two commercial and retail companies between 1 May 2009 and 31 January 2010."
"Given that the Commission believed this application to be appropriate when it considered it and to meet the requirements laid down, and therefore recommends that the request be approved, I voted in favour."
"in writing. - (PT) Given the social impact of the world economic crisis, which has had a particular effect on employment, the proper use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European citizens and families, contributing to their social reintegration and professional development, while at the same time providing new resources that meet the needs of companies and boost the economy."
"It is in this context that this intervention plan for the Netherlands is being put forward, in relation to 613 redundancies that have occurred within two companies operating within division 46 of NACE Rev. 2 (wholesale trade, except motor vehicles and motorcycles) within the NUTS Level 2 region of North Holland, in the Netherlands."
"I therefore hope that the European institutions will strengthen their commitment to implementing measures to speed up and improve the rates for use of such an important resource as the EGF, which currently has very low levels of mobilisation."
"This year, only 11% of the 500 million euros available has been requested."
"in writing. - (PT) The EU is an area of solidarity and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a part of this."
"This support is essential in helping the unemployed and victims of the relocation of firms that occurs in an era of globalisation."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of lower labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF aims to help workers who are victims of the relocation of businesses and it is crucial in facilitating access to new employment."
"The EGF has been used in the past by other EU countries, so it is appropriate to provide aid to the Netherlands, which has submitted a request for mobilisation of the EGF in respect of 613 redundancies that have occurred within two companies operating within division 46 of NACE Rev. 2 (wholesale trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles) within the NUTS Level 2 region of North Holland, in the Netherlands."
"in writing. - (DE) Employees who have lost their jobs as a result of the financial and economic crisis should be given the opportunity to return quickly to the world of work."
"The Member States are obliged to take appropriate measures to support these people."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund provides funding for this purpose which the Member States can apply for."
"I am voting in favour of the report, as the mobilisation of the fund by the Netherlands is fully justified and all the criteria have been met."
"in writing. - (PT) Given that the Netherlands has requested assistance in respect of 613 cases of redundancy that have occurred in two companies operating within division 46 of NACE Rev. 2 (wholesale trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles) in the NUTS Level 2 region of Northern Holland in the Netherlands, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the European Commission's proposal and with the respective amendments to it tabled by the European Parliament."
"I also agree that:"
"the EGF should support the individual reintegration of redundant workers into employment, and I would like to reiterate that assistance from the EGF should not replace measures which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor should it finance the restructuring of companies or sectors;"
"the operation and added value of the EGF should be evaluated in the context of the general assessment of the programmes and various other instruments created by the Inter-Institutional Agreement of 17 May 2006;"
"I welcome the proposal of the European Commission to establish a source of funds other than unused ESF resources, in order to respond to the repeated statements by the European Parliament that it is necessary to identify appropriate budgetary mechanisms for the transfer of funds given that the EGF was set up to be a specific and separate instrument with its own aims and funding periods."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur Mrs Matera, who is pleased to observe that the Commission keeps identifying alternative sources of payment appropriations to unused European Social Fund resources, in accordance with the frequent requests in the past from the European Parliament."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that the alternatives chosen in the last cases (budgets line dedicated to the support of entrepreneurship and innovation) are not satisfactory given the severe shortcomings that the Commission encounters when implementing the programmes on competitiveness and innovation."
"In a period of economic crisis these appropriations should be in fact rather increased."
"The rapporteur invites therefore the Commission to continue in her effort to identify more appropriate budget lines for payments in the future."
"in writing. - (PT) The request submitted by the Netherlands for assistance under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in relation to 613 redundancies that occurred within two companies operating within division 46 (wholesale trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles) of NACE Rev. 2 within the NUTS II region of North Holland fulfils all the legally established eligibility criteria."
"Indeed, under Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and Council, of 18 June 2009, which amended Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and Council on 20 December 2006 and established the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the scope of the EGF was temporarily widened as it was expected to be able intervene in situations like this if, as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis, there are 'at least 500 redundancies over a period of nine months, particularly in small or medium-sized enterprises, within a level 2 division of NACE in one region or two contiguous regions at NUTS Level 2'."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, and I hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will contribute to the successful integration of these workers into the labour market."
"in writing. - With this vote, the EP: (1) calls on the institutions involved to take the necessary action to accelerate the mobilisation of the EGF; (2) recalls the institutions' commitment to ensuring a smooth and rapid procedure for the adoption of the decisions on the mobilisation of the EGF, providing one-off, time-limited individual support geared to helping workers who have suffered redundancies as a result of globalisation and the financial and economic crisis and emphasises the role that the EGF can play in the reintegration of workers made redundant into the labour market; (3) stresses that, in accordance with Article 6 of the EGF Regulation, it should be ensured that the EGF supports the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment and reiterates that assistance from the EGF must not replace either actions which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, or measures restructuring companies or sectors."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for the European Parliament Resolution on the mobilisation of the European Global Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the workers in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector, made redundant in the Noord Holland region of the Netherlands."
"Europe's ICT sector has been hit by both the global financial and economic crisis and the structural changes in the global IT market, especially due to the relocation of production to China and India, also reflected by the ICT 5 indicator."
"The ICT 5 indicator is a summary of the main research results linked to the business cycle, costs and budgets allocated to the ICT sector."
"This indicator for Western Europe has fallen from a value of approximately 160 in August 2008 to approximately 30 in April 2009."
"The Netherlands has prepared a coordinated package of personalised services for the 613 workers made redundant from two businesses belonging to the company Randstad, such as offering guidance on the transition from one job to another, setting up mobility centres, placing staff made redundant, providing professional training and researching employability."
"The total budget required is EUR 3 934 055 and the Netherlands submitted an application on 8 April 2010 to obtain a financial contribution of EUR 2 557 135 from the EGF."
"in writing. - (DE) I have voted in favour of the draft report."
"Once again we are able to help EU citizens, who have been made redundant after their company got into difficulties, to find new jobs."
"in writing. - (DE) This application is just one of a large number of applications from the Netherlands which we have recently approved in the Committee on Budgets."
"Of course, I have voted in favour of Mrs Matera's report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to support citizens in Noord Holland who have been made redundant."
"The purpose of the EGF is to make funding available to help individual citizens who have lost their jobs as a result of globalisation."
"During the budget negotiations over the last few weeks, the Government of the Netherlands has excelled itself with its stubborn response to the legitimate positions taken by the European Parliament, which is always ready to compromise."
"At this point, I would like to say that it seems to be compatible with the national perspective on politics to apply for tens of millions of euros in EU aid, on the one hand, and to refuse to have a legitimate discussion on the points put forward by Parliament, on the other hand."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that in the EU there needs to be enhanced cooperation in the area of the law applicable to divorce or legal separation."
"I believe that EU regulation in this field should be universal."
"In other words, based on its global rules on conflicts of law, it can be determined that any law is applicable - that of participating Member States, non-participating Member States or non-EU Member States."
"The Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is assured, therefore in order to allow the spouses to choose an applicable law with which they have a close connection or, in the absence of such choice, in order that that law might apply to their divorce or legal separation, the law in question should apply even if it is not that of a participating Member State."
"Increasing the mobility of citizens calls for more flexibility and greater legal certainty, which the new EU regulation can enhance."
"The need to establish a clear, comprehensive legal framework on the law applicable to divorce and legal separation arises out of an urgent need to address the problems that arise in the case of 'international' divorces."
"Until now, the disparities in national rules have not favoured the safeguarding of equal opportunities between spouses and neither have they protected the best interests of the children involved."
"On the contrary, they have helped to encourage the so-called 'rush to court'."
"As the European Parliament Mediator for children contested by parents of different nationalities and based on experience gained during the work I have carried out, I support this proposal for a regulation to create legal certainty for the couples concerned and guarantee predictability and flexibility."
"One of the innovative ideas contained in the text of the regulation is the possibility of consulting a family mediator before, during and after the divorce proceedings."
"This is not only because this individual is of great help in informing the couple about the various forms and conditions of divorce and resolving any differences between them, but also because it protects the rights of children involved, helping them to make appropriate and amicable choices to protect the welfare of their offspring."
"When it comes to improving coherence between European rules on matrimonial matters, it is tricky getting 27 to agree on this matter."
"Fortunately, since the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam, Member States which so wish can come together to make progress in a specific field, through 'enhanced cooperation', in such a way that a core of leading States can be set up to move the Union forward."
"The problems encountered by spouses in having their status recognised across Europe, particularly during a divorce or legal separation, have led certain States to come together to improve the coordination of national regulations."
"I am really keen that this enhanced cooperation, in which France wishes to be involved, should be implemented."
"In my opinion, this initiative is in the interests of bringing Europeans together, in an area that concerns us all, and in which legal certainty is of the essence."
"I have therefore voted for the proposed regulation implementing this enhanced cooperation."
"In the future, such enforced cooperation must be used as often as is necessary."
"I voted in favour of this report because the purpose of the regulation is to create legal security for couples belonging to different Member States, who wish to separate or divorce, guaranteeing them predictability and flexibility."
"In this respect, the initiative adopted has been a step forward, but it is regrettable, firstly, that the opportunity has been lost to extend the scope of application to the recognition of marriages, annulments, custody of children and inheritance."
"It also does not cover the existence of other types of unions such as those of homosexual couples, which are recognised in some Member States."
"Secondly, it is also regrettable that only 15 out of the 27 Member States are prepared to sign up to this enhanced cooperation, which will be detrimental to the citizens of the countries that do not do so."
"It is therefore my hope and wish that, in the future, the scope of application can be extended, and the number of countries subscribing to this enhanced cooperation can be increased: they owe it to the citizens that they represent."
"I voted in favour of this European Parliament report on enhanced cooperation in the area of the law applicable to divorce and legal separation, because a clear and explicit legal basis must be established, according to which rules would be applied related to the applicable law."
"I would like to point out that one of the European Union's main objectives is to maintain and develop an area of freedom, security and justice, in which freedom of movement of persons is guaranteed."
"The legal situation at European level regarding the law applicable to the divorce and legal separation of spouses of different nationalities is currently very confusing, because it is unclear which law should be applied."
"This often leads to a 'rush to court' where one of the spouses files for divorce before the other one does in order to ensure that the proceeding is governed by a given law which he or she regards as more favourable to his or her own interests."
"I would like to stress that the new regulation proposed should create legal certainty for the couples concerned and guarantee predictability and flexibility."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Zwiefka for drawing up this report, which I support."
"The aim of this measure is to establish a clear, comprehensive legal framework in the legislation applicable to divorce and legal separation, by allowing the parties a certain degree of autonomy."
"The diversified nature of these rules in the Member States may, in fact, create problems in the case of 'international' divorces."
"Indeed, as well as the legal uncertainty over the identification of the laws applicable in each individual case, there may also be a 'rush to court' to ensure that the proceeding is governed by a given law which better protects one of the two spouses."
"The European Union must therefore limit these risks and shortcomings by introducing the possibility of choosing the applicable law by mutual agreement between the parties."
"I therefore agree with the need to ensure the parties fair and accurate information that allows them to be aware of their choices as soon as possible."
"Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Member States may now work in enhanced cooperation in the area of freedom, security and justice, and more specifically on matters of divorce and legal separation."
"This regulation defines enhanced cooperation between certain Member States (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Spain)."
"The main objective of this is to rule out any discrimination on the grounds of sex, to guarantee equal opportunities for both spouses, and to give central priority to the welfare of the children."
"Spouses often 'compete' over which one of them is the first to apply for divorce in order to ensure that the divorce proceedings are governed by a law which best protects the interests of the relevant party."
"The purpose of this regulation is to improve legal certainty for the couples concerned, and at the same time, to guarantee the predictability and flexibility of the proceedings."
"I supported the regulation, even when it does not currently affect the Czech Republic."
"On the whole, I believe that the introduction of this regulation will set a good example for other Member States, including the Czech Republic."
"In future, other Member States would be able to sign up to the regulation and benefit from the experience of the pioneering Member States."
"This proposal does not seek to harmonise the substantive law applicable to divorce and legal separation, but to establish harmonised rules for resolving international jurisdictional conflicts."
"What this means is that we need to work within the framework of international private law and not within the substantive framework of family law, wherein each State will continue to have its own laws."
"This is why it is important to remember, for example, that the proposed regulation, through the amendment of Article 7.º-A, does not require a State to recognise as a marriage - even if only to ensure its dissolution - an act that is not considered as such by its national legislation, or which would be contrary to the principle of subsidiarity."
"However, this will not be able to limit the rights of people whose unions are not recognised within a State, a point on which a compromise solution needs to be found."
"In the light of the above, I can only see the provision for greater legal certainty with regard to the resolution of conflicts of international jurisdiction within the context of family law, most especially with regard to the dissolution of marriage and legal separation, as an important step for constructing an environment of freedom and justice, in which the freedom of movement of people is a reality."
"in writing. - (PT) I am delighted with the adoption of this report, which should enable couples, from different Member States or residing in another country that is not their own, to choose the law that should apply to their divorce."
"There were one million divorces granted in the EU during 2007, 13% of which involved couples consisting of partners of different nationalities."
"During these proceedings, European citizens were faced with legal problems affecting their separation."
"I would point out that Portugal is taking part in the process of enhanced cooperation that would enable advances to made on this issue, blocked in the Council."
"I would emphasise the need for this report not to result in a Member State being required to recognise as a marriage - even if solely for the purposes of its dissolution - a situation that is not considered as such by the legislation of that State, or which would be contrary to the principle of subsidiarity."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for dealing so thoroughly with such a difficult subject as the issue of the choice of law applicable to divorce and legal separation."
"Just how delicate a matter this is can be seen by the fact that Rome III is the first example in the EU's history of enhanced cooperation conducted in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Treaties."
"The territorial range of force of the regulation will, therefore, be restricted to 14 out of the 27 EU Member States."
"Poland is not among them."
"I think that by introducing a principle which enables parties to choose the law applicable in divorce, Rome III will contribute to greater legal predictability and certainty."
"However, taking into account the restricted scope of this regulation - it will concern only the law applicable on the matter of international divorce - it is also essential to answer the question as to which court has jurisdiction to decide in a particular case."
"This problem is the subject of another EU regulation - Brussels IIa."
"Therefore, like the rapporteur, I think it is essential for this regulation to be revised as quickly as possible in order to introduce the forum necessitatis rule."
"This will dispel the fears of many Member States concerning whether their courts will be forced to decide on the divorces of couples whom their legal system does not regard as being married, which in turn will encourage them to adopt general European principles in the field of international divorce, and this will undoubtedly make life easier for many EU citizens."
"If two people of different nationalities or simply two people who no longer reside in the same Member State are planning to divorce, they should know which court has jurisdiction and in which country."
"From now on, these two divorcing people will soon be in a position to choose which European Union legal system will govern their divorce."
"Another very specific step forward in the gradual creation of a 'common European legal space', which is directly applicable in the day-to-day lives of each of us."
"While I welcome the adoption of this report and the use for the first time of what is called the enhanced cooperation procedure, I do regret that this procedure needed to be used and that no agreement could be reached between all the EU Member States."
"I do hope that other Member States will be part of this cooperation soon."
"The Czech Republic is represented in the European Parliament."
"The Czech Republic did not sign up to the mechanism for enhanced cooperation in the area of compatibility of the rules applicable concerning conflict of laws."
"This is because the Czech Republic does not feel that the proposal for a regulation is a necessary measure for the proper functioning of the internal market."
"Similarly, the Czech Republic finds the regulation questionable in light of the principle of subsidiarity, since it does not offer any added value that would justify its infringement on the Member States' national family law provisions."
"The Czech Republic also considers the proposal to be questionable in light of the principle of proportionality, since the chosen legal form of the regulation is not a suitable tool for ensuring the compatibility of rules on conflict of laws in the area of international family law."
"However, having said that, it is not my intention that my vote should stop those States which have opted for enhanced cooperation as a tool for ensuring the compatibility of rules on conflict of laws, with respect to determining the applicable law in matrimonial matters, from taking this route."
"The proposal for a regulation on enhanced cooperation in the area of the law applicable to divorce and legal separation helps to address the commonly occurring complex and sensitive issues that are associated with divorce proceedings for valid marriages, which are entered into by people of different nationalities."
"It makes things clearer for the divorcing couple and allows them to choose the applicable law."
"It also significantly increases their legal certainty right from the outset."
"As the adopted legislation goes beyond the Acquis communautaire, the application of the mechanism for enhanced cooperation is a step which allows participating Member States to deal with some of the legislative problems of international cooperation associated with the break-up of these kinds of marriages."
"It gives other Member States, which are not taking part at this stage, sufficient opportunity to evaluate the positive and negative effects of this proposal for a regulation over time and to consider signing up to it."
"For several years, and in several duly justified cases, it has been foreign law which has applied in such divorce proceedings in the Czech Republic."
"in writing. - (PT) The new regulation will enable international couples (couples with different nationalities, couples who live in different countries or couples who live together in a different country to their country of origin) to choose the national law to be applicable to their divorce, provided that one of the partners has a connection with the country in question, for example, habitual residence or nationality."
"The new rules also clarify the law that is applicable in the case of there being no agreement between the partners."
"The new regulation will enable, for example, a Spanish/Portuguese couple living in Belgium to choose whether the law to be applicable to their divorce should be Portuguese, Spanish or Belgian."
"in writing. - Divorce is a serious matter. Quite often it involves broken dishes and divided properties."
"I sincerely admire the idealism of the rapporteur, Tadeusz Zwiefka."
"What happens if the German husband wants to be divorced in Germany, but his wife wants to be divorced in Sicily because her mother is Sicilian?"
"How do you divide a vacuum cleaner and a washing machine if there is no agreement?"
"The idea is good, but it needs to be polished."
"90% of divorces are tragedy and scandal."
"I am 'in favour', but let us look at details when considering this kind of document."
"We need a law, not rules."
"in writing. - (DE) Separation and divorce are always difficult matters and involve a whole series of legal consequences."
"Everything becomes particularly problematic when the husband and wife come from different countries."
"We have been looking for a solution within the European Union, but we have only been able to agree on an enhanced cooperation procedure, which makes the situation only slightly easier for those affected, in other words, the couples from different EU Member States who are divorcing."
"The scope of this procedure has not been specified and, therefore, is also not entirely clear."
"Of course, cooperation does not mean that judgments, like those in the case of divorce, must be recognised in a Member State where there is no legal provision for doing so."
"Equally, the procedure must not offer an opportunity to force Member States to recognise same-sex partnerships via the back door."
"Equally little attention has been paid to the rights of parents in the case of cross-border separations."
"For this reason, I have abstained from voting."
"I voted in favour of the report because I believe it is necessary to establish a clear and comprehensive legal framework on the law applicable to divorce and legal separation."
"For the first time, with the introduction of Article 3a, the spouses are given an opportunity to designate the law applicable to the divorce proceedings by mutual agreement."
"I also believe that we should ensure that the decision made by the parties is an informed one, in other words that both spouses have been duly informed about the practical consequences of their decision."
"In this regard, it is necessary to ensure that the information is accurate and complete."
"I think it is important to protect the couple's relationship so that the act of separation can take place in a clear, transparent and consensual manner between both parties, who thus become decision-makers of equal authority."
"Portugal is taking part, together with 13 other EU countries (Spain, Italy, Hungary, Luxemburg, Austria, Romania, Slovenia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Belgium, Latvia and Malta) in the first enhanced cooperation trial in the history of the EU."
"This enhanced cooperation is being applied in the area of the law applicable to divorce and the legal separation of people and property."
"I voted in favour of this report relating to the Regulation, which establishes clear rules on the procedure for international couples (where the spouses are of different nationalities) seeking a divorce or a legal separation of people or property in their countries of origin or residence."
"This is a fully consensual issue that will make the lives of a number of Europeans easier."
"It is also a symbolic moment, being the first time that enhanced cooperation between EU Member States has been applied."
"The aim of these provisions is to strengthen legal certainty and predictability with regard to divorce and the legal separation of people and property."
"The agreement only provides for the harmonisation of conflict situations, and not for the harmonisation of basic national rules."
"One of the European Union's main objectives is to maintain and develop an area of freedom, security and justice, in which freedom of movement of persons is guaranteed."
"The legal situation at European level regarding the law applicable to the divorce and legal separation of spouses of different nationalities is currently very confusing."
"This often leads to a 'rush to court' where one of the spouses applies for divorce before the other one does in order to ensure that the proceeding is governed by a given law which he or she regards as more favourable to his or her own interests."
"The purpose of the proposal for a regulation is to create legal certainty for the couples concerned and guarantee predictability and flexibility."
"I am therefore bound to agree with the rapporteur, Mr Zwiefka, who supports the substance of the rules for determining the law applicable to divorce and legal separation."
"in writing. - (RO) Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece (withdrew its request on 3 March 2010), Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Austria, Portugal, Romania and Slovenia submitted a request to the Commission indicating that they intended to establish enhanced cooperation between themselves in the area of applicable law in matrimonial matters and invited the Commission to present a proposal on this to the Council."
"Citizens' ever-increasing mobility requires, on the one hand, more flexibility and, on the other hand, greater legal certainty In order to achieve this objective, this regulation must enhance the parties' autonomy in the areas of divorce and legal separation by giving spouses the opportunity to choose the law applicable to their divorce or legal separation."
"The regulation will apply only to the dissolution of the marriage or cessation of marital obligations (legal separation) and will not apply to matters relating to the legal capacity of natural persons, the existence, validity or recognition of a marriage, the annulment of a marriage, the name of the spouses, the property consequences of the marriage, parental responsibility, maintenance obligations, trusts or successions, even if they arise merely as a preliminary question within the context of divorce or legal separation proceedings."
"in writing. - (PT) The development of an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of people is guaranteed, represents one of the most fundamental objectives of the European Union."
"I therefore welcome this proposal, which introduces greater legal security with regard to identifying the law applicable to national divorces and separations, and would like to see other Member States join efforts to achieve compatibility in the national rules on legal conflicts in this area."
"in writing. - This text sets out to solve problems such as the following."
"A and B are nationals of different Member States who entered into a same-sex marriage in one of the Member States which have introduced legislation to permit such marriages."
"They have been habitually resident for three years in a Member State which does not permit same-sex marriages but participated in the adoption of the regulation on applicable law under the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"A and B wish to dissolve their marriage."
"Under the rules of Regulation No 2201/2003 on jurisdiction, the only courts having jurisdiction in those circumstances are the courts of the Member State in which they are habitually resident."
"This is patently not fair on the couple concerned, who would be put to a considerable amount of inconvenience and loss of time in order to bring their divorce proceedings within the jurisdiction of another court."
"in writing. - (SV) When the European Parliament voted today on the proposal for a Council regulation implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the law applicable to divorce and legal separation, I chose to abstain from the vote."
"In my opinion, family law, such as the regulation of divorces, is an area where the principle of subsidiarity should be upheld and where every Member State should make its own decisions."
"The cooperation that the report discusses is voluntary for the Member States of the EU and, as things currently stand, there are 14 countries taking part."
"Sweden is not one of them."
"In my opinion, it is not entirely appropriate for me, as a Swedish MEP, to adopt a position on legislation that relates solely to a form of cooperation that Sweden is not involved in."
"in writing. - (DE) With 16 million marriages between partners of different nationalities in the EU, of which an estimated 140 000 end in divorce every year, negotiations and an agreement on this question are essential in order to guarantee the necessary legal certainty for citizens."
"After numerous initiatives in this area have been vetoed by individual Member States, the enhanced cooperation procedure has now given at least 14 countries the opportunity to put in place the necessary criteria."
"I voted in favour of this report because the world financial crisis, to which the credit rating agencies contributed in part, has demonstrated the need to introduce a mechanism for the classification and supervision of credit rating agencies."
"I agree with this report in its encouragement of the creation, at a European level, of a system for the registration and supervision of credit rating agencies that issue ratings used within the EU, and its consideration of conditions for the use within the EU of ratings issued by agencies in third countries."
"The agreement reached on the European supervisory architecture, which will come into force on 1 January 2011, now makes the effective application of supervision to these agencies possible."
"It is essential that, from its inception, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is in a position to exercise its powers so as to ensure the vigorous supervision of credit rating agencies active within the EU, as well as those from third countries whose ratings are authorised within the EU, in full cooperation with their national authorities."
"I also welcome the fact that the US has also decided to draw up stricter supervision rules in this area, given that the Commission is also considering working towards further international harmonisation."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that there is a need to set up a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies."
"The global financial crisis, to which the credit rating agencies made their contribution, had an influence on this initiative."
"I agree with the European Commission's proposal to organise the accreditation and supervision of credit rating agencies by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)."
"However, it is vital for the ESMA, as soon as it is established, to be in a position to exercise its remit to ensure sound supervision of credit rating agencies operating in the European Union and also third-country agencies whose ratings will be authorised in the European Union."
"In principle, credit rating agencies issue independent opinions on the creditworthiness of an entity, a debt, a financial obligation or a finance instrument."
"However, these agencies' opinions can sometimes seriously impact the economy of the country whose financial regularity they are rating."
"In 2009, the Union adopted Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 which aims to regulate the activities of agencies to protect investors and European financial markets against the risk of malpractice."
"It sets the conditions for issuing credit ratings as well as the rules governing the registration and supervision of credit rating agencies."
"Meanwhile, a report issued by an expert panel concluded that the framework for supervision needs to be improved to reduce the risk of future financial crises and their severity."
"The European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA') regulation established the European Supervisory Authority ."
"To ensure that this authority runs smoothly and is properly integrated into the overall framework of financial regulation, it became necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009."
"I voted for this report, as it improves control over credit rating agencies."
"Based on the report by my excellent colleague and friend Jean-Paul Gauzès from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I voted for the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the 2009 regulation on credit rating agencies and granting the all-new European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) supervisory powers over these entities."
"I support the improvements offered by the rapporteur, particularly the transfer of new powers to ESMA which the Commission intended to keep for itself in particular with regard to penalties."
"I believe it is important that ESMA can delegate part of its functions to the national authorities."
"I regret that no mention is made (albeit this regulatory amendment is probably not the right medium) on the matter of rating States and the specific supervision which ought to be in place when rating States."
"I propose the creation of a European public agency for rating States which would guarantee the necessary technicality and independence."
"in writing. - (LT) The global financial crisis showed the need to set up a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies."
"There is a need for EU-wide joint oversight of credit rating agencies and integrated supervision of them."
"I approved of this important document."
"2009 saw the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies."
"It made it possible to establish a European system for registering and supervising credit rating agencies which issue ratings used in the European Union."
"It also lays down the conditions for the use in the European Union of ratings issued by third-country agencies."
"There needs to be a reliable supervisory and control system and I therefore support the proposed amendments which will strengthen the European Securities and Markets Authority."
"This institution must be introduced into the supervision of credit rating agencies operating in the EU and effectively exercise its remit."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report because the economic and financial crisis that has affected the whole world showed the need to set up a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies."
"For this reason the European Commission presented a proposal to organise the accreditation and supervision of credit rating agencies by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)."
"Importantly, this authority will be endowed with its own supervisory powers, but also investigatory powers, and it will be able to punish failure to apply this Regulation."
"I agree with the European Parliament's position that there is a need for EU-wide joint oversight of credit rating agencies' products and integrated supervision of them."
"Furthermore, Parliament suggests focusing on the introduction of the ESMA into the supervision of agencies and on the definition of its new tasks and new powers."
"It is vital for the ESMA, as soon as it is established, to be in a position to exercise its remit to ensure sound supervision of credit rating agencies operating in the European Union and also third-country agencies whose ratings will be authorised in the European Union."
"I abstained in the vote on the report on credit rating agencies."
"These rating agencies openly serve the interests of international speculators."
"They have played a negative role since the beginning of the crisis and they continue to do so."
"Their targeted and arbitrary downgrading of countries' credit ratings, both inside and outside the EU, send those countries into a vicious circle of speculation and borrowing."
"The increase in spreads increases countries' financial problems and enriches the markets at their expense."
"In the euro area in particular, the role and practices of credit rating agencies also has a negative effect on the stability of the euro."
"The EU bears serious political responsibility, having granted them the right to rate both companies and the economies of the Member States."
"I believe that effective measures need to be taken immediately to put an end to the speculative nature of rating agencies and, consequently, to radically amend Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009."
"The report contains some positive but, unfortunately, weak proposals and only takes timid steps in this direction."
"in writing. - (PT) The need to move towards this change derives from the need to adapt Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 to the new European supervisory architecture, and from the introduction of a new mechanism for the centralisation of the operations of rating agencies."
"To this end, the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority - ESMA) will be given its own powers of supervision, investigation and for the application of sanctions."
"We must now ensure that ESMA is in a position to exercise its powers and to ensure the vigorous supervision of credit rating agencies active within the European Union, as well as those from third countries whose ratings are authorised within the European Union."
"This report is a technical amendment to the existing directive, and it will confer powers on the new supervisory authority, EMSA, from January 2011 onwards."
"We must remember that it is expected that there will be a more comprehensive improvement of the credit rating agencies in the spring of 2011."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the activity of credit rating agencies is, in theory, already supervised and regulated at European level."
"But has this called into question the domination of the three American agencies which call all the shots on the European markets, sovereign debt and hence the rates at which European States can borrow?"
"I am afraid not."
"This did not stop Standard & Poor, again quite recently, from threatening to downgrade Belgium's rating, nor Moody's from threatening Spain nor Fitch Ireland."
"None of these agencies has been penalised, neither by their customers nor by their reputation being tarnished, for not having done their work properly during the Enron or subprime crises."
"They are now claiming to have a political role: the threat against Belgium is an attempt to force the constitution of a government; the absence of threat against France to artificially prevent the fragmentation of the euro area."
"The truth is that they only have power because the markets are not regulated, and your texts, which I have however voted for, will not do much to improve things."
"The regulation covers both the supervision of credit rating agencies by the European Securities and Markets Authority and supervision of the use of credit ratings by individual entities supervised at national level."
"The national supervisory authorities will remain responsible for supervising the use of credit ratings by these individual entities."
"However, the national authorities will not have powers to take supervisory measures against credit rating agencies in breach of the regulation."
"This is the very point on which the proposal is being examined in terms of compliance with the principle of proportionality."
"The proposal creates a control system but, within the context of the current neoliberal environment, there is no provision for real, essential application of it; it is merely a psychologically novel action directly mainly at the public at large."
"It is not designed to replace a previous system; it is designed to introduce a new control system which has not previously existed, even in this form, which is what allowed the credit rating agencies to steam ahead regardless in the first place."
"In this sense, it is perhaps better to have this system than none at all."
"I voted in favour of the report on the introduction of centralised supervision of credit rating agencies."
"I am in complete agreement with the content of Mr Gauzès' report on the proposal for a regulation which sets out a model for the centralised supervision of credit rating agencies by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), especially given the significant mobility of services provided by credit rating agencies and their instantaneous impact on the financial markets."
"Centralised supervision could lead to increased transparency in the world of credit rating agencies and could promote greater competition between the different agencies."
"That is the reason why I voted in favour of the report."
"However, I am concerned that the proposed period during which all the changes regarding the transfer of competencies and duties from the relevant supervisory bodies in the Member States to ESMA is too short, and so I think it should be extended."
"I approved of this report because the global financial crisis, to which the credit rating agencies made their contribution, showed the need to set up a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies."
"This was the purpose behind the adoption, in 2009, of the Regulation on credit rating agencies."
"It made it possible to establish a European system for registering and supervising credit rating agencies which issue ratings used in the European Union."
"It also lays down the conditions for the use in the European Union of ratings issued by third-country agencies."
"The agreement reached on the architecture of European supervision which will enter into force on 1 January 2011 provides that the ESMA will exercise its own supervisory powers in relation, in particular, to credit rating agencies."
"It is therefore necessary to amend the Regulation on credit rating agencies in order to organise the accreditation and supervision of credit rating agencies by the European Securities and Markets Authority."
"This authority will be endowed with its own supervisory powers, but also investigatory powers, and it will be able to punish failure to apply this Regulation."
"Fines will be levied by the Member States."
"A mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies is necessary."
"We must take note of the fact that credit rating agencies contributed, in part, to the crisis."
"In 2011 we will receive a proposal from the Commission in relation to various supplementary measures concerning ratings, and introducing such measures will be possible after adoption of this report."
"The above considerations persuaded me to endorse the report, which I did as an expression of my conviction that it will enter into force quickly and we will see positive results."
"Private credit rating agencies have been given new rights to set the standards and promises of delegation of power from the public authorities."
"Their dependence on private partners knows no limit."
"Nor does their arbitrary nature."
"The public authorities have given up."
"It is shameful."
"in writing. - (PT) There is a need to move towards this change so that Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 can be adapted to the new European supervisory architecture and so that a new mechanism for the centralisation of the operations of rating agencies can be introduced."
"Thus the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority - ESMA) will be given its own powers of supervision, investigation and for the application of sanctions."
"It is essential that ESMA is in a position to exercise its powers and to ensure the vigorous supervision of credit rating agencies active within the European Union."
"in writing. - (ES) I was not able to support this report, as although I am in favour of many of the points included and of the general propositions of increased transparency and improved information and supervision for credit agencies and other financial entities, this proposal will serve the interests of investors, who are professionals far removed from what has been described as the 'real economy', since it gives them greater legal security."
"Therefore, although I believe it is necessary, as this proposal states, to work hard to achieve transparency and the right to clear information in the financial system, I believe it is more necessary to put an end to financial speculation and work to achieve regulation that will place the financial markets under the supervision of the Member States."
"This report works towards transparency, information and a degree of supervision of financial agents, but it does so cautiously and from a pro-capitalist perspective that seeks to please the financial industry, which I neither share not support."
"in writing. - It is a very important instrument to inform EU citizens about the situation in the companies and banks, but also to compare the competitiveness of different brands and articles."
"I voted in favour."
"I also hope that in future this regulation will be completed by control of the rates of political parties and the mass media in order to prevent the manipulation of public opinion for money."
"The credit rating agencies do not work hard in getting the information and analysing it."
"They are ready to show the convenient result to those who pay."
"All those who are manipulating public opinion and thus betraying society deserve severe punishment."
"in writing. - (DE) More than anything else the financial crisis has made it clear to us that credit rating agencies have a dangerous monopoly and that their evaluations are not always adequate and are sometimes highly risky."
"Therefore, it is important to set up a mechanism for monitoring and supervising rating agencies."
"As they form part of a highly complex system of financial markets, the decision was made to introduce a double system for this purpose."
"In addition, the report lays down the conditions under which ratings issued by third-country agencies can be used in the European Union."
"It is, of course, essential for the supervisory system to allow sanctions to be imposed."
"The future will show to what extent these will actually be applied."
"The fact that several EU supervisory bodies have now been set up, involving increased administration and costs, is not a good thing for European taxpayers."
"I have taken this into account when voting."
"I voted in favour of Parliament's resolution as I agree that:"
"the registration and permanent supervision of credit rating agencies within the Union should be the sole responsibility of the European Supervisory Authority (ESA), namely the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which should have exclusive powers to sign cooperation agreements on the exchange of information with the relevant authorities in third countries;"
"the ESA (ESMA) should be responsible for the registration and permanent supervision of credit rating agencies, with the right to seek, by means of a simple request or a decision, all of the information that it needs from credit rating agencies, individuals involved in credit rating activities, organisations that are the subject of rating and third parties linked to them, third parties to which credit rating agencies have subcontracted any operational tasks, and individuals of any other kind that are closely and substantively linked to credit rating agencies or activities;"
"that the registration of a credit rating agency agreed by a relevant authority should be valid throughout the entire Union following the transfer of supervisory powers from the relevant authorities to ESA (ESMA)."
"The global financial crisis, to which the credit rating agencies made their contribution, showed the need to set up a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies."
"This was the purpose behind the adoption, in 2009, of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies."
"It made it possible to establish a European system for registering and supervising credit rating agencies which issue ratings used in the European Union."
"It also lays down the conditions for the use in the European Union of ratings issued by third-country agencies, by applying a double system of equivalence and endorsement of ratings."
"I therefore voted in favour and support the rapporteur, Mr Gauzes, who suggests focusing on the introduction of the European Securities and Markets Authority into the supervision of agencies and on the definition of its new tasks and new powers."
"It is, in fact, vital for the ESMA, as soon as it is established, to be in a position to exercise its remit to ensure sound supervision of credit rating agencies operating in the EU and also third-country agencies whose ratings will be authorised in the EU."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Parliament's resolution as I agree that the transparency of the information provided by the issuer of a financial instrument rated by a designated credit rating agency may potentially represent substantial added value for the functioning of the market and the protection of investors."
"in writing. - The global financial crisis, to which the credit rating agencies made their contribution, showed the need to set up a mechanism for monitoring and supervising these agencies."
"This was the purpose behind the adoption, in 2009, of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies."
"This made it possible to establish a European system for registering and supervising credit rating agencies which issue ratings used in the European Union."
"It also lays down the conditions for the use in the European Union of ratings issued by third-country agencies, by applying a double system of equivalence and endorsement of ratings."
"During the debates preceding the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009, your rapporteur stressed the need for EU-wide joint oversight of credit rating agencies' products and integrated supervision of them."
"This principle was upheld and the Commission undertook to draft a legislative proposal along these lines."
"The agreement reached on the architecture of European supervision which will enter into force on 1 January 2011 now makes the effective implementation of rating agency supervision possible."
"It is stressed in the regulation establishing the ESMA that this authority will exercise its own supervisory powers in relation, in particular, to credit rating agencies."
"The regulation covers both the supervision of credit rating agencies by the European Securities and Markets Authority and supervision of the use of credit ratings by individual entities supervised at national level."
"The national supervisory authorities will remain responsible for supervising the use of credit ratings by these individual entities."
"Nonetheless, the national authorities will not have the power to take supervisory measures against credit rating agencies in the event of infringement of the regulation."
"This is the very point on which the proposal is being checked in terms of compliance with the principle of proportionality."
"The proposal creates a control system for which, within the context of the current neoliberal environment, there is no provision for real, essential application above and beyond its psychologically novel action, which is directly mainly at the public at large."
"However, it is not designed to replace a previous system; it is designed to introduce a new control system which has not previously existed, even in this form, which is what allowed the credit rating agencies to steam ahead regardless."
"In this sense, it is perhaps better to have this system than none at all."
"in writing. - (DE) I was happy to vote in favour of this report."
"The gradual process of regulating the financial markets is beginning to take shape."
"Protection for investors has been improved and transparency has been increased."
"The regulations are now more wide-ranging and comprehensive and, therefore, provide better protection for those involved."
"in writing. - (DE) The worldwide financial crisis, which was in part caused by credit rating agencies, has made it necessary to set up a mechanism for monitoring and supervising these agencies."
"For this reason, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will come into being on 1 January 2011."
"At the same time, the continuing crisis and the constant new discoveries about market mechanisms make it necessary for the tasks and authority of this body to be constantly adjusted and, if required, expanded."
"Therefore, I very much welcome the detailed specifications and clarifications concerning the authority of the ESMA in its relationships with the relevant national bodies."
"For this reason, I have voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document, because it contributes to the necessary simplification of the EU legal framework."
"I believe that the eight directives currently in force in the field of metrology hinder more than help work in this field."
"At the same time I share the rapporteur's position that the Member States should be given more time to investigate whether repealing the Directives will lead to legal uncertainty which makes European harmonisation of rules necessary."
"I therefore believe that a solution must be adopted which repeals the Directives, but also provides sufficient time to analyse the possible consequences in context with the broader review of the basic legal instrument in this field."
"Metrology is the science of measurements."
"Since ancient times, Europeans have adopted a succession of measuring systems in all fields (length, volume, alcoholometry, and so on)."
"The adoption of the metric system, for example, led to improved collaboration between the various economic operators on the continent and then globally."
"However, a wide variety of measurements and measuring systems prevail in many fields."
"Through a desire to remove these barriers to cooperation between Europeans, the Union has a longstanding policy of harmonising measuring systems."
"Directive 2004/22 was an important step in this movement."
"As we prepare to revise this legislation, a number of instruments now appear obsolete and should be removed to make it more readable."
"I supported this text as it provides a welcome adjustment to the law on metrology."
"I agree with the need to simplify the Community acquis and to update the directives that no longer apply, adapting them to our times."
"The directives in question are obsolete and do not contribute to better regulation."
"The Commission believes that there is no need to harmonise legislation on metrology, as its understanding is that there is sufficient cooperation between Member States and that the current situation of the common recognition of rules based on the international parameters of the different Member States is satisfactory."
"However, it needs to be taken into account that it would be detrimental to have a void in the regulation on this issue, and that we should not contribute to legal uncertainties."
"in writing. - (PT) The report under discussion talks about the possibility of withdrawing up to eight directives relating to metrology in six sectors, with a view to simplifying the body of European law in this area: cold water meters for non-clean water (Directive 75/33/EEC); alcohol meters and alcohol tables (Directives 76/765/EEC and 76/766/EEC); medium and above-medium accuracy weights, respectively (Directives 71/317/EEC and 74/148/EEC); tyre pressure gauges for motor vehicles (Directive 86/217/EEC); standard mass of grain (Directive 71/347/EEC), and calibration of ship tanks (Directive 71/349/EEC)."
"The different options relating to these eight directives under consideration being - revocation in its entirety, revocation with conditions and no measures being taken - the Commission concluded that there is no option that stands out."
"However, for reasons of improved regulation, the Commission favours the revocation in its entirety of all of the directives, that is to say, it favours new regulation within the framework of measuring instruments."
"I favour this choice by the Commission from a legislative excellence point of view, although I believe that the Member States should be given sufficient time to analyse the possible consequences within the context of a broader review of the basic legal instrument in this area, namely the Directive relating to measuring instruments (Directive 2004/22/EC)."
"A simple and up-to-date Community acquis is one of the EU's objectives."
"It does not make sense to keep rules that are entirely obsolete in place."
"With regard to metrology, the understanding is that there is no need to proceed with any harmonisation, as the legislation in place is a common recognition of rules based on the international parameters of the various Member States."
"However, it is important that a gap in the regulation on this issue is not created, so that there are no legal uncertainties."
"in writing. - (ES) I voted in favour of this report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council repealing eight Council directives regarding metrology as, like the rapporteur, I support the general objective of better legislation."
"I also support the view that 'Member States should be given more time to investigate whether repealing the directives will lead to legal uncertainty'."
"I believe that these directives concerning measuring instruments need to be repealed and simplified by revising the legal basis for metrology: the Directive on measuring instruments."
"In general I think it is a positive step to simplify EU legislation, as it will improve access for citizens to that legislation and make it possible to work more efficiently in that field."
"in writing. - (DE) Eight EU directives currently cover the field of metrology in six different areas."
"For reasons of better law-making, the Commission is therefore proposing to repeal the directives."
"According to the Commission, harmonisation is not necessary, as the current situation of mutual recognition of national rules functions satisfactorily."
"However, the rapporteur is of the opinion that the Member States should be given more time to investigate whether repealing the directives will lead to legal uncertainty."
"I have voted in favour of the report, as the problems of legal uncertainty will be taken into account by the rapporteur."
"Repealing European directives essentially means leaving a regulatory vacuum in the European Union's system, but modernising a system such as that of the directives on metrology is certainly a step toward a broader and more up-to-date common system."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of the report repealing the eight Council directives on metrology."
"The principle shared by the Council and the Commission is nevertheless delicately balanced because each Member State will have to rely on mutual recognition of national standards, avoiding causing problems to businesses in the sector that rely on metrology rules until the revision of the directive on measuring instruments that will harmonise the relevant legislation at European level is adopted."
"I agree with the position of the rapporteur who advocates improved regulation with regard to metrology."
"The Commission was favouring the complete revocation of all eight directives relating to metrology; however, the rapporteur's position is more balanced, giving Member States more time to investigate whether revocation of the directives will lead to legal uncertainty, making it necessary for there to be European harmonisation of the rules relating to metrology."
"A transitional period is thus established in order to analyse the possible consequences of the revocation of the directives, and to analyse the need to review the basic directive in this area (Directive 2004/22/EC)."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Weisgerber, who favours the general objective of better regulation."
"However, with regard to this proposal it is not that clear what the best option will be."
"The Commission concludes in their Impact Assessment, when looking at the different options concerning these eight metrology directives (full repeal, repeal with conditions, do nothing), that 'no option stands out'."
"Still, for reasons of better regulation, the Commission favours the full repeal of all directives (and relies on mutual recognition of national regulation) above harmonisation, that is,. re-regulation in the Directive on measuring instruments."
"To reiterate, I agree with the rapporteur, who is of the opinion that Member States should be given more time to investigate whether repealing the directives will lead to legal uncertainty which makes European harmonisation of rules necessary."
"in writing. - (RO) Repealing all eight directives will most likely lead to additional administrative burdens as Members States will be able to introduce national provisions implementing the measuring instruments covered by the directives being repealed."
"Neither the directives being repealed nor those remaining in force will enhance the common level of consumer protection. This could only be achieved by amending them."
"I think that Member States should be given more time to investigate whether repealing the directives would lead to legal uncertainty which would make the harmonisation of European rules necessary."
"I also support the rapporteur's proposal for the process to be completed by 1 May 2014."
"Consequently, I voted for this report as it opts for a solution where the directives will be repealed, but also provides sufficient time to analyse the possible consequences in the context of the broad review of the basic legal instrument in this field, the Measurement Instruments Directive (2004/22/EC)."
"in writing. - (PT) I agree with the general objective of improved regulation in the area of metrology."
"However, I believe greater reflection would be advisable, as hasty standardisation could lead to more disruption and legal uncertainty than benefits."
"in writing. - With this vote, the EP shows that it favours the general objective of better regulation."
"However, with regard to this proposal it is not that clear what the best option will be."
"The Commission concludes in their Impact Assessment, when looking at the different options concerning these 8 metrology directives (full repeal, repeal with conditions, do nothing), that 'no option stands out'."
"Still, for reasons of better regulation, the Commission favours the full repeal of all Directives (and relies on mutual recognition of national regulation) above harmonisation, that is, re-regulation in MID."
"The EP is of the opinion that Member States should be given more time to investigate whether repealing the directives will lead to legal uncertainty which makes European harmonisation of rules necessary."
"Therefore we have opted for a solution where the directives will be repealed and which also provides sufficient time to analyse the possible consequences in context with the broader review of the basic legal instrument in this field, the 'Measurement Instruments Directive' (2004/22/EC)."
"in writing. - (DE) I have voted in favour of the report, because it makes a significant contribution to reducing bureaucracy, which is something that is constantly being called for, and allows more than 20 directives that are obsolete or no longer needed to be repealed."
"This is the right approach to achieving a simpler and leaner Europe."
"in writing. - (LT) I approved of this important resolution because I am convinced that the European citizens' initiative will be a powerful agenda-setting instrument and will foster greater cross-border debates within the EU."
"The citizens' initiative gives European citizens the right to make a legislative proposal."
"For this initiative to be effective the organisers of a European citizens' initiative should gather into a citizens' committee composed of persons coming from different Member States."
"This will ensure that the issues which arise are truly European, all the while having the added value of helping the collection of signatures from the very beginning."
"I feel that the citizens' initiative will only succeed if the EU regulation is citizen-friendly and does not create cumbersome obligations for and frustration among the organisers."
"It is also very important that the process is in line with the EU data protection requirements and that it is fully transparent, from the start until the end."
"The European citizens' initiative is a new instrument of participatory democracy on a continental scale and therefore significant attention should be paid to communication and information campaigns aimed at raising awareness of the European citizens' initiative."
"The compromise between the European Parliament and the Council on the regulation on the so-called citizens' initiative, which has been accompanied by ridiculous triumphant talk about the strengthening of the democratic institutions of the EU, is nothing more than an insulting attempt to manipulate and fool the people."
"The misleadingly entitled citizens' initiative is not only useless; it may prove to be dangerous for the people."
"Apart from any procedural requirements agreed in terms of collecting 1 000 000 signatures petitioning the Commission to take a legislative initiative, materially it is the same: the Commission is under no obligation to propose the legislative initiative and is not bound by its contents."
"On the contrary, this type of 'citizens' initiative', guided and manipulated by the mechanisms of capital and the bourgeois political system, may be used by EU bodies to present the most anti-grassroots and reactionary choices of the EU and the monopolies as an apparently 'popular request'."
"Moreover, this sort of 'initiative' will be used to set signatures, memoranda and requests against the organised grassroots and working class movement, mass demonstrations and struggles and various forms of fight."
"Various 'citizens' initiatives' cannot hide the reactionary face of the EU, nor will they be able to reverse the escalation in the class struggle and grassroots fight."
"The citizens' initiative was promised in the Treaty of Lisbon and is now finally being implemented."
"This new form of participation in the formulation of European Union policy allows European citizens to directly approach the Commission asking it to table a proposal on matters of interest to them, provided these fall within the framework of the EU's powers."
"We were only waiting for rules of procedure to be introduced for this new European citizens' right to become a reality."
"This has now been done and I supported the proposal in the vote."
"A 'citizens' committee' made up of individuals from at least seven Member States can register an initiative with the Commission."
"After this, the process to gather signatures on paper or online can begin."
"The million signatures that are required must come from at least one quarter of the EU Member States and must be gathered within 12 months."
"Member States will verify the statements of support."
"All the signatures must be submitted by European Union citizens old enough to vote in the European parliamentary elections."
"Lastly, the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, will be the final judge of whether the proposed legislative procedure should be undertaken."
"in writing. - (LT) I support the decision adopted by the European Parliament on the right in the European citizens' initiative to make a legislative proposal."
"It is believed that the introduction of the initiative will establish a direct link between the citizens and the institutions, thus bridging the gap between them and ensuring that the EU institutions will address the concrete problems which are of importance to them."
"Through the ECI, EU citizens can appeal directly to the European Commission to initiate a legal act."
"The Commission will be the one deciding on the follow-up to be given to successful citizens' initiatives."
"The European Parliament will be able to contribute to the achievement of these goals through the organisation of public hearings or the adoption of resolutions."
"As this is a new initiative it would be useful for the Commission to present a report on its implementation every three years and, if relevant, to propose a revision of the regulation."
"In order to ensure effective application of the initiative complicated administrative procedures should be avoided."
"It is also necessary to ensure that the process is in line with the EU data protection requirements."
"After a compromise was reached on the rules governing the European citizens' initiative, the report was adopted by a very large majority: 628 for and only 15 against and 24 abstentions."
"I am delighted with this vote, which introduces the opportunity starting in 2012 for Europe's citizens to make their voices heard more clearly."
"The concept is simple, it is a sort of petition at European level: a citizens' committee made up of members from at least seven Member States will have a year to collect one million signatures on a subject of public interest which requires the attention of the Commission."
"The Commission must then decide within three months whether or not it considers that a legislative proposal on the subject is appropriate and must give reasons for its decision."
"We may be opposed to some of the conditions obtained by Member States, such as the requirement to be a citizen rather than simply a resident of the European Union in order to be able to sign the petition; or the option for states to ask for individuals' identity cards in order to check their signatures."
"Nonetheless, the citizens' initiative is a positive idea and a step towards participative democracy which we must now put into practice."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report because the European citizens' initiative, introduced in the Treaty of Lisbon is a huge step towards closer relations between the European Union and European citizens."
"The new initiative will grant citizens the same political initiative powers that the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament already enjoy."
"Furthermore, it will provide citizens with a means to be heard by enabling them to refer some issues of interest to the European institutions."
"Such a two-way flow is mutually beneficial."
"With the introduction of the initiative there will be a guarantee that the European Union institutions will address the concrete problems which are of importance to citizens."
"Moreover, the European Parliament will be able to help citizens achieve these goals by making use of all the means in its power to support the citizens' initiatives of its choice, notably through the organisation of public hearings or the adoption of resolutions."
"However, the European Union must ensure that the process is in line with the EU data protection requirements and that it is fully transparent, from the start until the end."
"Only by guaranteeing a safe environment where citizens can present proposals, will we be able to win their trust and encourage their interest in the work of the European Union."
"The citizens' initiative, which gives a million Europeans the right to propose legislative initiatives, incorporates the concept of participative democracy into the European Union, which is actually stipulated in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This is a new, important step which the EU is taking and Parliament will therefore receive feedback from the citizens whom it represents on whether it is doing a good job or not."
"I welcome the fact that Parliament has endeavoured, as far as possible, to make the legislative initiative procedure for EU citizens as simple and easy to use as possible because they are the ones who will actually use it."
"We would not have needed a complicated procedure which would have only made EU citizens frustrated."
"Parliament's key demands have been accepted, such as the admissibility check right at the start rather than carrying out a check after the first 300 000 signatures have been collected."
"I regard it as a victory for Parliament and EU citizens that the minimum number of Member States from which signatures need to be collected is a quarter and not a third, as had originally been proposed."
"I hope that when Parliament's decision comes into force in 2012, there will be as many initiatives as possible submitted by EU citizens."
"I voted in favour of the report on the citizens' initiative, knowing full well that it is simply a means of expression of the will of the citizens of Europe and not a powerful means of participating in or reversing current policies."
"The Commission tried to the very end to limit this specific civil right and, thus, the final text does not reflect the real ambitions; for example, it introduces particular complex procedures for exercising this right."
"Unfortunately, important amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left were rejected and, as a result, initiatives cannot be signed by EU residents who are not nationals of a Member State, thereby precluding equal participation of residents, regardless of nationality, nor is there a guarantee that signatures will tally with signatories' ID numbers."
"Despite this, the final text is a much better version than the text originally proposed, in that it sets the minimum at a quarter of the Member States, proposes that initiatives be registered immediately and requires the Commission to organise a public hearing for every successful initiative and to guarantee absolute transparency in connection with the funding of each initiative."
"I have always seen this initiative as one of the most important innovations of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The possibility of a million citizens of a significant number of Member States being able to put forward a legislative initiative should contribute to the strengthening by European citizenship of civil society organised at an EU level."
"I have emphasised the scope of this measure, given that Members of the European Parliament do not have the right to legislative initiatives."
"I hope that the practical application of this legislative initiative does not turn out to be excessively bureaucratic, discouraging use of this new instrument."
"in writing. - Although I fully support the European Citizen's initiative, I voted against the final legislative resolution because I am disappointed with how little was ultimately achieved with this promising tool."
"In particular, I do not agree with the provision requesting signatories in the majority of Member States to give their personal ID numbers."
"I am also against the restriction of participation in the ECI to EU citizens only."
"The adoption of the basic rules of 'the citizens' initiative' as laid down by the Treaty of Lisbon, marks another step further towards direct democracy in Europe."
"In future, the Commission will have to consider drawing up a new European law when there is demand to do so from one million citizens from at least one quarter of all Member States."
"This new instrument therefore gives European citizens the ability to genuinely influence the legislative process, by bringing a demand or a concern raised by the people's will to European level."
"It is a victory for our movement which has consistently called for bringing the European Union closer to its citizens by building a more solid, a more transparent and a more accessible Europe."
"I am pleased that I voted, along with the huge majority of Members, in favour of the report on the 'citizens' initiative', which introduces an unprecedented dose of popular participation in the EU's legislative process."
"Indeed, by giving one million citizens the right of political initiative, Parliament is holding itself up as a fine example of participatory democracy."
"This is now the way forward for the European Union: it must become ever closer to its citizens."
"in writing. - (DE) Some small improvements have been made in comparison with the original draft."
"Therefore, I have voted in favour of the report."
"Nevertheless, I would like to say that, even with this toothless citizens' initiative, there is still a striking democratic deficit in the EU, which does not have any form of direct democracy."
"As a result, the next step must be the introduction of obligatory referendums for successful initiatives."
"The inclusion of a mandatory public hearing for the initiators of petitions involving the Commission and Parliament is very welcome."
"Now the Member States must implement the citizens' initiative quickly, without wasting time or introducing excessive red tape."
"Identity card checks by local authorities, such as those which apply in the case of national petitions for referendums, will not be needed to evaluate the statements of support."
"The national electoral authorities should rely on random sampling, as proposed by the European Parliament."
"I voted in favour of the report on the draft European Parliament and Council regulation relating to the citizens' initiative, one of the most relevant provisions introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, and under the terms of which one million citizens can ask the Commission to put forward certain legislative proposals."
"The proposals adopted by the European Parliament should enable the rules relating to the citizens' initiative to be made clearer, simpler and easier to apply."
"The citizens' initiative, approved today, is one more step towards the establishment of a Europe made for people and by people, increasing its democratic nature and transparency, and encouraging Europe to move closer to its citizens and an active, interested and participative civil society."
"From now on it will be possible for European citizens to submit a request that the European Commission proposes legislation on a given issue, provided that a minimum number of signatories coming from at least one-fifth of Member States is guaranteed."
"However, I have to express some bewilderment at the exclusion of collective entities and organisations as 'organisers' (Article 2, No 3), thinking in particular of NGOs and political parties, the founding organisations of representative democracy, as well as at the terminology chosen - ""citizens' committee” - to identify the group of organisers."
"I am also left wondering at the attempt to set the minimum age of signatories at 16, when, in the majority of Member States, the right to vote, actively or passively, is acquired at the age of majority, at 18 years of age."
"This should be the yardstick, as proposed by the Commission in sections 7 and 2 of Article 3 of the proposal."
"in writing. - (PT) I am pleased about the adoption of this report on the European citizens' initiative introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, which has the objective of assigning to citizens the same powers of political initiative as those currently enjoyed by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament."
"Each initiative will have 12 months to collect one million signatures, which need to come from at least a quarter of Member States, currently seven."
"The minimum number of signatories per country varies from 74 250 in Germany to 3 750 in Malta."
"In Portugal's case, the minimum number of signatories required to support an initiative will be 16 500."
"The validity of declarations of support will be gauged by the Member States."
"In Portugal, an identity card, passport or citizen's card number will need to be included."
"Signatories should be EU citizens and be old enough to be able to vote in European elections (18 in Portugal)."
"It will then be up to the Commission to analyse the initiative and decide, within a timeframe of three months, if it will put forward European legislation on the issue."
"The Community's executive will then have to 'indicate the measures that it intends to take, and the reasons that justify these or not'."
"This justification will be made public."
"I welcome the report by Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Gurmai on the citizens' initiative."
"This vote has approved and even helps lay down the ground rules for the operation of the European citizens' initiative, as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"A citizens' committee composed of persons coming from at least seven Member States may register an initiative and begin to gather the 1 million signatures necessary, on paper or online, once the Commission has carried out an admissibility check."
"This example of participative democracy has great potential because it involves citizens at first hand and enables them, in a certain sense, to be a part of our work."
"The joint work by the two co-rapporteurs showed that even ideological divisions can be overcome when work is carried out effectively and in the interests of citizens."
"This underlying position is typical of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which is always pro-active, open to dialogue and cooperation, but at the same time is anchored in solid and unshakeable values."
"This is a clearly demagogical initiative, propaganda by the European Union, which only serves to try and hide the impoverishment of democracy that is taking place, and to make us forget that it is those in charge in Europe who prevented a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon itself, which anticipated the so-called citizens' initiative."
"Meanwhile, the Treaty on European Union itself establishes limitations on such a citizens' initiative by stating, in Article 11, that a million signatures from a significant number of Member States is required, and going on to say that they can only invite the European Commission to put forward an appropriate proposal on issues that these citizens consider to require a Union legal instrument in order to apply the Treaties."
"In other words, after all the work of collecting signatures and fulfilling the requirements that the draft regulation lays down, there are no guarantees that the citizens' wishes will be taken into account."
"In any case, the report approved by the EP improves slightly on the European Commission's proposal, but must comply with the terms of the Treaty, which initially, in fact limits any deepening of the citizens' initiative."
"That is why we abstained."
"Any citizens' initiative must be signed by over a million citizens of the European Union, and a quarter of European Union Member States must be covered by those signatories: that was the most important point of this Regulation."
"The Irish Government intends to verify the signatories from Ireland by checking that country's electoral roll for elections to the European Parliament."
"I abstained on the regulation to implement the European citizens' initiative."
"In my opinion, Parliament is misguided in wanting to facilitate these initiatives as much as possible, particularly in reducing the number of Member States from which the signatures must come."
"I remain a supporter of representative democracy."
"Citizens' initiatives will not help resolve the EU's economic, social, environmental and societal problems."
"What are called citizens' initiatives will essentially serve extremist political forces that will seize these instruments to campaign for the restoration of the death penalty, against the construction of minarets, against the 'creeping Islamisation' of Europe and other populist subjects."
"We have all been waiting for it ever since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force last year: the regulation on the citizens' initiative, which lays down the procedures for its implementation, its rules and basic procedures and which above all will finally enable use of this new instrument."
"From now on, one million European citizens, that is to say just 0.2% of the EU population, can ask the Commission to put forward proposals in certain areas: an important step towards participatory democracy, which should enable and encourage cross-border debates in Europe as the initiative must be brought by citizens residing in various Member States; a significant step forward in bringing together the citizens of Europe, in the hope that this new instrument will actually be used by European citizens, that it will be effective and that the European Commission will be able to follow the proposals put forward by citizens."
"The European citizens' initiative is one of the most interesting innovations set out in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is a European petition that will enable one million European citizens, from a representative number of EU Member States, to impose a matter on the Commission's agenda."
"In other words, it marks the emergence of a genuine legislative power for European citizens, as the Commission will be obliged to respond to this citizens' initiative by commissioning a study or proposing a directive."
"In a context where citizens' feeling of belonging to the Union is still too weak and where rates of abstention at the European elections, especially, are particularly worrying, this new tool will enable European citizens to become fully-fledged actors in European democracy."
"For this reason, I find it somewhat regrettable to hear voices being raised today on the risks involved in the citizens' initiative."
"The compromise reached with the Council is completely fair, and the criteria governing the admissibility of the project will ensure that unfair initiatives will never see the light of day."
"We should not be afraid of debates generated by citizens availing themselves of this tool."
"I voted for this text."
"The European citizens' legislative initiative constitutes a fundamental step in the process of building a Europe based on citizens' rights."
"Strict admissibility criteria, accessible and simplified procedures and representativeness of Member States constitute the key pillars of an instrument that restores the primacy of the value of participatory democracy."
"In accordance with the values of the Union, the Treaty of Lisbon grants at least 1 million citizens, representing at least one quarter of Member States, an authentic opportunity for effective citizens' involvement in forming rules in line with expectations of the European people."
"We hope that this instrument will boost citizens' rights and that we will soon reach a time when we will be able to positively assess the results achieved and, where necessary, make due corrections in the interests of citizens to make this truly innovative project even more streamlined and flexible."
"In this way, the Union based on the euro will be coordinated with the Europe that hinges on the European people's right to citizenship."
"in writing. - (LT) I approved of this report because the European citizens' initiative is a new instrument of participatory democracy on a continental scale."
"It is a tool which should be used by the citizens themselves and its aim is to strengthen direct democracy, active citizenship, and the influence of the European citizens on the European Union policies."
"This initiative was introduced in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and then in the Treaty of Lisbon, with the aim of granting citizens the same political initiative powers that the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament already enjoy."
"I am pleased that the report promotes the use of modern technologies as an appropriate instrument of participatory democracy."
"The introduction of the initiative will establish a direct link between the citizens and the institutions, thus bridging the gap between them and ensuring that the EU institutions will address the concrete problems which are of importance to them."
"in writing. - (DE) The citizens' initiative that has been adopted today is an important step towards bringing the European Union closer to its citizens."
"This finally gives the citizens of the European Union the opportunity to take an active part in political events."
"In addition, it enables them not only to become involved in politics, but also to call directly on the Commission to take action."
"It is important to ensure that the initiative is as citizen-friendly and straightforward as possible, without encouraging its misuse."
"However user-friendly the citizens' initiative is, if it is overused it will become devalued."
"The citizens' initiative will introduce more democracy and will contribute significantly to making Europe more modern and to bringing it to life for its citizens."
"I would like to call once again on Parliament and also on the Commission to ensure that the Committee on Petitions is given an appropriate role in this process."
"One of the main objectives of the European citizens' initiative is to bring the European institutions closer to the citizens and to make it easier for ordinary Europeans to exercise their rights and privileges."
"It will certainly improve the lives of the residents of Member States and help in the creation of a pro-social image for the Union."
"The authors of the proposal have also endeavoured to achieve the simplest possible model for organising meetings and collecting signatures as part of an initiative."
"If Europeans are going to want to voice their opinions on a matter which they consider to be important, it is our duty to ensure that they are heard and their requests given consideration."
"After all, this is what true democracy means."
"in writing. - (LV) Today the European Parliament has made a historic decision, which gives civil society the opportunity of becoming much more actively involved in the decision-making process."
"An active civil society, which takes part in the making of political decisions, is one of the cornerstones of a democracy."
"It is one of the basic requirements for a politics of high quality, which has over the course of many years allowed the Member States of the European Union to reach a high level of democracy, human rights and welfare, and Europe as a whole to become the world's most developed region."
"The task of civil society does not lie solely in taking part in elections."
"Citizens must also become involved from day to day in the decision-making process, expressing their opinion on specific decisions or events on the political agenda."
"It is in their interests to become involved in democratic control over authority and to criticise politicians over their activities."
"Without an active civil society, it would not have been possible to restore the independence of the Baltic States and secure our return to Europe."
"That is why I am voting in favour of the citizens' initiative with great conviction."
"Until now, European legislation has not contained sufficiently developed clear mechanisms for Europeans to become involved in the decision-making process and for drawing the attention of European institutions to citizens' current concerns."
"I believe that the citizens' initiative will increase people's faith in the European Union and enhance the legitimacy of decisions that are made."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the proposed amendments by the EP to the citizens' initiative, as I believe that they make the initiative stronger and enable more people to participate."
"This is a historic moment in which European citizens are being given a concrete measure for bringing important issues and topics to EU level."
"I urge the Commission to take note of the amendment asking for easy procedures and transparent information for citizens."
"It is one thing to create such a mechanism, but it also has to be accessible and understandable to EU citizens in order to enable them to make full use of it."
"Parliament is seeking an easing of the criteria with regard to signatories by asking that they should come from at least a fifth, rather than a third, of the Member States."
"It is also calling for the creation of an easily accessible, free-of-charge online collection system for signatures."
"I would especially like to underline the need to convene citizens' committees to organise initiatives."
"The citizens' committees movement was one of the most important factors that led to the renewed independence of Estonia in 1991."
"This is a clear sign that citizens together can bring down walls."
"in writing. - (DE) I support Parliament's decision to introduce the option of the citizens' initiative for the citizens of the EU."
"The new EU-wide petition system is an important means of allowing citizens to become more involved and will ensure more direct democracy."
"The Treaty on European Union as a whole improves the democratic functioning of the Union."
"Citizens can participate in the democratic life of the Union and approach the Commission directly."
"The citizens' initiative gives citizens a right of initiative similar to that of the European Parliament and the Council."
"In order to ensure that the citizens' initiative is implemented correctly, at least one million signatures are needed from a minimum of one fifth of all the Member States."
"In addition, Parliament recommends measures in its resolution which will make the citizens' initiative easier to use."
"For example, the Commission should consider using the existing programmes which promote mobility and active citizenship, as well as new forms of communication, such as social networking, which encourage public debate."
"I welcome the fact that the representations and offices in the Member States will act as interfaces and advisory bodies."
"in writing. - (DE) Despite the improvements to the European citizens' initiative resulting from the compromise between the Commission and Parliament, it still involves unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles."
"In addition, there is the risk that it will be used as a tool, for example by large companies and organisations, because although transparency is guaranteed, there is no limit on donations from businesses."
"For these reasons among others, we have abstained in the final vote."
"Some of our criticisms are as follows:"
"1."
"Businesses are not excluded from the initiative."
"2."
"No decision has been made about whether younger citizens can take part from the age of 16."
"Instead this is dependent on national electoral law."
"3."
"Third-party nationals who live in the EU cannot take part."
"4."
"No compensation is available above 100 000 signatures (EUR 0.005 per signature)."
"As a result, the initiative will be very costly for the initiators and, therefore, is not equally accessible to all."
"5."
"There is no ban on company donations in support of a European citizens' initiative and they have no upper limit."
"6."
"No specific information is provided about the possibility of appealing to the Court of Justice of the Europe Union if an initiative is rejected."
"7."
"If the European Commission rejects a related draft legislative text, it is not obliged to justify its decision."
"in writing. - (RO) The citizens' initiative will establish a direct link between citizens and institutions, thereby plugging the current gap and making EU institutions deal with the major problems facing citizens."
"I wish to emphasise a few points which must not be overlooked:"
"1."
"The citizens' initiative will only be successful if the associated regulation is easy for citizens to understand and apply, without imposing excessive obligations on organisers."
"2."
"Following the negotiations conducted with the Commission and the Council, we have a common understanding which stipulates the need for the supporters of a citizens' initiative to provide certain elements of ID and for facilities for Member States to verify them."
"However, it is vital to ensure that the process complies with EU legislation in the area of data protection."
"Any organisation with the opportunity to support citizens' initiatives must provide total transparency regarding the support being provided so that the signatories are aware who is behind an initiative they choose to support."
"3."
"The European Parliament information offices in Member States and the Commission's information networks, such as Europe Direct and the Citizen Signpost Service, must be involved in providing all the necessary information regarding the citizens' initiative."
"I was pleased to hear the result of today's vote on the citizens' initiative."
"By bringing in the citizens' initiative, the Treaty of Lisbon has become a legislative tool for the EU's citizens, but we have to remember that collecting a million signatures does not yet mean that a new law will be made."
"This process has to go the whole length of the UE legislative route, and we MEPs must make sure that procedures are simplified, to avoid disappointment, here."
"I think we should run a good information campaign in the Member States about this instrument, so that the issues raised under the EU citizens' initiative correspond with what is said in the Treaties and are in accord with the EU's values."
"in writing. - (PT) With this important initiative of the European Parliament, one million European citizens will be able to ask the European Commission to put forward legislation on a given issue."
"The rules implementing the 'citizens' initiative', approved today by the European Parliament, state that signatories need to come from at least seven Member States."
"In Portugal's case, at least 16 500 signatories will be required to support an initiative."
"Alongside the Treaty of Lisbon, a 'citizens' right of initiative' was created, under the terms of which one million European citizens may ask the European Commission to put forward certain legislative proposals."
"The regulation adopted in plenary today sets out the necessary conditions for putting forward future citizens' initiatives."
"in writing. - (ES) I voted in favour of this report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the citizens' initiative because, although it only vaguely satisfies my group's position, because it ignores important issues such as the idea of allowing initiatives proposing changes to the Treaties or that of extending the period for collecting signatures from the proposed 12 months to 18 months, I believe nonetheless that the report is an considerable yet insufficient improvement on the text put forward by the Commission."
"The citizens' initiative is a mechanism for public participation laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon to make it possible for citizens and civil society to play a role in the process of drawing up European policies."
"I have supported the text tabled as it facilitates the creation of the mechanism and its combined procedure."
"For example, it simplifies the process of registering initiatives and reduces the requirement regarding the number of Member States that must be represented among the citizens (from a third to a quarter)."
"It also represents progress compared with the Commission's proposal, since it improves transparency regarding the funding of campaigns to collect signatures."
"The European citizens' initiative will be a powerful tool for shaping the agenda of the European Union. The initiative was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon and will allow one million European citizens to call on the European Commission to put forward proposals on subjects within the framework of its powers."
"This initiative grants EU citizens the right to make their opinions known and in doing so confers on them a right of initiative similar to that exercised by the European Parliament and the Council."
"Citizens' initiatives should also encourage wider cross-border debate, as they will need to be put together by citizens of several different Member States."
"The initiatives will only be able to be implemented, however, if they meets certain procedural requirements or requirements on compliance with the European Union's fundamental values, in order to prevent the instrument from being used for non-democratic purposes."
"These requirements guarantee the reliability and hence the efficacy of the initiative."
"It is also vital to ensure that the process complies with EU data protection requirements and is fully transparent from beginning to end."
"in writing. - I do not share the opinion of my colleagues from the S&D Group, which is why I have abstained from voting."
"It does not matter who writes the nonsense: to multiply it is foolishness."
"The citizens' initiative is necessary, no doubt, but to collect one million signatures in order to be heard is nonsense."
"I would like to ask the rapporteurs if they ever collected signatures themselves."
"If they did, they should know that the minimum cost of each signature certified by a notary is 20 euros."
"That means 20-30 million euros to introduce a new law."
"Who will finance this action?"
"Only large enterprises are able to do that, not ordinary people."
"Is this not then a fake?"
"A point to remember: MEPs also represent these people."
"in writing. - This initiative was promised during the Lisbon process, so I am pleased that it is now being moved forward."
"It is imperative that the citizens' initiative is not open to political, business or other manipulation."
"It should be left to the genuine initiative of citizens and not be manipulated with a hidden agenda."
"It should be open and transparent."
"To set the ball rolling, the Commission should advertise the agreed conditions for an initiative when they are agreed."
"Would it not be reasonable for the initiation of the process that the Commission organise some form of arms-length competition across the EU to test the water and find out what are the top ten issues on which citizens would welcome an initiative with fellow citizens."
"in writing. - (DE) The European citizens' initiative is the first tiny step in the right direction."
"I have voted in favour of it because it is the first directly democratic instrument in the EU."
"However, overall the citizens' initiative is simply a veneer of direct democracy, which will lead the citizens to believe that they have the right of codecision on some issues in the European Union."
"The citizens' initiative does not involve any consequences, regardless of how many people sign it."
"The parallels with the system of petitions for a referendum in Austria are obvious."
"In Austria, these petitions are generally just shoved in a drawer and much the same thing will happen with the EU citizens' initiatives."
"In addition, care has evidently been taken to ensure that non-conformist opinions can be suppressed."
"The Commission makes the final check on the admissibility of a citizens' initiative."
"In the real European Union, the rulers not only put in place the legislation and directives, they also want to control the will of the citizens."
"However, the European citizens' initiative at least gives non-conformist movements and parties the opportunity to develop their ideas."
"It will in future be possible at an EU level, as it is in Austria, to run campaigns and to show the citizens that there are routes to a different and better Europe which lead away from the blind alleys in Brussels."
"Although I naturally support the regulation on the citizens' initiative, I am not in agreement with the possibility of members of the European Parliament, or members of national parliaments, being able to take part in these initiatives, or the possibility of them being funded by political parties or public bodies."
"I believe that both solutions go against the spirit of the new mechanism, which aims to provide ordinary citizens and civil society with the means of taking part in the political life of the Union."
"I also disagree with the powers given to the Commission to adopt certain technical specifications required for the application of the law by means of an 'executive act'."
"Measures of general application assigned to the Commission for the application of legislative instruments should not be considered to be 'implementing acts', under the control of Member States, but 'delegated acts', under the direct control of the legislator."
"In the same way, it does not make sense, after the Treaty of Lisbon, to continue to apply the 'regulatory procedure' under the traditional committee system, as it clearly concerns issues that are currently covered by the legislative procedure or by the 'delegated acts' procedure."
"The provisions referred to are therefore contrary to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Apart from these specific objections, I believe that overall this is an excellent law that does justice to the political and constitutional importance of this new mechanism for participatory democracy within the EU."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of the position of the European Parliament on the European citizens' initiative, because I fully support this citizens' right provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"As an optimist I feel that this may be one of the main instruments helping to bring European Union institutions closer to ordinary people."
"Ultimately, a civically active part of society will be able to have a direct impact on decisions taken at EU level."
"It should be recognised that at a time when many European initiatives are viewed rather critically by the public, from the outset the European citizens' initiative has largely been met with positive assessment and approval."
"I hope that we will ultimately have clear rules that are not weighed down by unnecessary bureaucratic requirements, and that will help European society voice its opinion."
"This report fully meets my expectations, particularly on three issues."
"Firstly, the minimum age for supporting a legislative initiative has been fixed at 18 years old which is the minimum age for voting in European Parliament elections and as is required to participate in instruments of direct democracy, such as referendums."
"Secondly, the need to request the identity documents of resident European citizens who intend to sign the statements of support, in order to carry out the checks provided for by the regulation in accordance with the laws in force."
"Lastly, the need to allow for a term of 12 months for the application of the regulation after its entry into force, with the aim of allowing the competent national administrations - many of which will be seeing this type of instrument for the first time - to prepare all the necessary legal, administrative and financial measures."
"It is with great satisfaction that I vote in favour of this report relating to the citizens' initiative, one of the greatest innovations of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This new legal instrument may become a way of bolstering the participation of European citizens."
"In fact, enabling millions of citizens to suggest to the European Commission that it should legislate on a given issue is a very positive step on the path of bringing Europe closer to its citizens."
"I applaud the work of the rapporteurs whose objective was to simplify the citizens' initiative and remove any bureaucratic burden, so as to make it as accessible as possible."
"I agree with the majority of the requests made by the European Parliament, specifically the checking of the acceptability of an initiative being made at the time of its presentation, and not after 300 000 signatures have been collected, which could raise the expectation of the signatory citizens."
"I support the reduction in the minimum number of Member States involved in the initial signing of the initiative."
"The original proposal was for signatories to come from at least one third of Member States, and the European Parliament and the Council reached an agreement that the signatories should come from a quarter of all Member States."
"I support the initiative by the rapporteurs Mrs Gurmai and Mr Lamassoure, which is that the organisers of a European citizens' initiative should gather into a citizens' committee composed of persons coming from different Member States."
"This will ensure that the issues which arise are truly European, all the while having the added value of helping the collection of signatures from the very beginning"
"I support the rapporteurs' idea, whereby the European citizens' initiative is a new instrument of participatory democracy on a continental scale."
"Therefore, the present regulation may not be flawless and practice may present European decision-makers with new challenges."
"For this reason, I agree with the rapporteurs' call for the Commission to present a report on its implementation every three years and, if relevant, to propose a revision of the regulation."
"in writing. - (RO) The citizens' initiative, introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, has been devised to give citizens the right to participate in the democratic life of the European Union."
"Its aim is to provide citizens with a means of having their voice heard by enabling them to refer a number of issues of interest to the EU institutions."
"These may include difficulties that they face in their daily lives which they do not feel receive enough attention and support from trade unions, political institutions or any other regular interlocutors from the institutions."
"The citizens' initiative will properly establish a direct link between citizens and institutions, thereby making EU institutions deal with the specific major problems facing citizens."
"The citizens' initiative comes with the need to comply with certain administrative requirements, but also to respect the fundamental values of the EU, among others, thereby ensuring its reliability and effectiveness, which will be the key to its success."
"It is necessary to ensure that the process complies with EU applications in the area of data protection, as well as guarantee total transparency."
"Any organisation, association or even political party will have the opportunity to support the citizens' initiatives which they choose, subject to total transparency regarding the support being provided so that signatories are aware who is behind an initiative they choose to support or not."
"in writing. - (PT) I am glad about the approval of this report, which represents a very important step in the affirmation of the constitutional nature of the European Union, providing citizens with a mechanism for accessible and effective democratic participation, which will undoubtedly contribute to the increased involvement and commitment of citizens with regard to European political life, and a strengthening of the ties of solidarity between the various Member States."
"in writing. - (FR) Participative democracy has made its triumphant entry into Europe with the adoption of this report on the European citizens' initiative, one of the major areas of progress brought in by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"One million European citizens will now be able to approach the Commission and require it to pronounce an opinion on an issue of interest to society, provided that it falls within the framework of the Commission's powers."
"One million citizens, who must come from at least a quarter of the Member States and must be of voting age, in other words only 0.2% of the population of the EU."
"The signatures must be collected in writing or over the Internet and must be verified."
"The organisers will have to be identified: who they are, what they support, for whom they are working."
"This is a potential leap forward for the European Union's democratic legitimacy."
"It is a step towards bringing citizens closer to an EU which they often see, rightly or wrongly, as being light years away from their day-to-day concerns."
"However, the risk that the initiative could be exploited by certain non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or by a given sector of industry should not be ignored."
"For it to be a success, the initiative must genuinely come from citizens."
"It must help to move the debate forward, to reconcile citizens with the European Union and to contribute towards the development of a European civil society."
"Today we voted in plenary on the European citizens' initiative."
"This initiative was introduced by Article 11 of the Treaty of Lisbon, with the aim of empowering citizens with the same political initiative powers that the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament already enjoy."
"The ECI is a new instrument of participatory democracy on a continental scale."
"On 31 March 2010, the Commission submitted its proposal for a regulation and on 14 June, Council approved the general approach to the ECI."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs of the European Parliament adopted this report in November, which included a negotiation mandate."
"The trialogue of 30 November reached an agreement over various amendments."
"The main points of the agreement concern: combining registration and admissibility; the number of signatures that must come from a minimum of one quarter of Member States; setting up a citizens' committee; the minimum age for supporting an initiative; and the online collection system."
"Our citizens have been waiting for this new instrument, which will give them some influence over EU policy."
"They have already demonstrated that they will know how to use it to have their say in the legislative debate: take the petition for a moratorium on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) launched by Greenpeace and Avaaz, which was sent last week to Commission President José Manuel Barroso."
"Sadly, the citizens have acted before the legislators and the petition arrived before the rules of procedure, which will make the citizens' initiative operative in early 2012, had been defined."
"It is up to us Members of Parliament therefore to relay and support the request expressed by almost 1.2 million people and to ensure that it is properly followed up."
"Parliament succeeded in using its influence in the talks with Council and the Commission to make the initiative as accessible and effective as possible and paved the way."
"There is now nothing to stop citizens from participating directly in the functioning of the EU."
"Today's vote has given the go-ahead for the first example of European democratic participation."
"The European citizens' initiative is one of the most innovative provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon and a first step toward direct democracy."
"The initiative is an instrument that allows citizens to call on the European Commission to submit a legislative proposal on any issue that they consider to be in their interest by submitting 1 million signatures, which represent 0.2% of the population of the European Union."
"Issues relating to the environment, social matters and disasters caused by the financial crisis are among the most sensitive topics that may mobilise citizens to call on the EU to legislate on these matters."
"With the proposal for the citizens' initiative which has been adopted, today, we have put into effect an important element of the Treaty of Lisbon, thanks to which citizens will be able to participate directly in debate about the European Union."
"This is particularly important for the European Parliament, which is elected by popular vote."
"Our role, now, is to give serious attention to this tool, which provides for even greater democratisation of public life in Europe."
"It would not be good if it were a dead letter and the citizens had the impression we are only giving them the theoretical possibility of participating in a legislative initiative."
"It will be an important test for the European institutions as to what extent they are, in fact, serving the citizens and not themselves."
"It is good that after this law has been in force for three years we will be able to revise provisions which have proved to be insufficiently effective, so that it will really be a system which guarantees democratic discussion."
"in writing. - (NL) I have voted in favour of the adoption of rules for the European citizens' initiative."
"The European Parliament has achieved enough in its negotiations with the Council of Ministers."
"The citizens' initiative gives inhabitants of the European Union the possibility of getting a proposal onto the European political agenda."
"Once one million signatures have been collected, the European Commission is obliged to consider the proposal and state reasons why it will or will not turn it into an official legislative proposal."
"The European Union insisted that signatures must be collected from at least nine different EU Member States, but Parliament succeeded in lowering that threshold to seven."
"In addition, organisers who manage to collect a sufficient number of signatures will also be allowed to explain their proposal in person to the European Commission and the European Parliament."
"It is a pity that Parliament has not been able to defeat the rule that eighteen countries must require their citizens to state their identity card number when they sign a citizens' initiative."
"That will scare people off."
"Some will fear identity fraud."
"There are countries that are not going to ask for the identity card number."
"This will create an inequality in the law within the EU."
"How seriously it will take European citizens will now be an issue primarily for the European Commission."
"in writing. - (DE) Today's vote on the European citizens' initiative has established a new element of direct democracy almost exactly a year after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force."
"I took up my mandate in the European Parliament with the aim of putting the concerns of the people of Austria on the table in Brussels."
"I am committed to this principle and, therefore, it is essential for me that the concerns of the people are heard at a European level."
"The European citizens' initiative should be seen as an opportunity to involve people more closely in the EU's decision-making process."
"The citizens of the EU now have the possibility for the first time of submitting legislative initiatives to the Commission and, as a result, actively influencing EU policy."
"Following long negotiations, it can be regarded as a success that the admissibility barrier has been lowered from the level of 300 000 signatures and the number of Member States reduced to a quarter."
"One special feature in Austria is that young people can take part in citizens' initiatives from the age of 16."
"This shows once again that it is important to Austria to include young people in the EU project, because they are ultimately the ones who will take the European spirit forward."
"The European citizens' initiative (ECI) is an instrument of public participation that aims to respond to the democratic deficit and, as such, to reduce the distance that European citizens feel exists between them and European institutions."
"The institutionalisation of this initiative, provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon, makes it possible for European citizens to invite the European Commission, indirectly, to put forward certain legislative measures, provided that these fall within its powers."
"This report, presented by the European Parliament, defines the criteria for implementing this European right of initiative, in order to make it simpler, more accessible, swifter, more transparent and more uniform throughout all Member States."
"The creation of a real European public space will be possible thanks to this initiative, which will boost civil dialogue and the involvement of civil society."
"I believe that all initiatives that aim to reduce distances between citizens and the European project should be emphasised, implemented and carried out in full."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for the report on the citizens' initiative."
"The new provisions introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon boost participatory democracy and mark an important step towards fostering civic spirit."
"Forty-two per cent of European citizens have confidence in EU institutions."
"One of the reasons for this might be that European citizens get to know about few of the European initiatives and policies targeted at them."
"This is precisely why the citizens' initiative not only offers European citizens the opportunity to participate directly in the decision-making process, but also empowers them to make a contribution to setting the European agenda."
"The citizens' initiative will therefore help bring European citizens' major concerns and requests before the European legislative."
"This is not a new concept."
"In 2007 we proposed collecting 1 million signatures to request the Commission to table a directive for integrating people with disabilities into society."
"At the time, only around 700 000 signatures were collected, but the legislative proposals were submitted to the European Commission."
"Consequently, it will be vital, with a view to meeting our commitment to Europe's citizens, for us to ensure that the requests submitted via the citizens' initiative will be turned into legislative acts which will improve the situation of these citizens."
"in writing. - I welcome this report as a way of encouraging citizen engagement in Europe by allowing EU citizens to propose legislation which could have an effect on their daily lives."
"Citizens will be able to let the European Union know what they think of its work."
"With a million signatures that must come from at least a quarter of all EU states, this initiative puts some power back into the hands of the people."
"The procedure has been simplified by Parliament to ensure ease of use and to maximise citizens' participation in the initiative."
"Once all signatures have been verified, the Commission will decide within three months whether a new law can be proposed, and it will have to make its reasons public."
"Reference is often made in this Parliament to the citizens of the European Union, whose interests we represent."
"At the same time, those same citizens have long regarded not only this Parliament, but all European institutions as too distant and insensitive to their problems."
"The European citizens' initiative can change this."
"It will enable citizens to say directly: we want this, we do not want that and this must change."
"We also like to talk about European integration."
"What unites people from different countries, however, more than the need to look for a common view, to formulate a common proposal and to seek the support of people speaking various different languages?"
"The implementation of the citizens' initiative will mean in practice that citizens from various Member States will speak in one voice about the subjects that are important to them."
"A common initiative and a common interest will be the soil from which a true European identity may grow."
"I firmly believe that in the near future this practical sense of European-ness will begin to form."
"I believe that, in contrast to the phrases in the brochures of European institutions, it will be vibrant and viable, because the citizen himself will be the source of the new European identity and the new European-ness."
"I therefore welcome the submitted draft regulation on how the citizens' initiative will be implemented, and I am ready to do all it takes to ensure that the voice of the citizen is not only heard but also respected."
"in writing. - (PT) I believe the Commission's Work Programme for 2011 to be ambitious, having European economic recovery as its main objective, through the political priorities of the EU 2020 Strategy together with the budget within the 2011 multi-annual financial framework, with its new funding and expenditure measures, with a new decision on 'own resources', demonstrating the concern that conditional funding may aggravate the situation of the weaker national economies and not have the desired effect of the EU 2020 Strategy, which is to re-launch the economy."
"I believe that the Structural Funds are essential for the economic recovery and competitiveness of European regions, as in a time of crisis, conditionality added to austerity measures may further adversely affect the internal development of the EU."
"Emphasis needs to be placed on reform of the Common Agriculture and Fisheries Policies and the Cohesion Policy, with the different points of departure of different regions always needing to be taken into account, and this includes measures adapted to the different realities."
"SMEs should play an prominent role, and the approach involving the internationalisation of SMEs within global trade relations and efforts towards their modernisation and competitiveness provided for within the priorities of this work programme is to be applauded."
"in writing. - I would like to draw your attention to certain very important issues that are missing from the Commission Work Programme for next year."
"These concern issues related to human rights. Does the Commission intend to initiate any specific actions or legislation in the area of human rights during the next year?"
"We have heard that Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy Baroness Ashton intends to pay special attention to human rights during her term in office."
"However, there has been very little attention paid so far to human rights in her actions and statements."
"The External Action Service is also meant to beef up EU action in the area of human rights, but now that there is no EU budget for 2011 the EEAS will not be able to fully undertake its duties as from 1 January 2011."
"Can you, Mr President, tell us what your plan B is and how you intend to strengthen the EU's credibility when it comes to defending and promoting human rights in the world?"
"Parliament was called upon to express its opinion on the statement by the Commission on the Commission Work Programme for 2011."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, which draws attention to the need for proper collaboration between the Commission and Parliament and to the Commission's role as guardian of the treaties and of the EU's general interest."
"The resolution also places particular emphasis on the 'Europe 2020' goals of growth for jobs and welcomes the 'European semester' aimed at more effective management of public finances."
"This growth must be smart (it must promote digital technology, research and development and education); sustainable (with a target of 20% greater energy efficiency) and inclusive (by combating discrimination between workers and through better industrial relations)."
"The Commission must look further at the internal market, the area of freedom, security and justice and its external policy, which is still in its infancy."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this European Parliament joint resolution because it discusses and assesses the priorities for the activities of the European Commission in 2011 and future challenges."
"In the last part-session at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, President Barroso presented the Commission Work Programme for the coming year, therefore the European Parliament believes that it is very important to establish a dialogue with the Commission and to pay particular attention to fundamental EU strategic objectives."
"Furthermore, Parliament urges the Commission to ensure a realistic and clearer timetable relating to major proposals to be put forward, which must be effective and translated into reality and better implemented than in the past."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that although the Commission planned to create new jobs and implement the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy as soon as possible, in the field of employment and social affairs there are no specific proposals on the creation of new and high quality jobs in the Commission's programme for the coming year."
"Again the Commission proposes the same legislative initiatives on the posting of workers and working time as it did in the work programme for the previous year, and pledges to improve the rights of migrant workers throughout the European Union."
"Full economic recovery requires a common European strategy for sustainable growth and employment creation, backed by the necessary powers and resources."
"in writing. - (PT) Bearing in mind the fact that the current crisis into which Europe has been plunged continues to have an effect on the economies of the Member States, significant adjustments urgently need to be made at both a national level and in the Union itself."
"Conscious of the fundamental importance that 2011 will have for the success of the future of the Union, and the challenge that this poses to the European Commission, and in a general way to the Union as a whole, I am voting in favour of this draft resolution."
"I would furthermore like to highlight all of the proposals that reveal the European Commission's intention to explore the growth potential of the single market."
"I believe that maximising the potential of the single market, through greater integration of the markets and the strengthening of European company and consumer confidence could have a leverage effect on the European economy."
"However, I believe that the Commission could have gone further on this matter, putting forward more ambitious and concrete proposals to address the needs of those operating within the market."
"The Commission Work Programme 2011 needs a top-up of European Union spirit and greater courage in facing up to the EU's main political and institutional problems, particularly in the light of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and in accordance with this."
"The issues to be tackled include: 1."
"Greater respect for the role of the European Parliament in the formulation of proposals, taking due account of the positions it assumes in its opinions and proposals for initiatives; 2."
"Closer and inter-institutionally more balanced cooperation on the budget and on financial prospects; 3."
"Greater courage in formulating proposals for the efficient use of EU resources that make it possible to achieve binding objectives and concrete benchmarks; 4. effective and incisive EU governance of the economy and finance, as well as financial participation of employees in the success of the company that allow more widespread, balanced and inclusive economic and social development."
"Even though the Commission Work Programme 2011 covers only some of the points listed above, I nevertheless consider it necessary to support it."
"I voted in favour of the resolution relating to the Commission's Work Programme for 2011, which is the first to be adopted within the framework of the new programming period and should contribute to a deepening of the dialogue between Parliament and the Commission, with the aim of improving the relationship between political and budget priorities at EU level."
"in writing. - (PT) The Commission has presented an ambitious Commission Work Programme for 2011, which contains the following basic points: (i) inclusive growth; (ii) sustainable growth and (iii) financial regulation."
"With regard to the subject of inclusive growth, within which the Commission emphasises the sustainability of social security schemes and the fight against poverty, I am in favour of the need to find an exact balance between austerity and social support, and to determine in which direction reforms to European systems of social security should go."
"With regard to the subject of sustainable growth, it is important to understand how the balance between the necessary environmental protection and future reforms of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and common fisheries policy (CFP) will be achieved."
"Finally, with regard to financial regulation and the strengthening of economic governance, any steps to make the European banking system more robust and resistant to crisis scenarios and to strengthen the budgetary policies of Member States and their economic coordination should be seen as a number one priority, as the major challenge for 2011 will be to come out of the crisis and to lay the foundations for a policy of growth."
"We voted against the European Parliament's draft resolution on the European Commission's working programme for 2011 because, on the basic issues, it supports its own positions and ignores the real need for a break with the neoliberal, militarist and antisocial policies that the European Commission favours."
"Although the European Commission has been criticised for not having provided the answers that Parliament was seeking, in reality it has done so, when it congratulates itself on the priority given to economic reform, prioritising budget sustainability and making social sustainability secondary, or when it insists on favouring the deepening of the single market, or when it insists on concluding the Doha round as quickly as possible, and its respective free trade agreements."
"Thus, what the majority in Parliament seek is to continue with the same policy, which is to promote the aforementioned austerity plans within various Member States, regardless of the increase in unemployment, poverty, inequality, asymmetry and economic recession that these austerity plans will cause, while economic and financial groupings continue with ever larger profits."
"For all these reasons, we are compelled to vote against."
"In 2011, the European Commission will publish proposals on amending thecommon agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy."
"Those two initiatives are extremely important to the farmers and fishermen of Ireland."
"in writing. - (DE) In 2011 the Commission will submit its proposal for the multiannual financial framework for 2013 to 2020."
"It is clear to me that the field of agriculture and rural development must have the same level of funding as it does now and that the food sovereignty of the people of Europe must be guaranteed."
"The production of food and the revival of rural regions as economic areas and recreational areas within easy reach of towns must in future be one of Europe's highest priorities."
"The Commission's commitment to sustainable and integrative growth takes into account the environmental and climate objectives for 2020 and requires investment in green technologies, which will in turn create jobs."
"I welcome Parliament's call for the new multiannual financial framework for the period after 2013 to take into consideration the expansion of the EU's responsibilities."
"The plans for the EU's trade policy are of great importance."
"The Commission is obliged to bring the World Trade Organisation negotiations to a positive conclusion."
"We must take a highly critical approach to the increasing focus on bilateral trade agreements, in particular the Mercosur negotiations which will be continuing next year."
"I have just voted in favour of the Commission Work Programme for 2011, but with reservations."
"It no longer contains the promised communication from the Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry (DG ENTERPRISE) on corporate social responsibility (CSR)."
"Instead the Internal Market and Services Directorate General (DG MARKT) has started an online consultation on the disclosure of non-financial information by companies."
"This is alarming and suggests a possible change in policy."
"The DG MARKT is no longer asking whether EU regulation is needed in the field of CSR, but instead how it should be structured."
"The DG ENTERPRISE held several transparency workshops from which it emerged that almost all employers and unions were strongly opposed to mandatory CSR."
"Since 2006, the DG ENTERPRISE has been in overall control, as CSR initiatives represent contributions to a sustainable society by companies as part of their business activities."
"They are the result of entrepreneurial commitment and are based on individual initiative and responsibility."
"There is a consensus about this basic concept which has been developed over a number of years in numerous multi-stakeholder forums."
"The DG ENTERPRISE has the institutional knowledge used to exercise control over these processes."
"I am calling on the Commission to leave the responsibility for managing and structuring CSR with the DG ENTERPRISE."
"I continue to oppose the idea of mandatory CSR reporting, as it will lead to new red tape and discourage companies from making additional voluntary commitments."
"in writing. - The financial crisis has severely damaged the economies of all Europe's Member States."
"In this resolution we call for a strong and determined response from the European Commission, to boost growth and ensure a strong and lasting recovery that benefits all Europe's citizens."
"We support the call for a review of the own-resources system to create a system that is fair, clear, transparent and neutral concerning the tax burden; we welcome consideration of options that would reduce the cost of the EU to its citizens, for example by correcting the current under-taxation of the financial sector."
"in writing. - (PT) The Commission's new Work Programme for 2011 is based on three points: (1) inclusive growth; (2) sustainable growth and (3) financial regulation."
"We will therefore need to work towards achieving the sustainability of social security schemes to fight against poverty, whilst achieving economic growth that is also concerned with the protection of the environment, the strengthening of economic governance, the European banking system becoming stronger and more resistant to future crisis scenarios, and the strengthening of the budget policies of Member States, as the main challenge for 2011 is to come out of the crisis and resume a policy of growth."
"in writing. - Congratulations."
"Finally someone paid attention to the difference between the European Commission and gods."
"It is time to replace idle talking by real work."
"The European Commission should not ignore MEPs' questions; their duty is to fulfil the decisions of the European Parliament."
"It looks like some Commissioners have forgotten that."
"If not, what happened to the resolution on the comprehensive monitoring report adopted by the European Parliament on 11 March 2004 which opened the subject of the aliens in Latvia?"
"It just disappeared from the agenda."
"Who was responsible?"
"Whose salary was cut down?"
"Who was reprimanded?"
"No one."
"Long live the European Council!"
"I voted in favour of the resolution relating to the European Commission's Work Programme for 2011 because I agree with its main objectives."
"It is a fact that the main priority for 2011 should be to push forward with the economic recovery."
"Within the Commission's Work Programme, I would point very positively to the strengthening of economic governance and the completion of reform of the financial sector, through measures enabling growth to be restored in order to create jobs."
"Effective, sustainable and inclusive growth of the economy is essential to restore confidence and optimism within the EU."
"Investment in research and development, energy security and horizontal labour policies that allow for the real movement of workers are therefore the fundamental pillars of a work programme that is geared towards growth."
"The objective of constructing a common area of freedom, security and justice also needs to be emphasised."
"in writing. - (RO) The Commission Work Programme for 2011 does not reflect adequately the significant events which have had an impact on Europe since 2008, or the hopes and expectations of Europe's citizens either."
"It is deplorable that this programme does not focus more on the loss of the 7 million jobs caused by the financial crisis, virtually ensuring constant unemployment in the years to come."
"This aspect is one of the fundamental challenges facing the EU in 2011."
"The Commission will therefore need to find the way in which its initiatives and proposals will create sufficient decent jobs for ordinary citizens."
"The Commission must heed the views of the social partners in the area of pensions and ensure that the future White Paper reflects the stakeholders' expectations, which includes strengthening the first pillar, which is the public pillar."
"I welcome the revamp of the EURES job information and advice portal aimed at young workers to make it more accessible to them."
"However, I regret that this proposal has been postponed until 2012, when today's young people need it now."
"The Commission's programme makes no reference to the gender issue."
"As a result, a European directive is needed which will tackle the 17.4% pay gap between women and men, along with a directive on eradicating violence against women."
"in writing. - (DE) As the voting list was changed at short notice, I did not have enough time to check the contents and to decide on one side or the other."
"in writing. - The Greens/EFA have supported the proposed common resolution, as well as many of the amendments suggested."
"I'm glad that the reference remained untouched where we say that the EP strongly urges the Commission to come forward with bold and innovative proposals for a substantive revision of the own resources system."
"I endorsed the adoption of the resolution on the Commission Work Programme 2011."
"In a previous speech, I have raised the issues of the need to prepare a draft directive on violence against women, rapid and efficient transposition of the Stockholm Programme and the inclusion of sport in next year's budget."
"It is also essential to renew work on the non-discrimination directive."
"I appeal to the Commission and Member States for decisive steps to be made in this direction in 2011."
"While EU citizens impatiently await this directive, some Member States are continuing to question the validity of adopting it."
"It is hard to understand the lack of awareness of the need to have a single anti-discrimination law which would protect the equal treatment of all people and not just of select social groups."
"I am not persuaded by the financial arguments which emphasise the high costs of introducing the directive in relation to disabled people."
"Even during a crisis, Europe must continue to treat all its citizens equally."
"The Commission has presented its Work Programme for 2011 at a particularly delicate time for the European Union."
"Recovery from the economic crisis is still not completely established, meaning that the programme for next year needs to continue to be focused on a dynamic of the recovery of the European economy."
"2011 should be the year that the EU 2020 Strategy becomes integrated into European proceedings, with a view to pursuing the objectives of smart, sustainable and integrated growth."
"I reiterate the importance of re-establishing job-creating growth by accelerating the EU 2020 programme of reforms."
"Within this context, I would emphasise the role of the following flagship initiatives: Innovation Union, Digital Agenda, New Skills and Jobs, and the Platform against Poverty."
"I believe it essential to ensure structural reform in order to improve European competitiveness and to speed up economic growth, specifically through a policy of cohesion that encourages investment in the real economy."
"Any future cohesion policy should also ensure that the new multi-annual financial framework is directed towards achieving the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy, and European policies within the framework of Lisbon."
"The European Parliament needs to take an active part in this, and it is essential that the Commission urgently comes up with a model of inter-institutional cooperation for this."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution because the EU and the African Union (AU) must jointly address key issues of common concern in order to successfully implement the partnership between Africa and the EU which is based on the mutual interest in exploiting their combined potentials."
"For there to be closer cooperation, democratic governance and human rights must be ensured, but regrettably Mr Robert Mugabe was invited to and actively participated in the 3rd Africa EU-Summit."
"I therefore call for all actors to take a stronger political stance in future in order to send a clear message of the EU's firm belief in the rule of law and democracy."
"It is also important for all member states of the African Union to ratify the African Union Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance and to fully support the International Criminal Court."
"This would safeguard the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and at the same time would open up opportunities to effective cooperation in economic, social, cultural and other fields."
"Since the Cairo EU-Africa Summit in 2000, the European Union has launched an extremely wide-reaching external policy on Africa."
"In 2005, the EU launched its strategy for Africa."
"Two years later, the standpoint was different and this time, the Lisbon EU-Africa Summit ended with the creation of a strategic partnership with Africa."
"The third Africa-EU Summit ended just recently."
"It was not a complete success: for example we did not welcome the presence of the dictator Robert Mugabe and, conversely, would have welcomed the presence of a representative from Sudan."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the future of partnership."
"The new action plan is based on eight major new themes: 1- peace and security; 2 - democratic governance and human rights; 3 - trade, regional integration and infrastructure; 4 - the millennium development goals; 5 - energy; 6 - climate change; 7 - migration, mobility and employment; 8 - science, information society and space."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution."
"It is necessary to further develop the strategic partnership between Africa and the European Union, in order to meet common challenges together, promote sustainable economic growth and develop cooperation in the fields of energy, trade and climate change."
"In developing cooperation it is necessary to give significant support to the fight against poverty, the protection of human rights, including social, economic and environmental rights and to address peace and security challenges on the African continent."
"I welcome the Africa-EU Renewable Energy Cooperation Programme and commitments made to provide Africans with access to modern and sustainable energy services, to increase the use of renewable energy in Africa and improve energy efficiency in Africa in all sectors."
"The EU and Africa should unite their efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and take effective measures to combat climate change."
"The necessary financing should be provided to implement the actions outlined, ensuring effective parliamentary oversight of the use of EU financial assistance."
"in writing. - (PT) I was pleased to vote in favour of this joint motion for a resolution on the conclusions of the third EU-Africa Summit."
"In the light of the African continent's need to diversify its investment partnerships, specifically with Asian countries and Latin America, the proposed 2010-2013 EU-Africa strategic action plan is particularly relevant, in that it could add value to the Union for the Mediterranean and the Cotonou Agreement."
"I believe that the regional integration of African countries through the African Union, and trade and investment in this context, will take on a crucial importance for political and economic stability and sustainable growth in Africa."
"I hope, therefore, that African and EU leaders will not only honour the Tripoli agreement, but also recognise this strategic partnership, among others things, to be a valuable instrument for promoting intra-regional African trade."
"I also share President Barroso's conviction that renewable energy is vital for Africa's economic and social development, and support his call for a green energy revolution in Africa."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the future of the Africa-EU Strategic Partnership during the period preceding the 3rd Africa-EU Summit because I believe that the partnership established between the two continents three years ago, during the Portuguese Presidency of the EU, should continue to be strengthened, so that together, we can face common challenges and promote sustainable development, peace and human rights."
"I was in Lisbon in December 2007 when the first EU-Africa Summit took place, launching the basis for permanent dialogue between Europe and the African continent, to which we are linked by extremely important historical, cultural, economic and commercial ties, opening up a path to cooperation that took European and African leaders to Tripoli, 3 years later."
"I believe that a lasting and healthy EU-Africa partnership is fundamental to development and progress, and I therefore believe that the investment that both parties have made in strengthening their relations is fully justified."
"We live in a time in which traditional cooperation policies, implemented through mere humanitarian aid, no longer respond to the needs of developing countries, especially on the African continent."
"Thus I believe that the future of cooperation will move, in a very definite way, towards establishing commercial relationships and economic partnerships, as well as towards an effective exchange in the areas of research, innovation and education, areas in which EU-Africa cooperation needs to be strengthened."
"in writing. - (PT) The 3rd EU-Africa Summit took place in Tripoli between 29 and 30 November 2010."
"I regret that the Africa-EU Joint Strategy was not able to establish a new strategic relationship."
"I reiterate my hope for a fruitful agreement at the next Summit and sustainable objectives for both partners, with the aim of combating poverty and guaranteeing fair income and support, as well as upholding basic human rights, including social, economic and environmental rights, in Africa."
"The challenges for African countries are immense, within the context of a serious crisis in the world economy."
"The crisis, presented as financial, has finally exposed the limits of economic growth, as understood by capitalism, namely the availability of fertile land for the production of food and other organic raw materials, and geological reserves for the extraction of mineral raw materials and energy to run industries."
"This situation is accelerating the scramble for Africa, a continent that is immensely rich in natural resources."
"The aim is the domination of markets and natural resources."
"The EU's policy towards Africa should be understood in this context; blackmail for the signing of so-called Economic Partnership Agreements; the promotion of the secession of Southern Sudan; support and funding for the African Peace and Security Architecture, which seeks to position its armies so as to repress its people; in order to serve the interests of the EU and its economic and financial groupings."
"These are just some examples."
"This resolution is therefore about neo-colonialism."
"The ties that keep the countries in this region subjugated to interests that are alien to its people need to be loosened, establishing genuine cooperation and helping them to consolidate their independence and sovereignty with a view to their economic and social development and progress."
"in writing. - (PT) It has been three years now since the last Africa-EU Summit, which was the start of a dialogue that has been sought between Europe and the African continent."
"This partnership is fundamental for development and progress, and it is important that both parties strive to strengthen their relations."
"Partnerships should not only relate to Community assistance; commercial relationships and economic partnerships should also be established, with exchanges of experiences within the fields of research, innovation and education, thus strengthening future relations."
"The Africa-EU strategic partnership is the European Union's only tool covering intercontinental relations."
"It marks a shift in the relationship between the EU and Africa: they are becoming genuine partners dealing with each other on an equal footing and covering a wide range of subjects of shared interest in their dialogue."
"This is no longer a relationship between donors and recipients."
"It is a strategically important relationship and needs to be revitalised and strengthened if both Europe and Africa are to cope with the challenges that lie ahead of us."
"I am referring to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, the food crisis, the economic and financial crisis, climate change, and so on. The theme of the Tripoli Summit: 'Investment, Economic Growth and Job Creation', is a reminder that peace and security, economic and political governance and respect for human rights are pre-requisites for development."
"Legal and judicial protection of private investment is one of the keys to Africa's economic and social development."
"There can be no social, human and economic development if there is no prosperity."
"in writing. - This future is dim, especially now, on the eve of the Africa-EU Summit."
"The best way to ensure it is to finance the public education programmes."
"People who can get secondary school education would prefer to live in their countries rather to beg in Europe."
"We must support the governments that focus their efforts on making their countries attractive to their own citizens."
"I voted in favour."
"in writing. - (DE) It is important for the EU to become closely involved with the African states and to tackle existing and future challenges by means of a common strategy."
"These include, in particular, bringing democracy to Africa, improving the living conditions of the people there and also the sustainable exploitation of raw materials, which offers benefits for both sides."
"Another problem which needs to be resolved is corruption."
"It prevents many African states from developing in a way which would improve the welfare of their citizens."
"Unfortunately, millions of euros of aid from the EU is continuing to disappear as a result of corruption."
"This could be used constructively for the direct benefit of the citizens."
"We must apply the principle of helping people to help themselves."
"Unfortunately, the resolution takes no account of this and simply envisages the continuation of existing practices."
"Poverty is one of the main reasons why people emigrate from Africa and come to Europe."
"Instead of questioning the European practice of export subsidies, which have a massive impact on the ability of some African states to survive, we keep coming up with more empty words."
"The negative consequences of migration are being glossed over and, therefore, I felt obliged to vote against this resolution."
"European Union/Africa relations are clearly fundamental."
"I am therefore pleased with the adoption of the 2010-2013 Strategic Action Plan and with the partnerships established."
"Among these I would point to the one relating to peace and security, together with the EU's efforts to provide predictable and sustainable funding for African peace-keeping operations, and to the need to create local empowerment, resilience and determination to protect civilians during armed conflicts."
"I should also emphasise the efforts towards cooperation on questions of common interest, such as: democratic governance and human rights; trade, regional integration and infrastructure, and the Millennium Development Goals."
"Within the context of this final aspect, the pledge by European Union countries to renew the commitment to allocate 0.7% of their gross national income to development aid by 2015 should be emphasised."
"This effort is crucial for meeting the Millinnium Development Goals, in particular with regard to specific policies on maternal, neonatal and child health, sex, education, agricultural policy, sustainable development, access to water and sanitation."
"I regret the presence of the President of Zimbabwe, Mr Mugabe, at the summit held in Tripoli on 30 November, and the absence of numerous European Heads of State or Government."
"I also note that the new United States 'Conflict Minerals' law is a huge step forward to combat the illegal exploitation of minerals in Africa."
"I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to submit similar proposals to guarantee the traceability of minerals imported into the EU market and on the African Union to cooperate in the sustainable exploitation of raw materials sector."
"Hopes that the lessons will be learned from the difficulties which arose during the implementation of the first 'Action Plan', for 2008-2010 and hopes that the intentions expressed in principle in the Final Declaration by Heads of State and of Government will be acted on; 4. Notes with interest that both the private sector and civil society, particularly from Africa, could be allowed to make a far more effective contribution to the strategy than has been the case to date."
"in writing. - (NL) An American law has already placed curbs on the illegal exploitation of 'conflict minerals'."
"The joint resolution on the future EU-Africa strategy calls on the EU to do the same."
"Minerals which are imported into the EU must be traceable."
"Today, illegal exploitation is far too often the cause of civil wars and conflicts in the region, while this wealth could actually be an engine for sustainable economic development."
"Action in the areas of capacity building, good governance, infrastructure development and investment are crucial."
"A policy which is characterised by participation, which is socially and environmentally responsible and which benefits the people is indispensable."
"Agriculture, too, is an engine for development."
"This is why we need to strengthen the agriculture and fisheries sectors in a sustainable way, especially as regards small farmers and fishermen."
"The debate around agricultural land and land ownership should be conducted thoroughly."
"The Cancún Agreement is essential for tackling poverty in Africa, given the enormous potential of natural resources - sunshine, wind, rivers and tides - which African countries often possess in abundance."
"The text of the resolution does not avoid the controversial issues and I have, therefore, accepted it."
"The 3rd Africa-EU Summit, which took place in the capital of Libya, Tripoli, sought to strengthen the level of cooperation between the two continents."
"On the subject of Growth, Investment and Job Creation, this Summit emphasised the need to create economic growth, capable of generating employment, alongside sustainable social development."
"The Africa-EU strategy will be put into practice in line with the action plan adopted for the period 2010-2013, which focuses on eight priority areas already established during the Lisbon Summit in 2007."
"Concrete measures relating to private entrepreneurship, economic integration and social questions, to peace and security on the African continent, to respect for human rights and the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals were all mentioned in the final Tripoli declaration."
"First and foremost, I applaud this partnership between the two continents, which has demonstrated added value for both partners and the importance of continuing to boost the regional and global integration of the African continent."
"However, I believe it is important for the European Parliament to take a more active role in this partnership, and for a funding plan for the effective implementation of the 2010-2013 action plan to be drawn up."
"The importance of the protection and promotion of human rights and basic freedoms is at the centre of the democratic values of the European Union itself."
"I agree that local and regional authorities could have a pivotal role in the implementation of these values, and propose a bottom-up approach."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon should be seen as a strengthening of the system at several levels of the protection of human rights, including the Charter."
"It has become necessary to reflect on developments in the protection of these rights following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, remembering that the Charter has the same legal value as the Treaties, and needs to be incorporated in EU primary legislation."
"The new horizontal obligations created by the Treaty of Lisbon are to be welcomed, and efforts between institutions need to be better coordinated for the sake of their effectiveness."
"It should also be recalled that a new 'Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship' portfolio has been created within the Commission, and new action is to be expected from the Commission within the context of this new scenario."
"Tangible results may be expected to be achieved from the new Commission communication: Strategy for the effective implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights by the EU."
"For a very long time, European integration consisted simply of working on the creation of the internal market."
"However, over the last ten years an unprecedented desire to emulate has come over EU legislators."
"In the beginning, there was an automatic tacit division of labour between the Council of Europe, responsible for matters concerning individual freedoms, and the embryonic single market that was the European Community."
"However, it was not long before the Member States' national courts had to deal with disputes challenging Community law on the grounds of human rights."
"This is why, after a long period of gestation, the Charter of Fundamental Rights was adopted in 2000 and came into force last year with the Treaty of Lisbon."
"With the Charter, the European Court of Justice has a single legal basis under which to protect European citizens' fundamental rights."
"However, this new system is only just beginning."
"This is why I supported this text, which reminds all the European parties concerned, including Member States and institutions, of their duties under the Charter and of the need to develop a genuine culture of civil liberties and effective collaboration on the subject."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report."
"The effective protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms constitutes the core of democracy and the rule of law in the EU."
"I therefore support the obligation strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon to ensure the protection of fundamental human rights, combat social exclusion and discrimination and to promote social justice and protection."
"Even if this is achieved, it is necessary to ensure cooperation between the European Union and national institutions, establishing effective inter-institutional cooperation to monitor the situation of human rights in the EU."
"The Commission should continuously monitor the implementation of legislation in the field of human rights protection at national level and, in the case of gaps, should provide proposals for specific measures."
"It would be useful for a report on the situation of fundamental rights in the EU to be issued annually to make sure EU citizens are properly informed on the new fundamental rights architecture."
"Furthermore, the EU institutions should increase cooperation with international organisations in the area of the protection of human rights."
"in writing. - (LT) I am delighted that since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, we have made some significant achievements in the field of human rights, firstly because the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights became legally binding, and secondly because the European Union is obliged to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"I voted in favour of this report, because as far as the European Union strategy on the rights of the child is concerned, it is very important to develop practical measures to combat child abuse, sexual exploitation and child pornography and to promote safer use of the internet and to eliminate child labour and child poverty."
"Combating trafficking in human beings, particularly women and children, is another pressing challenge."
"Although numerous EU and national laws have already been adopted in this area, several hundred thousand people are trafficked each year to the EU or within the EU, and therefore there is an urgent need to apply the new proposed European Union directive on combating trafficking in human beings."
"The effective protection of fundamental rights and respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law should be a global objective for all European policies and an essential condition for the consolidation of the European area of Freedom, Security and Justice."
"The year 2009-2010 was of major importance in this respect, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, within which the Charter of Fundamental Rights became legally binding, thus transforming fundamental values into concrete rights, directly enforceable by European and national courts."
"It needs to be ensured that all new legislative proposals conform to the Charter and, by the same logic, that all instruments already in place are checked."
"It is important that cooperation and coherence between the various bodies responsible is strengthened, at a European and national level, for the purposes of the control and application of this new general framework established by the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to ensure its effective application."
"I also hope that the Commission completes, as quickly as possible, the process of the EU's membership of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which will provide an additional mechanism for the respect of human rights."
"I am very pleased that citizens and the protection of their rights have finally been placed at the centre of Europe's architecture."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report relating to fundamental rights within the European Union (2009) - Effective implementation following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, because I believe it to be necessary to promote a culture of fundamental rights within the European Union and the Member States."
"The protection of fundamental rights should be an objective of all European policies, especially foreign policy, in the interests of promoting peace, human rights and basic freedoms."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon creates a new paradigm in the area of fundamental rights within the Union, and makes the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding."
"We have an obligation to position the Union as a community that protects fundamental rights, both internally and externally."
"There are still far too many attacks on freedom of expression, as I have reported a number of times, as in the recent cases in Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan."
"In this resolution, the rapporteur points out several situations that are more urgent and frequent, both within Member States and within the European Union as a whole."
"The challenge now is to respond to these questions, and to adopt the strategies and measures required to solve these problems."
"in writing. - (PT) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon created a new situation within the EU in the area of human rights by making the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding and by giving the European Union the status of a legal entity, which enables it to sign up to international treaties."
"The effective protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms are the basis of democracy and the rule of law within the European Union, and an essential condition for the consolidation of the European area of Freedom, Security and Justice, which requires action at several levels (international, European, national, regional and local)."
"Within this context it is worth mentioning the important role that regional and local authorities can fulfil in the concrete application and promotion of these rights."
"I am also pleased with the invitation to the Commission to designate 2013 the 'European Year for Citizenship', in order to bolster the debate on European citizenship and inform European citizens about their new rights following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"As usual, the report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union has given rise to two perverse trends: the first consisting of demanding more and more rights for all kinds of minorities, to the detriment of those of the majority of our fellow citizens; the second consisting of castigating patriotic political movements and heaping the same old leftist, libellous insults on them, while attempting to dispute the legitimacy of their election victories and curb their freedom of expression."
"This militant xenophilia and anti-patriotism are very wearing."
"You are not in a position to judge the results of democratic elections held in democratic countries."
"The recent victories of national parties in France, Hungary, Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands and elsewhere are not a sign of some worrying perversion."
"They are a sign that Europe's citizens are tired of your policies, your lax attitude towards immigration, your weakness in defending our nations' economic interests, your complacency towards the financial interests of the powerful and your undermining of our social welfare systems."
"It is you who are continuously infringing their rights, especially their rights to security, to employment, to a decent wage, to the preservation of their culture and to determine their own futures."
"In the forum of the European Parliament, we have raised matters related to human rights violations, the principles of democracy and discrimination against national minorities many times, and we continue to do so."
"We award the Sakharov Prize, we support humanitarian measures and we strive to attain rights and privileges not only for the people of Europe, but of the whole world."
"However, I greatly regret that we are still unable to enforce respect for fundamental human rights in the Union's Member States."
"The Polish national minority in Lithuania, which comprises nearly 7% of the entire population, is still suffering discrimination, and its rights are being flagrantly violated."
"Yet again, I appeal to the Members of the European Parliament who are assembled in this Chamber, and also to the President of the European Parliament, the Commission and the European Council, to take effective steps to ensure that the Lithuanian Government upholds the principles of democracy and respects the dignity of its citizens."
"in writing. - The ECR Group is a staunch supporter of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"We believe that the EU has a role to play in the defence of fundamental rights; however, it is the Member States who carry the first responsibility, in line with their traditions of democracy and the rule of law."
"We are of the opinion that the Gál report certainly contains good elements, but overall it stresses too much the role of the EU in areas which we believe to be the exclusive competence of the Member States, such as immigration and judicial systems."
"Therefore we have had to abstain in the vote today on this report."
"in writing. - (PT) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has created more responsibilities for the EU with regard to the creation of a culture of defending fundamental rights within the EU and Member States."
"It is essential that the EU promotes protection of fundamental rights not only domestically but also throughout the world, where unfortunately major attacks on these rights continue to take place."
"Only in this way can peace, human rights and fundamental freedoms be promoted."
"in writing. - (ES) As the report states, I regret the fact that neither the Council nor the Commission have followed the recommendations of the 2007 report on the use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners and that they have not shared information on this with Parliament."
"I support the general assessment regarding the need for the EU to redouble its efforts in order to prevent violations of fundamental human rights, which in too many cases have been suffered this year by immigrants and third-country nationals who live in the European Union."
"Although I do not agree with part of the report's assessment of the EU's role in the world as a guarantor of human rights and the role of the European External Action Service, as it is vague regarding the compatibility of that role with the need to respect the principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other states, I voted in favour of the report because I support its general spirit in terms of the need for the European Union to respect human rights in all aspects of its work."
"The protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms are central to democracy and the rule of law in the European Union."
"The accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights will contribute a further mechanism for upholding human rights, namely the possibility of taking cases to the European Court of Human Rights."
"It is also important that the EU institutions and the Member States renew their efforts on awareness-raising, to ensure that citizens are aware of these fundamental rights, thus ensuring that these rights are better protected."
"There also needs to be more effective cooperation with the international organisations working to protect fundamental rights and freedoms."
"The European Union needs to devise a strategy on the rights of the child, through practical measures to combat abuse, sexual exploitation and child pornography and to promote safe use of the Internet and eradicate child labour and child poverty."
"Combating human trafficking, especially that of women and children, which constitutes an intolerable form of slavery, must remain a priority."
"in writing. - (DE) Human rights and fundamental freedoms play a central role in democracy and the rule of law."
"Therefore, it is important to ensure that these basic values are safeguarded within the European Union."
"The right to freedom of speech, religion, assembly and association, together with the right of free movement and of respect for human integrity and dignity, are the cornerstones of a free society."
"I did not vote in favour of the report because it did not focus on Christian values and the restrictions on residents caused by immigration."
"in writing. - (DE) The EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, is problematic."
"It puts fundamental rights in the EU under the control of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR)."
"Apart from the legal problems which judges in the Court of Justice of the European Union are also warning about, it is clear that a court which passes a judgment opposing the presence of crosses in classrooms is not a suitable decision-making body for the EU."
"The cross is the symbol of Christianity, which is one of the foundations of Europe and of our fundamental values."
"The ECtHR has also recently attracted attention with its judgments, including its attempt to prevent transfers under the Dublin II Regulation from Austria to Greece."
"The ECtHR seems to believe that the Member States with the best systems of social services should bear the entire burden of refugees in the EU."
"This judgment by the ECtHR will not lead to the improved integration of refugees and is not an effective way of resolving the asylum challenges faced by the EU."
"In addition, the neutrality of the ECtHR judges is not guaranteed."
"One of the judges admitted that he would look more closely at appeals from asylum seekers than at other cases."
"Giving preferential treatment to some of the parties who are lodging appeals is inappropriate."
"In addition, one judge at the ECtHR comes from Turkey, where human rights are not respected and which has areas of the EU under military occupation."
"For me the ECtHR is neither European nor a court of human rights."
"Therefore, I have voted against this report."
"The heart of democracy and the rule of law is the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"After the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon last year, the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights became legally binding, outlining a new European legal framework in which the universal values expressed in the Charter finally became concrete rights."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Gál because this text approves the effective implementation of fundamental rights in the European Union after Lisbon."
"This is not only an internal step by the EU but also an external stance for the safeguarding and protection of human rights and the promotion of peace for the welfare of citizens in an atmosphere where the law guarantees peace of mind, safety and justice."
"I voted today in favour of the report on the situation of fundamental rights in the EU."
"This report provides added value by clarifying the role which the EU institutions will play in the fundamental rights sector in the new European architecture, especially after the Treaty of Lisbon, by promoting greater transparency, democratic control and access to documents between the EU bodies."
"As regards the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is now binding and covers a broad range of rights, the Commission has been called upon to draft an annual report on compliance with the provisions of the Charter with an evaluation of the application of the various rights."
"This report emphasises the obligations resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to combating social exclusion and discrimination, and promoting justice and social protection, equality between men and women, solidarity between the generations and the protection of children's rights."
"The emphasis on these points, together with the explicit reference to people belonging to minorities, another fundamental value of the European Union, was the reason for my vote in favour."
"I support the position of the European Parliament in its request to the Comission to conclude the negotiations and technical consultations so that the European Union may accede without further delay to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"in writing. - With this report the EP stresses, once again, that the effective protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms constitutes the core of democracy and the rule of law in the EU and an essential condition of the consolidation of the European area of freedom, security and justice and that it requires actions at various levels (international, European, national, regional and local level); stresses, moreover, the role that regional and local authorities can play in the concrete implementation and in the promotion of such rights; therefore calls on all EU institutions, Member States' governments and parliaments to build on the new institutional and legal framework created by the Treaty of Lisbon to devise a comprehensive internal human rights policy for the Union which ensures effective accountability mechanisms, both at national and EU level, to address human rights violations."
"I endorsed the Gál report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union (2009)."
"I would like to draw attention to paragraph 13, which calls for full and consistent implementation of the Stockholm Programme."
"In September this year, Mr Barroso assured us of the intensive work being carried out by the Commission in this area."
"It is important to maintain the schedule of this work and its smooth progress."
"All Europeans must be able to benefit from the same rights."
"In the Europe of the 21st century there is no place for discrimination."
"I would like to ask the Hungarian and Polish Presidencies to say what action they intend to take in order to implement the Stockholm Programme efficiently."
"We must meet our obligations to the citizens and implement the legislation which we make."
"I would also like to stress that pursuant to paragraph 39 of the resolution, the Member States should provide ongoing training of national judges on fundamental rights and freedoms, including the new aspects in the field after the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Even the best law will not change anything, if it is not properly interpreted and implemented."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution because it is necessary to take measures to stop unfair commercial practices in the area of advertising, which above all have a negative impact on consumers."
"In order to achieve tangible results it is important to step up European cooperation in combating unfair online advertising practices, and the most vulnerable groups of people such as children, adolescents, the elderly and so on need special protection."
"It should be pointed out that there is a lack of information about consumers' rights in respect of advertising, and I therefore support the proposal to take steps to facilitate access to information and make advertising more transparent."
"It is also essential to develop a critical attitude to the quality of media content, because well-informed consumers are in a stronger position."
"I believe that in view of the lack of advertising literacy, we should introduce a special education programme, aimed at children and adolescents and designed to make them advertising-literate by enhancing their understanding of advertising and teaching them how to interpret it."
"The European Union has made it a point of honour to protect consumers within the internal market."
"This is not simply a matter of ethics, but one of political strategy."
"Greater consumer confidence in the range of products crowding onto the market stimulates demand."
"In this respect, the role of advertising is ambivalent."
"It is a powerful tool for developing demand but at the same time, due to questionable practices, it can sometimes be a negative factor in the functioning of the market."
"These violations are more frequent in Internet advertising and the main victims are the weakest among us."
"I voted in favour of this resolution calling on the Commission, at the end of a consultation and study already undertaken by Parliament, to take the necessary measures to reform the current regulations."
"Addressing these new fraudulent practices will be one more step towards a single market that respects individuals."
"I voted in favour of this report on the impact of advertising on consumer behaviour."
"Misleading and aggressive advertising is worrying consumers and businesses, and there are some good suggestions in the report to address this."
"European consumers and businesses need to be protected from companies engaged in misleading advertising."
"To this end, the people and businesses of the EU must be made aware of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive and the Directive on Misleading and Comparative Advertising so that they understand their rights."
"Goods like alcohol and online gambling must be controlled so that vulnerable consumers are protected."
"I particularly welcome the fact that this report requests the Commission to study the impact of the aggressive advertising on vulnerable consumers and to correctly apply the relevant laws on child protection."
"Of concern are behavioural advertising and the emerging practice of aggressive advertising, such as using social networks and reading e-mail to obtain information for use in advertising."
"The Commission must address these attacks on consumer privacy."
"With the rapid evolution of advertising technologies and the spread of advertising via the internet, mobile telephones and social networks, it is necessary to take effective measures to protect the consumer from the impact of unwanted and misleading advertising."
"Particular attention should be paid to the most vulnerable groups of people, including children and adolescents."
"Cooperation between the Member States in combating unfair online advertising practices should be stepped up, in order to avoid the consequences of internal market distortion and unfair commercial practices."
"Furthermore, there is a need to provide consumers with more information about their rights in the area of advertising and to make this information more accessible and transparent."
"The Commission should continuously monitor and assess the application of legislation regulating unfair commercial practices in the Member States and prepare reports on the implementation of legislation."
"As there is still a lack of information on the socio-psychological effects of advertising on the consumer, it is necessary to take action to research these effects."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report because it deals with unfair commercial practices in the field of advertising, and concentrates on issues arising from the development of new advertising practices and technologies."
"I would like to point out that advertising has a major impact on gender equality, particularly when advertising often communicates discriminatory and/or undignified messages based on all forms of gender stereotyping, which hinder gender equality strategies."
"I therefore agree that the European Parliament should call on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that the media and advertising professionals guarantee respect for human dignity and make every effort to combat discrimination and any incitement to hatred based on sex, race, ethnic origin, age, religious or other beliefs, sexual orientation, disability and social status."
"As for the protection of vulnerable groups of people, the Commission should study the impact of misleading and aggressive advertising on vulnerable consumers."
"I would like to stress that children, teenagers and the elderly in particular need special protection against the negative impact of advertising."
"Advertising involves unfair practices and intrusion into public and private spaces, while making a number of target public groups vulnerable."
"Internet advertising is the area which has enjoyed considerable expansion in recent years, generating a current value of more than EUR 14 billion on the European market alone."
"It is important for us to step up European cooperation in combating unfair online advertising practices in view of the success of the 'sweeps', that is, systematic, simultaneous website checks carried out by Member States, which have so far been confined to three sectors:airline tickets, mobile phone ring tones and electronic devices."
"These checks should be much more frequent and their scope of application extended."
"Self-regulation of national markets addresses rapid developments in the advertising sector, with the focus on instilling responsible attitudes among players and disseminating good practices."
"Self-regulation must be encouraged at EU level in order to establish a tradition of self-discipline and responsible communication."
"The European Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which covers the aspects relating to online advertising as part of the relations between companies and consumers, has become inadequate because the area of online advertising is evolving every day."
"Social networks have seen a scale of expansion which was not envisaged a few years ago."
"I voted in favour of this report on the impact of advertising on consumer behaviour."
"Indeed, considering the influence that advertising exercises on consumers and the economy, it is more necessary than ever to take action to prevent certain unfair advertising practices from influencing and conditioning commercial choices."
"The spread of new systems of communication, such as the Internet, mean that even greater attention must be paid to consumers and in particular to more vulnerable sections of society, such as children and adolescents."
"It is our duty to combat the spread of untruthful and misleading information and above all certain practices, such as e-mail spam, which invades the private lives of users and their privacy."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Juvin, when he calls for action to be focused on the suppression of unfair advertising practices by broadening the scope of the directive in force."
"I believe that the measure we have voted on today offers an appropriate balance between freedom of expression and consumer protection."
"Advertising is a fundamental instrument for the existence of a functioning market and for competition, and, in the final analysis, for consumers, given that, if duly regulated, it ensures a more informed choice."
"However, new technologies at the service of advertising are opening up a new area for the development of new, unfair promotional practices, which justifies a change to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive."
"In order for advertising to fulfil its basic functions within a free and competitive market, it needs to be well regulated, and commercial practices that distort the market need to be duly punished."
"This is particularly important for forms of online advertising via Internet and telephone, which often reach the public in an unsolicited manner, and raise important questions relating, among other things, to unfair practices and the unauthorised use of personal data."
"This is why I believe this to be an excellent initiative that merits my support."
"in writing. - (PT) This report concerns unfair commercial practices in the area of advertising, defined within the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD), and focuses on the problems inherent in the development of new advertising practices and technologies."
"The report does not concern relations between companies (B2B), which are specifically covered by Directive 2006/114/EC."
"Unfair practices in advertising take many forms: invasion of the public space and sphere, and focusing on people who are particularly vulnerable, such as children."
"Given that young people and children are those most exposed to advertising on the internet, I am in favour of the need to develop an integrated European policy for combating the unregulated use of the Internet and means of communication."
"To do this I propose the creation of a new, mandatory area that is specifically aimed at learning about the risks associated with the use of the Internet and means of communication, especially with regard to unfair advertising practices, directed at primary school children, and a mandatory subject within the final year of studying or training for primary school teachers and childcare workers to learn how to prepare the children for the safe and responsible use of the internet and means of communication, together with ongoing training for education professionals in this area."
"The evolution of communication media and Internet developments have contributed to the spread of hidden advertising messages and unfair advertising practices that often invade the private lives of consumers."
"It is essential to carefully consider the consequences that this may have on the most vulnerable groups, which must be protected from damaging and uncontrolled drip-feeding of advertising."
"We must also not forget that sometimes advertising conveys social stereotypes associated, for example, with an overly casual view of sexuality and violence, or inappropriate messages that can negatively affect the behaviour of impressionable children and adolescents who still lack the necessary critical faculties."
"It is therefore necessary to update the legislation in force on the subject and ensure better implementation and interpretation of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive."
"Lastly, I should like to emphasise that it is essential that consumers should be properly informed of the way that collected data is used and processed, particularly in cases where the data is demanded from them in exchange for price reductions and other promotional offers."
"To this end, it would be useful to promote effective information campaigns on relevant consumer rights and thus seek to compensate for the lack of knowledge about issues associated with the use of personal data."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the report on the impact of advertising on consumer behaviour because I am in agreement with the rapporteur that, in the digital era, advertising has taken on a new dimension which necessitates - as the rapporteur has recommended - the implementation of an EU website labelling system modelled on the European Privacy Seal, certifying a site's compliance with the data protection laws."
"Consumers need to have information which is clear, non-manipulative and objective in order to be able to make intelligent decisions."
"Sophisticated and aggressive marketing techniques have over the years prevented consumers from making informed choices with regard to goods and services."
"This is especially so with regard to citizens who are particularly vulnerable, such as children."
"We need to have a more disciplined approach which truly safeguards citizens' interests."
"in writing. - (LT) I approve of this report because it deals with unfair commercial practices in the field of advertising, as defined in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, and concentrates on issues arising from the development of new advertising practices and technologies."
"Advertising is a tool that benefits both the internal market, in other words, oiling the wheels of economic activity by stimulating competition, competitiveness, innovation and creativity, and consumers by increasing choice and lowering prices."
"It is a key economic sector: the EU online advertising market alone is worth more than EUR 14 billion."
"It must not be idealised, however: advertising can also involve unfair practices, intrude into public spaces such as advertising billboards and the private arena such as unsolicited e-mails, target vulnerable groups of people such as children and those in excessive debt, create potential entry barriers to the internal market where the outlay required is too high, distort the internal market by causing consumers to buy goods or services they would not normally have purchased and cause huge losses."
"As a result of these and other problems that have arisen due to the use of new technologies, the rapporteur proposes a series of measures for consumer protection."
"While personalised advertising, for example, offers of products or services tailored to consumers' tastes, is not in itself a problem, it must not lead to the development of intrusive advertising based on consumer tracking, which breaches the principles of data protection and privacy."
"in writing. - (DE) We want consumers to be responsible, well-informed and in a position to make sensible decisions."
"Our aim is to supply consumers with all the information they need to allow them to take the right decisions in economic terms."
"Advertising also makes an important contribution to providing consumers with information."
"However, it must contain objective, reliable and relevant details, otherwise what is supposed to be consumer information will rapidly lead consumers astray or even result in them being deceived."
"The purpose of the policy is to ensure a fair and safe trading environment, so that consumers can be involved in the market on an equal footing."
"However, it is also important to me that consumers do not become victims."
"By making purchasing decisions, they are in a position to exert a great deal of influence, but they must ensure that they make good use of it."
"Advertising is an essential tool which ensures that the free market functions properly."
"It brings significant benefits, not only to the economy, but also to consumers, who, thanks to advertising, are ensured a range of choice of product."
"Unfortunately, the sustained development of new technologies, and particularly of the Internet, is resulting in the increasingly frequent use by businesses of unethical and dishonest practices in the field of advertising."
"As the rapporteur points out, existing legislation does not regulate all the issues to a sufficient degree."
"It is essential to take steps to protect European consumers effectively, and also to educate them in the area of the rights to which they are entitled."
"Groups which are most at risk from unethical practices, such as children, young people and the elderly, should be given special protection."
"Therefore, I agree with the proposals put forward by the rapporteur."
"in writing. - (DE) New media, in particular social networking sites and blogs, are opening up new opportunities for communication and advertising."
"The possibilities of Internet marketing result in additional demands being placed on consumer protection law."
"The current directive concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market does not provide for these new advertising methods."
"Young consumers and, in particular, teenagers and children are making extensive use of these new technologies and may be exposed to misleading and aggressive advertising."
"The study 'EU kids online' shows that one third of Internet users between the ages of nine and 10 use the Internet every day, while the figure for 15 to 16-year-olds is 77%."
"This makes it all the more important to take urgent measures in this area, including implementing restrictions and, at the same time, providing education and information."
"I support the resolution to give consumers more information about the new technical communication options and the risks they involve."
"I can agree with many of the comments and proposals given in the material."
"However, I cannot identify with some of the propositions and proposals, which lean towards giving additional power to the state under the guise of consumer protection."
"In my opinion, the report should put more emphasis on educating users on their online behaviour, on how to make their computer secure, and on how and to whom they should give their personal data."
"It is not for states to provide technological solutions to be implemented under the pretext of consumer protection."
"A computer is as vulnerable as any other electronic device which is connected to the Internet via an electronic communications network."
"Politicians and states should undertake to teach citizens that privacy is something to be protected; just as one needs to lock up and secure one's own home, today it is just as important to secure our electronic devices, and their means of communicating with the world, to the same extent."
"Politicians should also undertake to impose strict penalties for those who misuse personal data or breach personal privacy."
"Essentially, it does not matter if this happens via the Internet or via some other means."
"in writing. - (FR) From the title of this own-initiative report, I thought Parliament was finally going to examine the society model sold to us by advertisers without having been asked for anything."
"However apart from a few interesting points such as controlling targeted advertising and discrimination in advertising, or the call for a reduction in TV advertising aimed at children, this text falls far short of what we might have expected."
"It contents itself with castigating illegal advertising which supposedly obstructs our sacrosanct freedom of competition and proclaims the advantages of advertising for citizens, whom it refers to as consumers, and for the media."
"Not with my blessing."
"I am against this report."
"in writing. - (PT) Unfair commercial practices in advertising need to be combated."
"We are getting ever closer to a serious phenomenon of personal debt."
"We must do everything we can to stop the problem from getting worse."
"Advertising can and should be an important tool for companies, serving as a source of income, stimulating competitiveness, providing healthy competition and encouraging creativity."
"We all know that there are vulnerable people, for example children, who are a special target for advertising campaigns."
"This is why I agree that this issue should be the focus of special attention, so that we can build a society that is better sustained at an economic and social level."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"in writing. - (HU) As far as the impact of advertising on consumer behaviour is concerned, advertising is beneficial for the internal market in the same way as it is beneficial for the consumers."
"It encourages competition, increases competitiveness, and stimulates innovation and creativity."
"It also represents an important sector in respect of the economy, as the online advertising market in itself transacts a turnover of EUR 14 billion."
"However, we must also be aware of the opposite side of the coin."
"Many advertisements attempt to manipulate vulnerable target audiences, such as children and severely indebted persons."
"I believe that it is important to strengthen common European cooperation in combating unfair advertising practices."
"We consider the emergence of discriminative gender stereotypes, which could act as an impediment to gender equality to be unacceptable."
"Through the appropriate means we must ensure that media and advertising professionals respect human dignity and oppose direct or indirect discrimination or stereotypical depictions."
"in writing. - (ES) I voted in favour of this report on the impact of advertising on consumer behaviour as it points clearly to an improvement in the existing legislative framework for protecting consumers from advertising, and the need for a review of that framework taking into account new advertising media that are not yet regulated."
"I also gave the report my support as it seeks to improve harmonisation between the Member States in order to prevent legal loopholes that allow businesses to use deceptive advertising practices in the EU Member States."
"I think that the reference to 'hidden' advertising mechanisms that have developed on the Internet and are now in use there is appropriate; in many cases the advertising is disguised as opinions or comments on social networking sites, forums or blogs."
"I am also pleased that the report conveys concern to the Council and the Commission regarding the real risk posed by businesses that are both content providers and advertising sales houses."
"These are the main reasons, among others, for my vote in support of this report."
"in writing. - (FR) Advertising is present everywhere, in the streets, the newspapers, on the television, the radio, the Internet, and whether we like it or not it has a huge influence on consumer behaviour."
"It is a channel of communication."
"Whilst the informative role of advertising is essential for the effective functioning of the internal market, consumers have the right to be informed and protected."
"This is why the report on unfair commercial practices in advertising and the problems linked with the development of new advertising practices and technologies is very important."
"Advertising control is vital if we are to keep it sound and truthful."
"It is essential to strengthen European cooperation in this field, just as it is valuable to encourage joint regulation."
"Lastly, online advertising is often aggressive and intrusive."
"It needs to be looked into in greater depth."
"in writing. - I voted in favour for a number of reasons:"
"1. it is time to recognise all mass media in the Internet;"
"2. false information and defamation should be matters of criminal liability;"
"3. in order to restrict access to vulnerable groups like children;"
"4. in order to clean the Internet of spam and punish those who make it circulate;"
"5. in order to induce very strict rules regarding announcements;"
"6. in order to oblige Parliament to establish a special structure to search for plotters and hackers and hold them to account."
"Let us work and get it done."
"in writing. - (DE) Advertising is a powerful tool for business which in some cases can be used to address the subconscious. The purpose of advertising is to influence consumer and purchasing behaviour."
"However, the use of unfair business practices must be prevented."
"The most important task is to protect public spaces, vulnerable people and privacy."
"Assessing whether advertising has crossed these boundaries is, of course, extremely time-consuming."
"In the case of sensitive areas involving legal drugs, such as alcohol and cigarettes, strict regulations have been in place for a long time."
"Other areas will continue to be subject to self-regulation in the Member States, as a complement to the provisions of legislation."
"There is some catching up to do, not only in the field of Internet advertising, but also, for example, in cases where additional costs are covered up and where the use of new technologies and advertising methods, such as social networking sites or blogs, represents new territory."
"As it is important to protect consumers from 'hidden' advertising and similar problematic advertising tactics, I have voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (LT) Modern advertising has long overtaken the legal framework of this area."
"Advertising on the internet - in search engines, email, social networks and Internet television - and on mobile phones is often presented to consumers without their consent, and even worse, using their data, sometimes collected without their knowledge or full awareness."
"Furthermore, there are dozens of loopholes in the legal framework of such advertising."
"Although alcohol advertising is prohibited on television for example, it is still accessible to minors on the Internet."
"On the other hand, internet advertising can very easily cross a country's borders."
"Therefore the initiative to tighten the regulation of such advertising, and thus protect consumers, their privacy and personal data from unauthorised or disproportionate use, is very welcome."
"Advertising - as the rapporteur has stressed - is an important sector of the economy."
"However, it carries many dangers."
"I fully endorse the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, which points out the necessity of eliminating advertising content which is discriminatory."
"It is also extremely important - and this is said by the rapporteur - to protect groups which are particularly vulnerable to being manipulated by advertising, such as children, teenagers and the elderly."
"I support the rapporteur's proposal to run an educational programme throughout the European Union aimed at children and designed to help them understand the methods used in advertising."
"We should also consider setting up similar programmes aimed at the other two groups which are vulnerable to manipulation - teenagers and the elderly."
"It might be a good idea to extend this kind of education to people in other age groups."
"In view of these comments, I decided to endorse the report on the impact of advertising on consumer behaviour."
"The impact of advertising on the consumer often assumes enormous proportions that can lead to the risk of unfair commercial practices."
"My decision to vote in favour of this report is a result of the way advertising is used on the market."
"It acts as a tool that benefits both the internal market - oiling the wheels of economic activity - and consumers."
"However, above all it is an important economic sector."
"We must naturally also take into consideration the negative aspects that advertising can have: unfair practices, intrusion into public and private spaces, influencing of the most vulnerable groups of people, creation of potential entry barriers to the market and distortion of the internal market."
"It is also essential, in my opinion, to safeguard the most vulnerable categories and reinforce education and information, increasing the transparency of adverts."
"It would be an extremely good idea to run information campaigns on consumer rights through the use of educational materials."
"The impact of advertising on consumer behaviour is a reality that should not be swept under the carpet, and this report does not do this."
"This report, for which I voted in favour, concerns unfair commercial practices in advertising, defined within the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices, and focuses on the problems inherent in the development of new advertising practices and technologies."
"Advertising is a positive tool, both for the internal market and for consumers."
"However, it is important to combat various abuses, among which I would highlight: unfair practices, the invasion of public and private space such as unsolicited emails, undue focus on vulnerable people and the possible distortion of the internal market, that is, thepurchase of goods and services that the consumers normally would not buy."
"The analysis of the current legislation and proposals to review or improve it should focus on an assessment of these distortions."
"I support the rapporteur in his desire to intensify European cooperation in combating unfair advertising practices, whether by extending its scope or its frequency."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Juvin, that European Union-wide cooperation in combating unfair online advertising practices should be stepped up in view of the success of 'EU sweeps' (systematic, simultaneous website checks by the Member States), which have so far been confined to three sectors: airline tickets, mobile phone ring tones and electronic devices."
"I agree with the rapporteur, who suggests broadening the scope and increasing the frequency of such sweeps and encouraging coregulation, whereby the various stakeholders are involved in legislative developments, so that the resulting measures are more effective and easier to apply."
"in writing. - (RO) The report deals with unfair commercial practices in the advertising field, as defined in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, and concentrates on issues arising from the development of new advertising practices and technologies."
"It does not discuss B2B relations, which are covered in particular by Directive 2006/114/EC."
"Advertising is a tool that benefits both the internal market, by oiling the wheels of economic activity (through stimulating competition, competitiveness, innovation and creativity), and consumers (through the diversity of options available and lowering prices)."
"This is an important economic sector as online advertising alone has a value of more than EUR 14 billion on the European market."
"At a time when there is a lack of information about consumers' rights in respect of advertising, steps need to be taken to facilitate access to information and make advertising more transparent."
"Given that the general public is not even aware of the issues surrounding the use of personal data and the tools they have available for addressing them, information campaigns often need to be launched on consumers' rights in respect of advertising, particularly with regard to the use of personal data, irrespective of whether it is provided voluntarily or collected automatically."
"It is also necessary to produce educational tools designed to inform Internet users (e.g. technologies for managing 'traces' left on the web and resources for protecting privacy)."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Juvin on his excellent work."
"With the 2005 Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which does not guarantee an appropriate legal framework for combating misleading and aggressive advertising, a set of new and more persuasive forms of advertising is developing through the Internet."
"The resolution enables European consumers to be better informed on the new intrusive forms of advertising present on the Internet, calls for greater protection for vulnerable consumers and emphasises the role of advertising in promoting positive role models."
"I would like to express my particular concern about the routine use of behavioural advertising and the development of intrusive advertising practices (such as reading the content of e-mails, using social networks and geolocation, and retargeted advertising) which constitute attacks on consumers' privacy."
"I therefore call on the Commission to make it obligatory to insert the clearly readable words 'behavioural advertisement' into the relevant online advertisements."
"in writing. - This report deals with unfair commercial practices in the advertising field, as defined in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD), and concentrates on issues arising from the development of new advertising practices and technologies."
"It does not discuss B2B relations, which are covered inter alia by Directive 2006/114/EC."
"Advertising is a tool that benefits both the internal market (oiling the wheels of economic activity by stimulating competition, competitiveness, innovation and creativity) and consumers (by increasing choice and lowering prices)."
"It is a key economic sector: the EU online advertising market alone is worth more than EUR 14 billion."
"However, it must not be idealised: advertising can also involve unfair practices, intrude into public spaces (e.g. in the form of advertising billboards) and the private arena (e.g. in the form of unsolicited e-mails), target vulnerable groups of people (such as children and those in excessive debt), create potential entry barriers to the internal market (where the outlay required is too high) and distort the internal market (by causing consumers to buy goods or services they would not normally have purchased)."
"I would in particular like to stress the issue of online data protection in Mr Juvin's report."
"It is necessary to ensure that consumers receive clear and comprehensive information about how their personal data are collected, processed and used."
"However, rather than regulating the Internet, I would prefer a solution which involves educating Internet users and resorting to regulations or restrictions in limited cases only."
"The introduction of censorship practices will only lead to other, more sophisticated fraudulent schemes and scams, which will always be one step ahead of any regulation."
"Activities which inform and educate users are important, as is giving Internet users more options with respect to the treatment of their personal data."
"It is important that the Commission starts to devise informative campaigns on the basic rights of consumers in respect of advertising, especially where this involves the use of their personal data."
"I would also welcome the development of EU educational programmes that teach children and other vulnerable groups how to understand the pitfalls of advertising."
"Equally, I welcome the report's emphasis on the protection of vulnerable groups of consumers and the guarantee of respect for human dignity in advertising."
"Advertising can effectively challenge and confront stereotypes."
"It can be a positive force acting against racism, sexism, discrimination and so on. However, it can also be a negative influence, contributing to violence, addictions such as smoking or alcoholism, or eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia."
"The report also mentions other important factors that need attention."
"That is why I supported the report."
"in writing. - (DE) Internet advertising adapts itself to users' behaviour."
"Given a user profile, advertisers can target their advertising and avoid people outside their target group."
"However, surveys show that users are largely opposed to personalised online advertising, which is often seen as intrusive."
"Many people even feel that they are being watched."
"A total of 62% of those surveyed are concerned that data protection is being disregarded in the case of personalised advertising and data protection specialists also have misgivings, because personal data is being stored, compared and linked with other data."
"In theory, every user can disable this option."
"However, the link is not easy to find and, therefore, this report proposes to make it easier for consumers to refuse all further e-mail advertising by means of a direct, working hyperlink."
"In addition, the report enables consumers to be provided with clear, accessible and comprehensive information about how their data is collected, processed and used."
"Their data must be kept completely separate from that collected in the course of advertising activities."
"The content of private e-mails must under no circumstances be misused for advertising purposes and default settings for computer systems must be used to protect privacy on the Internet (privacy by design)."
"I agree with the general objectives of this action plan, which should ensure an improved flow of information at a local level or the creation of a single point of contact, taking into account the reduced use of European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) resources for measures relating to energy efficiency, with Member States and regions moving to a horizontal approach to energy efficiency for their development, given that this represents a profitable way of stimulating economic competitiveness and reducing fuel shortages."
"I also agree that the Commission should consult local and regional representatives in order to define the direction for development in energy policy, as well as to provide financial support to local and regional projects through innovative programmes that use existing energy resources and structural funds."
"Within this framework of possible action, it is suggested that major incentives are created for regions, which, up to now, have had an above-average role with regard to energy efficiency, promoting their energy independence and, on the other hand, encouraging the sharing of good practice between these regions and those having had little development in this area."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution because we are committed to respecting the environment, finding economic means of producing energy and combating climate change."
"There is a need to ensure sustainable development, but economic development is also important."
"These two dimensions must be reconciled with one another."
"It is impossible to combat climate change without considering energy efficiency."
"To this end, comprehensive and realistic objectives and penalties need to be set, so that energy efficiency is not simply based on economic benefits."
"Energy efficiency mostly concerns buildings because there is a huge potential in energy efficiency in buildings."
"I therefore support the rapporteur's opinion that the focus should be on the renovation of existing buildings, since the construction rate of new buildings within the EU is in continuous decline and many old buildings can make a significant contribution to energy efficiency, if renovated properly."
"in writing. - (FR) The energy question is a major challenge for Europe."
"We need to remember how much our continent's development owes to the relatively easy access to energy that European countries have enjoyed for over a century."
"The energy question has now taken on a different aspect."
"The use of fossil fuels is becoming increasingly a thing of the past."
"The dual pressure exerted by the issue of global warming and the inevitable increasing difficulty in obtaining oil supplies and to a latter extent gas, is forcing us to think of new solutions."
"There has been an Energy Efficiency Action Plan in place since 2006, which deals with two particular aspects of efficiency."
"In order to economise in a way that will make the EU less dependent on its international partners, it needs to tackle efficiencies in both production and consumption: less energy-hungry buildings, more economic machines, but also more streamlined production technologies that will enable us to combine competitiveness, and innovation with economies of scale."
"Needless to say I supported this vital text (including the binding objective of a further 20% energy efficiency between now and 2020), which places the European Union among the front-runners in these fields."
"in writing. - (LT) A lot has been achieved since the adoption of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan in 2006; however, the political and economic context has changed quite a lot since then."
"Therefore, there is a clear need to review the EU's energy efficiency policy to align it with the current priorities and developments."
"Energy efficiency is the most cost-efficient and fastest way to reduce CO2 and other emissions."
"The advantages are huge in terms of both economic growth and job creation."
"I believe that a thorough assessment of the achievements and shortcomings of the 2006 Energy Efficiency Action Plan should be undertaken as a basis for the revision of the EU's energy efficiency policy."
"It is becoming increasingly obvious that the EU is not on track to meet its 20% target, therefore it is necessary to take more effective measures to promote energy efficiency."
"Great attention must be paid to the renovation of existing buildings, because hitherto there has been little progress in this area."
"The construction rate of new buildings within the EU is in continuous decline and many old buildings have the greatest efficiency potential, if renovated properly."
"This would facilitate a reduction in the EU's overall energy dependence."
"in writing. - (FR) Adopted by a large majority, the own-initiative report of Bendt Bendtsen sends a welcome political signal on the issue of energy, several days after the end of the Cancún Summit and two months before the Summit on Energy on 4 February 2011."
"Energy efficiency is without doubt one of the critical issues of our fight to protect the environment."
"Energy savings and energy efficiency are the most cost-efficient and fastest way to reduce CO2 emissions and improve security of supply."
"In this report, we are calling for renewed efforts to achieve the energy efficiency objective of 20% by 2020."
"However, I regret that the amendment calling on the European Commission to launch an initiative for the deep renovation of existing buildings next year did not get the necessary majority."
"The report only mentions new buildings and not the issue of the management of existing buildings."
"Yet buildings are responsible for about 40% of energy consumption and about 36% of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report because there is a need to take specific measures on the implementation of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan, in particular as it is becoming increasingly obvious that the EU will not meet its target of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that energy efficiency is the most cost-efficient way to reduce CO2 and other emissions."
"Furthermore, it represents a unique opportunity to support and create jobs, while lowering dependence on energy imports."
"The European Parliament thus calls on the European Commission to design the new Energy Efficiency Action Plan taking into account the needs of vulnerable energy consumers."
"In addition, it calls on the Member States to adopt appropriate measures and effective policies, such as national action plans or targeted social measures to reduce energy poverty and to report regularly on their actions to address this concern."
"The Commission should also be responsible for presenting statistics on the development of all major elements of the EU's energy policy."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Bendtsen for this important and topical report on energy efficiency."
"I voted in favour of this report, because I believe that good energy efficiency can help us to cut CO2 emissions substantially."
"Various advantages may be derived from this type of political action: firstly, new jobs would be created, but it would also be possible to introduce greater involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises, the connective tissue of the Italian and European economies, which could be offered innovative development opportunities."
"To do this, it would be necessary to arrange appropriate financial instruments to strengthen professional training, research and access to information."
"I therefore agree with the need to review the European Union's policies on energy efficiency and implement concrete plans to boost competitiveness."
"As far as buildings and ecodesign are concerned, I agree that the focus should be on the renovation of existing buildings, since they offer extremely high energy efficiency potential, if renovated properly."
"Therefore, to achieve these goals, it is necessary to promote measures, instruments and funding support from both Member States and at European level, for example through the introduction of ad hoc funds."
"The report on energy efficiency rightly calls for a greater emphasis on innovative solutions such as smart grids and smart meters, for more flexible integration of renewable energy sources, and for the creation of a global strategy for heat generation."
"Here we should note that the goal is for 50% of homes to be fitted with smart meters by 2015, rising to 80% of homes by 2020."
"I am glad that there were no proposals for the introduction of legislative measures in the area of energy poverty."
"Instead it was worded in such a way that it is clear that Member States are the ones who are best able to deal with the problem of energy poverty, and therefore this is a problem that should be resolved at the level of the Member States."
"The possibility of using 15% of the ERDF for energy efficiency programmes should also help in improving energy efficiency."
"However, I do believe that energy efficiency should be made a horizontal European priority, which is financed from sources other than structural funds."
"I think it was right to reject proposals for the introduction of a pan-European energy or coal tax, which would only lead to increased energy costs and would hit low-income groups the hardest."
"I am also of the opinion that energy efficiency goals should not be legally binding and that we should not introduce a superficial conditionality for granting structural funds based on energy efficiency."
"Energy efficiency is crucial for increasing security of supply, improving air quality, reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and increasing the competitiveness of our society."
"Energy efficiency means doing 'more' with 'fewer' resources."
"This report sets out an ambitious vision for energy efficiency through, for example, the introduction of individual goals and positive incentives."
"Important elements are introduced with regard to the modernisation of energy infrastructure, such as smart networks, energy efficiency in buildings and transport, the use of ICT and the development of scientific research in the area of energy."
"This report underlines the need to double the funds for scientific research, technological development and demonstration in the area of energy."
"With regard to funding, the report also encourages the use of structural funds to support energy efficiency, and this will be a priority within the EU budget after 2013."
"In the light of all this, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bendtsen, for the excellent work carried out, and for the balance achieved, and I would invite all of you to support this important report."
"in writing. - (FR) Buildings are responsible for about 40% of energy consumption and about 36% of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union."
"Energy-efficient buildings should be a priority of the next revision of the energy efficiency action plan."
"Today, 30% of existing homes in Europe are unhealthy and have high energy bills."
"It is therefore important not only to promote new sustanaible buildings but also to renovate existing buildings sustainably."
"That is why the Member States must immediately launch a programme of deep renovations in the existing building stock to achieve a nearly zero level energy consumption in the built environment by 2050."
"There is also a link between energy efficiency and energy poverty."
"We are therefore calling on the Commission to prepare a new energy efficiency action plan action to take account of the needs of vulnerable consumers."
"in writing. - I would like to welcome this report on energy efficiency as it will increase energy security and it will serve to create social and economic advantages for the EU's economy."
"The S&D Group have pointed out that energy resources are not evenly distributed among Member States."
"We must always consider European solidarity when legislating for energy efficiency."
"It has been said that economising on energy is one of the quickest routes to energy efficiency."
"Promoting energy efficiency will create employment and it will save Member State governments billions in heating costs on an annual basis."
"I strongly welcome the creation of a lower carbon intensive society but we must be careful to strike the correct balance between Member States based on their capabilities and resources."
"I am concerned that Member States such as Romania will be expected to perform on a level playing field with other Member States such as Sweden, who have a proven track record in the area of energy efficiency."
"Financial Perspective 8 will be a critical financing tool to encourage and promote energy efficiency from 2014 to 2020."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this report on the Action Plan for Energy Efficiency because it puts forward important proposals for the environment and for the economy, specifically the presentation of European legislation that introduces binding goals to reduce energy consumption."
"In 2008, Europe committed itself to achieving, no later than 2020, a 20% reduction in energy consumption, and to ensure that 20% of its energy consumption was from renewable sources."
"This target is fundamental for helping Europe to meet its objective of reducing CO2 emissions, and to reduce dependency on fossil fuels, but it should continue to be exactly that, a target which the various States adhere to voluntarily."
"For this to happen, rather than imposing a binding limit, it will be more important for Member States to agree on solutions that allow for greater energy efficiency and less energy being wasted, without affecting development and without this being overly costly for European industries and producers, particularly at a time of economic crisis such as now."
"in writing. - (PT) This report focuses on energy efficiency policy within the EU."
"With regard to this issue, I support the need to set binding targets."
"In the Commission's Green Paper (2005/0265 final) on energy efficiency, it is estimated that around a million new jobs could be created in Europe, directly or indirectly."
"According to this Communication, the particular beneficiaries of energy efficiency measures are SMEs, and it adds that an average household could save an average of EUR 1,000 a year through energy efficiency measures."
"Mandatory energy efficiency measures are also crucial for reducing the energy deficit resulting from imports of oil and gas from the Gulf and Russia."
"We already have binding targets for increasing the quota of renewable energy in the European Union to 20%."
"Within the current framework, we could only attain half of the potential without binding targets for energy efficiency."
"It is also a question of legal certainty, and an important signal for directing new investment."
"For the EU and Portugal I see more gains than losses with this binding objective."
"In addition, if the EU 2020 objectives do not go beyond simple intentions, this strategy will not achieve anything."
"Promises to increase energy efficiency have multiplied, but the European Union runs the risk of not meeting the targets that have been proposed: achieving 20% by 2020."
"The latest data points to an actual average of only 9%, despite the contribution that an increase in energy efficiency could make to a reduction in emissions, consumption and energy dependence."
"The report contains a wide selection of elements that cover the vast field of energy efficiency quite adequately, although it indicates routes that might make it difficult to achieve successfully the objectives that it aims for."
"But there are aspects with which we disagree, such as the link that is claimed between energy efficiency and what is called the Europe 2020 Strategy, which provides for the creation of a single market in energy, the promotion of market-based instruments, the European Emissions Trading System masking some of the profits from energy efficiency, and overlooking the need to defend a strong energy public sector that each State needs to promote."
"Although we agree with the need for there to be community funds for implementing the objectives, we still have doubts about the practical possibility of using up to 15% of the ERDF or using the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) for energy efficiency, given that it should be the Member States that determine their needs and priorities for the distribution of these funds."
"in writing. - (FR) Numerous measures offering unexploited possibilities can be introduced to improve energy efficiency in key sectors such as transport and the built environment."
"It is nonetheless unrealistic to set a binding target for improving energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2020, because there is no method of evaluation and there are no common indicators."
"Instead, we should focus on specific sectoral targets, such as the commitment to reduce energy consumption in existing buildings by 38%."
"The lack of funding is a major obstacle to the renovation of buildings in the residential and SME sectors."
"Instead of engaging in a battle of unrealistic objectives, the European Commission should, instead, come up with innovative solutions and stimulate public-private partnerships, because this creative ecology is a source of jobs."
"in writing. - (LT) I approved of this report because it aims to increase energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2020, and thereby advance the transition to a sustainable and green economy."
"The advantages are huge in terms of both economic growth and job creation."
"The jobs created will be in both rural and urban areas."
"It is well known that there is a huge potential for energy efficiency in buildings."
"Therefore the focus should be on the renovation of existing buildings, since the construction rate of new buildings within the EU is in continuous decline and many old buildings have the greatest efficiency potential, if renovated properly."
"In the cleantech industry there is a need to bridge the gap between the USA and China, on one hand, and the EU, on the other."
"Both countries are far more progressive than the EU with regard to adopting legislative measures promoting energy-efficient solutions."
"Therefore, measures and instruments to boost financing should be supported by the EU and Member States."
"The creation of national energy efficiency funds which support Energy Performance Contracting should be incentivised through a financial instrument at European level."
"Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) whereby a customer purchases a guaranteed energy saving creates leverage as the investment is paid back over a time span of 2-15 years."
"Such a model creates jobs within SMEs, consumers save money on energy bills and emissions are reduced."
"in writing. - (FI) When I, like the majority in my group, voted against the mandatory 20% energy savings target, I was not taking a stand on the importance of energy saving, but the way in which it is trying to be promoted."
"The importance of improved energy savings is undeniable."
"Nevertheless, attempts to resolve the EU's climate and energy security and supply problems are not, in my opinion, sustainable or prudent."
"In the notorious 202020 climate and energy package the energy savings target was the only nonbinding one, as it was assumed that it would be stepped up in line with other mandatory targets, such as those for cuts in emissions and renewables."
"The energy savings target was not implemented in the way we wanted, but now, rather than burden our Community with yet another binding target, one that overlaps with other binding targets, and without knowing how it will be achieved, we should examine whether those other targets were set appropriately in the first place."
"When we introduce emission cuts and targets for renewables our Member States and their companies are put under pressure, and the temptation to create shortsighted, unsustainable solutions becomes overwhelming."
"If on top of that we impose one more constraint, we will be in a situation where the EU will be literally sawing off the branch it is sitting on, at the same time bringing about a massive transfer of income, with no further benefit to the climate, the environment or our energy security."
"In trying to do something good, we have done just the opposite."
"Industry is becoming less viable globally, we are unsustainably burning wood in the name of renewable energy, and, at the same time, the problem itself, carbon dioxide emissions, is growing increasingly serious beyond our borders."
"It is time to take sensible and sustainable action, and not resort to shortsighted forcefeeding with nothing rationally tangible."
"in writing. - (DE) The EU-wide increase in energy efficiency is a central component of a sustainable European energy strategy."
"It will allow CO2 emissions to be reduced and, at the same time, energy security to be improved in the most rapid and cost-effective way."
"I welcome the fact that the report highlights increased investment in energy efficiency in buildings which will create new jobs in the construction sector and in SMEs and will bring possible annual energy benefits of up to EUR 1 000 per household."
"The report also refers to the need to increase energy efficiency throughout the transport system by shifting from energy intensive transport modes, such as cars and trucks, to energy saving means of transport, such as rail."
"I welcome the aspects of the report which call on the Commission and the Member States to give energy efficiency the attention it deserves and, at the same time, to ensure that the numerous legislative provisions relating to this area which are already in place at an EU and a national level are complied with."
"At the vote, today, I endorsed the adoption of the Bendtsen report on the revision of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan."
"There is no doubt that increasing energy efficiency is the most cost-effective and the fastest way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions."
"The fact is that buildings account for around 40% of energy consumption and around 36% of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU."
"This is why I think that one of the most important things which needs to be done is to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, and this should be accomplished by initiating work to renovate existing equipment and by installing a more efficient common infrastructure in buildings and heating systems."
"I voted in favour of financing the insulation of buildings from the Structural Funds."
"The report on energy efficiency is extremely important with a view to adopting the EU action plan in this area for the coming years."
"It will have a huge impact on the methods used to cut CO2 emissions, on economic growth and on creating jobs in areas such as IT, construction and services."
"I voted in favour of more effective protection for vulnerable consumers."
"These consumers must benefit most from the energy efficiency improvements made."
"However, more financial resources are needed to make the required investments."
"Furthermore, I voted for setting up energy efficiency funds at national, regional or local level."
"These funds could play a key role in developing SMEs and companies supplying energy efficiency services."
"I voted against setting the legally binding target of achieving minimum energy savings of 20% by 2020 as this element of compulsion at EU level could have an adverse impact on the single market."
"I think that the transition to a sustainable, green economy will progress even without imposing excessive legislative measures."
"In his report on the revision of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan, Mr Bendtsen rightly points out that national policies still do not fully exploit the potential in the field of energy efficiency."
"We must therefore strengthen European Union strategies in this direction."
"I voted for the motion."
"in writing. - (FR) This report promotes the principle of energy efficiency and advocates energy labelling."
"This is a good thing, although one might have wished to see the discussion extended to energy sobriety and eco-labelling."
"It is also concerned about energy poverty."
"This is good news."
"What a pity, then, that it makes them instruments of green capitalism, that it is in favour of free competition, calls for the intervention of financial intermediaries and extols the virtues of the carbon market."
"It annihilates the advances it promises."
"in writing. - (PT) An action plan that complies with the European energy policy needs to address the following issues: moving towards a low carbon-emission energy system, ensuring security of energy supply, and ensuring the Union's improved competitiveness and the supply of energy to all consumers at affordable prices."
"Considerable financial and human effort is required in order to achieve these objectives."
"in writing. - Here are 10 principal guidelines for energy efficiency."
"Anti-monopoly programmes for energy consumption and energy supply; 9. Nanotechnologies in the energy supply sector and its development; 10."
"Unfortunately, these aspects are not covered by the present report."
"I voted in favour, bearing in mind that the principal task has only just begun."
"in writing. - (DE) Energy efficiency is an area with great potential for the future where the EU already has some experience."
"In addition, the EU Member States are home to many leading technology companies."
"Alongside the obvious benefits for the environment, this sector also offers opportunities for boosting economic growth and creating jobs."
"However, it has become clear in the past that the EU often sets itself ambitious targets and then has problems in achieving them or misses them altogether."
"This could be the case with buildings which, of course, offer enormous potential for energy savings."
"It is significantly simpler to implement measures of this kind in new buildings than in existing older ones."
"Listed buildings present particular problems."
"Last but not least, we must not allow the situation to get out of hand by imposing measures to increase energy efficiency which are so expensive to implement that the cost of living becomes almost unaffordable."
"I have voted accordingly."
"One cannot but agree with the proposition of the rapporteur that 'energy efficiency is the most cost-efficient and fastest way to reduce CO2 and other emissions.'"
"In addition, action to improve energy efficiency contributes to economic growth and the creation of jobs."
"This phenomenon can be observed, for example, in the new Member States, where the scale of the challenges to be faced is enormous."
"It is also worth mentioning that European Union support for the insulation of buildings is one of the most visible features of cohesion policy."
"Modernised buildings are one of the best signs of the European Union in the region."
"With this in mind, I endorse the proposals contained in the report concerning an increase in expenditure on improving energy efficiency."
"I voted in favour of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan, because I believe it is important to push the European Union to make progress towards a green and sustainable future."
"Reducing energy consumption through system innovations in energy infrastructures and urban development is the goal set by Europe in the new action plan that the Commission will submit in February."
"I also believe that the objectives must not be binding because if we speed up the timing we run the risk of financially damaging companies and individuals."
"The measures for an action plan must be coherent with national plans in order to outline a common methodology for measuring energy efficiency targets."
"The rapporteur, a member of the PPE Group, in his review of the energy efficiency action plan, makes a balanced proposal to attain a target of a 20% energy saving, set by the European Council in 2007."
"The pragmatic way of implementing an energy efficiency policy proposed by the rapporteur, through individual targets and without imposing legally binding objectives, seemed to me to be the most appropriate method, in the current economic and political context, of achieving the objective in question."
"However, a solution involving the introduction of mandatory targets of at least 20% for energy reduction, an amendment approved through the votes of the socialists, liberals and greens, was passed in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE)."
"Within the report, for which I voted in favour, I would highlight the various community and Member State actions that support energy efficiency: the application of existing legislation in this area, energy efficient urban development, the construction of energy efficient buildings and the funding of these and other measures through the creation of national energy efficiency funds."
"It should be emphasised that this European Parliament report is an important contribution to the review of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan under way within the European Commission."
"Partly as a result of several improvements to the original plan, I agree with Mr Bendtsen that energy efficiency is the most cost-efficient measure to reduce CO2 and other emissions and that it represents a unique opportunity to support and create jobs, while at the same time lowering dependence on energy imports."
"He notes that, according to the Commission, energy-saving benefits could amount to over EUR 1 000 per household per year."
"in writing. - (RO) Energy efficiency is the most cost-effective and fastest way to reduce CO2 and other emissions."
"The advantages are huge in terms of both economic growth and job creation in the areas of IT, construction and services."
"These jobs will be in both rural and urban areas, often within SMEs, and they will be local jobs which cannot be outsourced."
"The Commission is going to submit a new revised plan at the start of 2011, which must contain the following elements: - EU binding target of a minimum 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020 - measures to combat energy poverty introduced in all energy policies - revision of the Energy Services Directive in 2011 - encouraging investment in smart grids and compliance by Member States with the requirement of the third legislative package on the internal market to install smart meters in 80% of households by 2020 - Member States must set annual building stock renovation targets - the Commission must put forward policies for achieving nearly zero energy losses in buildings by 2050 - the Commission must examine innovative funding models, such as revolving funds, in order to achieve the targets in this sector."
"in writing. - (ES) I voted in favour of this report because I believe that it is important for the target of 20% energy efficiency to be compulsory, not only for reasons of CO2 reduction, but also for in social reasons."
"A large proportion of the expenditure of European households is on energy bills."
"Introducing efficiency measures that reduce energy waste and help to reduce energy poverty is a socialist objective."
"in writing. - (FR) Until such time as the crazy challenge of space solar energy becomes a reality and the entire world reaps the benefits of this almost inexhaustible electric manna, the European Union has no other choice for its current energy policy than to get its energy supply from as many sources as possible and to opt for energy efficiency."
"This is a key priority of the European strategy for the next decade highlighted in the report by Mr Bendtsen, which was approved this afternoon by a majority of the members of the European Parliament."
"I particularly welcome the adoption of the binding energy savings target of 20% by 2020, which would enable the EU to save approximately EUR 100 billion."
"In order to achieve this, we are clearly going to have to do more in fields as varied as energy services, transport (by when will we have a framework for the standardisation of electric vehicles?) and buildings."
"The latter requires particular attention, as we know that they are responsible for about 40% of energy consumption and about 36% of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union."
"There is considerable energy saving potential in public buildings, for example, which would facilitate the transition towards a stable, green economy."
"in writing. - This report is a powerful and timely reminder to the Commission and the Council of the importance of a binding energy-saving target ahead of the crucial Energy Summit on 4 February 2011 and as the Commission prepares its energy efficiency action plan."
"Ambitious EU measures on energy saving and efficiency are essential if Europe is to respond to the challenges of energy security and climate change."
"They also make economic sense, create jobs and save consumers money on their energy bills."
"Until now, Member States have been reneging on their pledge to reduce energy consumption by 20% by 2020, by making insufficient progress."
"Making the target binding will help (as in the case of renewable energy) to ensure that the EU governments actually deliver on this potential."
"The report also calls for stronger measures to address the energy consumption of buildings, notably by renovating the existing building stock."
"With buildings accounting for 40% of energy consumption in the EU, it is essential to tackle this sector head on."
"The Greens hope that the EU Energy Summit will also address this crucial issue."
"The Energy Efficiency Action Plan is a cost-effective means of increasing the competitiveness of the economy and security of energy supply to the European Union."
"The plan to begin improving energy efficiency is also a perfect opportunity for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The Bendtsen report rightly draws attention to ways of using energy effectively and efficiently without the need to reduce its consumption, because this is continuing to rise in the Member States."
"The use of new energy technologies in construction and transport allows significant savings at the level of the whole Union."
"However, for such methods to come into use, an information campaign for the citizens is needed, as also is a reduction in the costs of energy-saving technologies."
"It is, indeed, the high price of innovative equipment which is the greatest obstacle to its coming into use."
"Adoption of binding targets for 2020 is difficult for many Member States."
"We must, however, remember that each of the Member States is at a different stage of development of energy policy."
"A binding renewable energy target of 20% of final energy consumption by 2020 may prove to be too great a challenge, particularly for the 12 new Member States."
"in writing. - (NL) I am pleased that the European Parliament has declared itself to be in favour of a mandatory 20% energy savings target in 2020."
"Forecasts indicate that, with the current policy, Europe will only achieve an 11% energy saving."
"Meanwhile, households waste EUR 1 000 of energy a year and we annually export no less than EUR 350 billion of our European welfare to oil-rich nations."
"Better insulation for houses, more efficient energy transport and more efficient appliances ensure a lower energy bill for consumers and businesses."
"There are often barriers to these effective measures being taken, such as high investment costs or uncertainty about the benefits."
"If the European ministers support this proposal, governments will have to step up their support for energy conservation measures."
"These measures will ultimately bring in money, because the energy bill will be lower."
"Energy conservation is the cheapest way for us to reach our climate target and will lead to 560 million tonnes less CO2 emissions."
"Energy conservation therefore makes it even easier for us to raise our climate target a little."
"Unfortunately, we are still hopelessly behind; according to a recent report, we need to triple the European target if we are to achieve a 20% energy saving."
"It is therefore important that this target be imposed as binding on all EU Member States."
"in writing. - ECR MEPs believe that energy efficiency has a crucial part to play in helping the EU meet its renewable energy and emissions reduction targets."
"It also has a crucial role to play in ensuring our energy security and contributing to our economic competitiveness."
"We support much of the content of this report, such as the focus on smart grids and metering, financing from the EIB and the private sector, and also the potential for R&D to further energy efficiency. ECR MEPs do not, however, support binding energy efficiency targets."
"We believe that the EU and Member States are already incentivised to implement energy efficiency policies through renewable energy and emissions reduction targets, as well as energy saving targets under the Energy Services Directive."
"ECR members therefore abstained on this report."
"in writing. - (DE) I have voted against the Bendtsen report, because the figures have once again been changed and the targets are restrictive."
"It is true that this is a non-legislative report, but the effects of the ecodesign directive have shown how carefully these issues must be handled."
"As result of the light bulb ban, I have had to evacuate a room after an energy-saving bulb containing mercury broke, in order to avoid damage being caused to people's health."
"This is exactly the sort of thing that must be stopped in good time."
"in writing. - (DE) I have voted against this report."
"I welcome the approach taken by the report concerning the Energy Efficiency Action Plan."
"However, I believe that imposing mandatory energy efficiency targets 'from above' and setting obligatory modernisation and refurbishment targets for private and public buildings (such as schools) is a mistake."
"At a time when budgets are tight in the provinces, local authorities and private households, these unrealistic requirements will put too great a strain on them."
"For example, the EU Commission, whose buildings were covered by the new efficiency criteria, recently had to admit that it could not meet the additional requirements for the energy refurbishment of its building stock."
"The EU must not require others to do things which it cannot do itself."
"For the many medium-sized companies and, in particular, small contractors in Saxony these measures go significantly too far."
"They will overburden businesses and will obviously result in job losses and in cost increases for consumers."
"In my opinion, we need to take a critical approach in particular to the call for energy efficiency criteria to be applied to public procurement policy."
"The right way to save energy involves educating the citizens of Europe and establishing tax incentive systems."
"in writing. - (DE) I oppose this report."
"Although it contains some proposals which are worthy of consideration, I have a low opinion of the type of gesture politics which calls for restrictive measures that are almost impossible to implement in practice."
"The demands on local and regional authorities and on private home-owners to carry out energy refurbishments of their properties are particularly pointless, given the financial situation of all the parties involved."
"Even the EU Commission had to admit that it could not meet the comprehensive requirements for the energy refurbishment of its building stock."
"In addition, we have not yet seen any proof of the claim that energy refurbishments result in direct cost savings."
"As a result of investment in the production and maintenance of the infrastructure and in renewable energy generation facilities, the cost of energy is rising faster than can be compensated for by the possible savings from energy efficiency measures."
"The existing EU energy efficiency directive from 2002 has been implemented in very different ways in the individual Member States which means that there is no common approach in Europe on this issue."
"Insisting on a much greater mobilisation of structural funds to pay for energy efficiency measures is inappropriate in the light of the ongoing finance debates."
"I am very much in favour of a debate on energy efficiency based on a broad consensus at all political levels and involving all the relevant players and the creation of incentive systems."
"However, I am opposed to regulations imposed 'from above' for which others have to foot the bill."

"Economic governance and Article 9 of the Treaty of Lisbon (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on"
"the oral question by Stephen Hughes, Pervenche Berès and Udo Bullmann, on behalf of the S&D Group, to the Council: Economic governance and Article 9 of the Treaty of Lisbon - B7-0660/2010), and"
"the oral question by Stephen Hughes, Pervenche Berès and Udo Bullmann, on behalf of the S&D Group, to the Commission: Economic governance and Article 9 of the Treaty of Lisbon - B7-0661/2010)"
"author. - (FR) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, both your institutions have worked very hard in the field of economic governance and, today, the European Parliament is debating the six Commission proposals on economic governance."
"Today, we are under the regime of the Treaty of Lisbon, Article 9 of which provides that, in the definition and implementation of its policies and actions, the Union shall, and I quote, 'take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion, and a high level of education, training and protection of human health'."
"This article is binding on all the institutions of the Union and on all its policies."
"Yet, today, you have not carried out an impact assessment on the 'economic governance package' on which you are asking me to deliberate."
"These impact assessments are very close to the heart of the Commission when, for example, it comes to implementing legislation on electromagnetic diseases."
"This is to be welcomed, but we would like the same zeal to be applied to economic governance."
"Otherwise, what do we see?"
"We see Commissioner Rehn explaining to us today that there would be three pillars in his strategy: growth on the one hand, economic governance on the other, and, finally, supervision of the financial markets."
"But if the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing, the action of the European Union will be incoherent and European law in terms of Article 9 will not be complied with."
"We therefore urge you to evaluate the social impact in terms of employment, in terms of the funding of retirement pension, in terms of social protection, in terms of the funding of public services, of the measures you are preparing to take."
"What impact will the fight against poverty have on your 2020 Strategy objective, when we learn that, today, within the European Union, 116 million people were threatened by poverty or social exclusion on the basis of figures valid for 2008?"
"The reality is that the Commission seems to be applying a secret mandate asking you, in response to the concerns of some Member States, within the Council, to reform the Stability and Growth Pact to make it more binding, to provide for preventive and corrective sanctions, while ignoring the necessary investment strategy around what you yourselves have adopted, the 2020 Strategy."
"We know that, as regards job creation, over the next few years the situation in terms of growth prospects will be more difficult than in the years that have just elapsed."
"We are not opposed to a return to public finance scenes but we are opposed to a growth strategy that has no means of financing, with austerity plans that may have immeasurable social effects, with potential consequences in terms of inequality, and where none of the inequalities, with respect to the distribution of wealth, is addressed."
"This cannot be the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon, for which we fought so hard and which you, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, have an obligation to implement."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I am delighted that the public is present."
"That is good."
"I should like to thank Parliament, of course, for having put this issue on the agenda of this part-session."
"It allows us to address an important issue, on which a great deal of work has been done in recent months within the Council."
"I am aware, of course, of the importance this Parliament attaches to economic governance and to its links with social issues in the broader sense, as set forth in Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"The obligation deriving from Article 9 must be complied with when defining and implementing all the policies and actions of the Union, including, therefore, all the work on future economic governance."
"I should first like to point out that, during the Belgian Presidency, the importance of the implementation of Article 9 and hence of the cross-section clause has been referred to so often."
"I should therefore like to recall the conclusions adopted by the Council on 6 December on the social dimension in the context of an integrated Europe 2020 Strategy."
"These conclusions call on the European Commission to strengthen and encourage the use of the existing system for the evaluation of the social impact."
"It calls on the Council to produce a report on the way in which Article 9 is implemented in work and in European policies through the open coordination method."
"It also calls on the Commission to seek out means of implementing social mainstreaming and thus, also, Article 9 in the context of its flagship initiative of a European platform against poverty, which should be published in the next few days."
"With regard, more specifically, to the new macroeconomic monitoring and coordination mechanism, the Council does not see employment and social protection as simply outcomes affected by the new macroeconomic monitoring framework, the impact of which would have to be studied, but also as factors stimulating macroeconomic and fiscal growth in the short and medium term."
"This is important if we want to avoid an unbalanced macroeconomic framework and preserve the institutional balance sought by the treaties."
"The Council's willingness to promote Article 9 in practice is also evident in the European Semester, which has to reflect, in an integrated approach, a balanced position between the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The principles contained in Article 9 must therefore apply across all these documents and legislative measures so that they become an integrated whole."
"With this in mind, the Council carried out its work in two phases."
"In the first phase, the work of the Council consisted in developing a European Employment Strategy, as provided for by the Treaty and the new economic governance framework."
"In the conclusions adopted on 21 October, the Council defined the place of the European Employment Strategy in economic governance."
"In the second phase, at the 6 December European Council, the Council adopted a new instrument for the multilateral monitoring of employment and social policies, the Joint Assessment Framework, which will make for better monitoring of the employment and social integration policies of the Member States and, therefore, ensure that better account is taken of these dimensions at European level."
"These new instruments will have to be mobilised in the preventive phase of macroeconomic monitoring so that adequate attention is paid to the situation of the labour markets and to social problems which could jeopardise Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)."
"They will, of course, also be central instruments for the thematic monitoring of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"The Council also recalled that it intended to contribute both to thematic monitoring, based on the five key objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, and to macroeconomic monitoring, since both these frameworks are closely linked."
"And, in response to the request of the Belgian Presidency, the Social Protection Committee delivered an opinion on the social dimension of the Europe 2020 Strategy, in which it stresses the need for synergy among the priorities of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the indivisible whole formed by the objectives set by the European Council."
"I would also note that the Council referred to Article 9 in other conclusions: the conclusions on pensions and the conclusions of the Council on social services of general interest."
"Madam President, honourable Members, our discussion this afternoon allows us to address issues relating to economic governance and, in particular, its social aspects."
"As President-in-Office of the Council, I will naturally listen carefully to your speeches and I look forward to a fruitful exchange of views, which will help us all in the subsequent negotiations."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, Article 9 of the Treaty of Lisbon, to which you are referring, really defines the specific features of the European social economic model."
"When you read our Europe 2020 Strategy you can see it explicit reinforces this very model of Europe by bringing together efforts to improve performance in areas such as labour participation, lifelong education, labour adaptability and mobility and social inclusion."
"However, this is not a sufficient answer at this time of severe challenges, when the climate of crisis in Europe is affecting negatively, or even dramatically, the real economy, public finances, the labour market and the quality of life in Europe."
"To address the challenges revealed by the crisis, the Commission has launched several policy initiatives."
"To reinforce the stability of our financial system, the EU has agreed on a new architecture for financial regulation."
"This has been debated in Parliament."
"Secondly, to address the challenges to public finances and macroeconomic imbalances, the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive strengthening of economic governance in the European Union, the legislative package you referred to in your question."
"The package includes, as you know, proposals to address excessive public debt more seriously than in the past by defining a satisfactory pace of debt reduction."
"It also proposes minimum requirements for national fiscal frameworks to ensure that they are in line with Treaty obligations as well as a monitoring system for macroeconomic imbalances such as large current account deficits or bubbles in the housing market."
"It underlines prevention and prudence to ensure better preparedness in times of economic downturn."
"To ensure the credibility of the new framework, the Commission is proposing a wide range of sanctions that should start kicking in at an early stage."
"The philosophy behind the proposed legislation is that it should help Member States to follow disciplined policies and lay the basis for stable long-term growth performance, which is critical to the welfare of European citizens, while making an important contribution to the prevention of future crises."
"Given the current economic situation it is really important to have this economic governance framework in place as soon as possible."
"As to the impact assessment, the government reforms were prepared by far-reaching analysis in the EMU@10 study in 2008."
"Also, in preparing and following up the Commission communications announcing the new governance structures of the so-called EU semester that were adopted in May and June 2010, the Commission discussed its proposal with many stakeholders alongside the European Parliament and the Council and promoted vigorous, broad-based debate of the issues."
"And of course, we was developed the proposals in the light of past performance and lessons learnt."
"And what are the major lessons?"
"The major lesson is that preventive action is much more valuable than imposing corrective sanctions on a state that is already in difficulties."
"Therefore our emphasis is on influencing positively the national policy mix responsible - and here is the real responsibility - for the trade-off between real economic revival and growth, and austerity and consolidation of public finances."
"Europe needs both."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, following Mrs Berès's question, I should like to focus on the economic model on which we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) base ourselves: social market economics."
"That is to say we must indeed put all of our efforts not only into ending the crisis and combating poverty, but more importantly into ensuring the social inclusion of some of our fellow European citizens who are today left by the wayside."
"This social inclusion must be addressed today, on the one hand to ensure that these fellow citizens can get back into work, which means creating jobs to fight the crisis, and on the other hand - and this is extremely important - to ensure that in the years to come we can have training programmes - initial training initiatives and lifelong learning initiatives - in every Member State, which will enable our fellow European citizens to adapt to the jobs of the future, to the new qualifications that we will require, and to the rise in the level of qualifications expected in the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"On the basis of Article 9, therefore, we can clearly see that, beyond everything that is being done at the financial systems level, there is also an extremely important contribution to develop to ensure our fellow citizens are trained and able to fully become stakeholders in society because they are active in this society, and active means trained and ready to take on the jobs of the future."
"I therefore call for Commission policies to comply with this objective, otherwise we will lose sight of the objective of a Europe with strong social cohesion."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (ES) Madam President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, over the last 50 years our economy's interdependence has increased, along with the interdependence of our economic policies."
"The eyes of citizens are on the European Union; they know that the process of European integration has placed many aspects of their lives under the responsibility of the EU institutions: many decisions are made jointly."
"Many of the Member States' traditional instruments have moved to European level, and everyone recognises that economic policies are an issue of common interest at European level."
"The European Union is therefore the focal point of this crisis: all eyes are on the EU."
"We are not, as some say, in a 'post-crisis' scenario."
"At most we might be in a 'post-recession' scenario."
"Predicted growth for this year will be low and uneven, and the problem is that next year forecasts are still indicating that growth could decline slightly."
"The number of people unemployed in the European Union is currently 23 million. This crisis has opened up a significant social gap, and, moreover, it has put pressure on public finances and even threatened the future of the euro."
"It is essential that we strengthen the economic governance of the European Union in order to respond to the crisis and ensure the future of the EU project."
"In order to tackle these common challenges, we need to restore growth and employment, change the economic model and promote global sustainable development, and we must do so while ensuring the future of the European social model."
"From the first economic crisis in 1929, we learnt that the public authorities have a commitment to restoring growth and employment; from the second economic crisis, which was the rebuilding of Europe following the Second World War, that the new Europe should be built on foundations of social justice."
"Neither of those lessons must be forgotten, and both of them must play an integral role in the future of a sustainable Europe."
"Article 9 of our Treaty on the Functioning of the EU states that 'In defining and implementing its policies and activities, the Union shall take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion, and a high level of education, training and protection of human health.'"
"It is not, therefore, just a question of austerity."
"Austerity could cause the economy to contract."
"We need policies that also promote growth, in other words responsible policies."
"It is also not a question of growing first and distributing later: we have learnt that distribution contributes to growth."
"It is also not a question of making progress first and later providing for the basic needs of citizens: we have learnt that education, health, social security and public services are essential in order for societies to progress."
"If they are not in place, they are costs that are a burden on the future of our society, and it is not possible to have a healthy economy in a sick society."
"We therefore raise the following questions: must the future legislative framework on economic governance be in line with the model of a social Europe and Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU?"
"Does a true impact assessment exist?"
"Finally, is what we really want for President Barroso to fulfil his commitment to there being a social impact and to clearly state that Europe needs a new social pact, in terms of both fiscal and employment standards, a model that ensures employment, fairness, environmental responsibility and global development?"
"Any other reform will be insufficient."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, when I was canvassing for a 'yes' vote for the Treaty of Lisbon, I gave Irish citizens 10 reasons to vote 'yes' to Lisbon."
"One of those was the social clause, Article 9."
"On several occasions in this Chamber and elsewhere I have asked the Commission and the Council to now apply Article 9 in their proposals on economic governance and, of course, in their response to the current economic crisis, which is a real test of their commitment to the social clause."
"In Ireland we see the evidence of this response, where the minimum wage has been cut by one euro an hour in the last week, and where invalidity payments and payments to blind persons have also been cut."
"What now do the phrases 'the fight against social exclusion' or 'the guarantee of adequate social protection' contained in Article 9 signify to those citizens?"
"Of course, you may say that this is an internal matter for Ireland, but it is not."
"The parameters for austerity in Ireland were set by the EU, and our government will send monthly reports to you."
"Will you remind them of Article 9 when the report comes in about the cut in the minimum wage?"
"Why has this happened?"
"This has happened because Irish banks and European banks engaged in reckless lending and borrowing right under the noses of the ECB."
"The interest rates you are now charging to Ireland for borrowing, according to today's newspapers, are 3% more than were charged to Latvia, Romania and Hungary."
"Representatives from the Court of Auditors say that there is no precedent for the EU charging such a margin on loans."
"Can I ask you to confirm or deny this situation?"
"If it is true, please explain to me, so that I can explain to Irish citizens, how the social clause is working for them."
"This situation is specific to Ireland, but if it is a template for other Member States in trouble, then Article 9 is dead in the water."
"Madam President, I will be brief."
"If we look at the policies being implemented today, broadly speaking there is an 80% cut in expenditure and a 20% increase in new revenue, and I think that is being generous."
"Everybody knows very well that when there is an 80% cut in public expenditure, the first ones to pay the price are the most vulnerable people in our societies."
"I should therefore like to share my indignation with you by drawing on two contrasts: the first being the contrast I see between economic governance, on the one hand, and the EU 2020 Strategy on the other."
"Economic governance requires harsh, immediate action and stringent rules that are binding."
"The EU 2020 Strategy indeed has good intentions, in particular to reduce poverty, but it is a soft, voluntary option and governments will only follow it if they really want to and have the time."
"There is nothing binding about any of that."
"I feel that is a contrast that is untenable and therefore incompatible with the spirit of Article 9."
"The second contrast exists between the issue of economic governance, on the one hand, and the issue of public expenditure on the other."
"Public expenditure must be reduced quickly otherwise we will be heading for catastrophe."
"The debt must be reduced within a maximum of 20 years and, if possible, even sooner than this but without an impact assessment we are not giving it much thought."
"When it comes to generating new revenue - because in any case a budget is made up of both revenue and expenditure - with taxes on financial transactions, taxes on energy, and a consolidated basis for corporate tax, we say, 'Wait, an assessment is required, we must consider the impact, we must not do too much."
"Let us think about it, let us take our time, let us assess ...'."
"I really do not understand why on the one hand we have to charge full speed ahead without worrying about the impact, whereas on the other hand we move slowly and take the time to think, while, in the meantime, the people are paying the price."
"These contrasts, I think, demonstrate to everyone that Article 9 does not hold as much weight as the articles on economic convergence in the Treaties of the European Union and it is, I believe, a contrast we must resolve if we wish to win back the trust of our citizens."
"Madam President, I want to ask the Commission if it would give the House a specific definition of how it intends to implement Article 9."
"We constantly hear about macroeconomic monitoring."
"We never hear it talking about macro-social monitoring of what Member States are doing in pursuit of European social policy and objectives."
"I want it to tell us if it intends to use this simply as an impact assessment, i.e. that it hopes its measurements will have no social impact."
"That is not good enough, because Article 9 is intended to promote the objectives of the European Union as outlined in Article 3 of the Treaty."
"It is not good enough simply to have no impact - it must have a positive impact."
"This is the obligation on the Commission and it must implement the treaties."
"I also want to address the issue of social services of general interest, on which I am a rapporteur."
"There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that the current crisis exit strategy which the Commission is pursuing is going to destroy social services of general interest in the Member States."
"You need only look at the Memorandum of Understanding which the Commission has concluded with the Irish Government for a demonstration of that."
"It is stated on page 2 that a reduction of current expenditure in 2011 of just over EUR 2 billion will be implemented, including social protection expenditure reductions, a reduction of public service employment numbers, a reduction of existing public service pensions on a progressive basis, other expenditure savings of over EUR 1 billion, and a reduction of close to EUR 2 billion in public capital expenditure against existing plans for 2011."
"What other impact can that have than to decimate services of general interest, and in particular social services of general interest?"
"So where is Article 9?"
"Where was Article 9 when the Commission was negotiating this deal with a Conservative Irish Government on the point of collapse?"
"I would also ask the Commission, when it is going to present this Memorandum of Understanding it has signed off with the Irish Government before this House?"
"It is obliged to do so under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"When are we going to see it?"
"When are we going to have an opportunity to discuss it here?"
"One of the other aspects of this agreement which I mentioned this morning is the insistence by the Commission that the minimum wage in Ireland be reduced by EUR 2 000 a year."
"I repeat, the minimum wage."
"The Treaty of Lisbon declares that we must have adequate social protection, that we must encourage people to stay in work, that we must eliminate poverty traps, etc., etc., etc., and yet we reduce the minimum wage by EUR 2 000 a year."
"What will that do other than drive more people out of work into the safe haven, relatively speaking, of welfare dependency?"
"These are questions which the Commission must respond to."
"We do not want any more flannel."
"No more plámás."
"No more Eurospeak."
"We want clear answers on how the Commission is going to apply Article 9 of the Treaty in relation to economic governance and, in particular, on the arrangements it is making with Member States with regard to the crisis exit strategy."
"(IT) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, there is no doubt that remaining alert to the matter of economic governance is an absolutely right and proper aim of the European Parliament."
"Article 9, mentioned in the question, is absolutely consistent with the need to take everything concerning the individual citizen into the greatest consideration."
"Today, no more than a few hours ago, an important piece of legislation was passed, recognising citizens' rights to take the legislative initiative, to give primacy to their right to citizenship."
"Greater stability means more controls, it means intervening promptly and effectively, and it means making the most of competitiveness."
"Toughness must be combined with efficiency and substance."
"Social protection is closely linked to a real will to create jobs in a situation, such as our own, of particular difficulty."
"For this reason, we need to talk about this - and talk about it meaningfully - with all the stakeholders."
"(EL) Madam President, may I say that the question of economic governance and the targets it sets, especially as put forward under the Treaty of Lisbon, raise specific questions as to whether a policy is being applied that is socially correct, whether an economy is being applied that targets green growth and whether an economy is being applied that prevents against unemployment, especially among young people."
"I should like to refer to the Republic of Cyprus, which is now under observation."
"The measures taken do everything except offer a way out into proper social policy and social standing, especially the measures which conflict with the interests of the young generations growing up on the island."
"(EL) Madam President, the new report on employment in Europe in 2010 highlights the fact that young people have borne the burden of the crisis and that young people are facing more and more problems, with unemployment mainly affecting the 15-24 year age group."
"It is not enough to establish the problem; we need to resolve it."
"We have 3 million unemployed in the European Union."
"Commissioner, tell me please, what are we to do about it?"
"I consider that the efforts you have made to record the problem are positive, but the problem needs to be resolved and you have an historic role to play."
"What is worrying for Greece, the country I come from, is that unemployment among young people up to the age of 24 has reached 27.5%, an astonishing and very dangerous number; and what is most worrying is that unemployment rates are not falling as more formal qualifications are obtained."
"As you know, employment is not merely a livelihood; it is the basis of human dignity."
"We need to give our young people dignity."
"(DE) Madam President, there have been recent reports in the media about the directors of the failing German bank HRE being entitled to huge pensions after only working there for two years and on the basis of contracts which were drawn up after the bank had already received massive amounts of state aid."
"This confirms the belief of the citizens of the European Union that money is simply being thrown at the banks, while strict austerity programmes are being imposed on ordinary people."
"Article 9 of the Treaty of Lisbon refers to 'a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection'."
"For those people in Europe who have been hard hit by the financial and economic crisis and who are now being forced to make savings, this sounds like adding insult to injury."
"For example, when the pension reform in Hungary is rolled back and the citizens have to transfer back to the state pension system or lose 70% of their pension rights, it is clear that an icy wind is blowing through the EU."
"In the debate in plenary on the future of the euro area, the President-in-Office of the Council explained that events in Dublin had highlighted the importance of an economic policy control mechanism in the EU."
"In my opinion, completely the opposite is the case."
"We have too much centralism and too much conformity."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, to defend what is called the European social economic model we have to adjust the European model to reality, namely the global challenges and the crisis in Europe."
"If we want to defend the model, it cannot remain the same."
"A major assumption, which has already been stated, is as follows - this is a basic philosophy: consolidation and the regaining of the confidence of the markets is the basis for stable, sustainable growth and jobs."
"That is critical to the future welfare of European citizens."
"Referring precisely to the questions from Ms Harkin and Mr De Rossa - Mr De Rossa's being Irish-oriented - we are setting the same rate as the IMF in this respect."
"We are not obliged to make our Memorandum to the Irish Government open to the public."
"I have to say that there is nothing more anti-social than to produce deficit and debt, which will be charged to future generations of European citizens."
"There is nothing less responsible than banking practices that are transferring the banking problem into the sovereign debt problem."
"These are anti-social, irresponsible actions and we cannot blame the Commission for them."
"We recognise that there is a clear tension between the austerity being undertaken in so many countries and its impact upon social inclusion and the level of poverty."
"We recognise that and therefore we need impact assessments and discussions."
"Such a discussion has been conducted here in Parliament."
"Again, our basic philosophy is that prevention is what is valuable."
"Prevention means that we should influence the policy mix at the national level."
"The policy mix at national level is mainly responsible for the trade-off between austerity and growth."
"This is the major responsibility, but we are to influence this policy mix at national level in such a way as to discourage building the future of Europe upon debts and deficits because that does not lead anywhere."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you will have understood from my first speech, the Council is well aware of the obligations pursuant to Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union regarding the need to take account of the overall aspect of the requirements associated with promoting a high level of employment, ensuring adequate social protection and combating social exclusion, as well as achieving a high level of education, training and protection of human health."
"These obligations are and will be duly respected in all of the Council's work."
"Given the universality of this obligation, it is also required in the field of economic governance."
"It applies to the results contained in the report by the task force chaired by President Van Rompuy, which the October European Council fully endorsed."
"It also applies to the six legislative proposals that came out of the work of the task force, which were tabled by the Commission on 29 September."
"Nevertheless, compliance with the obligations in Article 9 does not require a formal social impact assessment procedure."
"Our obligation, which applies to both the Council and Parliament, especially since it is up to our institutions to lay down the policies and work of the Union by adopting legislation in this field, is to take account of these requirements."
"That is what the Council will do."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (EL) The package of economic governance measures proposed by the Commission makes provision for stricter discipline in the Stability and Growth Pact and budgetary supervision, by proposing penalties for 'undisciplined' Member States."
"In other words, it is a worse version of the recipe which led the EU into the crisis and recession and drastically exacerbated its social problems."
"The path marked out by the Commission, with the demand for institutional changes, is exacerbating social and regional inequalities."
"Consequently, the very unfortunate social repercussions addressed by my fellow members in their questions are a known fact."
"Moreover, we are already seeing these repercussions in practice and the workers are paying for them, not only in certain countries in the South, but in the entire EU also."
"The European Parliament must stand up against this policy which, apart from including harsh austerity measures and cuts to workers' rights, is undermining its role and the role of the national parliaments."
"In other words, it is undermining the role of the elected representatives of EU institutions, which should, however, demonstrate greater awareness in their demands of the citizens' fight."
"Human rights in the world 2009 and EU policy on the matter (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Andrikienė, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2009 and the European Union's policy on the matter."
"rapporteur. - (LT) Madam President, Madam High Representative, I am very pleased to see you here today participating in this particularly important discussion."
"In particular because these are the first political debates that Baroness Ashton has participated in since the launch of the new European External Action Service."
"The Annual Report on Human Rights in the World adopted by the Council of the European Union and EU policy in this field are the basis of this discussion and the European Parliament resolution, on which we will vote tomorrow."
"We cannot hold Baroness Ashton responsible for those actions that are discussed in the above report, that is 2008-2009, because at that point she had not yet assumed the post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"We understand the great responsibility that lies with you, both now and in the future, and I would like to assure you that we in the European Parliament will do all we can to ensure that the European Union's objectives in the area of foreign policy are realised."
"Baroness Ashton, the Treaty of Lisbon has been in force for a year and the European External Action Service became operational barely a fortnight ago."
"In its report today the European Parliament sends a clear signal to all EU institutions."
"The European Parliament has clearly expressed its position that in the new European External Action Service the primary focus should be democracy-building and human rights protection across the globe and that this should be reflected both in the structure of the service and its funding."
"There could be a Human Rights and Democracy Directorate, an international law directorate or a structure with another name but the same content."
"What we should avoid is the marginalisation of human rights issues or their exclusion from the main EU agenda and the structure of the EEAS."
"With the same aim in mind, the European Parliament proposes to create special representatives for human rights within the context of the service, who would work in specific countries or regions, especially those where the EU does not have diplomatic representations."
"These special representatives would have a clear mandate to defend human rights in the countries where they work."
"I would also like to stress once more the need for a Brussels-based Working Group on Human Rights (COHOM), all the more so because an absolute majority of EU Member States support this idea."
"The report on which we will vote tomorrow, here in the European Parliament, discusses and assesses EU policy, the work of the entire European Union and its institutions, covering a whole range of topics and issues, including the abolition of the death penalty, the fight against terrorism and human rights, children's rights, combating violence against women, the situation of human rights defenders in various countries across the globe and freedom of religion or belief."
"We are discussing and assessing the functioning of the European Union in international fora, such as the United Nations, the United Nations Human Rights Council and the cooperation of the European Union with the International Criminal Court."
"My colleagues in the European Parliament played an active part in the preparation of the report we are debating and it was adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs by a huge majority: 50 'for', none 'against' and two abstentions."
"It is appended with a list of specific human rights violations in various countries, to which the European Parliament has drawn attention."
"These are actual names, countries, human destinies and lost lives."
"I would therefore like to end my speech by mentioning a few specific severe cases of human rights violations."
"Of course, having taken part in the ceremony, you are aware that today the European Parliament was supposed to award the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to the Cuban dissident Mr Guillermo Farinas."
"We were unable to do this because representatives of the Cuban Government refused to allow Mr Farinas to come to the European Parliament."
"We trust that in exercising your responsibilities, you will take this fact into account and will find a means of expressing our position, our disappointment and our regret and opposition in this matter to the Cuban Government."
"I would also like to draw your attention to another painful case that we discuss in our report."
"Russia's Khamovinicheskii Court was supposed to pass sentence on one of them today, but for reasons that are unclear it postponed the announcement until the end of the month."
"This is the trial of Mikhail Khodorkovskii and Platon Lebedev, which in my opinion mirrors the rotten state of the judicial system and the absence of the rule of law in Russia."
"Baroness Ashton, I would like to urge you not to forget these cases and to make efforts to ensure that justice in Russia becomes the rule rather than the exception."
"I believe that the current opening up of Russia and President Medvedev's aims to modernise Russia are a very good opportunity to achieve the implementation of this objective."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, honourable Members, on Friday we celebrated International Human Rights Day."
"This year's theme highlighted the work of individuals and organisations worldwide who fight human rights violations, specifically discrimination."
"Over this past year I have met Nobel Prize winner Shirin Ebadi on Iran and frontline award winner, Afghanistan's human rights commissioner for women Dr Soria Sabhrang, and other human rights defenders across the world and I will continue to do so."
"As I have expressed previously, I fully expect my colleagues in Brussels and the heads of our EU delegations to do the same."
"Six months ago I stood before you to present a first vision of how the European Union should conduct its policy on human rights."
"Today I want to set out how work has been proceeding since then and how I see the way ahead now with the support of the European External Action Service."
"But first of all I am very grateful to Dr Andrikienfor her report which responds to the EU's annual report on human rights and sets out the European Parliament's vision for how we can make our approach to human rights in the European Union more effective."
"This is an ambition which I strongly share."
"The range of EU action and challenges we face are well reflected in the report before the House today: attacks on human rights defenders, sexual violence, use of new technologies to curb freedom of expression, to name but a few."
"I want to pay tribute to Dr Andrikienfor bringing together more than 400 amendments in this impressive, informative and extremely useful report."
"The report covers a lot of ground and I want to pick up three important developments of recent months."
"First and foremost, the EU has been working hard to advance the cause of human rights on the multilateral stage."
"In a successful session of the UN Human Rights Council, the European Union held a common position on potentially divisive resolutions concerning the Gaza flotilla and the Goldstone report."
"At the General Assembly Third Committee, the EU also achieved its chief objectives: resolutions on Burma, DPRK and the death penalty were all passed with increased majorities - as was the Canadian resolution on Iran - and the EU resolution on eliminating religious intolerance again met with consensus."
"Secondly, as announced in June, work has begun on a review of EU human rights policy."
"It has been an inclusive process for which I sought input from Member States' parliamentarians, notably Ms Hautala and the Subcommittee on Human Rights, as well as civil society NGOs and academics."
"I will be asking the service and my senior team in the months ahead to consider the key themes arising from these consultations and how best we can put them into practice."
"I will count on Parliament's continued support in this endeavour."
"Third, work has begun on streamlining the patchwork of policies which have grown up over the past ten years and which make up the EU's human rights policy guidelines: toolkits, other instruments, the guidelines we have got for promoting and protecting human rights."
"There are good reasons why policy has grown in such an organic way, but it seems like a good time to take stock and to move on and, for that ongoing work on the review, I see three lines of action."
"First of all, the need for Europe to continue to speak up for human rights on the global stage."
"We are working to strengthen our action at the United Nations and to resist attempts to dilute universal standards, the basis of our action."
"We need to find innovative ways of working with third-country partners to promote our shared values, as we have done successfully in the UN General Assembly vote on the death penalty resolution."
"We are also investing to ensure that our own record stands up to scrutiny."
"Second, we need to tailor our approach to individual situations."
"That means establishing local human rights strategies for each country, reviewing our priorities and the most effective use of our assorted tools, for example by sharing experiences on child protection on the Internet or how best to tackle child labour."
"Third and finally, human rights should be visibly at the centre of EU external action."
"That means working human rights into the activities of all parts of the External Action Service, as well as the whole range of EU external action: trade, development, CSDP and so on, and at all levels."
"That will be built into the structure at headquarters as well as throughout our delegations in order to be able to monitor the human rights situation and promote an effective realisation of EU human rights policy goals."
"Human rights are the core of our EU identity and they go to the heart of what we do around the world."
"We have developed strong sets of mechanisms for promoting these values in different contexts with different partners; in the multilateral context and through support for civil society; funding specific human rights projects in over one hundred countries."
"Nearly ten years on from the very first EU communication on human rights, and with the establishment of the new service, I want to ensure our human rights policy is effective, innovative and targeted: the silver thread that runs through all of our external action and a gold standard for our foreign policy."
"That is why I particularly welcome today the contribution in this report and I would also end by congratulating Guillermo Fariñas on the award of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (LV) Madam President, Mrs Ashton, I should first of all like to thank Mrs Andrikienfor her successful report, which was adopted practically unanimously in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Thank you also to Mrs Ashton for her measured speech."
"The report on human rights in the world testifies to the critical situation in even those countries with which the European Union has for many years been conducting dialogue and consultations on human rights."
"For example, the report emphasises that Russia has still implemented only the first point of the six-point agreement on Georgia."
"Half a million people are still unable to return to their homes in South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"The European Union must seriously resolve such situations, which is why I call on the High Representative to pay special attention to the resolution of the issues to which I have referred."
"It would be intolerable for the European Union to spend vast resources in terms of time and funds on human rights dialogue and yet fail to obtain good results."
"It is therefore clear that significant improvements need to be made in the European Union's policy on human rights."
"First, by implementing a precise human rights strategy that defines not only tasks, but also structure, which ensures regular evaluation of outcomes and a review of operational tactics."
"Second, the European Union's evaluation of the human rights situation must be based solely on experience and defined criteria."
"We must not alter our opinion under pressure from some third country or under the influence of economic interests."
"Third, we must establish regular consultation at European Union level with non-governmental organisations."
"Securing human rights and democracy must be the priority of the External Action Service and an unequivocal criterion in bilateral agreements with third countries."
"Thank you."
"Madam President, this report is really huge, a massive undertaking."
"It in fact almost exhausts the subject of human rights and, at the same time, it has flaws because of its qualities; that is to say it is dense and it can sometimes take a long time to read."
"The rapporteur is certainly not to blame for this but rather the 423 amendments, which she had to digest."
"It is therefore a feat on which we must congratulate Mrs Andrikienė."
"The report, however, also highlights the fact that human rights, at the centre of European policies, is complex and multi-faceted."
"Consequently, when the European Parliament asks you, Baroness Ashton, for a special rapporteur on human rights, a directorate-general for human rights, special training for the staff of EU delegations abroad, and, among these staff members, a person very specifically responsible for monitoring human rights in the country in question - if Parliament wants these arrangements, it is certainly not to bureaucratise this field but rather that there is a lot of work to be carried out."
"Although this report does not overlook the serious problems and violations that continue to shake the world, it is not a litany of horrors either."
"On a positive note, it rightly emphasises the efforts made, and does not hesitate to recommend courses of action and topics of discussion to embark on."
"In conclusion, it really reflects the importance and substance of the work carried out by the European Union."
"The European Union has developed a set of tools that can really contribute to promoting democracy in the world."
"It has yet to convince its interlocutors that respecting human rights does not impede growth and international trade, and that it is not a millstone around one's neck in external relations but rather that it brings added value in terms of stability and prosperity."
"Baroness Ashton, you have taken up the cause of human rights very well and made your mark at the end of this first year after the Treaty of Lisbon."
"on behalf on the ALDE Group. - (LT) Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and all those MEPs, who provided amendments and participated in discussions, for their interest and efforts to create and improve this report on Human rights in the world and EU policy on the matter."
"I believe that the rapporteur and colleagues from the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Committee on Foreign Affairs took this challenge and met it superbly."
"The ideas and assistance that we received from the representatives of non-governmental organisations also helped to improve the report."
"I would therefore urge all MEPs to vote in favour of this report, which following lengthy debates, amendments and discussions represents an accurate reflection of the position of the European Parliament as regards human rights."
"On the subject of the amendments tabled, I would urge my colleagues not to expand on issues which have already been discussed at length in committee."
"It is true that human rights problems abound and there are also a lot of countries that could be mentioned and called upon to act."
"However, the value of the report lies in its brevity."
"By endlessly developing the report it would lose its effectiveness and so to me some of the amendments being debated seem unnecessary."
"At the same time I would like to draw colleagues' attention to some important amendments which did not feature in the previous version of the report."
"These include the amendment tabled by my group on Sodium Pentothal calling for assurances that the production and sale of this substance, which can be used to carry out death sentences, is only permitted for medical purposes."
"The adoption of this amendment would be an important step in the fight against the death penalty throughout the world."
"I would also urge colleagues to support another amendment tabled by our group calling on the European Commission to take further action to implement the 2007 Human Rights report's commitments to strengthen efforts to combat violence."
"This document is not just a set of guidelines for the European Commission, the Council and Member States, but also a very strong, clear message for the European Union's neighbours, partners and other countries, where human rights are not sufficiently respected and defended."
"I hope that all interested countries and institutions will pay appropriate attention to this report and will adopt its valuable recommendations."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I would like to welcome the High Representative to the European Parliament today."
"I would also like to warmly congratulate Mrs Andrikienfor her work."
"It was excellent team work, which is why it could be adopted nearly unanimously in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I was very fortunate to have been invited this autumn to participate in the discussions between the Member States on how the EU human rights policy could be made more effective and more coherent."
"I believe that we have now a historic opportunity to review our human rights policy, as you have indicated, Baroness Ashton."
"My suggestion is that this process should be as inclusive and as open as possible."
"I would very much recommend that you send a communication in due time - not too late, of course - to Parliament and the Council, so that we can have real high-level discussion and engagement."
"Today it is very important to be reminded that the Treaty of Lisbon places respect for human rights at the core of the Union's external policy."
"For this reason, we need to have the proper structures in place."
"We know that you, the High Representative, are committed to human rights and democratic structures at headquarters."
"Could we please be told what that might mean in practice?"
"Are you able to give us the commitment that you gave Parliament in the summer?"
"I would also strongly urge you to go for the decision to establish the Brussels-based COHOM, which is the EU Council working party on human rights."
"If we need to have more coherence - which we do - we definitely need to have this permanent structure in place."
"Lastly, I would like to thank you for your efforts in bringing the Member States together last Friday in Oslo for the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony."
"I have reason to believe that, without your efforts, it would not have happened."
"It is a very good basis for our human rights work so that the Union will have a clearer, louder and more effective voice in the world."
"Madam President, I, too, would like to add my voice to the expressions of thanks for the rapporteur."
"We enjoyed very good cooperation, which has resulted in what I think is a very good report."
"I think one thing which should be stressed is that Christians still constitute the most persecuted religious group in the world, and they are suffering discrimination, being attacked and often even being killed in almost every part of the world."
"At the same time, the world is remaining silent."
"We, too - the European Union- are still doing too little."
"I am very grateful to Mrs Ashton for her reaction in many individual cases recently, but this matter should continue to be reiterated."
"Countries in our neighbourhood, such as Egypt and Algeria, should feel that we cannot extend our political dialogue without including the subject of religious minorities in these countries."
"Countries such as Sudan and Iraq should be made very clearly aware that we will not agree to develop aid programmes or free trade agreements until the fundamental right to religious liberty is respected there."
"Much has changed for the better on this matter in recent years, but we need to be permanently engaged in the defence of religious liberty around the world, because no one will do this for us."
"In the last few days in the European Parliament we have been able to meet bishops who have come here from Iraq, from Mosul and Baghdad, to share their experiences."
"I think we should give them not only a feeling of solidarity, but a guarantee of security for the future, so that they have the feeling they have someone to whom they can appeal for help."
"Otherwise, we risk our own credibility, because if we are not able to look after our friends, we lose credibility in the eyes of the world."
"Madam President, our sitting seems to be particularly devoted to human rights."
"This morning we adopted the Gál report."
"We also adopted a report on the trafficking of human beings and another on the European protection order; the rights of victims in other words."
"I will put on the same footing the rejection of the single permit, by which the European Parliament rejected a proposal that was far too discriminatory towards foreigners."
"I shall not go back over the Sakharov Prize."
"I have already expressed my opinion."
"For me, however, this report falls within the same two-speed vision, the same narrow prism through which some fellow Members regrettably view human rights."
"Here are a few examples: I am committed to freedom of religion as well as to the freedom to believe or not to believe."
"Many non-believers are also persecuted throughout the world."
"Our rapporteur rejected amendments to introduce the concept of freedom of thought, freedom of faith and freedom of religion, even though it exists in international law."
"Why are there 15 paragraphs on freedom of religion, primarily focusing on Christians, and only six paragraphs on freedom of expression?"
"There is no mention of trade unionists."
"Why is there this double standard, which always consists in mentioning the same countries: Iraq, Iran, Russia, Belarus or Cuba, when the situation in many African countries is hardly ever mentioned, and especially not in the Maghreb, where those supporting human rights and democracy are terribly targeted, particularly in Libya and Tunisia, amid almost universal indifference?"
"There is no mention of Colombia either."
"I hope that this debate will enable us to make progress."
"I believe that by balancing our positions and adapting what we say and do we will progress towards a truly universal conception of human rights."
"There is still a lot of work to be done and I have listened to you carefully, Baroness Ashton."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Andrikienė, for accepting some of my amendments on religious freedom and I congratulate her for the successful drafting of this report."
"More and more tragic events are happening that concern the freedom of believers throughout the world: the number of obstacles to freedom of worship, assaults and murders is growing year by year."
"These criminal acts concern believers of all religions, particularly Christians."
"Paradoxically, religious freedom is becoming an increasingly sensitive subject instead of being one of the most natural and unquestionable freedoms."
"For all these reasons, I reiterate the proposal already put forward earlier to establish a specific, accurate and annual report by the European Parliament to monitor the status of religious freedom in the world."
"This report would provide the information needed to plan appropriate and preventive political interventions."
"Madam President, generations of Soviet school children grew up learning that Comrade Stalin had invented the internal combustion engine."
"It appears that European school children will grow up learning that the EU is a defender of human rights - but what have you actually done, beyond rhetoric?"
"The rapporteur highlights the weakness of the EU's policy towards the Burmese junta, a weakness that is tantamount to appeasement."
"The rapporteur tells us that the EU is very concerned indeed about human rights abuses outside the EU - but what about the forced deportations of Roma from Belgium in 1999 during the premiership of Guy Verhofstadt, who now sits here as an MEP?"
"What about the forced deportations of Roma from France this year?"
"But maybe words are all we can expected from the External Action Service."
"In Brussels last week, Amnesty International raised concerns over the lack of a human rights unit within the External Action Service."
"Words are very fine, but action might be more helpful to the oppressed and suffering peoples of the world."
"Last week in committee I accused the Belgian Presidency of being a ghost presidency."
"To my astonishment the Presidency agreed with me, saying that was exactly what they want it to be."
"So can I ask Baroness Ashton to attend the next meeting of the Subcommittee on Human Rights - and not just in spirit - on 10 January, where she can take part in an exchange of views on the human rights and democracy network and explain to us exactly what the word 'action' means to her."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Andrikienė, rapporteur for the report on human rights in 2009."
"It was not an easy job, because the state of respect for human rights continues, unfortunately, to require our attention and engagement."
"In our report, we repeatedly call on various countries and institutions to take specific steps intended to increase the degree of respect for human rights."
"It seems to me that we ought to check more often whether these institutions do in fact carry out what the European Parliament has requested."
"Otherwise, in a year's time we are going to have to repeat many of today's remarks."
"We are right to demand respect for fundamental rights, but this is still not enough."
"We must also be effective - we must be able to persuade executive authorities to be effective in implementing our instructions."
"I support the rapporteur's proposal for the European External Action Service to have a directorate for human rights and democracy and to create the position of High Representative for Human Rights."
"The main principle of a consistent European Union foreign policy should be the promotion of democratic values and human rights."
"This is probably the most important political message of the report."
"If it should prove possible to achieve this, successive annual reports on respect for human rights in the world would get shorter each year - and may this be the case."
"(PL) Madam President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak."
"We are analysing material, today, which is clearly composed of two parts or two areas."
"The first area is an attempt to evaluate respect for human rights in 2009, and the second is the European Union's policy in this matter."
"For we have to say whether progress was made in the world last year in terms of respect for human rights."
"Unfortunately, the answer to that question is not in the affirmative."
"In 2009, there definitely was no progress in terms of respect for fundamental rights."
"I am thinking, here, of the fact that capital punishment is still in use, and that torture continues to be used in many countries."
"I am thinking of the use of violence against women, and also of the fact that there are still hundreds of millions of children in the world who are being forced to work as slaves."
"The second matter is about the Union."
"There is no dispute over values or objectives."
"The basic dispute, and what we are worried about, concerns the fact that we want the work of the Union in the area of protecting human rights to be more effective."
"I would like to agree with all the suggestions about this which are found in the report."
"If these recommendations of ours were put into effect, the work of the Union in the area of protecting human rights in the world would certainly be a great deal more effective."
"(FR) Madam President, Mrs Andrikienė's report is a remarkable reference document for all those who speak out on human rights."
"It is good to share lessons with our partners in the rest of the world on the subject of human rights."
"Although some countries are still living in the Middle Ages as regards compliance with human rights standards, Europe would be well advised to give up on adopting too arrogant a stance."
"The European Union's criticism of the authorities of countries that continue to violate human rights would be even more credible if our 27 Member States were to agree, without exception, to enforce all the judgments of the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"Where do we stand on this?"
"Is it not time to make a solemn commitment so as to avoid leaving the slightest doubt over our desire to respect the authority of the bodies that we ourselves created?"
"(DE) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the EU has an extensive range of measures which can be used to improve human rights policy in a number of countries."
"The EU is a regional power which should be calling in multilateral forums for human rights policies to be implemented and ensuring that there is a greater focus on making progress in this area."
"Following the launch of the European External Action Service, will we take this opportunity to consider whether EU human rights policy is having the desired effect?"
"I hope so and I welcome the review of existing human rights policy announced by Baroness Ashton."
"However, I am very concerned that it will not be possible to make appropriate use of the structures which are planned for human rights activities within the External Action Service."
"There is a real risk that there will be even fewer resources available than there have been in the past and that we will have no visible, audible or effective European human rights policy."
"The human rights department which is being established threatens to become a mere front if human rights policy is not represented in any way at the highest level."
"The mainstreaming of human rights will not on its own produce the required results."
"We need a substantial team of experts with links at the highest level and the requirement for everyone involved to take the issue seriously."
"Only then will mainstreaming be possible in all areas of policy and at a central decision-making level."
"It would be completely incomprehensible, unprofessional and retrogressive to focus only on mainstreaming."
"Those people who are suffering from violations of their most fundamental rights expect a new and effective human rights policy from the EU and not simply the application of administrative procedures in this area."
"Madam President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Laima Andrikienė, for her balanced and sensible approach to this report."
"My group, the ECR, is fully committed to promoting fundamental human rights throughout the world."
"However, we also recognise that human rights often need to be balanced with realpolitik."
"Why else would the EU be developing a strategic partnership with China, whose government shows scant regard for freedoms we consider to be essential?"
"Equally, the EU has a moral duty to provide development and humanitarian aid to developing countries, even those with a lamentable human rights record, such as Pakistan where women and religious minorities in particular suffer from institutionalised discrimination."
"I am nevertheless pleased that this report highlights countries that have been of particular concern to me during my career - Vietnam, Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, Zimbabwe and North Korea."
"The issue of impunity in Russia for human rights offenders is rightly also raised."
"The central theme running through this report is that democracy, human rights and economic freedom go hand in hand."
"However, I do have doubts when this Parliament invokes international law in condemning certain distasteful practices, when the legal basis for this is far from clear."
"I notice, for instance that, in a Parliament resolution to be debated tomorrow, caning in Malaysia has been declared as clearly against international law, when such a statement is legally questionable."
"We must stick to the facts to remain credible as an institution."
"(NL) Madam President, our commitment to the observance of fundamental rights means little without personal involvement and that is what Mrs Andrikienė's interesting report clearly encourages."
"My specific concern in this regard is 'religious freedom'."
"I would like to mention three current breaches of the fundamental right of religious freedom as a way of urging the Council and the Commission, who are here combined in one person, you, Madam High Representative, to give a voice and, thus, a face to these and all other persecuted citizens caught up on the diplomatic agenda."
"For me, there are three urgent cases: 1."
"Dr Fan Yafeng, a prominent Christian human rights lawyer and pastor of the Beijing house church, who has been under house arrest since 1 November 2010 and who has for weeks been weighed down by the chicanery and machinations of the Chinese intelligence service."
"Action point for Europe: lift the house arrest on Dr Fan."
"2."
"Aisha Bibi, a Pakistani Christian, sentenced to death under Pakistan's blasphemy laws on highly dubious charges."
"In a recent personal conversation with me in San Francisco, the Pakistani Minister for Foreign Affairs did not want to agree to more than a thorough police investigation into the charges based on blasphemy laws."
"Action point for Europe: bring about the release of Aisha Bibi and the abolition of blasphemy laws in Pakistan."
"3."
"Yusuf al-Qaradawi, leader of a house church in Iran, sentenced to death on 'apostasy' charges."
"Action point for Europe: bring about the release of this minister and end permanent state surveillance of house churches in the Islamic Republic."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Council and Commission, Madam High Representative, unfortunately there is no lack of homework for you."
"(DE) Madam President, when China calls for a boycott of the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony and the governments in Iraq and Afghanistan, which came to power with Western military aid, both heed its call, this is for me an obvious example of the problems which regimes of an Islamic nature have with human rights."
"In this context, the increasing persecution of Christian minorities in the Middle East and the cases of discrimination and intolerance of Christians in Europe are highly disturbing."
"We can no longer ignore the growing problems in Muslim communities in the EU relating to forced marriages, honour killings, violence against women and the call for Sharia law."
"In my opinion, we should also strongly oppose the sort of cultural relativism which, under the pretext of respect for foreign cultures and traditions, tolerates the fact that the right to freedom, equality and codetermination of people in some parts of Muslim cultural areas is being restricted."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, overall the report by Mrs Andrikienreport is an excellent report, which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists & Democrats in the European Parliament have worked hard on to provide ideas of the utmost value."
"Human rights have constituted one of the fundamental pillars of the European Union since its creation and respect for them is an essential point that the European Parliament must encourage every day."
"Wider acceptance of human and fundamental rights, globalisation and changes in our society require a new and different outlook that does not fit any of our existing canons."
"It therefore becomes essential to guarantee equal access to natural resources, as one of the fundamental rights of each individual."
"In the coming years, climate change will lead to an enormous number of refugees fleeing the poorest areas of the Earth and it is our duty to begin to take note of these potential migratory flows so that we can establish appropriate policies that will enable respect for the dignity of these people to be guaranteed."
"The expression 'climate refugee' has not yet entered the vocabulary of current international law."
"Naturally, we remain committed to the fight against desertification, just as we do to adjusting to climate change."
"These are the topics I have attempted to add to the text of the report, so that a serious debate can be opened on the issues."
"Madam President, we are celebrating a significant day with the award of the Sakharov Prize today, but we have a lot more work to do than that."
"I would like to highlight a few elements from this comprehensive and well-drafted report."
"There is the necessity to fight for justice over impunity, whether through the ICC or otherwise."
"It is not only important to bring perpetrators to justice, because this is often a long-term process, but in the meantime, for those who fear that violations of human rights are unnoticed or in fact tolerated by liberal democracies, starting to hold individual human rights violators accountable is an acknowledgement of the suffering and of our credibility in the EU."
"In this report we ask for sanctions on Russian officials responsible for the death of Mr Magnitsky and for Iranian officials involved in the systematic censorship, rape, crackdown and executions of citizens who have done nothing other than act according to their inalienable and indeed universal human rights."
"(NL) Madam President, we have seen over the past few decades that the human rights situation has improved in a number of places in the world."
"I am thinking of South America and Eastern Europe, where this has been linked to democratisation and increased prosperity."
"Unfortunately, we have seen no progress in countries where Islam is dominant - on the contrary."
"In Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Somalia and other such countries, more and more Christians and other religious minorities are becoming the subjects of oppression."
"In those countries, the extremists are leaving no stone unturned."
"Charges of blasphemy, prohibition of conversion to Christianity, harassment on a daily basis, murder, all that is happening."
"Often, these actions are directed against communities who have lived in these countries much longer than the Muslims."
"Madam President, four out of every five people who are persecuted for their faith are Christians and the situation in Muslim countries is the most serious."
"I call on the European Union and its Member States to do more to combat this religious persecution and, Madam Ashton, I am asking you specifically, how is your policy going to address this?"
"(EL) Madam President, I must congratulate Mrs Andrikienon the integrated report which she tabled."
"I would remind everyone that the Ancient Greeks said 'man is the measure of all things' 2 500 years ago."
"Two centuries later the Romans said 'man is a wolf to his fellow man'."
"I want to see if the Ancient Greek saying is philosophical rhetoric or if we have progressed."
"We have certainly progressed, except that we have not reached the desired result in terms of safeguarding human rights and, unfortunately, the economic and financial crisis which broke in Europe and worldwide has caused a huge problem and has mainly hit the poorer sections of society, thereby depriving them of the human right of fundamental self-respect."
"Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we need to go beyond words; we need to take action, we need to take the measures needed for social protection, to combat social exclusion and, most of all, to find employment for young people."
"I would remind you once again: employment is not a livelihood; it is a means to self-respect and dignity and conditions of peace in Europe."
"(DE) Madam President, a civilisation is measured not only by its technical progress and prosperity, but increasingly by its respect for human rights."
"This is a quotation from a programme on the subject of human rights in the 21st century and should serve as a warning to us."
"The credibility of the EU in this area should not be taken for granted and our policies are not immune to being measured on the basis of double standards."
"The European External Action Service offers us the opportunity to follow up with actions the words which we approve every Thursday afternoon at the latest."
"Human rights must be reflected in every area of EU foreign policy."
"I welcome the comprehensive review of the effectiveness of all EU instruments in this area, because we are obviously not lacking the political will to make strict demands, but simply the will to implement them."
"- (SK) Madam President, the European Union is based on values such as freedom, democracy, equality, the principles of the legal state and adherence to human rights."
"If the Union also wants to play a significant role in the promotion of human rights worldwide, however, it is essential that it develops a coherent foreign policy, to which all Member States should make a determined contribution."
"The coming into effect of the Treaty of Lisbon is a unique opportunity for significant progress in human rights and democracy, which from now on should become a central element in various areas of foreign policy in particular."
"The decision to incorporate human rights into the structures of the European External Action Service is therefore of clear and decisive significance."
"I firmly believe, however, that creating the role of special representative for human rights would contribute towards greater cohesion, and above all to the necessary visibility of the external actions of the EU in this area."
"I would like to end by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Andrikienė, for her excellent work on the annual EU report on human rights 2008-2009, which provides a detailed summary of the diverse activities of the European Union in the area of human rights and democracy in the world."
"Madam President, thank you to the rapporteur for producing an excellent report."
"Baroness Ashton, I am extremely glad that you are now in office, because your record has shown that you have absolutely no hesitation in standing up for people who have no voice and whose rights are taken away."
"Human rights, of course, know no national boundaries."
"They know no national borders."
"They are universal."
"Yet the universality of that respect is failing across the world."
"We have agreements with countries such as the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries where the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are criminalised."
"They are not respected and, indeed, even within the Cotonou Agreement there is a question as to whether there should be respect for the rights of LGBT people."
"This is why we need a strong human rights directorate within the External Action Service, to ensure this policy coherence across development, trade and foreign affairs - as you said in your statement."
"We have free trade agreements where Article 2, the human rights clause, has never actually been enforced."
"Parliament makes recommendations and, I am afraid, the Council backs away."
"So we look to you to give a very strong lead in defending human rights with all those countries that we have relations with."
"I should also like to express congratulations on the adoption by the Council in 2009 of the LGBT toolkit."
"The toolkit enables the EU's External Action Service to work for the fundamental rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people."
"I wish you well, I trust you and this House has every confidence in you."
"Madam President, I speak as the European Parliament's Vice-President for Democracy and Human Rights and thank Ms Andrikienfor her excellent report."
"In her speech Lady Ashton talked about the new structures within the EEAS - or at least she did not talk about them."
"When I founded the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights many years ago, I believed it was necessary to have a structure to deliver democracy and human rights."
"That still exists."
"Incidentally, the Commission wanted to abolish it and mainstream human rights and democracy through all external programmes."
"Lady Ashton does not talk about mainstreaming in her speech, but I fear that, when she talks about a silver thread so thin that it risks breaking at the first pressure, she is talking about a sort of filigree foreign policy."
"I think we need more than that."
"We would like to see - as others have said, right around the House - a directorate for human rights and democracy within the EEAS and, possibly, a special representative."
"Like Mrs Hautala, I was in Oslo last week and I would like to just reflect on one single point."
"There were about a thousand people - I sat just behind Mrs Pelosi - united across the Atlantic: politicians, diplomats, civil servants and NGOs, happily united around the European Union."
"When there was a standing ovation, it was unanimous - no wave, no fragmented approach."
"Everybody stood up, because we stood as Western civil society behind a set of principles."
"So in the future, when the EU projects its soft power, it must also project principles."
"We look to you, Baroness Ashton, to bring those forward."
"(PL) Madam President, Mrs Andrikienė's report is, indeed, lengthy, but it is my profound conviction that the report does not exhaust all the issues concerning respect for human rights in the world in 2009."
"It devotes a particularly small amount of space to the growing phenomenon of the persecution of Christians, which is now happening not only in third countries, but also in Europe."
"The European Union has enough political and diplomatic instruments both to prevent these phenomena and to express categorical and resolute condemnation of them."
"A second matter about which the Union should not remain silent is the question of respect for human rights in Russia."
"It seems to me that the cooperation agreement currently being negotiated with Russia is the perfect moment to raise in a firm and specific way the question of respect for human rights in that country."
"For we must not forget the people who are being persecuted in Russia - the politicians, representatives of non-governmental organisations and businessmen who are being persecuted just because they have the courage and strength to demand the truth about the operation of their country."
"Madam President, whilst we all unite in condemning flagrant human rights abuses in countries such as Iran and China, we must start distinguishing these from the grossly over-the-top EU-inspired human rights industry."
"The public are now bamboozled by this human rights fest."
"There is the EU Fundamental Charter of Human Rights in the Treaty of Lisbon; there is a European Court of Human Rights over there, which seeks to give British prisoners the vote - even murderers and paedophiles."
"There are excessive EU employment rights and American-style rights too for damages, and national legislation such as the UK's disastrous Human Rights Act, which allows foreign terrorists and criminals to stay in Britain because their rights are now seen to be more important than those of the decent citizens they threaten."
"The truth is the noble cause of human rights has too often descended into a deep trough, with millionaire lawyers growing rich defending the spurious rights of terrorists, criminals and the greedy."
"This has to stop."
"(DE) Madam President, the fact that the EU is increasing its activities in the field of human rights and that the issue of persecution and discrimination against Christian minorities is specifically addressed in these reports represents a step in the right direction."
"Christians suffer acute persecution in many countries, some of which have close contacts with the EU."
"Examples include Egypt, Iran, Iraq and, of course, Turkey, where Christians are in some cases fighting for their very survival, both in economic and in physical terms."
"We do not need a new post, such as the planned Special Representative for Human Rights, to force these countries to show more tolerance and to protect their minorities."
"This will give rise to unnecessary costs and is not guaranteed to be effective, because we already have enough means of applying pressure."
"We must take specific measures."
"We must ensure that no treaties are signed with the EU and no financial aid is provided without a commitment to respect human rights and to protect minorities, in particular Christians."
"Ladies and gentlemen, financial arguments are very powerful, especially when humanitarian arguments do not work."
"Most importantly, they are well understood throughout the world."
"(HU) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, first of all, let me congratulate my colleague, Mrs Laima Andrikienė, on her excellent work."
"The number of letters of amendment, which had reached record proportions, imposed a considerable task on her, which she handled excellently and in a very elegant way, and the result is an exceptionally good report."
"I am delighted to say that the report places emphasis on the most vulnerable groups that require the greatest degree of protection, such as children, indigenous people and national minorities."
"I very much hope that our messages formulated in the report will be met with openness as regards the structure of the External Action Service and the future High Representative for Human Rights."
"We expect High Representative Ashton to ensure that human rights have a special place in the new structure, and that in addition to providing the necessary organisational conditions, the entire work of the External Action Service should be inspired by human rights mainstreaming."
"The spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon has created a new moment, one that will require us to take more consistent action in this area as well, and the failure to observe this spirit should not be permitted to undermine the credibility of the EU."
"As the rapporteur for the report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union I am particularly pleased that this debate has been brought before the plenary of Parliament at the same time, and that the report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union that was adopted today, as well as the report on human rights that is currently under debate, convey the message that we consider the protection and consistent application of fundamental and human rights and the avoidance of a double standard to be equally important in and outside the EU."
"(PL) Madam President, I am pleased by two things."
"Firstly, because human rights have become an integral part of the work of the European External Action Service, and this is a very good thing."
"The apparatus of the European External Action Service should be used for this very purpose - to promote human rights and to protect human rights defenders throughout the world."
"The second thing which pleases me is this: as a member of the Delegation of the European Union to Russia, I am very pleased to see that in this report there are sections devoted to respect for human rights in Russia and that particular human rights defenders have been mentioned."
"This support from Brussels and Strasbourg for people who are fighting for human rights in Russia is extremely important, and I think this report deserves support if only because it treats these people with such respect."
"I think we should move in this direction, and I appeal to Mrs Ashton to do this."
"(PL) Madam President, the debate on the report on human rights in the world has coincided with sad events which confirm that human rights are constantly being violated."
"Winners of the Nobel Peace Prize - Liu Xiaobo - and the Sakharov Prize - Guillermo Fariñas - were not able to receive their awards, because they did not receive permission from the regimes where they live to leave their country."
"Yesterday's visit to the European Parliament by bishops from Iraq is proof that we still have a huge problem with the persecution of religious groups."
"The persecution of Christians in the Middle East, including the recent terrorist attack on the cathedral in Baghdad, shows that new methods of violating fundamental rights are appearing, and the Union should react appropriately and effectively."
"I would like to add my voice to the appeal of the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, to make the problem of the safety of Christians in Iraq a priority."
"We cannot agree to Christians being treated as second-class citizens."
"How, too, can we continue accession negotiations with Turkey, if the only Christian seminary in the country remains closed?"
"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the EU's diplomatic service offers the chance to improve the work of the Union in the field of human rights."
"This work should concentrate on strengthening international cooperation and raising the level of security."
"Promoting democratic values and human rights should be the main principle of a consistent European Union foreign policy."
"(IT) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, as Vice-Chair of the Committee on Development, I am engaged with the problems of many countries, especially in Africa, where human rights are routinely violated and trampled underfoot, if not altogether forgotten at times."
"I returned just last Sunday from an official mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo where, in addition to my usual institutional meetings, I wanted to meet representatives of non-governmental organisations operating in the country and visit some of the centres where they work."
"I must say they really do some great work."
"I met victims in a country where rape is seen as an instrument of war, where armed groups continue to practice mass rapes and other systematic crimes against civil society, especially against women, old people and children."
"I wanted to mention the example of the Democratic Republic of Congo because this was a very recent experience for me."
"In general, however, I would like to call for the need for strong and ongoing condemnation of brutal violations of women's rights."
"The international community must significantly increase funding for campaigns to protect women from rape and other forms of violence, such as genital mutilation, which is also a serious violation of human rights and the physical integrity of women."
"(IT) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of the European External Action Service is a historic opportunity to address issues of human rights and democracy."
"It must ensure, in particular, that respect for and promotion of human rights are central to the various parts of the European Union's external policy."
"Greater synergy between the European Union delegations and embassies of Member States is desirable, with the aim of adopting one human rights strategy per country, given that the specific details vary greatly from country to country."
"The death penalty, which is practised in many parts of the world, is one of the most inhuman forms of law enforcement."
"The use of capital punishment is of concern in Belarus, the only country in Europe that still applies the death penalty."
"It is important to put an end to the types of human right violations suffered by women, including female genital mutilation."
"All political means should also be brought to bear to support the United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for an international moratorium on female genital mutilation."
"I conclude by calling for greater efforts to be made by the Commission and the Council to circulate the European Union annual report on human rights."
"(HU) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to emphasise that although the European Union has achieved unprecedented integration between its Member States in several areas, in the codification of human rights it is significantly lagging behind other international organisations."
"I fully support the statement calling on Member States to sign and ratify all fundamental human rights conventions of the UN and the Council of Europe, as well as the attached optional protocols."
"Of these, I would like to highlight the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, for which the future signing of the Convention on Human Rights by the EU could serve as an example."
"I believe that a better coordination of the work of the international organisations having jurisdiction in the field of human rights is of similar importance, and could be the sole guarantee for the assertion of the formulated rights and obligations."
"(EL) Madam President, the European Union defends human rights in the world, in keeping with its principles and values."
"However, a great deal needs to be done and the Treaty of Lisbon has improved our efficacy in this sector."
"All of us here in the European Parliament are convinced that action for human rights defenders must be continued."
"Proper application of the instruments that already exist may provide a framework for protecting them."
"Top priority must be given to ratifying all international conventions against torture and any other form of inhumane treatment."
"Including the human rights clause in all trade agreements with third countries and monitoring its application are basic measures for exerting pressure and we must insist on them."
"I think special reference should be made to essential protection of the rights of women and girls, including protection of their sexual and reproductive health."
"Madam President, as part of our debate today on human rights in EU internal and external policies, I would like to make a special point on the situation of women in conflict zones and in particular in Congo, Gaza and Iran, where this question should no longer be overlooked."
"Women, as well as children, are the ones suffering most from the devastating consequences of conflict situations."
"We should not allow breaches of human rights affecting women to be a side issue: the EU should prioritise the defence of women's rights in its foreign affairs and humanitarian policies."
"Human rights considerations - and in particular the status of women - in a large number of third countries are too often sacrificed for the sake of the economic interests of some EU Member States."
"We need, and we demand today, appropriate and concrete steps to make the EU's principles in its action within and outside the Union a real tool of human rights promotion, with a specific focus on women's rights."
"(PT) Mrs Ashton, how do you feel when governments like the French and Portuguese turn back demonstrations when there are visits by Chinese dignitaries to their capitals so that they are not seen by the dignitaries when they visit these countries?"
"Wasn't the idea of having a High Representative so that Europe could speak with one voice on human rights abroad, for example in China?"
"Do you not think that this is speaking with more than one voice?"
"Out of curiosity, why do you always sit next to the Council?"
"What is the philosophy or constitutional theory behind this choice?"
"A third question: I would like our European diplomats to see human rights as a daily priority, not a second, third or fourth priority, but the first priority."
"What will you do to ensure that some of our diplomats think about human rights as a full-time job, every day?"
"Would it not be good to have, as several colleagues here have already suggested, a directorate permanently dedicated to this?"
"Madam President, when we heard the recording from Mr Fariñas from Cuba this morning, I was impressed by the fact that he identified himself and his colleagues as a 'non-violent' opposition to the Cuban regime."
"I think it is particularly important to respect the rights of people who neither commit violence, nor encourage violence in others."
"However, before we become too pious about this, we must face up to the fact that in some EU countries people such as Mr Geert Wilders in the Netherlands are prosecuted for having dissenting political opinions or heretical opinions of academic subjects without a hint of encouragement of violence."
"Moreover, a political party without any violent connections has been banned in Belgium."
"An attempt to ban a party in Germany failed in the constitutional court, only because it was revealed that the evidence had been fabricated by state agents."
"In the UK, a state body has been pursuing a civil action against our own party, with the express purpose of closing us down."
"(IT) Madam President, Lady Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, human rights and European Union policy are at a crossroads."
"Mrs Andrikienė's report should certainly be encouraged and supported as it specifically states what concrete actions still need to be taken."
"The EU European External Action Service can carry out its activities effectively, relying moreover on the acknowledged sensitivity of Member States, but we need a comprehensive and decisive policy that has the necessary bite when required."
"We must truly protect human rights: young people, women, old people, the disabled, people with particular religious and political orientations, and those with different sexual orientations must be protected, just as people's rights to freely express their own thoughts must be protected."
"Today, however, Parliament has enacted some important measures and we therefore believe that any programme that is genuinely aimed at protecting human rights can only be developed truly and effectively through strong, concrete dialogue with third countries."
"(EL) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, it is a pleasure to listen to the High Representative for Foreign Affairs of the European Union state in no uncertain terms that we are in favour of the application of fundamental freedoms and human rights and that, as the European Union, we have to do everything we can to safeguard the application of principles and freedoms that are common to the entire world, so that we can perform this positive role."
"You know our position: that we desperately want a special service for human freedoms and, more to the point, supervision and representatives."
"However, I would say, Baroness Ashton, that we need to look inside as well as outside."
"Coming as I do from Cyprus, I would point out that we have two hundred thousand Greek Cypriot refugees deprived of their fundamental human rights (access to their homes) and that we have a Turkish Cypriot community oppressed by the Turkish occupation."
"Set up your service."
"A word of advice and a request: send your first representative to the Republic of Cyprus."
"(SV) Madam President, one of the candidates for the Sakharov Prize, Dawit Isaak, is still being held in prison without trial in Eritrea."
"He has now been imprisoned for 3 370 days."
"Accession to the European Convention on Human Rights will provide a greater opportunity for the EU also to demonstrate in earnest its commitment to, and defence of, human rights outside the EU's borders."
"I appeal to you, Baroness Aston, to use this opportunity to increase the pressure on Eritrea to release the European prisoner of conscience, Dawit Isaak."
"We must now show that we mean business and we need to have a clear message for the President of Eritrea."
"It has to be an essential requirement that all of the negotiations conducted with Eritrea lead to the release of Dawit Isaak."
"I have confidence in you."
"Just as Mr Cashman said:"
"I believe, I trust in you, Lady Ashton."
"(PL) Madam President, I would, firstly, like to thank Mrs Andrikienfor her report."
"I would also like to say that human rights are in a new situation after the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The question is how we will use this instrument."
"We should do this not only by talking directly about human rights, but by including them in other contexts, such as where we talk about trade policy with numerous countries."
"Are these human rights important to our partners?"
"I think that reactions to what the European Parliament says, or, for example, to today's award of the Sakharov Prize, show that Parliament's views are important, because they are being heard."
"I would also like to talk about the rights of Christians in the world."
"It seems to me that there are now so many examples of the persecution of Christians, that we must react decisively."
"I think, too, that it is important to cooperate with, amongst others, the Council of Europe, the UN, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the ombudsmen and human rights representatives both of the Council of Europe and of numerous Member States, because there are many, very good examples of the effect of their work on changes in attitudes to human rights."
"Madam President, although the report encompasses many significant issues, I would just like to touch upon the case of Sergei Magnitsky."
"His tragedy represents a great number of similar cases that have not come to our attention yet."
"It is essential to make it very clear to the Russian authorities that such incidents must be investigated in compliance with the principle of the rule of law."
"Instead, the investigators and prosecutors involved in the death of Sergei Magnitsky have been promoted and rewarded."
"Such a course of action is simply an incredible perversion of justice, and the European Union and its Member States must not close their eyes to this."
"We should bear in mind the international commitments of the Russian Federation."
"Therefore, colleagues, I encourage you to support Amendment 25, which proposes to impose sanctions on 60 Russian officials involved in the case until a proper investigation of the death of Sergei Magnitsky is conducted."
"(PL) Madam President, as a member of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, I would like to extend hearty congratulations to Mrs Andrikienfor writing a really good draft report."
"Furthermore, as Chairman of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Belarus, I would also like to express my great satisfaction that the report contains references to the situation in that country."
"I am thinking, in particular, of the references to how freedom of association is permanently restricted in Belarus, and this includes the freedom of association of national and ethnic minorities, and also how the work of religious organisations is restricted."
"I am pleased, too, that the report also reflects the restricted freedom of access to the Internet, and the fact that Belarus is a kind of shameful leader in this field in Europe."
"I am hoping, too, that Mrs Ashton, who is present, today, at this debate, will make every effort to ensure that the dialogue on the subject of human rights, which was begun with Belarus last year, brings tangible results, particularly where we are talking about ending the repression of human rights defenders and independent Belarusian journalists."
"Madam President, I would like to address an issue that has been raised by many colleagues, and that is the suppression of the rights of Christians."
"I very much wish, in the name of consistency, that colleagues would be equally interested in repression of the rights of representatives of other religions, because we are very often told by other countries that we are one-sided and biased, so I think this is a question of real coherence and credibility."
"I would like the guiding line of the EU human rights foreign policy to be the avoidance of any double standards, and I hope that the European Parliament will stick to that."
"Lastly, can I ask Baroness Ashton if she is going to respond to the many questions that we have about the new human rights structures in the EAS, since these will be assembled in the very near future."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, I should like to thank everyone for all the contributions to this debate, which I found extremely useful."
"Can I just say that I am on the Council side now but I was on the Commission side earlier today?"
"I move between the two, and we do keep a record to make sure that I move between the two, so you must just catch me when I am here."
"Again, I would like to thank Ms Andrikienvery very much for the work that she has done, and congratulate her on the report, which has been extremely helpful."
"I am going to respond on three particular areas."
"I will begin with the issue which Ms Hautala raised right at the end and which a number of colleagues have mentioned."
"Let me start by being absolutely clear: I talk about mainstreaming because I have seen, too often in my life, human rights relegated to the corner of an organisation and done as an afterthought in a way that is not going to make any kind of difference."
"I am not suggesting that is what the EU has done before."
"I am suggesting that I am determined to make sure it cannot happen again."
"As you will see in the structure when we finalise it, and we have not yet done so - human rights will be fully recognised in the structure and we are going to make sure we have the expertise that colleagues here have asked for within the structure."
"But I do not want it to sit in a corner."
"I want it to be part of everything that we do: a silver thread, not a filigree thread, a silver thread that is strong but that shines and is there for everyone to witness."
"That is what I want to achieve in my time in office and I feel 100% committed to trying to achieve that."
"It will take time and there will be things we cannot do as well as I would wish, but we will absolutely do our best."
"It matters to me, however, that this Parliament understands what I am trying to do and that I am trying to make sure that it is everybody's responsibility."
"Yes, it should be monitored; yes, we need expertise; but it is not down to just a few people within the EAS."
"It is the responsibility of everybody."
"That is the first thing to say."
"The second thing is that you will see the structures very soon, and it is in there."
"It is there for you all to witness as part of what we will be doing."
"On the working group chairs, we are going to put forward our proposals for appointments."
"I will be appointing the working group chair who will be responsible for human rights, and that will enable them to pick up the point that was made about whether capitals should have people gathered from the capitals or whether it should be based in Brussels."
"We will pick that point up in that conversation."
"Finally on structures: we have already done the training programme for new heads of delegations, and one session was about human rights."
"They are very clear about their responsibilities and about my and your expectations in that regard."
"So please accept that it is part - and a fundamental core - of the structure, but I will be determined to make it everybody's responsibility."
"The second point was about the breadth of the issues."
"I recognise what a number of people have said about religious faith and I accept that this is an important issue."
"It was, in fact, part of our discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council this week as well."
"Colleagues have also mentioned the need to address the rights of women, of children and of lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual people."
"I read into all that was said, about the different people and the different countries, the fundamental point about human rights, which is this: for them to apply to you, you simply need to be human and here."
"Those are the criteria for human rights and that is, again, how we will approach this within the External Action Service."
"They belong to everybody."
"The third thing I wanted to say was just a bit about some of the things we are beginning to see happen and in which we are playing a part."
"This is particularly true on some of the work that we are doing internationally."
"The International Criminal Court this year saw four countries recognise and ratify the statute."
"That is very important because we played a part: I personally wrote to the ministers in every country that had not yet ratified, asking them to do so."
"These were countries which responded directly to us and which have ratified."
"Equally, I would mention the importance, in the UN General Assembly Committee, of trying to extend support for the moratorium on the death penalty."
"I think this is a core and fundamental part of the work that we should do."
"It is universal, it is something we all believe in, and it is the way forward that we should be practical in what we do."
"So three areas: firstly, making sure the structures are right and the people know and understand the core work they need to do; secondly, ensuring that we cover everyone in the work we do on human rights; and thirdly, ways in which we can make a difference."
"The final point I want to make is how I think that, more than anything, we have to look, within the review, for practical and innovative ways of getting our messages across."
"I want us to be really creative in working with people on the ground in different countries where we meet human rights defenders - and I do wherever I go."
"I want us to be innovative and creative in finding new ways of raising these issues of human rights, new ways beyond what is so important in any event: the statements that I make, the statements that we make as 27 Member States and the statements that we make as the institutions of the European Union."
"It is about finding ways in which we can do as much as possible to address the concerns."
"It is about individuals, organisations and the collective will to be able to make a real difference."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, first of all I have been told that the English interpretation of my speech was not accurate, and I am very sorry about this."
"Immediately after this discussion I will translate my speech into English myself and will send it to all the colleagues concerned and also to the High Representative."
"Secondly, I would like to thank all the colleagues who participated in today's debate for their positive assessment and for their critical remarks."
"With regard to my colleagues Mr Obermayr and Mr Poręba, who spoke about Christian minorities in different countries, saying that this issue is not addressed in the report, I would like to draw their attention to paragraph 126 among others."
"We have a chapter that deals with freedom of religion, and Christian minorities are also mentioned in some specific paragraphs."
"On a final note, I would like to assure Baroness Ashton that Parliament will continue to scrutinise closely the work of the European External Action Service and will criticise inaction or the ineffectiveness of action taken in the area of human rights."
"In this year's report, we clearly state that we are not satisfied by the fact that the EU still does not have clear benchmarks for assessing whether actions on human rights have produced results."
"We have also expressed our disappointment at the lack of progress achieved by the human rights dialogues and consultations."
"Baroness Ashton, Parliament has come a long way to find common ground on human rights issues, especially the most sensitive ones."
"This shows that Parliament stands united in the promotion of democracy and the protection of human rights in the world."
"It also shows that the days when Parliament would merely applaud the Commission or the Council are over."
"Parliament is now a serious player in the area of human rights."
"All actors operating in this field will have to take note of that."
"I would like to thank all those who have taken part in this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (DE) The fact that the EU wants to increase its activities in the field of human rights and that the issue of persecution and discrimination against Christian minorities is specifically addressed in this report represents a fundamental step in the right direction."
"Christians are still suffering acute persecution today in many countries, some of which have close contacts with the EU."
"To give just a few examples: In Egypt, Iran, Iraq and Turkey, Christians are fighting for their very survival, both in economic and in physical terms."
"We do not need to establish a new post, such as the planned Special Representative for Human Rights, to encourage or even to force these countries to show more tolerance and to protect their minorities."
"This will give rise to unnecessary costs and is not guaranteed to be effective."
"We have enough means of applying pressure in the case of business interests and international trade relations."
"We must take specific measures."
"We must ensure that no treaties are signed with the EU and no financial aid is provided without a commitment to respect human rights and to protect minorities, in particular Christians."
"Financial arguments are among the most powerful and they are understood throughout the world."
"Respect for human rights is one of the foundations of democracy and is the main value on which the idea of the European Union is based."
"This is why human rights occupy a special place in the work of the Union and of our Parliament."
"In its annual report on human rights, the European Parliament stresses its commitment to protecting these rights throughout the world."
"Since 1988, Parliament has awarded the Sakharov Prize to people and organisations with a record of particular distinction in the fight for human rights."
"We will be introduced to the winner of this year's prize this week."
"In the context of the report for 2009, I appeal to the Member States to sign and ratify all the main UN and Council of Europe conventions on respect for human rights."
"In order to be effective in the fight against violations of human rights around the world, we have to act together and in accordance with the principles of law and order which are accepted internationally on this matter."
"Therefore, it is important for the Union, as a leader in the field of the defence of human rights, that the Member States comply with international obligations in this area."
"The lack of respect for the rights of defenceless children is particularly repugnant."
"This is why I stand for a definitive ban on child labour and for additional funds to be allocated to the fight against using children for work."
"It is horrifying that in the 21st century there are 215 million children in the world who are being forced to work, including around 115 million who have to perform hard slave labour."
"We cannot allow the economic crisis to make the situation of these children worse."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament has today adopted the necessary sanctions against the Russian officers involved in the trial and the death of Magnitsky."
"Russia, a State that is not a State with a rule of law and where human rights are flouted on a daily basis, does not deserve the attention that France pays to it."
"Therefore, I strongly condemn the sale by France of a Mistral class warship to Russia and regret this action."
"in writing. - Mrs Andrikienė's report is a step in the right direction."
"The EU-Russia relationship is indeed special and should stay special, but not unusually special."
"Russia is bound by its own commitments to protect human rights and to defend its citizens against State abuse."
"The Magnitsky case, referred to in the report, follows the murders of Politkovsaya, Estemirova and Barburova."
"This is a pattern, not a succession of tragic accidents beyond the abilities of Russia's judiciary."
"And yet, murder after murder, the Russian authorities tell the outside world that this time the guilty will definitely be found and punished."
"What is the result?"
"Zero, nil, nothing!"
"The Russian State Duma even accused the European Parliament of interference in Russia's internal affairs and used a bunch of lies to smear the Andrikienreport."
"If Europe is to maintain its credibility as a defender of democracy and human rights, the Andrikienreport should be adopted as it is, with no special provisions for Russia's constant abuses."
"A resolution in the Canadian Parliament already backed a travelling ban and the freezing of the accounts of those linked to the Magnitsky case."
"We should follow suit and send Russia a clear and resolute message."
"Enough is enough!"
"in writing. - The European Union's continued protection of human rights has paid great dividends worldwide and we must further our efforts in this age of globalisation."
"Admittedly, this is a slow and sometimes tedious process, but it is important that we expand our goals and look at real world scenarios in order to develop efficient strategies."
"Furthermore, I wish to voice my support for the protection of human rights defenders and policies that will provide for the continued spread of democracy to those countries that have yet to make this change."
"As we have seen with the recent Nobel Prize and Sakharov Prize winners, protection of these human rights defenders is of the utmost importance and these measures are a step toward that end."
"Parliament's efforts to spread democracy and protect human rights continue to make progress, and in today's globalised world we know about injustices at a faster rate."
"This access to information makes it easier for us to monitor and react to situations around the world."
"We must therefore take advantage of this and continue our efforts to ensure that all people are given the fundamental rights that we have worked so hard to preserve."
"Composition of Parliament : see Minutes"
"A new strategy for Afghanistan (debate)"
"(FR) - The next item is the report by Mr Arlacchi, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a new strategy for Afghanistan."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, the report that we considered today has been approved virtually unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs of this Parliament."
"It is the result of one year's work by a team which I led and is based on extensive consultations in Kabul and Brussels."
"This report is an attempt to explain a paradox: why has so little been achieved in Afghanistan, in spite of nine years of international involvement?"
"Since 2001, military operations inside that country have cost more than EUR 300 billion and several thousand human lives, and at least another EUR 40 billion have been spent on the civilian side: in total, more than 30 times the current Afghan GDP."
"In spite of this huge effort, Afghanistan is still the number one producer of narcotic drugs."
"It is still one of the poorest countries in the world, where - for the majority of the Afghan population - life is short, brutal and nasty, as it was in our continent five centuries ago."
"There are more victims of maternal mortality alone in Afghanistan than the war: over 20 000 a year as against 2 300."
"The answer to this paradox is not simple."
"The opium problem and the strength of the insurgency must be taken into account, along with the belief in the illusion of a quick military victory, which dominated the early years of the international presence."
"Moreover, the legitimacy of the central government has been overestimated, as has the efficiency of international aid in the reconstruction of the country."
"This report does not try to simplify all these matters."
"It accepts the challenge in its full dimension, and this document is an attempt to suggest new directions for our policies."
"The report approaches the subject from a European standpoint."
"This means that the Afghan crisis is considered from an angle that does not simply mirror the American perspective on it."
"European values and principles matter."
"They influence the way the Afghan problem is seen by European citizens, and they do not believe in a military solution in principle, because more than 65 years ago we abandoned the idea that war and occupation of foreign lands is good solution."
"Today's EU is built on an aversion to war, and this report reflects this feeling."
"On the specific issue of Afghanistan, EU citizens strongly support a civilian approach as an alternative to the use of force."
"Our approach is not naive; it is not, as has been said, Venus's softness against Mars's strength."
"It is instead the power of reason, of human solidarity, applied to a crisis like the Afghan one that cannot be approached with a simplistic solution and mentality."
"This report proposes a strategy that does not exclude the limited use of coercive means."
"The security of the people of Afghanistan from terrorists and criminal attacks is a prerequisite for development, and this Parliament believes that the combination of peace-keeping interventions, multilateral diplomacy, domestic peace negotiations, effective poverty reduction measures, the establishment of democratic institutions and the protection of women's rights are the pillars of a new, winning strategy in Afghanistan as elsewhere."
"I hope that the strategy which is outlined here will be implemented carefully by the new system, and I take this opportunity to invite Baroness Ashton to join Parliament in this endeavour."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, I want to begin by honouring the memory of Richard Holbrooke, a dedicated diplomat, a champion of peace and a man I was proud to call my friend."
"I want to pay tribute to the honourable Member Mr Arlacchi for the comprehensive report and for work that I know he has done which has provoked a rich debate in this Parliament over the last few months."
"For my part, I look forward to working very much with him and other colleagues in Parliament in the months ahead as we enter what I would describe as a crucial phase in our engagement in Afghanistan."
"As Mr Arlacchi said, the problems that face Afghanistan in a sense concern all of us."
"Violent extremism extends beyond the region."
"Drugs grown and produced in Afghanistan find their way to the streets of Europe."
"Our engagement is spurred by the need to prevent Afghanistan becoming a safe haven for terrorism and criminal activities."
"But it is equally important that we promote a better, more secure and prosperous future for the people of Afghanistan."
"Without that, there will not be a solution."
"In response to these challenges I want to begin by saying, as I have said many times in other places, that the European Union is in Afghanistan for the long term."
"We have an assistance programme up to 2013 - and, I am sure, beyond - and we have now increased the baseline of our assistance to EUR 200 million per annum, which is up from EUR 150 million per annum previously."
"With that funding we are able to continue to support health and social welfare as well as governance and the rule of law, and despite the fact that security concerns are in the forefront of all our minds, I believe we have had some noticeable success in key social sectors."
"I have already mentioned in this House the health sector where, for example, 80% of the country now has some form of access to primary health care, compared with less than 10% in 2001."
"It is also true that health indictors in Afghanistan are still amongst the worst in the world, so we have a long way to go."
"That said, we know from the UN figures that, compared with 2001, 40 000 fewer babies are dying each year in Afghanistan, and that is due to considerably improved prenatal care."
"We also continue to channel as much of our assistance as possible through the Afghan Government structures to ensure that we get Afghani leadership of the reform process."
"About 50% of our assistance goes either through national programmes or through trust funds that directly support the Afghan Government."
"This is good for donor coordination, good for building local capacity and good for reinforcing Afghani ownership."
"It sets a good example for many other donors too."
"But there is always room for improving international coordination."
"We need to do more and we need to do it better."
"But looking at what the European Union does, I think we have made real progress, significantly enhanced by the arrival of our new EU Special Representative Head of Delegation Vygaudas Ušackas, who arrived in Afghanistan in April."
"Our political messaging is more coherent, and we are enhancing the coordination of our development efforts within the EU through the action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which was approved in October last year by the Council of Ministers."
"The action plan brings the instruments that are being deployed collectively and by individual Member States in line with our policy priorities - especially those arising from the Kabul Conference, which I attended in July."
"Aligning our efforts and our approach is a key aspect of the plan."
"It identifies areas where we as the European Union believe our action will be most effective."
"Indeed, European Union development ministers under my chairmanship were discussing precisely these issues last week in Brussels."
"That brings me in a sense to the key message I want to give today, namely that the implementation of our existing strategies needs to be the priority."
"The strategic framework is in place in both the military and the civilian spheres."
"Together with both Presidents, I participated in the ISAF meeting in Lisbon last month, where the transfer of security responsibility under the NATO transition plan was agreed."
"I have met with General David Petraeus three times in recent months and, while much remains to be done, I am confident that the current strategy is beginning to have a real impact."
"On the civilian side, we had the successful Kabul Conference."
"The Afghan Government is to be applauded for the organisation and the focus of the event in July."
"It was not the usual roll-call of requests and donor pledges."
"Rather, the agenda focused on how best to prioritise our existing resources and commitments, channelling our efforts into agreed national programmes that have been developed by the Afghanis themselves."
"These national priority programmes paved the way for transition across a range of different sectors and we need now to support them, which is precisely what our action plan is doing."
"We all know that there can be no sustainable military exit from Afghanistan without a civilian framework for stability that can keep the country together."
"More effective state institutions, better governance, access to basic services, justice and the rule of law are just as important as hard security."
"We will thus reinforce our efforts to strengthen Afghan capacity and will work with the Afghan Government to foster effective and accountable state institutions, especially at the sub-national level."
"Indeed, in all the areas we are engaged in - rural development, law enforcement, border management or tackling the narcotics trade - we will work to build up local Afghan institutions, putting the emphasis on promoting the rule of law and governance and on fighting corruption."
"On the question of Afghan institutions, I want to end with a word on Afghan undertakings."
"Our efforts on development will only become sustainable once the Afghan Government becomes more accountable and inclusive."
"We need to encourage them to take such a long-term view."
"At present, half the human capacity in the country is marginalised, and yet we have seen from other examples in the world that the engagement of women in the governance and development processes is fundamental."
"I was struck by this untapped potential when I met with women's groups in Kabul last July."
"This will remain a key aspect of our engagement in Afghanistan, be it in the political support to women MPs in the new Afghan Parliament or through our support to women's participation in local development projects such as the widely-recognised National Solidarity Programme, which we have been funding through the World Bank since 2002."
"As I close, I am grateful to the honourable Member, Mr Arlacchi, for highlighting so many important issues in this report."
"I believe it comes at a really opportune moment with so much at stake to both our military and our civilian commitments."
"Madam President, Afghanistan has no longer a great deal of choice."
"Firstly, the status quo is no longer a realistic option insofar as the NATO forces are announcing one after another their withdrawal from Afghanistan, yet we do not yet know whether the country is able to guarantee its own security."
"Secondly, would a return to the pre-2000 situation be an option?"
"Furthermore, if we create a pocket for terrorist networks, we would expose the country once again to a trial of strength with the foreign armed forces."
"Thirdly, should power be entrusted to the moderate Taliban?"
"I am unable to say what I think about this option, as no one can tell us what a moderate Taliban is."
"Let us ask the Afghan women who have emerged from hell and have just rediscovered some freedom."
"Fourthly, what remains is to pursue efforts to consolidate what has been achieved and to continue to fight for more democracy and greater development."
"Karzai, who is seeking to be the embodiment of that option, has come up against a major obstacle, namely his own person."
"Until there is a credible alternative, that is the only option remaining to us."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, our key position in this report is the counter-insurgency strategy in the EU action plan, and I thank Mr Arlacchi for understanding this."
"This strategy must be given time to work according to the timetable set by President Obama, with 2014 as the deadline for the complete Afghanisation of military and police operations."
"The final stage will certainly be political, with an agreement reached through negotiation by all Afghani parties to the conflict."
"Contact with the Taliban is an Afghani affair, but this should begin when the insurgents cease to feel in a position of strength."
"Aid distribution and the use of private contractors need to be rethought so that they benefit the local population - and certainly without paying protection money to local insurgents for the supply routes."
"Equal importance should be accorded to narcotics - alongside security - for the sake of the lives of European young people."
"We are strongly against paragraph 71, which condemns the use of drones - an integral part of the counter-insurgency strategy."
"What are the European soldiers in the field going to think if the European Parliament condemns such an effective weapon in their fight against insurgency?"
"I urge colleagues to vote against the third part of paragraph 71."
"Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the European Union is involved in a number of missions in Afghanistan on the basis of United Nations resolutions."
"Too many young soldiers from Europe have lost their lives in Afghanistan."
"A large number have been seriously injured or are suffering from the mental stress caused by military service."
"Thousands of civilian aid workers from Europe risk their lives every day to help to bring about a better future in Afghanistan."
"All of them and all of us have a right to know how Europe's commitment in Afghanistan can be bought to successful and lasting conclusion and how long we will continue to have a military presence in the country."
"What needs to be changed or improved and what are the objectives of the new EU strategy for Afghanistan?"
"We need to make greater efforts in the area of civil reconstruction."
"We must at last make progress with retraining the Afghan police force and judiciary."
"We know that there will not be a military solution and, therefore, we must increase our efforts to bring about a political solution to the conflict, by means of the EU and a common foreign policy."
"We must show determination and push forward with the internal reconciliation process in Afghanistan and include moderate members of the Taliban."
"We need to put in place specific initiatives, in particular at a regional level, to stabilise the situation."
"This involves, in particular, effective means of combating drug cultivation and trafficking."
"Our strategy includes good proposals."
"We call on the Afghan Government to demonstrate that it has the will to introduce a better system of governance which is free from corruption."
"However, the new EU strategy can only be successful if it no longer plays a passive role, but actively involves the neighbouring countries."
"Baroness Ashton, we are putting our hopes on you, we are relying on you and you have our full support."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SL) Madam President, thank you for remembering ambassador Richard Holbrooke."
"It is right that we should remember him today as we speak about Afghanistan, in gratitude for what he did to promote peace."
"For the world, for the European Union and for us all, Afghanistan is a problem with which we would be able to deal relatively quickly and efficiently if the times and the methods were different."
"It is obvious today that, as we are exploring other avenues, this problem cannot be solved by military means."
"This report, which was prepared by Professor Pino Arlacchi, a sensitive connoisseur of Afghanistan and of the dark side of global politics, is helping to make those other avenues possible."
"Nonetheless, we see new victims, both civilians and uniformed combatants, dying every day."
"The report provides an insight into information on missed opportunities for investment, irregularities surrounding and abuses of humanitarian aid, profits made by international drug trafficking networks and the illusions which military leaders have been under."
"Today, it is clear that Al Qa'ida's presence in Afghanistan is no longer the central problem."
"However, it is a problem which will export the fight against international terrorism into the neighbouring countries and regions for as long as fighting in Afghanistan continues."
"The report warns that real and long-term solutions in Afghanistan, such as those that will raise human rights, the position of women and prospects for children closer to the standards with which we are familiar, will only be possible if the Afghan authorities, religious leaders and civil society are actively and strongly involved."
"We need to be more confident than before that they are able to build a society and a state on foundations that are close to their definition of freedom and their traditions and values."
"This report is a valid attempt at defining the key problems and possible solutions for Afghanistan."
"The report is an incentive for a responsible and creative European Union policy in Afghanistan."
"Madam President, Mrs Ashton, may I take this opportunity to thank Mr Arlacchi for the constructive atmosphere in which we have worked."
"This report offers a very honest, very fair analysis of the shortcomings in the international intervention in Afghanistan since 2001."
"We approve its key message: there will be no military solution."
"The war is having a huge cost."
"The war is costing human lives both amongst the soldiers and the population and it only serves to strengthen the Taliban."
"The only solution is a political one."
"What the Afghans are waiting for is real investment in their country's development, in support for good governance, in the creation of a judicial system."
"The problem of fundamental rights, most importantly women's rights, remains intact."
"The very recent report of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan demonstrates the inability of the Afghan Government to fully safeguard the rights of women and girls."
"I quote: 'As long as women and girls are subject to practices that harm them, degrade them and deprive them of their rights, little significant or lasting progress can be made in Afghanistan'."
"In order to safeguard the rights of Afghan women, not only do we need written legal and constitutional guarantees, but more importantly their rapid and appropriate application."
"The National Assembly has little influence in the country, the bulk of the power being concentrated in the hands of President Karzai."
"If it is not too late, unfailing support, to strengthen democracy and the state of law, must come from the European Union to the various institutions and, in particular, to the parliament that has just been elected."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, for the past year I have served as personal representative of the chairman-in-office of the OSCE Kazakhstan, preparing a detailed report on the key environmental issues affecting central Asia."
"I have sent you a copy of my report, Baroness Ashton."
"One of the key issues which affects the whole of Central Asia is of course the question of transboundary water utilisation."
"As you know there is great and constant tension between the upstream and downstream nations in central Asia involving water use."
"But one aspect of this problem emerged during the course of my investigation that has, I think, been missed by many decision makers in the west."
"The mainstay of the Afghan economy is agriculture and any rebuilding of the economy in a post-conflict Afghanistan will mean massive investment in agriculture, encouraging for example farmers to switch from growing heroin poppies to growing pomegranates."
"That in turn will mean a huge additional utilisation of already scarce water resources."
"In other words, by helping to resolve the current conflict in Afghanistan, we could inadvertently create a series of mini-Afghanistans downstream as acute water shortages are exacerbated."
"We must take care to ensure that any new irrigation schemes are properly designed, with concrete-lined channels and reservoirs, and droplet irrigation systems similar to those used by farmers in Spain."
"In addition, any major energy projects involving hydroelectric power plants must be carefully designed and constructed to ensure that they do not create any disadvantage for downstream water users in neighbouring countries."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, the United States and NATO-led war in Afghanistan is an unmitigated disaster for the Afghan people, an estimated 30 000 of whom were killed last year alone."
"It is also a disaster for the young men and women forced to join and fight there in the armies of NATO and the United States, of whom perhaps 500 have already been killed this year."
"As the Arlacchi report makes very clear, after nine years the economic and social situation in Afghanistan is extremely dire."
"The number of people living in poverty has increased dramatically."
"What a scandal this is, considering that USD 300 billion have been obscenely wasted on weapons of mass destruction and war and lost in corruption over that time."
"The US invasion of Afghanistan was undertaken not to advance the interests of the Afghan people but the geostrategic interests of the United States in Central Asia, which of course is rich in energy, oil and gas."
"Foreign armies must be withdrawn and such wealth as exists in Afghanistan should be taken from the hands of the Karzai government, corrupt landlords and warlords and put democratically in the hands of organisations of peasants, workers and the poor to really utilise those resources and develop them for the benefit of the people."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (NL) Madam President, as rapporteur in charge of drafting the European Union's position on Iran, I have focused, in the resolution on Afghanistan, on the Islamic Republic's role in the Afghan theatre of war."
"However, the resolution deals with the interesting influence of Iran only very fleetingly and also, in my opinion, with little regard for reality."
"Meanwhile, the crucial question remains: how does the European Union assess Iran's actual influence in Afghanistan and what political consequences does it anticipate from that?"
"For this reason, I will put three questions to Madam High Representative and I would like to think, Madam Ashton, that you will answer these in writing."
"I, too, would prefer to get specific answers."
"1."
"To what extent does mass deportation of Afghan refugees on the part of Iran have a destabilising impact on the western part of Afghanistan?"
"I am thinking here of Nimruz and Herat."
"2."
"Do you share the official Afghan view that Iran is attempting to infiltrate foreign terrorists into the country under the cover of these deportations?"
"3."
"What kind of assistance is the European Union providing to the Afghan authorities in terms of receiving large numbers of refugees from Iran, in order to prevent Teheran from politically abusing this sensitive humanitarian issue and from instrumentalsing it in order to make Kabul independent and put it under political pressure."
"Madam President, this report demolishes the lies of the British political class about the Afghan War."
"I do not know the names of any of the innocent Afghan victims of this wicked war, but I do know that it has nothing to do with British interests."
"And I know the names of the 18 brave young men from my constituency who paid with their lives for this madness in the last year alone."
"Warrant Officer David Markland, Lancashire; Kingsman Sean Dawson, Stalybridge;"
"What a criminal waste of brave young lives!"
"It is, of course, no business of the European Union what wars Britain should or should not fight."
"That is for the British people and our elected representatives in our House of Parliament in Westminster to decide, just as it will be for us to decide one happy day to put Messrs Blair, Brown and Cameron on trial for war crimes, because Afghanistan, just like Iraq, is a criminal war."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I share with the rapporteur the idea that the huge problems still present today in Afghanistan should be approached in a new way, in other words with a different definition of priorities compared to what has been done so far."
"I share his satisfaction with the fact that the Afghan President, Mr Karzai, has set a target of 2014 for the beginning of the period in which only Afghan National Security Forces will conduct military operations in all various provinces and the Afghan Government's to commitment to a phased exercise of full authority over its own security."
"All this, however, should not mean that the international community abandons the Afghan cause."
"The partnership with Afghanistan should instead be strengthened in every way."
"Firstly, we need to promote investment in the economy because this really would mean investing in the country's stability."
"This must be done in the right way, in other words by establishing a model of cooperation based on an inclusive dialogue between social organisations and local institutions."
"However the key issue, as the report correctly states, is the fact that there can be no stability or peace in Afghanistan without the state first of all guaranteeing security for its citizens on its own responsibility."
"On this topic, I call on the rapporteur, Mr Arlacchi, to revise, if possible, perhaps through an oral amendment, the passage on the use of drones on the ground and make it more operational."
"In other words, it is one thing to say 'it is forbidden to use drones' and it is another thing to say 'we will limit the use of this technological instrument as far as possible', and then maybe add 'in order not to impact the civilian population'."
"I am sure we can reach a compromise, I believe that Mr Arlacchi has the insight and the resources to do so."
"We will willingly support him in this work."
"(BG) Madam President, what we are discussing today is probably one of the most important reports on external policy and security for 2010."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Arlacchi for his efforts and the results he has achieved."
"We can judge the results of our current Afghanistan policy by the shocking figures on rising infant mortality, falling life expectancy and growing illiteracy and poverty."
"By comparison, five days of war cost the same as it would to eliminate poverty, and a week of war costs the same as 6 000 schools."
"I am aware that comparisons of this kind are not straightforward, but they give us an idea of the quandary we currently find ourselves in."
"At the same time, numerous reports have shown grave shortcomings, embezzlement and corruption in the distribution of international aid."
"Since 2002, the European Union and its Member States alone have poured in over EUR 8 billion with no palpable result."
"No less alarming is the fact that the selection and training of recruits for the Afghan police force does not even meet the minimum standards: 90% of the police force is made up of illiterate citizens; and one-fifth are drug users."
"I mention this because we cannot speak of a new strategy for Afghanistan unless we open our eyes to the real facts."
"There are no easy solutions or prescriptions, but we urge everyone to be aware that the only solution is a political solution, one which emphasises a strong engagement with Afghan institutions and citizens in their country's development which will have an effect over the long term by creating stable prerequisites for halting opium production and eliminating poverty."
"(SV) Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Arlacchi, who has done an excellent job on this strategy."
"I think it is a splendid demonstration of the challenges we are facing, but also of the mistakes we have made up to now."
"I hope that we can learn from this document in order to improve our action in Afghanistan."
"There are a few elements that are worth considering in more detail."
"Firstly, there is the somewhat radical, but important idea of actually holding serious talks with the so-called 'moderate Taliban'."
"This is surely the only solution."
"At the same time, I believe that many of us would find it difficult to define exactly what and who a moderate member of the Taliban actually is."
"I believe, therefore, that we have grounds for holding a debate on this matter, and I think that recent events have shown that this is not really clear for any of us."
"Another matter that I would like to address is the question of the money provided in aid and how that money is developed."
"I think it is a positive development that we are going to have the courage to channel it through the Afghan Government's budget in future."
"After all, this is probably the only way to go about it, although I think it needs to be done with due consideration."
"We also have reason to demonstrate to the electorate in our own Member States that we are monitoring this and that the misuse of aid will not be too significant."
"Last but not least, I think it is a good thing that Pakistan's role is mentioned, because this is also vital."
"I think we all agree about that, and here the international community has an important role to play in putting pressure on Pakistan to do what it should be doing."
"Finally, I would like to say that I come from a country where, as things stand at the moment, the debate about Afghanistan solely concerns whether or not the Finnish troops should stay there, and this is not particularly constructive."
"There is no discussion of the substance of the matter, only whether or not the troops should be there."
"The same applies to our neighbouring country of Sweden, for example, and therefore such initiatives as this serious strategy provide a sound contribution for future debate."
"(PL) Madam President, four years ago I was an observer at elections to the Palestinian Authority, and I do mean the Palestinian Authority."
"I remember the illusory opinion of one of the more important people in the European Parliament."
"That person said to me: 'Why, the people from Hamas are basically nice, cultured, friendly people."
"Perhaps we should negotiate with them.'"
"Today, I hear the same."
"I hear, today, that perhaps we should negotiate with the moderate Taliban."
"Only, the question arises - who are the moderate Taliban, and is this not too flexible a concept?"
"I would caution against taking such a line."
"It is clear that a great many soldiers are being killed in Afghanistan - including soldiers from my country, from Poland - far too many of these soldiers are being killed, our strategy is costing too much money, and NATO's strategy is also questionable."
"However, I would not throw the baby out with the bathwater, and I warn against dialogue with people who in reality have objectives which are completely different objectives from ours."
"(FR) Madam President, I am aware that Mr Arlacchi knows Afghanistan well."
"Of the members of this Assembly, he is probably one of those who know this country and complex region best."
"However, let us be clear, this text, in its current state, poses a serious problem."
"I do not agree with all our Members who are delighted and pat themselves on the back for this text."
"I shall tell you why."
"I find that this text firstly has the major shortcoming of wanting at all cost to make us, Westerners, responsible for the ills Afghanistan is experiencing."
"I will give you three examples."
"Firstly, Mr Arlacchi writes that health conditions have deteriorated, almost by chance, since we have been there."
"That is astonishing."
"Mrs Ashton stated quite the opposite."
"Nobody noticed this."
"My second point is that in Recital B, read it ladies and gentlemen, Western forces are forces of occupation."
"Those Member States in this Assembly who have lived through occupations will know what a word like this means."
"My third point, on paragraph 71, concerns the question of the drones: ladies and gentlemen, I was an officer in Afghanistan two years ago, as a military doctor."
"I treated German, British, Polish, Italian, French, Allied Afghan soldiers."
"I even treated the Taliban."
"I can tell you that if tomorrow you were to say to our soldiers 'You cannot use drones', that would be tantamount to telling them 'Make contact with the enemy, take risks'."
"I do not know whether it is our responsibility as politicians to say that to our men."
"I am not under-estimating the complexity of the situation."
"I know that war is cruel, but we must, I believe, put a stop to this anti-militarism, this simplistic anti-Americanism, this self-flagellation of Western forces which turns them into the source of all the Afghan ills."
"I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that everything is much simpler than that."
"The enemy is the Taliban, not the Americans and not the Western forces."
"All of this is very complex but we must be careful about how we present matters."
"Madam President, I would like to join Lady Ashton in paying tribute to Richard Holbrooke."
"I admired him for Dayton, met him once for a fascinating dinner in Brussels and was very much impressed by him."
"(NL) Madam President, no strategy that is, primarily, of a military nature stands any chance of succeeding in Afghanistan."
"The number of our troops there has grown from 20 000 in 2001 to 150 000 now and, yet, insecurity has only increased."
"We are seeing more civilian casualties, more dead soldiers and a coalition army which, if my fellow member Mr Juvin will excuse me for putting it in this way, an increasing number of Afghans are now really seeing as an occupying force."
"The strategy should focus on rebuilding the country, local government, the judiciary, education, health, and that includes for women, rural development, but without opium."
"The coalition must take its own principles seriously."
"We have heard some fine words about combating corruption, but nothing has been done about the corruption in and around the presidential palace."
"That is making the Afghans disillusioned and that has to change."
"The anti-corruption efforts of the Afghan police should be bolstered by the European Union, which must set to work by instituting public prosecutors."
"Afghanistan cannot do without reliable administration."
"(PL) Madam President, it will not be possible to establish an efficient programme of assistance for Afghanistan without stabilising its internal situation."
"The main pillar of these measures must be to guarantee security and victory in the fight against rebel forces."
"To this end, it is necessary to increase the commitment of European states as part of the NATO mission and to strengthen Europol forces which, as we know, have not yet reached the numerical strength which was announced."
"It is also essential to cut Taliban forces off from their bases in Pakistan and Peshawar."
"In its reports, the US State Department has shown that a significant source of finance for the operations of the guerrillas is the trade in narcotics."
"This is another area for action from the European Union, which should increase the funds available for encouraging farmers to stop growing poppies."
"I do not think the idea contained in the report which talks about support for General Petraeus's programme is warranted."
"Funds should be obtained on a regional basis, but authority must be central."
"Further break-up of Afghanistan may lead to 'Somalisation' of the country and its division amongst the fighting tribes."
"(EL) Madam President, the state of Afghanistan is an extremely interesting issue for the international community, not only because there are military forces there, but also because forces have been deployed and will be deployed there in future that will launch terrorist attacks and create problems for the international community."
"The truth of the matter, and we should accept it, is that there have been forces such as these, fundamentalists and terrorists, in Afghanistan since the 14th century."
"Twenty-four years ago, Baroness Ashton, this parliament voted through a report by the Committee of Inquiry into Drugs containing a special section on Afghanistan and predictions about the present situation which, unfortunately, have proven to be true."
"The drug problem cannot be suppressed with crops."
"The UN crop programme has failed in practice."
"Opium from Afghanistan, which (according to the specialists) is considered to be the best, funds all activities in Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere."
"It therefore needs to be eliminated but, more importantly, as you said, development efforts are needed, efforts in health, in reducing infant mortality; in other words, we need to show these people a model that they will like, that they will love and want for their future quality of life, that they can integrate into their perception of life."
"Of course, a model such as this will help women, because the state to which the Taliban reduced women is a monumental issue."
"Women are already in a terrible situation and under terrible pressure in Muslim countries."
"Here, things are even worse."
"The European Union needs to stay, Baroness Ashton, and your interventions need to be continuous and to keep their European face, precisely as you yourself said."
"(PT) Madam President, Richard Holbrooke, to whom I also pay a heartfelt tribute, said before he died, ""We must end the war in Afghanistan”."
"The fact is, that this country is vital for European and global security, and it is for this reason, as Pino Arlacchi's report details very well, that we need to correct the huge errors committed in the move to investing in 'Afghanisation' and putting the human safety of the Afghan people first, which involves a responsibility to protect on the part of the foreign forces present."
"Let us not deceive ourselves: the rule of law and democratic institutions cannot be constructed by corrupt warlords, discredited in the eyes of the people."
"Ending the war in Afghanistan also depends on the control that the democratically elected government has over the military power of its neighbour Pakistan, a nuclear power on the margins of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)."
"Provided they end their policy of burying their heads in the sand with regard to these fundamental political questions, Europeans within the European Union and NATO may be able to help end the war in Afghanistan, and also the descent into hell in Pakistan."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I join you in remembering Richard Holbrooke."
"If my own political group had been responsible for drafting this report, our approach would undoubtedly have been very different to that followed by Mr Arlacchi, although I am grateful for the passion with which he has followed the Afghanistan file for so long."
"Due in part to the numerous and crucial amendments tabled by our political group, this report is now less ideological and certainly capable of recognising the critical points encountered over this nine-year period as well as recognising the positive points and the most effective lines of development to be followed in order to help achieve a restoration of full sovereignty to the Afghan authorities."
"While it is true that a military response alone is not sufficient, we must once again forcefully reiterate, on the one hand, that in recent months there have been significant military successes - we need only think of the operations in the areas of Almondo and Kandahar - and on the other hand, more incisive action against the insurgents is also an essential prerequisite to calm down the Taliban forces that we wish to bring to the negotiating table."
"We can only be proud of this military engagement, which has seen the sacrifice of thousands of young soldiers of the International Security Assistance Force contingent, among them many Europeans and many young people from my own country, because it is not only a military commitment but also a commitment to reconstruction."
"We are taking schools, bridges and civil works to these unfortunate lands, which will help with the development of the devastated areas."
"Despite the compromises achieved, I believe there are still some critical issues in the report, particularly those already mentioned on the use of drones."
"I believe it is a serious mistake to deprive ourselves unreservedly of the possibility of using this tool that is proving very useful in some areas of the north-east of the country, where it is more difficult to root out and defeat the Taliban forces."
"I hope that the rapporteur sees fit to rethink this point, otherwise I will join my group in voting against the report."
"(SL) Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Arlacchi on his courageous report."
"Today, as we rightly remember the diplomat Mr Holbrooke and what he did for peace, especially in the Balkans, allow me to quote his statement on the money spent on combating drug trafficking in Afghanistan (USD 1.61 billion)."
"Quote:"
"'The most wasteful and ineffective programme I have seen in and out of government'."
"(SL) Unquote."
"This is similar to all that has happened in these ill-fated ten years of war in Afghanistan."
"I have no time to go into why we fell into the Bush administration's trap, but it is a fact that our citizens expect us finally to put an end to this madness, which has cost us over EUR 300 billion and countless human lives."
"While, back in 2001, some were all too keen to go to war, it is now time to take the difficult risk of peace."
"Our citizens expect us to do so."
"They also expect a political solution and want us to put less confidence in a military solution."
"(RO) Madam President, I am delighted that a consensus was reached on this report by the political groups within the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"The resulting text is much more persuasive than the initial proposal."
"The situation in Afghanistan still requires considerable improvements after nine years of international intervention."
"Socio-economic and security indicators have not visibly improved and decisions have often been made without sufficient Afghan involvement."
"This is why I think that it is neither a framework nor instruments that are lacking."
"In actual fact, we need a strategic plan in line with the commitments made to Afghanistan."
"The EU must assume, alongside NATO, its role in leading an international effort which will aim to treat Afghanistan as a sovereign state."
"I must stress that the only political and diplomatic solution is to increase the involvement of the Afghan Government."
"In this regard, I think that one of the report's key elements is the support expressed for the new counter-insurgency strategy."
"The Lisbon Summit outlined the move to the transition phase, involving the gradual handover of responsibility for security to Afghan forces by 2014."
"In keeping with the commitment it made right at the outset of the mission, my country will not withdraw its troops until Afghan territory is completely secure."
"I must also mention here the important contribution made by Russia in agreeing to our troops and equipment crossing its territory in transit."
"I wish to end by stressing the need, once the transition has got underway, for ISAF troops, who will complete the operation, to be relocated to the areas where the security situation will continue to be uncertain."
"This measure is of paramount importance to the Romanian troops stationed in southern Afghanistan."
"Instability will remain in the region, in spite of the successes achieved in ISAF operations."
"(RO) Madam President, I would first of all like to say that I support the view presented earlier by my colleague Mr Juvin, and I would like to begin my speech by mentioning that I am sorry that the report does not contain 'European Union' in its title."
"I do not believe that we have to speak on behalf of the global community, but only on behalf of the European Union."
"I have therefore endeavoured to highlight this as well in the amendments which I have tabled."
"This obviously does not mean that we have to ignore the cooperation with our allies, especially, as my colleague Mr Juvin mentioned, with the United States."
"I do not think that there is any great need for us at the moment to focus on a completely new strategy."
"I believe that it is better to implement the strategic vision set out during the NATO Summit in Bucharest two years ago."
"In this regard, I do not think that it is about devising a new strategy, but about being consistent in relation to this strategic vision."
"On the other hand, we certainly need to acknowledge and learn from the mistakes which have been made in Afghanistan by the military coalition."
"However, we must avoid the pitfall of seeing the pre-intervention situation through rose-tinted glasses."
"As has already been emphasised, it is important for us to stress that one of the main objectives of our strategy in Afghanistan is to get rid of the Taliban groups from this country."
"However, we must also highlight the positive aspects of intervention, especially of the Petraeus plan."
"Nowadays, Afghanistan is a country where women enjoy more rights, more children go to school, more factories are open and more roads are being built."
"This can be attributed to the way in which we have conducted ourselves in this country."
"The integration of civilian measures such as education programmes and programmes for eradicating poverty and reconstruction and development is a vital step in safeguarding peace in Afghanistan."
"Finally, I would like to stress the need for a pragmatic vision, as proposed by my political group."
"Let us not forget that more than 400 amendments were made to the Arlacchi report."
"(FR) Madam President, I wish briefly to say three things."
"Firstly, I believe, counter to what has been said, that the European Union ought to have its own strategy."
"In Afghanistan, we have men, soldiers, troops who are engaged, we have resources, considerable resources that we have provided and we need to have our own view on matters."
"Secondly, I believe that it is absolutely necessary for the international community's money to benefit the Afghans."
"This, unfortunately, has not been the case for 10 years, and it is something that we can witness on a daily basis on the ground."
"I think that this is probably in part the responsibility of the NGOs and the humanitarian organisations."
"However, and the report possibly does not state this sufficiently, it is also largely due, I fear, to government corruption and to a government which, it must be said, is neither very fair nor very effective."
"Thirdly, there is the question of political dialogue."
"Indeed, there have been attempts to engage in this with the Taliban for a number of years."
"This is not new."
"I personally believe that dialogue is necessary."
"However, I believe that it will be very difficult because to hold a dialogue at a time when we are in a position of weakness on the ground and the withdrawal of troops is at an advanced stage, will, of course, be very complicated."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, now that the several amendments have been approved, we agree with Mr Arlacchi's report and with the priorities that were highlighted in the report for the future development of Afghanistan."
"In particular a transparent financial aid system, the training of domestic police forces, the fight against drug trafficking and the coordination of international aid are the main points of political and military strategy that have been further strengthened."
"It is important to stress again the need to ensure control and stabilisation of the area in order to weaken the action of Taliban forces and revitalise peace processes."
"I conclude by emphasising the contribution that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has made to achieving a shared text and I would also like to pay homage to the efforts and sacrifice of the soldiers of the International Security Assistance Force for their presence on the ground in the defence of freedom and the local populations."
"- (SK) Madam President, in my opinion, armies cannot bring peace and prosperity, and this also applies to Afghanistan."
"We should give some thought to the fact that while some of our fellow Members, chiefly from the EPP, worry about whether we will support a certain type of aircraft - I am no military expert and have no idea what this debate is about - then I believe we should pay far more attention to what Mr Arlacchi is talking about in this report, as it is very important."
"He is talking about the situation of women and children in that country."
"We should definitely focus more on supporting non-discrimination against women and the fight against discrimination."
"We should also focus on the fact that many children in Afghanistan do not have the opportunity to go to school, for example, and many are living below the poverty line."
"In my opinion, if we fail to support projects on education and health, and if we continue to invest in military solutions to this conflict, we will get nowhere."
"Madam President, Mr Arlacchi's report is well researched and informative."
"My slight criticism is that he seems to bemoan the fact that Afghanistan is not a liberal democracy run by a coalition of Greens and Liberal Democrats in Brighton."
"The horror story of Afghanistan has involved the deaths of 346 British soldiers, many more allied soldiers and thousands of innocent Afghans."
"During that period, infant mortality and maternal mortality have soared and life expectancy has fallen."
"He tells us than in 2001 no poppies were being grown in Afghanistan, whereas now, after nine years of conflict and allied influence, Afghanistan supplies more than 90% of the heroin in Europe."
"To point out that there is some discrimination against women is to get things slightly out of proportion."
"The answer is to support our troops by stopping the war and bringing them home to guard our own people against home grown but imported terrorists."
"(RO) Madam President, while both women and children are undoubtedly an important topic, what is important, however, in Mr Arlacchi's report is its clarity."
"I mean by this that it presents the legitimacy of the international intervention in Afghanistan to us and does not question it."
"However, it is a natural and politically responsible step to discuss the effectiveness of this intervention."
"The reason is that, sentimentality aside, an intervention lasting 10 years can cast a complete shadow over the effectiveness of the political decision taken on this issue."
"I believe that each one of us is responsible to those who elected us for coming up with an answer to this question."
"I welcome the clarity of this report also because it mentions matters which we generally avoid discussing for a variety of reasons."
"I believe that it is a report which merely provides a starting point."
"We must have the courage to carry out a regular analysis and evaluation of our actions, admit where we have made mistakes and, when we have made them, we must find other solutions."
"This is what acting both responsibly and democratically is all about."
"- (SK) Madam President, we know from experience that assistance through external intervention works if the majority of the population support such external aid."
"After years of intervention in Afghanistan, we see that the Afghans do not understand us, do not want our help, and do not understand our civilisation or our cultural values."
"In Slovakia we have a saying that 'he who accepts no advice cannot be helped'."
"I do not want to say that the Afghans cannot be helped, but I cannot vote for methods that are explicitly forceful and violent."
"We should above all focus on how to change our assistance and how to structure it so that it meets the needs of the Afghan people."
"I believe it is really necessary for us to gradually withdraw our armed forces and hand over power to the local administration and local politicians, and then to help the people of Afghanistan through the local politicians in such a way that they can identify with the values of our civilisation and understand us, and then perhaps they will be willing and able to accept our help."
"Madam President, our commitment to a stable self-governing Afghanistan, capable of preventing the re-establishment of a terrorist sanctuary there, is strong and long-term, having been reasserted by both the EU and NATO."
"However, precisely because our commitment is a long-term one, I would foresee at least three major challenges."
"The first is that the kind of state model we provide for Afghanistan does not fit the Afghan tradition."
"As the Afghans have to adjust, so too do we, helping them to get an achievable state model combining modernity with the Afghan tradition."
"The second challenge is that the security situation might well continue to require our international military involvement beyond 2014, when the Afghans will take over."
"We should be ready seriously to contemplate either extending the deadline or facing the consequences."
"Finally, the third challenge will be provided by the running-out of our public's patience, which might force us to speed up our present timetable to avoid the alternative of simply declaring victory and going home."
"That would ruin our credibility."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, I will just make a couple of concluding remarks."
"First of all, I would like to thank the European Parliament."
"This has been an interesting and diverse debate, and I commend you for the continued interest and energy that you put into our engagement in Afghanistan."
"That has been very well demonstrated by the discussion today."
"As I said at the beginning, I believe Afghanistan is important for all of us and for our citizens, and that the European Union must rightly remain a key player."
"I hope that I spelled out at the beginning the priorities and plans for the period ahead, together with the recognition of the balance that needs to be struck between channelling resources through the Afghan Government and recognising the importance of ensuring that we battle corruption appropriately, in order to safeguard the resources that we have."
"We remain engaged in key sectors: in health (as I have described), the police, justice, rural development and the sub-national governments - and of course the rule of law is essential."
"Moreover, as I have described, a focus for all these programmes is to ensure that we build up capacity in the local Afghan structures and that the government's priorities in combating the drugs industry and reducing corruption continue to be fully addressed."
"I also pointed out in my speech the importance of engaging and involving women at all levels of Afghan society and, indeed, in the political structures."
"I took note of Mr Stevenson's report and agree that water and irrigation, as in so many parts of the world, are increasingly an issue."
"Mr Belder, I promise I will reply to you, as you specifically asked, in writing."
"I will conclude by again thanking Mr Arlacchi for the report."
"I very much look forward to continuing the discussion on the key points at issue in that report and beyond."
"I end by echoing what was said about Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, and the fact that his final words as he went into his last surgery were on Afghanistan."
"That is very typical of him."
"How I will miss him."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, this has been an extremely interesting and lively debate."
"I just want to make a couple of observations."
"The first is that I am very happy there has been no criticism by anyone of the four main points of the report."
"The report asked for reform of international aid, elimination of opium poppy cultivation, better coordination of police training, and support for the peace process."
"All the observations have been on other issues and I am happy that, after one year of discussion in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, colleagues have confirmed their support for the structure of the report - which is not 'the Arlacchi report'."
"Following its approval by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, this is the committee report that has been approved almost unanimously - with 60 votes for, and one vote against."
"It also includes several compromises agreed on by all the political groups, so it is very important, too, to refer to the real text of the report, which is the final one."
"To Mr Juvin, I would say that there is no mention of occupying forces in Afghanistan."
"That was the original text."
"The final text says 'coalition of international forces in place' in Afghanistan."
"This part of the report has been changed by the amendments."
"The most important issue is drones."
"This is not a report on drones."
"There are just two lines of a compromise between the political groups on the issue of the use of drones."
"I believe that an agreement could have been reached sooner on that, but I trust my interlocutors and all the different positions, and I trust the compromise we reached."
"There is no call in the report for prohibition of the use of drones."
"There is moderate criticism of it, but I believe that an agreement between groups can be found on that."
"I thank you, and I also thank Baroness Ashton."
"I hope she will take full account of the content of the report, which is a very concrete one and calls for an exit strategy from Afghanistan."
"(HU) Madam President, I apologise for speaking now, technically, and I am not putting my question to Mr Arlacchi, but would only like to respectfully address a small reminder or question to Madam President."
"I am an independent Member, and we have very little opportunity to speak."
"Today I did not even have the opportunity to speak."
"I came in one hour early for this debate, very politely went downstairs, and indicated to the staff there that I would like to speak."
"I accept this, it is understandable that there was no time for this today or in this debate, and I will of course submit my speech for today's sitting in writing."
"What I would welcome and what I would like to ask of Madam President is to accord more attention and empathy to independent Members, who unfortunately only have this much opportunity to speak."
"Thank you very much, and I wish you fruitful work."
"(FR) Madam President, to correct what has been said, Mr Arlacchi is quite right, the final text proposed to us no longer contains, in Recital B, the words 'occupation force'."
"Quite simply, the translations, and particularly the French translation, were not correct in the latest version, and the French translation, until this morning, still contained the expression 'occupation force', hence the speech by my colleague Mr Juvin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The strategy presented and approved in Lisbon entails a gradual transfer of control over the area, region by region, from ISAF responsibility to Afghan armed forces."
"Its success depends on what action Pakistan will take, which is part of the problem and will also, inevitably, be part of the solution."
"Moreover, I do not believe that we can ignore the increasingly obvious involvement of Iran in Afghanistan."
"The recent events linked to this involvement are a cause for disquiet."
"I believe that this strategy must go hand in hand with larger, more high-profile civilian projects, which will support the development of these regions where poverty is ubiquitous and the presence of ISAF and US forces has not brought about any fundamental changes."
"After our withdrawal, we cannot leave behind us the same problems which resulted in the Taliban's rise to power during the last decade."
"I hope that this new strategy will work and enable Afghanistan to regain peace and stability."
"The strategy pursued so far on Afghanistan has not brought the expected results."
"I was pleased to learn of the establishment of a calendar for NATO involvement in Afghanistan and of the signing of a declaration on long-term partnership with the country during the NATO Summit in Lisbon."
"The EU, too, is presenting a more consistent and better coordinated approach to the region, which takes account of civil aspects and the significance of regional cooperation."
"We should continue to support reforms intended to combat poverty, discrimination against women and the production of opium."
"Our efforts must concentrate on increasing respect for human rights and law and order, building a state of law and integrating Afghanistan fully into the international community."
"They should also include building and reforming the administration and the public service corps by training programmes, help with construction and the use of existing infrastructure and advice from the EU."
"Afghanistan should participate in establishing and implementing priorities which will help to build civil society and ensure that Afghans assume responsibility for the country."
"At the same time, we must remember to ensure the security of those we send to Afghanistan - the trainers and members of the armed forces whose job it is to see that these plans are put into effect."
"We cannot agree to ending the use of remote controlled aircraft, as this would cause a significant reduction in the safety of these people."
"Our strategy should take into account both the security of the citizens of Afghanistan and of our representatives, who are working for the development of the country."
"in writing. - (DE) The report on a new strategy for Afghanistan presents the absolutely necessary critical picture of the situation in that country."
"The report makes it clear that the NATO strategy of solving complex political and military problems by military means has failed."
"Therefore, it calls explicitly for a new strategy from the international community with a focus on civil reconstruction."
"I welcome the fact that the European Parliament, in contrast to many parliaments in the Member States, is sending out a clear signal with this report that the conflict must be brought to an end and that a change of policy is needed in order to achieve sustainable political, economic and democratic development in Afghanistan."
"We must support the fundamental message of this report."
"However, I disagree with the assessment that the Afghanistan strategy produced by the most recent NATO Summit can bring about a successful outcome."
"I call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan."
"The European Union Police Mission (EUPOL) has failed and should not be extended or developed."
"The roll-call votes on the paragraphs relating to some of these issues have allowed me to express my disagreement with the report."
"I also regret the fact that the report does not take a more critical approach to the tendency to give military strategies a higher priority than civil reconstruction and does not pay sufficient attention to the human rights situation, in particular with regard to women."
"Outcome of the NATO Summit in Lisbon (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the outcome of the NATO Summit in Lisbon."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, the NATO Summit in Lisbon was a success for NATO and indeed for its Secretary-General."
"I was very pleased to have participated in some of its discussions."
"I will outline to honourable Members what I think are the important results achieved, focusing particularly on EU-NATO relations and I will not touch on the more internal NATO issues."
"In Lisbon, the Heads of State and Government agreed on a new strategic concept, a vision for the alliance for the next ten years."
"NATO preserved its core tasks of collective defence and deterrents and recognised the importance of crisis management and cooperative security."
"Lisbon also paved the way for important decisions for NATO in a number of key areas such as missile defence, cyber defence, NATO reform and NATO's contribution to stabilisation and reconstruction."
"In relation to Afghanistan, which we just discussed and which is also an important area of cooperation between the EU and NATO, decisions were taken on both transition and on long-term partnership."
"I am going to focus on how Lisbon will in my view improve EU-NATO relations."
"This was also on the agenda of the Defence Ministers' meeting which I chaired last week and which was also attended by NATO Secretary-General Anders Rasmussen."
"NATO is a key strategic partner for the European Union."
"I welcome the recognition by NATO Heads of State and Government of the important contribution the European Union brings to security and stability."
"I would like to underline the strong political commitment to the strengthening of the EU-NATO strategic partnership expressed by all, especially from President Obama."
"I have been very actively engaged with Member States and allies and the NATO Secretary-General in order to reinforce EU-NATO relations."
"My participation in several NATO high-level meetings, including the Foreign Affairs dinner at the NATO Lisbon summit, which also focused on EU-NATO relations, has been instrumental in this regard."
"Earlier this year I took the initiative of sending NATO a set of concrete measures to reinforce EU-NATO cooperation."
"Many of these measures have already been implemented in the European Union with the support of the Secretary-General of NATO."
"This generated opportunities for informal discussions on issues of common interest, as well as more EU political dialogue with all NATO allies."
"My ambition is to pave the way to even more progress."
"I received a mandate for that at the European Council on 16 September."
"In Lisbon, Secretary-General Rasmussen received a similar mandate to work with me on reinforcing EU-NATO relations."
"One area of progress is EU-NATO cooperation on capability development, an area where we are achieving promising results, particularly on the military capability development, which is necessary for both enhancing military capabilities and maximising cost effectiveness."
"More than ever we have to ensure complementarity and avoid duplication."
"On 9 December, EU Ministers of Defence warmly welcomed the progress that has been achieved in strengthening cooperation with NATO."
"We have already worked together, for example on helicopter availability, and we have now defined the building blocks on counter improvised explosive devices and medical support."
"These are both vitally important areas of work with real operational consequences for our troops serving in the field."
"Just to give a couple of concrete examples."
"In the field of helicopter availability, we already had two exercises in France and in Spain."
"Similar exercises are planned for the next four years."
"In that context, we trained a 114 crews, that is over 1 300 personnel with 58 helicopters."
"As an immediate result, 63 trained crews were deployed in Afghanistan."
"Another example, this time in the field of countering road-side bombs, is the counter improvised explosive devices, where the European Defence Agency is in the final phase of purchasing a forensic laboratory which could be deployed in Afghanistan next year."
"We have also continued to improve cooperation through the productive interaction between the European Defence Agency and the allied command for transformation."
"Overall, my goal remains the development of true organisation-to-organisation relationship between the European Union and NATO."
"The meeting of Ministers of Defence last week paved the way to move forward towards that goal."
"Pending wider solutions, it is essential that we can count on solid arrangements between us when we are deployed together in the same theatre."
"We owe this to our personnel."
"It is also essential to be able to continue to work effectively to support the Member States and the allies to develop critical military capabilities, building on the successful work we have launched already."
"I would argue that this is even more important in the current context of the economic backdrop."
"We will all need flexibility to be able to take this forward and to find solutions."
"I will move forward in a concrete and pragmatic way working on behalf of all 27 Member States."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the NATO Summit has shown that the cooperation between NATO and the European Union which was discussed there is highly important."
"NATO remains essential to the collective security of Europe and it is an important means of tying in America."
"The summit has made it clear that the missile defence system, which is now safeguarding the whole of Europe as part of a joint NATO project, is an important step towards further cooperation."
"However, it also became obvious, and the debate on Afghanistan is an example of this, that there is a high level of civil and military cooperation in an area where the European Union can make a significant contribution."
"I believe that we need to develop this accordingly."
"However, we must understand that no progress has been made in one decisive area, because the necessary cooperation, which needs to be organised much more effectively, has been vetoed by NATO's partner Turkey."
"Baroness Ashton, I believe that it is extremely important that this question is addressed in the context of the accession negotiations with Turkey."
"We should not make NATO and the cooperation between NATO and the European Union into an instrument for use in a dispute with a Member State of the European Union which is not a member of NATO."
"For this reason, I believe that the fact that Turkey has not yet taken the necessary steps is having a decisive impact on our ability to act."
"Of course, I welcome the fact that the question of arms cooperation indicates that collaboration with the European Defence Agency is possible, with the cyberspace issue, in particular, being of great significance for the agency."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, the NATO Summit in Lisbon has acknowledged the new realities, challenges and non-conventional threats of the post-Cold War world."
"On that basis it has tried to establish a new balance between the alliance's regional and global involvement."
"A global NATO, or a NATO with a global role, is a must. Certain consequences are implied."
"Firstly, the European Union must prepare itself to assume more responsilities as far as European security and defence are concerned."
"This means not only developing and updating our European security and defence concept but also developing our military capabilities."
"Secondly, the European Union has a duty to prepare itself to face global challenges and to behave like a truly global player."
"This means that we have to redefine our global interest and targets, and increase our military capacities to an extent which will allow us properly to share the burdens of global defence with our American allies."
"Thirdly, we have a duty to include in our strategies concerning relations with other global players ideas which will lead towards a system of partnership for defence, with capacity for aggregation within a global defensive pact."
"In coping with all these duties, the European Union should not only preserve its strategic connection with NATO but should also be able to make its intellectual and political contribution with regard to maintaining NATO's ability to deter, and its ability to defend Member States against any aggression, in a context different from the one which determined the birth of the alliance."
"Madam President, I believe that the Lisbon Summit is the first since 1999 to make a beneficial contribution in terms of a strategic vision for the Alliance."
"I think that a more important consideration in this century is that not only the existing threats and security interests but also, in particular, the ability of defence budgets to offer effective military solutions raise for discussion the issue of a bipolar world."
"It was time for a broad analysis to be carried out of the direction in which the Alliance is heading, and certainly if compatibility with Russia is an aspect of it."
"However, I must stress that, in my view, compatibility with the European security project is also vital to NATO."
"The Afghanistan issue seems to have given a sufficiently large boost to the Alliance and I am pleased to note that Russia has agreed to become involved in NATO's efforts in Afghanistan."
"I hope that this complex problem of Afghanistan will not be one of the causes for concern with regard to this alliance's future effectiveness."
"I also welcome that the European Union has raised the issue of anti-missile technology for discussion."
"I believe that we will have to discuss at EU level the effectiveness of this anti-missile shield."
"Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the NATO Summit in Lisbon is of great importance for the EU and for Parliament, because we can only manage European security successfully in future if NATO, the EU and other organisations, such as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), each make a contribution and cooperate effectively."
"However, until now the results of the summit in Lisbon have essentially been glossed over."
"I would like to say, with just a hint of irony, that although NATO has a new strategy, it still does not know where it wants to go."
"The overblown fantasies of NATO as the world's police force have been discarded and that certainly represents a certain amount of progress."
"It is taking a slightly more modest approach, but there is still not enough clarity."
"Let me demonstrate this using some examples."
"1."
"One example is arms expenditure."
"The Member States of the European Union want to reduce their arms spending by means of permanent, structured cooperation, but NATO is signing uncovered cheques for missile defence."
"The Secretary General says that the amount is EUR 200 million, but all the experts believe that the missile defence system is more likely to cost between EUR 40 billion and EUR 70 billion and we do not even know how it will be managed."
"2."
"A second example is nuclear disarmament."
"President Obama's Global Zero vision in Prague was impressive and we welcomed it."
"Europe was no longer in agreement even at the conference on the non-proliferation treaty, but NATO is determined to hang on to its nuclear deterrent, like a blind person clinging to a lamp post."
"Former world powers, in particular, obviously find their nuclear weapons much more attractive than an ambitious European policy for nuclear disarmament."
"3."
"The third example is peacebuilding and civil conflict resolution."
"The European Union has achieved a great deal in this area."
"Then along comes NATO and also wants to be involved. The next thing that NATO expresses an interest in will be development policy."
"Unfortunately, it has a split personality in security policy terms."
"Let us bring this to an end."
"Let us ensure that we produce a white paper in a year's time which makes it clear what sort of security policy we want in Europe."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, NATO remains a fundamental element of Europe's collective security and so does the bridge it builds with America."
"At the Lisbon Summit, NATO redefined its place at the heart of the Euro-Atlantic security architecture for its new strategic concept."
"My role as Vice-Chair of this Parliament's delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly has made me more convinced than ever of the value of NATO and of EU cooperation with it."
"I am full of admiration for the work of NATO ISAF troops in Afghanistan but regret the lack of participation by some of our allies with restrictive caveats on military engagement, in a situation where defeat, or cutting and running prematurely on the part of NATO, would have incalculable consequences for Western security and for lasting peace in the region - destabilising Pakistan in particular."
"Even at a time of austerity, when many Member States are cutting their defence budgets, winning in Afghanistan must be our priority."
"I was also recently in Kosovo, where I saw for myself the valuable work being undertaken by NATO troops in KFOR."
"NATO's operation Ocean Shield is working well off the coast of Somalia to combat piracy, although it is in danger of duplicating the work of the larger EU Common Security and Defence Policy mission Atalanta."
"I welcome coordination between the two."
"I also support NATO enlargement to Georgia and Ukraine one day."
"The Cold War is now gone and the threats we face are increasingly asymmetric and global."
"I welcome the new approach by NATO of looking at the broader picture, from cyber security to the threats posed by climate change and food security, but the rationale for NATO is as strong today as it ever was when the organisation was first founded 61 years ago."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Madam President, the NATO Summit took place in Lisbon, and so I would like to say a few words about what happened in my country in connection with this Summit."
"The Portuguese authorities denied entry to the country to European citizens, for one reason only: these citizens were carrying written material that was critical of the Alliance."
"The least we can say about these events is that what happened in Portugal was an arbitrary regime, real thought police."
"A regime that was so special that it prompted the Portuguese Government to buy five million euros' worth of anti-riot gear, which did not even arrive in time for the Summit."
"These are the priorities of a government that is facing an enormous social crisis."
"In the Europe we dream about, freedom of expression is a fundamental value."
"The Europe we dream about does not bow down before military organisations that write their history with blood."
"The NATO Summit has resulted in the legitimacy of its military intervention anywhere on the planet."
"It has also resulted in the European Union becoming subordinate to North America's military strategy and interests."
"Thirdly, it has consolidated the militarisation of access to energy sources."
"Finally, military defence has instituted a development model that causes environmental imbalance and disturbs the social crisis."
"As a result, I would like to say, Madam President, that in my opinion, with this Summit we lost democracy, we lost freedom, and we lost so that some could win with war."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, thank you for using my full name."
"I think we should celebrate the fact that NATO's Lisbon Summit has strengthened protection for our peace and democracy, in direct contrast to the Treaty of Lisbon which is already doing quite the opposite."
"But NATO is threatened by the savage cuts being imposed on European armed forces."
"These are deeply dangerous."
"It is unforgiveable that the UK Government is slashing spending to below the 2% base level every NATO member is meant to honour."
"It is a false economy too, because defence spending brings good jobs."
"Today the British Harrier jet is removed from service."
"This month we lost the carrier HMS Ark Royal prematurely with the loss of 6 000 dedicated personnel."
"The USA cannot be expected to carry this burden with less and less contribution from us."
"We should be under no illusion that the Americans could pull out of NATO, as top British General Dannatt has warned, and leave us to an emboldened Russian bear still prepared to launch cyber attacks against Estonia and to systematically probe British sea and air defences, in disturbing echoes of the Cold War."
"(DE) Madam President, a historic breakthrough at the NATO Summit has been mentioned."
"Although the dispute between Germany and France over nuclear disarmament has been settled, the fact is that we will not be able to do without nuclear weapons in future."
"This would lay the NATO states open to blackmail from Teheran or Pyongyang."
"A world without nuclear weapons and even without dictatorial regimes will remain an illusion while some states are only taken seriously when they join the ranks of the potential or actual nuclear powers."
"It is also regrettable that the summit managed to avoid the subject of what will happen in the Middle East after the planned withdrawal of US forces from Iraq, which is an unpleasant topic for the United States."
"The much-quoted reversal of Russia's foreign policy trend has proved, after a closer look, to be just a clever tactical move."
"There were declarations of intent relating to terrorism and cyber war, rather than genuine concepts."
"In my opinion, the NATO Summit was far from being a breakthrough."
"(ES) Madam President, the new strategic concept of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), which emerged in Lisbon, was established in order to seek to respond and adapt, firstly to a new context, in other words the disappearance of the system of blockades and the end of the Cold War."
"Secondly, it was established in order to adapt to the new configuration of threats, and particularly to globalisation and the fact that our armies do not have apparent enemies and our enemies do not have armies."
"Based on this new strategic concept, while taking into consideration Article 5 of the Treaty of Washington regarding mutual assistance, there are three aspects that I am interested in."
"Firstly, how to shape this strategic alliance with Europe: Baroness Ashton, I would like to ask you whether you think that Turkey should participate as much as possible in the actions and the development of the common foreign and security policy."
"Secondly, regarding the ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) by the United States Congress, do you think that this new strategic concept will be affected if it is not ratified?"
"Finally, what are your thoughts on the subject of the anti-missile shield?"
"Do you think that this notion in any way compromises the goal of reducing nuclear arsenals?"
"It seems that there are opposing views on this among the Member States."
"(IT) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the new strategic concept developed by NATO contains important, positive changes to meet the challenges of the 21st century in a manner consistent with the values of the Atlantic Pact."
"In particular, we welcome the revival of the strategic partnership with Russia, the explicit formulation of the goal of a world without nuclear weapons, the recognition of the importance of a stronger European defence, the reaffirmation of the principle of collective defence and, at the same time, the statements that NATO does not consider any country to be its adversary."
"There are still, however, problems and contradictions that this far from new concept does nothing to dispel."
"Firstly, there is no clear and unambiguous commitment to the elimination of tactical nuclear weapons, which are still deployed in Europe even though they are strategically anachronistic and economically increasingly unsustainable."
"Secondly, the European Union's role in the strategic concept is still insufficient and the planned civilian crisis management capabilities are at risk of pointlessly duplicating those of the European Union."
"We are aware of the political problems that hinder more effective EU-NATO cooperation, but this cannot get in the way of developing an operational perspective, complementarity and synergies that are a match for our ambitions."
"Helicopters, medical support and explosives represent significant progress but are not enough: we need vision and an active commitment and we call on you, Baroness Ashton, to deploy them both with strength and clarity."
"Madam President, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Secretary-General of NATO, stated that the NATO-Russia Council Summit which took place in Lisbon provided a historic impulse to improving NATO-Russia relations, which I very much welcome."
"Although the NATO-Russia Council Heads of State and Government agreed on a joint ballistic missile threat assessment and decided to resume missile defence cooperation, President Medvedev announced after the summit that Russia will take part in the envisaged joint missile defence system only as an equal and fully fledged partner involved in information exchange and resolving whatever problems."
"I would like to point out that equal partners must take equal responsibilities."
"There are some significant differences between NATO and Russia when defining security."
"While Russia perceives classical military threats to security, NATO on the other hand emphasises the lack of democracy and violation of human rights as a security threat."
"In order for Russia to be more closely involved in joint projects within the framework of NATO, I would expect Russia to mainstream democracy, human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law."
"To have an equal partnership, NATO and Russia must be on an equal footing on such relevant issues."
"Madam President, I would like to welcome Baroness Ashton here."
"We have been listening to her comments on other issues and I think they are very interrelated."
"It would seem strange now to be very specific, but I would like to mention the further development of CSDP in the framework of general cooperation with NATO."
"I think that we really need an outside review of what has happened so far."
"You mentioned, on human rights, that it is time to take stock and move on."
"I think we need exactly the same with regard to the missions that we have had so far."
"I think you have an opportunity to start anew."
"You can look back and have an external expertise and a review in order to define more what our priorities really are and what capabilities we need."
"I would just like to mention that we have headline goals for 2010, but now we are at the end of 2010 and we are far from reaching them, including on the civilian side."
"The question is how we should move forward and I think it would be good to have a view."
"Secondly, I really urge you to use the synergy post, which I hope will now be created in the framework of the setting up of the External Action Service, to strengthen the civilian management capabilities in your service."
"We have not had the chance to create new posts but at least should use them to strengthen this area."
"My last point, very briefly, is that there is a debate now going on regarding crisis response and national disaster response."
"I think we have to be careful there to keep the neutrality of the EU humanitarian response, even if it is sometimes difficult in crisis areas."
"I think this is an important issue."
"(PL) Madam President, NATO has, indeed, emerged from the Lisbon Summit in a stronger position."
"Article 5 has been revived and does not preclude the ability to mount a defence against a ballistic attack."
"The provisions of the new strategy must now be put into effect."
"The plan of action on the transatlantic missile defence architecture should be completed not later than the middle of 2011."
"This should also be backed up by money, including from the European partners in NATO."
"The signing by Russia of a new START treaty must not mean restrictions on building the NATO antimissile architecture."
"In addition, cooperation with Russia in this area must not mean a weakening of the defence of Central Europe."
"(PT) As stated in the conclusion to the NATO Summit that took place in Lisbon, NATO is proving itself to be a military alliance, a nuclear military alliance determined to intervene rapidly and in large numbers in any part of the world, at any time and under any pretext, asserting that it has a single and robust set of political and military capabilities, capable of dealing with any type of crisis: before, during and after conflicts."
"As a worrying global threat, NATO states that it is affected by, and it can affect, political and security developments beyond its own borders and that it will therefore become actively involved in improving international security through partnerships with relevant countries and other international organisations."
"It is an assertion that reveals two objectives: on the one hand, to assert itself as a type of core from which dependency relationships radiate out, enabling its presence, pressure and intervention by its forces all around the globe."
"On the other, to strengthen the path of interventionism and the merger between international security and the internal security of states, thus aiming for the destruction of international law, a direct affront to the role of the United Nations Organisation in its approach to international security issues."
"Commanded by one of the powers, the United States, it also aims to strengthen its European pillar, the European Union, considered to be a single and essential partner of NATO."
"So the NATO that left Lisbon was larger, more powerful, more dangerous and more covert; but the threat is considerable, and the response of the Portuguese people was more than thirty thousand people marching through the streets of Lisbon, fighting against and demanding the disbandment of this organisation which is considered to be so essential in defending peace."
"- (SK) Madam President, even if the negotiations of NATO member state representatives in Lisbon have resolved a number of serious topics regarding security risks in today's world, the significance of some of the conclusions and decisions will surely have a more dramatic effect on the current political world."
"The cautious new attempt at cooperation between NATO and Russia in developing a missile defence system in Europe represents just such a change in security policy, indicating that both the US and Europe may find a powerful new partner in Russia, which perhaps also realises that terrorist groups and militant regimes built on extremist ideologies have become the greatest threat to the peaceful and dignified life of civilised democratic society."
"High Representative Ashton, it would be a good thing if we could also translate the words of President Obama, when he said he saw Russia as a partner and not an enemy, into a positive new impulse in the field of economic cooperation."
"At a time when European industry is struggling with problems to do with insufficient outlets for its products, an open and solvent market space in the Russian Federation might offer opportunities that would be helpful to both partners - Russia and Europe - in their internal economic problems."
"(DE) Madam President, what will the EU's responsibilities be with regard to security and defence in the context of the new strategic concept presented by NATO?"
"The EU defence ministers have touched on a sore point."
"The EU does not have adequate capacity or capabilities."
"However, the financial crisis and budget constraints are increasing the pressure within the EU and NATO to concentrate military capabilities."
"The terms 'sharing' and 'pooling' describe what is now needed."
"As soon as the Member States have investigated what is possible, the European Defence Agency must be the main focus of the joint development of capabilities."
"In addition, the Commission must expand its cooperation with the European Defence Agency to include EU-funded research and development projects."
"Do you share my view?"
"Because I had no speaking time on the previous subject, I would like to ask a question about the topic of promoting democracy."
"I would like to find out from you how much money has actually been spent on the democracy and human rights instrument without the consent of the governments of the countries in question."
"I also have something to say about election observers."
"In this area we are inconsistent and sometimes even cowardly."
"After parts of the Commission and some Member States had pushed for an election observation mission in Ethiopia and the report by the head of the mission could not be presented in Addis Abeba, it was completely hushed up in Brussels."
"What I would like to know is: What has happened to your public protest?"
"You now have the opportunity to say something on this subject."
"Madam President, indeed both the new strategy concept and the summit declaration recognise loudly and clearly that the EU is a major, and therefore indispensible, partner of the Alliance."
"The current international challenges confronting NATO and the EU, their simultaneous presence in a number of theatres of action and, moreover, the increasing complementarity between their respective roles require that the relations between the two organisations be strengthened."
"In that regard, and taking into account the necessary collaboration in theatres of action and - inevitably - the revision of the Berlin Plus agreements, both organisations expect more concrete results from the discussions between the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative and the Secretary-General, in accordance with their respective mandates and, in that respect, the time has come to be imaginative in finding the right political compromise to allow for an unblocking of the current mechanical deadlock and permit both organisations to achieve their truly collaborative potential."
"(ES) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, you are perfectly aware that my parliamentary group is against the existence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)."
"My group is entirely against its existence, among other things because we do not support any state in the world - or any group of states, such as the NATO military alliance - being able to use force without a specific mandate from the United Nations Security Council."
"In 1999 at its Washington Summit, NATO approved in its strategic concept the possibility of using force without a mandate from the Security Council."
"This is a backward step, and a head-on attack on the system of international law that took so much to construct following the two world wars."
"We do not, therefore, agree with this philosophy."
"We do not share it with NATO nor with any state that claims the right to use force without that express mandate."
"Moreover, it has a direct impact on what were civil responses to problems that generate insecurity: organised crime, terrorism, and so on."
"We do not therefore consider that they require a military response, nor the associated risk to natural resources and uncontrolled mass migration."
"These are not matters requiring a military response."
"The biggest causes of death in the world are hunger and poverty - the biggest weapon of mass destruction - and a military force such as NATO cannot fight them."
"Madam President, the question is whether we are happy with the Lisbon outcome and I have a very mixed answer."
"It is insufficient, although it goes in the right direction."
"Could we have expected more?"
"I think yes, but if you compare it to where we were two, three or four years ago, it is much better."
"Clearly there is unused potential in relations between the two, but there are more words than deeds and we need more deeds than words."
"For the moment, there is a lot of talk about rapprochement, but these are declarations rather than concrete steps."
"At the same time, there is increasing complementarity between the two."
"There is a certain expertise and there are capabilities on the Union side."
"The Union specialises more on soft power, NATO more on hard, military power, but both sides evolve."
"The EU has gone a long way since St Malo to affirm its role in security and defence, and NATO in turn has acknowledged the need to broaden its purely military domain by a softer dimension and has already taken the decisions."
"Hence both are coming closer, hence complementarity is growing."
"Why not use it?"
"The real stumbling block is the relationship between Turkey and Cyprus and the unsolved problem of Cyprus."
"The role of the Union is to take the lead, to undertake initiatives, to suggest to NATO means of closer cooperation, to pass from words to deeds, and I take the example of the recent letter by the Polish, German and French Foreign Ministers, to which Lady Ashton did react, as a good starting point in the right direction."
"Closer EU-NATO cooperation via political will on both sides and the strengthening of CSDP, but there is also a role for, and a job to be done in, the capitals of both NATO and EU Member States."
"(PT) Madam President, what is contained within the NATO Strategic Concept, adopted in Lisbon, with regard to the doctrine of nuclear deterrence is not new, it is old."
"The Alliance has decided to retain nuclear weapons as the ultimate deterrent power."
"Ironically, this contradicts calls by President Obama for a world free of nuclear weapons and the disarmament promised during the last NPT Review Conference."
"The Alliance should lead by example, but this will not deter nuclear proliferation - tragically, it will encourage it."
"And in times of financial crisis, it diverts resources required for other threats with which we are confronted."
"What use are nuclear bombs against terrorism without address or sender, against piracy in the Indian Ocean, against organised crime, cyber-attacks, or chemical and biological attacks?"
"The Council of the European Union issued a statement this week about the need to increase our efforts against nuclear proliferation."
"Mrs Ashton, what plans do you have to play this card within NATO, where 21 of the 28 allies are also members of the European Union?"
"And what do you have to say to the two nuclear powers that are members of the European Union and that have also been most resistant to attempts at change by the NATO Strategic Council in connection with this existential question for the whole of humanity?"
"(EL) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I think that we are living in an absurd world and that you have been elected to play a role in it, in order to mitigate this irrationality absurdity."
"As everyone has noted, the war in Afghanistan cost over USD three hundred billion."
"The cost of eradicating poverty in Afghanistan is equal to the cost of five days' war."
"The cost of just one week's operations is enough to run six thousand schools."
"USD three hundred billion could have been used to build two hundred thousand schools."
"The same money could have been used to build thirty thousand hospitals."
"Do the sums and you will see."
"I am talking about hospitals costing USD ten million each."
"Do we need more information in order to understand that we are living in an absurd world?"
"If we divided this money between all the families in Europe living below the poverty line, there would be enough money for every family. Does anyone believe that?"
"Twenty thousand three hundred and fifty-five euros each for twenty-seven million families."
"Where does this absurd road lead?"
"It leads to ΝΑΤΟ."
"I therefore call upon Baroness Ashton, who has a leading position in the European Union, to play a catalytic role, so that this organisation is abolished from the inside."
"(FR) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I share your opinion on the Lisbon Summit which has come up with a new strategic concept which is satisfactory overall."
"However, we should nonetheless recognise, in all honesty, that the poor relation of this text is, in view of the potential of this strategic partnership, the European Union-NATO relationship, which should be a great deal more ambitious."
"You rightly noted the successes and progress of capability development."
"You noted successes, obviously, in the case of Afghanistan, where we are managing to reach compromises on the ground."
"However, it is unsatisfactory that we do not have a structured political dialogue with NATO, apart from the single case of Bosnia We all know that the problem is that of Turkey."
"We are going to have to deal with it seriously, no doubt pragmatically, and I hope that the efforts you are making with Secretary General Rasmussen will bear fruit."
"I briefly want to say that the problem of duplication is often advanced to highlight the weaknesses of the European Union and to limit the European Union's aspiration to be ambitious."
"This is a false problem because there are not two armies in our Member States, a NATO army and a European Union army."
"There is an armed force in each country and it is up to the country to choose whether to place its troops under the NATO banner or the European Union banner."
"Let us stop scaremongering with this notion of duplication."
"I would like to say a word about complementarity: it is essential and must be applied intelligently."
"I would not want to see complementarity becoming an imperative with the European Union becoming the Red Cross of what would be a NATO armed force."
"The European Union must keep its military capabilities, hold onto its military ambitions and must retain its ambition in the case of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) as was pointed out in the tripartite Franco-German and Polish letter."
"(ES) Madam President, the Lisbon Summit certainly served to modernise the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and adapt it to the new security challenges."
"We must welcome the fact that the new strategic concept adds new challenges, such as terrorism, combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, cyber-defence and energy security."
"It is also to be welcomed that the new concept highlights the need to strengthen the strategic relationship between NATO and the European Union."
"However, a clear division of tasks needs to be determined, in order o be efficient and not duplicate efforts in times of crisis."
"The Treaty of Lisbon was a step forward in the common security and defence policy, which we must now consolidate."
"The objective is clear: the European Union must be capable of mobilising the necessary civil and military capacity to be able to take on its international responsibilities, and the common security and defence policy should make a significant contribution to Atlantic security."
"What is not clear, however, is how this cooperation with the Alliance is going to be organised in order for it to be genuinely effective."
"It would be significant, Baroness Ashton, if you could tell us something more in this respect."
"(PL) Madam President, Mrs Ashton, the question has, in fact, been asked in this discussion, today, as to why in the European Parliament - an EU institution - we are talking about the NATO Summit."
"The answer is obvious."
"Most of the Member States of the European Union are members of NATO, so the European Union means us and in most cases NATO also means us."
"It should, therefore, be noted that, for NATO, development of European Union-NATO cooperation was one of the most important matters discussed at the summit in Lisbon."
"The decisions of the NATO Summit, and also the declarations, for example, of the President of the United States, confirm that NATO is not resisting the common security and defence policy, but is trying, rather, to find a way of cooperation which is beneficial to both institutions."
"Therefore, we, too, must seek to cooperate and work together instead of engaging in senseless competition and expensive duplication of structures, especially today at a time of financial crisis."
"I hope the decisions made at the NATO Summit and the letter from the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Poland, which has been mentioned, here, will persuade us - the European Union - to begin a serious debate on the common security and defence policy."
"Poland - I am a Member from Poland - will certainly support you, Mrs Ashton, in this work during the Polish Presidency."
"We must make use of the mechanisms and opportunities which the Treaty of Lisbon gives us."
"This is a great challenge for us."
"Finally, I would like to say that I welcome the NATO declaration on openness to cooperation with Russia, a declaration which also stresses NATO's readiness to be open and to receive new states, such as Georgia, for example."
"Madam President, the European Union is a unique and essential partner for NATO."
"As a document of the new strategy concept puts it, NATO and the European Union can and should play complementary and mutually reinforcing roles in supporting international peace and security."
"An active and effective European Union contributes to the overall security of the Euro-Atlantic area."
"Therefore, more favourable circumstances should be developed by strengthening the strategic partnership in the spirit of full mutual openness, transparency, complementarity and respect for the autonomy and institutional integrity of both organisations."
"We should also point out that close cooperation between the EU and NATO is of vital importance, and this should be developed without prejudice to the principle of decision-making autonomy and with due respect for the nuclear status of some EU Member States."
"(DE) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the NATO Summit has made good progress."
"It is good that it is being discussed here."
"New strategic elements, such as civil crisis management and cyber defence, are moves in the right direction."
"In particular for small, neutral countries like Austria, strengthening the strategic partnership between NATO and the European Union is of decisive importance."
"Developing military capacity by increasing synergy, reducing duplication and improving arms cooperation will help everyone, but especially the small Member States."
"There is still quite a lot to be done, in particular for us."
"Europe must set itself some homework and make sure that it is completed."
"The initiative of the French, German and Polish foreign ministers represents a step in the right direction."
"In the medium term, we need a European defence architecture which promotes military cooperation between the EU Member States, which brings together civil and military cooperation between the EU, the UN and NATO and which gradually develops European defence structures."
"Our goal must be to become an important security partner in the world."
"We need to work on this."
"(RO) Madam President, the Lisbon Summit outlined a new perspective on the Alliance's security strategy."
"In practical terms, three major objectives were achieved: the new strategic concept was adopted, a new approach to Afghanistan was devised, not to mention the fact that new impetus was given to relations with the Russian Federation."
"I think that the most important outcome was the integration of the anti-missile shield into the new strategic concept."
"Romania has advocated the establishment of the shield since the Bucharest Summit in 2008."
"This indicates that my country had a suitable vision and will make a significant contribution to implementing the defence system."
"At the same time, Romania has supported the open-door policy, aimed especially at strengthening NATO relations with Georgia and Ukraine."
"I also welcome the fact that NATO reaffirmed the Black Sea region's strategic importance, given the security risks that are predominant in this area."
"They concern in particular the unresolved conflicts in Transnistria and Georgia."
"In this respect, I feel that the Alliance must maintain a united front in the announcements made to Russia."
"The Russian Federation must demonstrate by deeds its statements of good intentions as it has a firm responsibility to the eastern border of Romania and NATO."
"I must stress that, as a result of the political declaration that has been adopted, NATO has assumed its commitment to the territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova and Georgia."
"(EL) Madam President, the historic NATO Summit in Lisbon was a turning point for the future of the alliance."
"Twenty-eight allies made important decisions, adopted a new defence doctrine, laid the foundations for closer cooperation with Russia, clarified the question of the anti-missile shield, approved an action plan on Afghanistan and confirmed the importance of cooperation with the European Union."
"However, this is the general and optimistic view."
"We should not forget that, as the result of consensus, these texts express the lowest common denominator of positions and views."
"We all know that, in a post-cold war environment, there are discrepancies in and varying degrees of perception of threat."
"Eastern European countries have a different view of relations with Russia and Turkey has a different perception of Iran's nuclear programme."
"We also know that Ankara waged a diplomatic war to prevent any reference to this in the Lisbon text."
"Ankara also takes a different approach to cooperation with the common security and defence policy, because it wants to exclude cooperation with one European partner and Member State of the Union."
"All this makes the role of the common security and defence policy even more important, within the context, of course, of Euro/NATO cooperation."
"That is why I believe that the European Union needs to take full advantage of the new opportunities afforded to us by the Treaty of Lisbon, by retaining independent powers of decision."
"We need to raise the Union's international profile and reinforce its international presence."
"We need a stronger Europe, so that we can have a stronger Atlantic alliance."
"(EL) Madam President, I agree with the High Representative's take on the Lisbon Summit."
"It really was an important turning point and an important moment."
"Transatlantic relations are the key to world safety and development but, on the other hand, the European Union must, where necessary, have its own voice and its own structures."
"The cost cuts mentioned earlier will be generated from this cooperation, both at equipment level and in civil decisions, without the need or the facility to change the NATO alliance."
"Europe must have its own defence system and security system and its own voice, because only then will it be able to address problems, such as the problem with Turkey or other problems with NATO members or non-members which take a different approach to Russia."
"Besides, I do not think that the issue with Russia is a difficult issue."
"I think it is an issue which Europe can handle overall, at the same time as the American side is handling it."
"Perhaps Europe can handle it even more effectively."
"Madam President, enlargement of NATO could be seen as one of the few true post-Cold War success stories."
"However, the momentum of enlargement has weakened."
"NATO has remained rather hesitant in opening up to Georgia or Macedonia. Military contributions have decreased alarmingly."
"Very few NATO members meet the 2% criteria for defence expenditure and the Alliance has not conducted serious military exercises for more than one decade."
"The last such big exercise to prove that the US could move troops rapidly into Europe took place 17 years ago."
"True, the Soviet Union has collapsed."
"However, NATO's credibility and potential still relies on US military might."
"It is vitally important that NATO's military institutions remain well integrated and that military commanders from America and Europe have the possibility to practice together."
"Only under conditions of much closer and more determined transatlantic cooperation will the EU and NATO be able to set a democratic international agenda over the next decade against the challenges of a multilateral world."
"I would also like to comment on the conclusions of the NATO-Russia Council."
"It calls for a modernised partnership based on reciprocal confidence, transparency and predictability."
"It may be taken as a declaration of goodwill."
"However, we know that Russia's military doctrine still views NATO expansion into Russia's neighbourhood as an aggression and justifies preventive military strikes and landings on foreign territories."
"Big military exercises in autumn 2009 in north-west Russia close to the territories of the Baltic States prepared for invasion of these states as a counter-attack, presumably against NATO actions."
"What is positive is that the Baltic States finally got NATO contingency plans for their defence, as exposed also by WikiLeaks."
"Georgia was invaded by Russia and two of its autonomous territories practically annexed."
"Just recently, Russia's missiles were deployed in these breakaway entities and Russia continues massive spying in all Western countries."
"When these spies are exposed, it is the West that feels embarrassment, not Russia, which decorates its spies openly with the highest state awards."
"Therefore, Russian insistence on equality in relations with NATO and some sort of joint decision-making is premature and carries a risk of a Russian veto on NATO's decisions and further enlargement."
"- (SK) Madam President, at the Lisbon Summit, NATO confirmed its role as guarantor of security in the Euro-Atlantic area, and also acknowledged that it has new challenges to confront."
"The best instrument for performing this role is a broad network of strategic partnerships, whether with states or with international organisations."
"NATO must therefore be prepared to enter into political dialogue with every potential partner who shares our common effort for peace and secure international relations."
"In my opinion, the key strategic partnership is the cooperation with Russia, where NATO needs to strengthen practical cooperation in order to be able to confront the modern threats of international terrorism, piracy, human trafficking and drug trafficking."
"NATO needs sufficient financial, military and human resources to be able to fulfil its mission."
"It is necessary, however, for these resources to be used as efficiently as possible, and mainly for securing peace."
"(SL) Madam President, I am pleased to have been given the floor before Mr Goerens, my colleague from Luxemburg, because otherwise that would have undermined the basic point that I am going to make, that we who have been speaking here for the past half hour have been mainly members from South-Eastern Europe."
"That should tell you that, for us, the questions of security, NATO and NATO's relationship with the European Union are slightly more significant than they are for other nations."
"For precisely that reason, I would like to say that those who attended the Lisbon Summit have passed up an opportunity to take a clearer and more principled and decisive stance on the wishes of two countries in South-Eastern Europe, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, to strengthen their security by joining at least one of the EU or NATO."
"When we in Slovenia were nearing membership of these two institutions, we said that either would do."
"NATO has the opportunity to correct mistakes that are made by the European Union."
"I think that we need to take this into account."
"(PL) Madam President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak."
"This discussion, today, is about cooperation between NATO and the Union."
"Mrs Ashton has given us, here, a positive assessment, but I want to say that, in my opinion, it is an assessment which is greatly exaggerated."
"My fellow Members from Poland, Mr Saryusz-Wolski and Mr Lisek, have already spoken, and I want to say clearly that I agree with their evaluation."
"This is only the beginning, and it is the beginning of a very long road."
"In relation to this, I would like to draw attention to three pragmatic aspects where we can see common progress."
"The first area concerns the joint defence planning of NATO and the European Union - here it is clear that more can be done."
"The second area should concern cooperation between intelligence services - here, too, progress can be made."
"Lastly, the third matter concerns the operation of combat groups - the question needs to be asked as to whether, today, they give added value."
"(FR) Madam President, I should like to put a question to Baroness Ashton concerning the Europe of defence and also NATO."
"The Treaty of Lisbon allows the Member States of the European Union to cooperate more closely in defence matters, if they so wish, of course."
"This is called 'structured cooperation' or 'enhanced cooperation', it hardly matters which."
"Can Baroness Ashton tell me whether cooperation of this nature has already been considered by a group of countries and if so, where appropriate, can you tell me the criteria to be met to qualify for this type of cooperation?"
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, thank you again to all those who have contributed to a very wide-ranging debate."
"I will, if I may, try and pick up some of the key points that were made and at least begin to give you responses to that."
"The first thing to say is that I am committed to trying to find ways forward in the relationship between the European Union and NATO, but I do not underestimate the political issues that sit at the heart of this question."
"My objective is to find practical and pragmatic ways in which increased collaboration can help support our people on the ground."
"The people in theatre, the people in operations, are those who are most in my thoughts when I look at how we can collaborate together."
"But I do so with the knowledge that Turkey has an important role to play, and I do so in the knowledge that I represent 27 Member States, and I work closely with the Member States who are most interested and affected by the issues at hand."
"We are moving forward to try and achieve that as swiftly as we possibly can."
"But I do not underestimate the challenges, and I am always looking at and interested in ideas for how we might do that."
"I accept that we want also to look very carefully at what we do ourselves and make sure that what we do is complementary and not duplicating other work."
"Actually the areas that we are working in are indeed very complementary."
"The example that was given earlier was of Ocean Shield off the coast of Somalia and the work we are doing with Operation Atalanta."
"Honourable Members who have visited the area will know it is a huge expanse of sea, where there is plenty of room for complementary activity and very little risk of duplication, and indeed the services work very well together."
"Commander Howes who is in charge of Operation Atalanta at the present time was speaking with the defence ministers, making this very point that indeed there was a lot of connectivity in communication, but an awful lot of work that can be done satisfactorily together."
"Mr Gahler raised a number of points which were not connected to this debate and I would just like to suggest to him that if he writes me a quick note about those issues I am happy to come back to him, but I did not want to take Parliament's time this evening on issues that were not on this debate itself."
"Concerning questions about missile defence, as far as I can see what happened was that a balance was found during those negotiations on NATO's new strategic concept between the issues of missile defence and NATO's nuclear posture."
"It is clear that NATO will want to retain its nuclear deterrents while keeping with the objective that it set itself on a nuclear-free world."
"That is the approach we are taking today but of course we do not participate in all aspects of NATO for exactly the reasons that have been well understood in this House."
"We were not participating, for example, in the NATO-Russia Council meetings so it is not possible for me to comment on what happened there, only, as I have already done, to comment on the issues that came out of it."
"In terms of START, the progress we have seen between the United States and Russia on demilitarisation is to be welcomed and I believe will pave the way for better coordination with NATO, which was certainly the objective that the Secretary-General has set himself."
"Finally, structured cooperation: will it happen, what is being done?"
"It is indeed for Member States to come forward with ideas."
"There are already examples where Member States, such as the UK and France, or in the letter that has come to me from the Weimar Triangle Group, have been looking at ways in which they can enhance that collaboration, partly through the European Defence Agency as well, where we have opportunities to try and develop those synergies as appropriate."
"I hope and expect to see more of that in the future."
"Particularly I expect this with the forthcoming presidencies, especially with Poland which has made defence issues something they wish to focus on."
"There are no examples I can give the honourable Member that would suggest there is an opportunity to join in, but I hope that we will see objectives coming forward that enhance the possibilities of being able, in this economic crisis, to use our resources most effectively."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"At the meeting of the ministers of NATO member states in October 2008, General John Craddock, commander of the NATO forces in Europe, stated that Russia's military action in Georgia prompted NATO to revise its basic assumption concerning the security of its member states."
"Does this statement still hold true now, after the Lisbon Summit?"
"The agreement with Russia is an expedient political step, which could serve the reinforcement of our security."
"However, it inevitably raises serious moral and strategic questions as well."
"Does NATO intend to yield, for the sake of cooperation, the representation and protection of the democratic ideas on which the Euro-Atlantic alliance is based, and which are in sharp contrast to the Russian concept of democracy on several points?"
"It is perhaps unnecessary to give a separate reminder of the intimidation and abuse of people, and the unclear details of the deaths of journalists and lawyers in Russia."
"It would also be hard not to interpret Russia's recent nomination of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange for the Nobel Prize for Peace as a provocative gesture."
"Will it lessen the chances of countries intending to join NATO if Russia does not approve of their future membership?"
"We are faced with the question whether NATO leaders are taking into consideration the vulnerability of certain member states, as well as their open and unsettled issues with Russia that exist to this day."
"The historic direction of peace-making and agreement must at any rate be welcomed."
"However, we must clearly recognise the historic responsibility of NATO in what major power it legitimises as a consequence of the agreement concluded for the missile defence programme, and what it will firmly oppose, true to our common European values."
"The NATO Summit that took place in Lisbon put an end to the strategic security concept that had been in place since the Cold War."
"The implementation of this new security strategy represents a move from the traditional defence of member countries of the Atlantic Alliance to a concept of global security for the 21st century."
"The challenges that the new strategic security concept emphasises involve close cooperation with the various international institutions, both governmental and non-governmental, and the strengthening of partnerships, particularly with Russia."
"In addition to the establishment of political channels, operational questions relating to capabilities and the structure of NATO itself have been adapted to new global threats."
"It is also important to highlight the adoption by NATO of a mission transition plan for Afghanistan, with the objective of the Afghan authorities taking the lead in matters of national security."
"I believe this new strategic vision, which creates guidelines on which the international relations of the Member States should be based, is extremely important."
"in writing. - For the first time since the Second World War, Russia has been invited to join the missile shield effort, something which can only be marked as a milestone for the Alliance."
"Russia's answer remains to be seen, and there is potentially a real partnership with the US, whereby both would have to come to the table committed."
"Furthermore, this project needs major European financing, and this is not going to be easy with European defence cuts."
"Lastly, Afghanistan will be the big political test for NATO in the years to come."
"The US acted quickly to reassure Russia that the missiles were in fact not targeted at them."
"It was crucial for the US not to aggravate Russia, and they proved they had no such intention by also inviting Russia to take part in the missile shield scheme."
"Secondly, the US was wise enough not to mention the name of Iran or, to put it correctly, granted the wishes of Turkey, which threatened to back out if its neighbour (Iran) was mentioned."
"The problem is that only 21 of the 27 EU Member States are in NATO, posing a threat to the development of European defence."
"Situation in Côte d'Ivoire (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in Côte d'Ivoire."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, the situation in Côte d'Ivoire is very precarious, as lives are at risk - the lives of Ivorian citizens but also of many Europeans who are living and working in the country."
"I believe important issues are at stake, not only the role which Côte d'Ivoire plays in Africa, but also the vast work done by the international community over the past 10 years to support crisis resolution and enhance stability."
"Presidential elections have been due for several years."
"In the end, it is a credit to the Ivorian people, to the work of the United Nations with the support of the international community and, in particular I must say, to the European Union and the facilitator, President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso, that these elections could finally take place."
"All candidates had agreed beforehand the ground rules of the election. These included a special role for the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr Choi, in certifying the election results."
"A European electoral observation mission was sent to the country headed by Mr Cristian Preda, MEP."
"I thank him for his work and I believe he will be speaking shortly."
"It concluded that the elections were held in democratic conditions."
"I do thank and congratulate Mr Preda and his team for their courage as well as their excellent work, carried out in difficult circumstances."
"The results were proclaimed by the Independent Electoral Commission and certified by the special representative of the UN Secretary-General."
"President Barroso and I were among the first to congratulate President Ouattara on his victory."
"The international community has been unanimous in recognising him."
"ECOWAS and the African Union have been crystal clear in their message."
"Mr Ouattara is the legitimate President of Côte d'Ivoire."
"On 3 December the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly was equally unambiguous in its declaration."
"We are calling on all political forces in Côte d'Ivoire to respect the electoral outcome, to show responsibility and to refrain from any act of violence."
"All efforts should now be focused on the achievement of a peaceful transfer of power."
"UN resolutions provide for targeted measures against those who obstruct the peaceful transition and the elections."
"African bodies have already resorted to sanctions on Côte d'Ivoire."
"The EU is ready to assume its responsibilities regarding targeted measures, and we have clearly said so this week in the Council with the EU Foreign Ministers, but we are also prepared to take measures to support the legally elected authorities."
"The developments in Côte d'Ivoire are being followed closely by many actors and by public opinion, particularly in Africa and especially in neighbouring countries, many of which are also in a post-conflict situation and undergoing difficult democratic transition."
"The outcome of the present constitutional crisis in Côte d'Ivoire will send a strong signal to all forces on the African continent, both those in favour of democracy and those who are against."
"The response of the European Union to this crisis is vital."
"As a major player in the international community, our role will be enhanced, and our credibility as a global champion of democracy improved, if our action can contribute to a peaceful handover of power in accordance with the will of the people of Côte d'Ivoire, clearly expressed in free and fair elections."
"Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I was, indeed, in Côte d'Ivoire to lead this European Union election observation mission."
"I shall begin by referring to the courage and commitment of observers from 26 countries, more than 100 people, 120 observers who were on the ground and who carried out a magnificent job."
"They noted, in the first place, that the citizens of Côte d'Ivoire were saying, more or less on all sides: 'We are tired'."
"That was the key word, the chorus which meant, indeed, that the elections were seen as the end of a political crisis."
"Everyone wanted all that to come to an end with these elections."
"There is one exception, the outgoing President, Mr Gbagbo, who refused to give up power and who provided himself with the resources to prevent this crisis from coming to an end by setting up a partisan constitutional council which quite simply annulled the results that were favourable to his opponent."
"This means that today, instead of calm, instead of an exit from crisis, there is an even more complicated crisis, with an already very precarious balance and now the beginnings of a confrontation."
"Further I would say that it is now really very difficult to avoid confrontation."
"You just have to look at what happened with the vote in the barracks, in the first and the second ballot."
"We are unfortunately faced with an extremely delicate situation."
"I would not wish to finish without expressing my appreciation of Baroness Ashton, for her commitment to resolving this matter."
"I would like to put a question to her, as I have noted that the Council has announced that restrictive measures are to be adopted shortly: can it be said when these restrictive measures will be adopted?"
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (FR) Madam President, I would first like to congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Preda, and his team on the remarkable work they have done."
"I would also like to congratulate Baroness Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, on the determination she has shown with the entire international community in monitoring these elections."
"For those of us who are absolutely committed to electoral observation missions, which are an extraordinary tool for encouraging democracy in a country, the fact that there was such a rapid and determined follow-up after an attempt to illegitimately appropriate the result of the elections warmed our hearts and we hope that this may happen in other contexts if ever, alas, the situation should call for it."
"Now, I would also like to say - because I have been told it often enough - that President Ouattara is not the candidate of Europe."
"The entire international community mobilised, which is extraordinary: the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the United Nations, Europe, and so on with a single voice, and that marks a historic milestone."
"Now, on the issue of Mr Ouattara wanting to put his militants onto the streets, I am, of course, somewhat more concerned, because I cannot see any peaceful solutions in the streets in the context of opposing forces."
"I would like to mention a document, which is currently being drafted in the ACP countries and which had already been discussed in Kinshasa at the last ACP meeting, which some of us attended."
"Its title is extraordinary: 'Challenges for the future of democracy and respect for the constitutional order'."
"An African representative and a European representative are responsible for drafting it."
"There are a great many legal things in this text and three pages are devoted to the sharing of power if one of the parties tries to gain power illegitimately."
"These three pages of advice describe the path to follow to prevent the situation from turning into a blood bath."
"It is perhaps not in the streets but perhaps through negotiations aimed at sharing a certain form of power that a blood bath is likely to be prevented."
"Pressure must first be exerted, of course, to ensure that the winner is acknowledged."
"I advise you to read this document."
"It is very informative and it showed me that, although African political culture does not know much about democracy, it certainly knows a lot about how to negotiate."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Madam President, it is just a few hours since the partisans of Ouattara reached the headquarters of the government and of Ivorian Radio and Television and I want to express my concern, because the risk of clashes and confrontation is clearly significant and absolutely real."
"Our first responsibility this evening is to call for calm and dialogue."
"However, this is also the responsibility of the main Ivorian leaders."
"Both the outgoing President and the President-elect must do all they can to prevent violence breaking out again in a country that has suffered far too much for years."
"That is the first message."
"The second message is that, from the start, the international community, Europe of course, but also the African Union, have spoken with one voice."
"They mobilised to ensure that the result of the election was respected."
"This pressure must continue and sanctions must be applied."
"Laurent Gbagbo must accept defeat."
"Alassane Ouattara must work tirelessly for the reconciliation of his people."
"For our part, it is imperative that we do not slacken in our efforts until the situation has stabilised."
"I should like to thank you in advance, High Representative, for bearing these messages, especially this evening."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, like those who have preceded me, I clearly deplore the seriousness of the situation today, the acute political crisis and also the risk of clashes that could well break out in the hours to come."
"Therefore, I obviously welcome the univocal position taken by the entire international community and I think that, beyond the need to uphold democracy, we have a responsibility not only to save the Ivorian people but also to give a clear signal that alternation of power in Africa is possible."
"Beyond the issue of the Ivorian people themselves, their security and the tensions affecting this country, and which could affect it in the days and months to come, the issues also concern the neighbouring countries."
"There will be elections in other, neighbouring countries, where the issue of the alternation of an outgoing President and a new President could arise."
"I think it is extremely important that, in Côte d'Ivoire, without in any way prejudging the result, the issue of democratic alternation can be decided peacefully, in a negotiated way, with the support of the international community and in opposition to all those who, given this opportunity, would cause blood baths or, at the very least, take the civil population hostage."
"This is important not only because these people have already suffered enough, but also because it will serve as an example for the neighbouring countries, and I am obviously thinking of the Congo, which will no doubt be in an electoral period in the coming year, in 2011."
"I welcome your statements on how to monitor, exert and keep the pressure on in the coming months in order to preserve peace."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL."
"Group - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all concerned about the serious crisis in Côte d'Ivoire."
"Naturally, the decision of the Constitutional Council of this country to challenge the election results officially proclaimed by the Independent Electoral Commission, in violation of the electoral code, is unanimously condemned by the international community."
"The European Union, the United Nations (UN), the African Union, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and, certainly soon, the European Parliament, demand respect for the official proclamation of the election results and the installation of the new President of the Republic, who has been recognised by the Independent Electoral Commission, which, I recall, is a body validated by the UN."
"All the political groups of the European Parliament have expressed their agreement on these crucial issues in a joint declaration."
"They have also called for action to curb any escalation of tension in the country, which could lead to civil war, which would be a human, social and economic disaster for Côte d'Ivoire, which must, of course, be prevented at all costs."
"(IT) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, democracy is a non-negotiable value, just as the results of a popular consensus are non-negotiable: participation, representation and popular sovereignty are a measure of the maturity of a democratic system."
"The events taking place in Côte d'Ivoire, which observers have reported with objectivity, are causing serious damage to an electoral process that should have been over by now."
"The people's choice was clear and unambiguous, yet the outgoing but still acting leader of government Mr Gbagbo has not yet been replaced with the incoming leader Mr Outtara."
"This is unacceptable to the European Parliament as it is unacceptable to anyone who believes in justice."
"Through its political manipulations, the Constitutional Council confirmed in office the outgoing leader, who unfortunately continues to be the acting representative of Côte d'Ivoire."
"All this threatens to fuel tensions and riots that are not easy to control."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) cannot accept that the popular vote is subverted by these Machiavellian manoeuvres."
"We therefore ask that the citizens, who have freely expressed their choice through their consensus, be put in a position where they can be governed by the person whom they have all chosen in unison."
"The United Nations is backing us in this process."
"Naturally, we are asking for this troubled crisis to be brought to an end in a reasonably short time and we place our trust in an authoritative intervention by Baroness Ashton, so that Europe can speak with authority and prestige through the highest office in international relations."
"(FR) Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the elections in Côte d'Ivoire have just taken place."
"The international community tolerated their being postponed year after year by the regime of Laurent Gbagbo."
"These successive reports alerted a number of us to the difficulties in which we find ourselves at the moment but, deep within ourselves, we hoped that the democratic spirit would prevail in a country that has suffered a great deal from sterile and unacceptable confrontations focused, in particular, around the concept of Ivorian nationality."
"The international community and, in particular, the European Union around Baroness Ashton and through my fellow Member, Mr Preda, mobilized to ensure that these elections took place under the best possible conditions, transparently and without violence."
"This should be commended."
"In view of the calm that prevailed and the atmosphere of mutual respect among candidates, the electoral campaign gave us cause to hope that the result would be accepted by all the parties."
"Today, unfortunately, the democratic result that emerged through the ballot box has been rejected by the outgoing President."
"Tomorrow, like my fellow Members, I will therefore vote in favour of appealing to Mr Gbagbo to accept that what appears to him to be a reversal of fortune or a conspiracy is, in fact, simply the will of the majority of his citizens."
"He cannot hang on to power without calling into question part of his own militant history, which was to appear, when resident in Europe, as the man who had brought about the newly regained freedom and democracy established in his country."
"The United Nations representative in Côte d'Ivoire courageously assumed his role and announced the results of the ballot."
"As First Vice-President of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I would also like to point out that a declaration was adopted by our Assembly on 3 December in Kinshasa firmly condemning the decision of the Ivorian Constitutional Council for invalidating the results."
"This declaration comes on top of the clear and unambiguous position taken by the leaders of the Member States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and of the African Union."
"Today, the regime of Mr Gbagbo is neither wanted by its citizens, nor supported by its neighbours, nor accepted by the international community."
"It is therefore time that he accepted the victory of Alassane Ouattara, the democratically elected President of Côte d'Ivoire, who must be in a position to take on the responsibility entrusted to him by his people as soon as possible."
"Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude by asking the European Union to assume its role through the means at its disposal to persuade Laurent Gbagbo and his illegitimate government to accept that the game is over."
"We will not allow his obstinacy to lead to chaos in Côte d'Ivoire."
"(FR) Madam President, were it not for the ego of Mr Gbagbo, Côte d'Ivoire would be a source of inspiration for all developing countries longing for democracy."
"Indeed, during the last elections, the Ivorian people showed great political maturity."
"Moreover, the international bodies, starting with the United Nations, are not in the least bit impressed by the final machinations of a bad loser."
"Mr Gbagbo should go away."
"There is no other way for him to keep the bit of dignity he has left."
"Until now, the European Union has reacted appropriately, especially at the level of targeting sanctions."
"Sanctions must not be imposed on the people, who have expressed themselves in an exemplary fashion, but on Mr Gbagbo and those close to him."
"My question to Baroness Ashton is 'What steps do you intend to take if the situation were to degenerate and the use of force were to threaten both the Ivorian citizens and the expatriates living in Côte d'Ivoire?"
"Furthermore, do you think that ECOWAS and the African Union have sufficient capacity to deal with this problem?'"
"(IT) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Côte d'Ivoire is a test case and a test case we cannot afford to fail."
"This applies to the European Union above all because there is no way we can acknowledge a stolen victory but neither is there any way we can stop exerting maximum pressure on the Ivorian leaders over this massive fraud."
"Furthermore, it will not be acceptable for a single euro from European taxpayers to end up in or even pass through an illegal government that disregards even the most elementary rules of democracy."
"Côte d'Ivoire must be made aware of this."
"Côte d'Ivoire is now also a test case for the African Union, which is dealing with the situation in a very interesting way, so far showing a degree of firmness and unity that would have been unthinkable only 10 or 15 years ago."
"This is a sign that the Ivorian affair should not be exploited to revive old stereotypes of black Africa being incompatible with democracy."
"Even though we hover on the brink of widespread violence, which would be catastrophic, Ivorian society is so far also passing this difficult test: it gave a majority to the reformist candidate Mr Outtara and appears to have learned the lesson of the great Ivorian writer Ahmadou Kourouma, who in 1998 published a book with the apt title 'En attendant les votes des bêtes sauvages' (Waiting for the Wild Beasts to Vote), which tells this very story from a democratic and very Ivorian standpoint"
"(RO) Madam President, the elections in Côte d'Ivoire have resulted in an unprecedented situation after both candidates in the presidential elections claimed victory and each appointed a prime minister."
"There is only one legitimate president: President Ouattara."
"I think that all political forces must respect the will of the people expressed in the result of the elections held on 28 November."
"There is all the more reason for this as the UN, the Electoral Commission and numerous European states have recognised the opposition leader as the rightful winner."
"At the same time, it is deplorable that acts of intimidation were carried out against EU observers, resulting in the mission having to end."
"The political instability is already having a significant impact."
"The African Union recently decided to suspend the country from all the organisation's activities."
"In addition, there is the risk of resumption of the civil war which took place in 2002."
"Côte d'Ivoire can therefore make the choice between two paths: one which preserves democracy and continues the progress and the other which means isolation from the African community."
"Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, I will be brief because I think that all one might have wished to say has been expressed very well."
"Mr Preda, again, thank you to you and your team for your courage and your work during the elections."
"I commend you."
"There are two quick points I want to make."
"Of course I have kept in touch with Ban Ki-moon throughout."
"He and I spoke at the very beginning of this crisis and discussed how outrageous the situation was, and we agreed to collaborate very fully."
"Equally I have been ensuring that the EU representatives on the ground are cared for: we have contingency plans in place for their safety, as you would expect."
"I also want to answer the specific question that was raised about the sanctions."
"I am expecting the list to be ready within the next few days."
"We want to get on with this as quickly as possible and to keep the pressure on as much as possible."
"There is a real danger of violence and there is a real danger of ambiguity around what is happening."
"We need to be very firm and very clear and to work as collaboratively as possible with the international community to keep the pressure on as heavily as we possibly can, and to do the things required to get a satisfactory resolution."
"I am extremely grateful for the support in this House for the work that we are doing."
"I have received six motions for resolution in accordance with Rule 110(4) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12.00 on Thursday, 16 December 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, two presidential candidates declared victory and took their oaths on 4 December."
"It is not possible, however, for a presidential election to produce two winners in one country."
"The situation in Côte d'Ivoire is therefore very dangerous, since we are all well aware that the country, which bears the marks of years of conflict and violence, is particularly prone to steps that may lead to a repeat of the civil war which broke out in 2002 after a violent coup."
"The steps taken by the international community, represented on our side by the European Union, must therefore be considered carefully and not postponed until some later date, because they will have a decisive impact on the lives of the inhabitants of this country."
"I therefore fully agree with the words of Baroness Ashton."
"The imposition of sanctions is one possible solution by the EU to punish those who are blocking a peaceful changeover of political elites."
"The sanctions must help to enforce the will of the people of Côte d'Ivoire."
"We must not forget the local population, however, and we must try to help improve their security, so that they can live in a free and democratic country."
"Control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Százjer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers - C7-0073/2010-."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, it is only about one year since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which envisages considerable changes in the delegation of powers by the European Parliament and Council to the Commission."
"A few months ago in this Parliament, we discussed my report about delegated acts."
"Delegated acts are when Parliament and Council delegate powers, but from now on, compared to the previous situation, we can take them back any time."
"We can set a deadline, we can change and we can veto if the Commission is not in line with what the legislator wanted."
"In the case of the present regulation we are discussing based on Article 291 of the Treaty, we are speaking about implementing acts."
"In the case of implementing acts, the situation is a bit different."
"Here, it is the Member States which exercise their rights on how to implement the different legislation of the European Union."
"So there is a clear difference."
"The new regulation and the new system of delegated acts gives us very wide powers."
"From Parliament's point of view, it changes our influence considerably, especially in certain areas of legislation."
"However, in the field of implementation, we have the right as Parliament, as legislator, to regulate how the implementation procedure for the Member State should go."
"I think Parliament was right after long negotiations to take the position that we would like to confirm and get clear commitments from both the Council and the Commission that Parliament's rights are met."
"After very long negotiations, we have made very serious progress in this area which has influence and an effect not only - and particularly not only - in the area of implementing acts, but also on delegated acts."
"Even in the case of implementing acts, Parliament got and kept the right of scrutiny which means that, on the basis of the agreement with the other institutions, we have a procedure which we can apply."
"My first priority was that we could keep these important positions."
"There is also another issue here, which is that there are other ongoing discussions in this Parliament represented by other committees - especially the Committee on International Trade, the Committee on Development and the Committee on Foreign Affairs - and also between Parliament and Council on the legislation concerning financial instruments and whether and how they should be regulated."
"My goal in this framework was that this regulation should not prejudge this discussion."
"We want to help our colleagues who are fighting our position in an important discussion with the Council so that we can finally end up with the cooperation of the Council."
"Finally, since my time is over, I would like to thank both the Commission and the Council for their flexibility in the negotiations."
"I understand that it was very difficult to get an agreement in Council."
"I think this is the deal which Parliament wanted and this deal can be satisfying for all Members, especially because this is not only about the text we are discussing now, but we expect both the Commission and Council to take part in the common understanding concerning these important issues."
"We also expect declarations which make clear that there is a clear commitment from the Commission for the alignment of the remaining part of the acquis communautaire."
"This text attached to my report should be satisfying for all Members of this Parliament."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, this morning we heard a very good debate on the citizens' initiative and tonight we are discussing the very important topic of comitology."
"I think it is a very good sign that here, after the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force, we are actually finalising the main pieces of the legislation necessary for its full implementation."
"The regulation on implementing acts will have a major impact on the way the Commission implements European law in the future."
"It will have a very important influence on the Union's ability to deliver its policies in the interests of its citizens."
"When we presented our proposal we set out its main objective: that new rules should put in place a system for the adoption of implementing acts by the Commission which would be simpler, more efficient, and more transparent and in full compliance with the Treaty."
"How did we achieve these goals in the proposals we are about to discuss?"
"As in the past, the control mechanism foreseen by the regulation is based on comitology, meaning committees composed of representatives from Member States to which the Commission will submit draft measures but, contrary to the present system, there will no room for intervention by the Council as such."
"As the Treaty makes clear, only Member States and not the Council can control the exercise of the implementing powers by the Commission."
"Moreover, the regulation provides that all special procedures will disappear and that all implementing measures including those on trade - various measures such as anti-dumping or countervailing measures - will be subject to the regulation."
"This will represent a real revolution in the field of commercial policy."
"We want to have simpler procedures, so not only will the new regulation establish just two procedures - advisory and examination - instead of four, but it will also provide for an automatic adaptation of the existing comitology procedures."
"The new procedures will begin to apply to all existing legislation from day one."
"Of course this is without prejudice to the nature of the powers conferred on the Commission on the basic acts."
"The Commission has committed in a declaration to review all the acquis in order to adapt it as far as legally required to the regime of delegated acts, and I know how important this is for this House."
"We have so far identified 153 acts which were not submitted to codecision before the Treaty of Lisbon, and which confer powers on the Commission that have to be turned into delegated powers."
"In addition there are 299 acts which were previously aligned to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, which will now have to be reviewed in the light of the provisions of the Treaty on delegated acts."
"But our aim is that before the end of Parliament's present legislative period all existing legislation will be fully in line with the new provision of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This means full alignment."
"You know how ambitious this goal is and therefore I am particularly pleased that the Belgian minister Mr Chastel kindly asked me to deliver to this House the commitment and the statement of the Presidency."
"It states that the Presidency is aware of the ambitious intentions of the Commission in this regard; it welcomes these and supports the objectives."
"It can confirm that it is willing to do its utmost to make sure that this alignment is concluded as soon as possible once proposals by the Commission have been submitted."
"The Presidency is ready to cooperate in a loyal manner with Parliament and the Commission to achieve these objectives."
"Of course we would like to have this statement enshrined in an official written record, but I think that we have to welcome the very cooperative spirit and collegial approach from the Belgian Presidency."
"We want to have a system which is more efficient; accordingly the new rules fully reflect the Commission's role under the Treaties - with just one regrettable exception which I will come back to later - because only a qualified majority vote by the Committee against the draft implementing act can prevent the Commission from adopting it."
"The one exception I just mentioned, where the Commission explicitly needs a positive opinion of the committee before being authorised to adopt the draft implementing act, relates to definitive multilateral trade safeguard measures."
"Even though only a limited number of acts are adopted in this area, we were against these exceptions on institutional grounds as we would have preferred a full alignment with the new rules."
"I wanted to make this institutional point here although in the end this was the only possible basis for the compromise for the legislator and we welcome it."
"We want to have a system which is more transparent; the whole procedure will be conducted in full transparency."
"All documents submitted to the committees are simultaneously sent to the European Parliament and to the Council; these two institutions will have a right of scrutiny on a completely equal footing."
"At any time during the procedure they may indicate to the Commission that they consider that the draft implementing act exceeds its powers; if we are overstepping our powers you have the right to make it very clear to us."
"To conclude, all in all the text presents a very good result for Europe; it clearly strengthens the Community method and it clearly expands Parliament's power of scrutiny into all areas."
"For instance, the new regulation provides that in some cases the Commission might be obliged to discuss the matter in an appeal committee."
"However this committee will be a normal comitology committee chaired by the Commission and subject to the same rules; only qualified majority against the Commission's draft can then prevent the Commission from adopting it."
"If the new comitology regulation is approved today by the European Parliament it will enter into force very soon, already on 1 March 2011, and this is indeed very good news."
"We need to have the new legal framework operating as soon as possible, and I also hope that in parallel we could launch a common reflection about the line of demarcation between the delegated powers and the implementing powers of the Commission."
"We need these not only to avoid further conflicts when discussing proposals for the new legislation but also to streamline the alignment exercise."
"To conclude I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Szájer, for all the work done throughout the negotiating process and also to all political groups for their cooperation and the flexibility they demonstrated."
"A final word of thanks goes to the Belgian Presidency who did a remarkable job in getting this file through the Council, in finding this very difficult compromise."
"I believe that what we are about to discuss, and I hope tomorrow approve, is very good news for Europe."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Szájer, for his efforts and for his report."
"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the current comitology provisions will be replaced by delegated acts and implementing acts under Articles 290 and 291, as has been explained, but I worry very much about the role of the Commission in implementing the decisions made in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I think I heard the Commissioner just say that their aim is to do so by the end of this Parliament."
"That is another three and a half years, and they only have an 'aim'!"
"This is not a residents' association, this is Parliament!"
"If the Council is involved, Parliament is involved."
"As a parliamentarian - and it gives me no joy to say this - it seems to me that often, instead of acting as honest broker between Council and Parliament, the Commission is far too close to the Council, while Parliament, being of such numbers, is easily divided and far too easily sometimes facilitates what is a common view reached by the Council and by the Commission."
"I must stress firstly that Parliament, in my view, should not be under any pressure to sign up completely to the proposed first-reading text in this regard."
"The most important thing is that we reach a fair compromise that is the best option available for this House and for the citizens we represent, while noting what our colleague, Mr Szájer has said."
"If this means waiting for a second-reading agreement, then so be it."
"As I said, the rule must be that if Council is involved, Parliament is involved."
"We are codecision makers, colegislators in this regard."
"As the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development, I feel it is of paramount importance that we assert the independence of Parliament and that the Commission respect both institutions."
"I am not sure that this 'compromise' achieves that."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (NL) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for his work on what is a complex and very technical dossier, but one that is, nonetheless, very important for our future activities."
"The old comitology procedure with four different options was not unknown to us, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and we have been familiar for a long time with how to deal with implementing decisions."
"However, with regard to the adjustments which need to be made under the Treaty of Lisbon, I would like to say that we support the compromises which the rapporteur has agreed with the Council."
"There are, nevertheless, two things which we consider need your attention."
"First of all, we want the maximum flow of information to Parliament and also the maximum involvement of Parliament in the preparation of the Committee's decisions."
"Secondly, I would like to emphasise the importance of a good approach to the transitional period, and in that respect we ask the Commission to be generous in favour of Parliament when reforming the comitology procedure, as defined in the acquis, to the new delegated and implementing acts, where the choice between the two procedures may be open to debate."
"Therefore, this does not apply to the reform alone, but also to the application of the current acquis ahead of any reform."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - Mr President, I worry that rejecting the inclusion of delegated acts in financial instruments might set a dangerous precedent for other policies."
"It also raises interinstitutional distrust and we are all concerned by this situation."
"The forthcoming proposals on the legislative package for regional policy after 2013 might require application of implementing acts, but might also require delegated acts."
"We cannot accept the prior exclusion of delegated acts."
"This should be a matter of negotiation among the colegislators on a case-by-case basis."
"This position is, in my view, consistent politically and legally and I believe that the Council and the Commission will evidently share it with Parliament."
"Ahead of us lie a number of difficult years, without doubt."
"Our duty as European institutions is to make the most of our policies, and by avoiding unnecessary conflicts and procedures we can be more effective in this common task."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I am deeply disappointed for several reasons with the contents of Mr Szájer's report, which is being voted on tomorrow."
"Firstly, none the amendments voted for by my committee unanimously - and I stress, unanimously - were taken into account, even though the common agricultural policy is one of the policies with the most acts adopted under the comitology procedure and is therefore one of the ones most affected by the adaptation of legislative acts under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Secondly, under the text of Article 10, the European Parliament will have no power to exert pressure nor a margin to negotiate with Council over the adaptation of CAP legislation to the new treaty."
"We are aware, in fact, that the Council has already demonstrated its unwillingness to agree acts delegated to the European Parliament and, with the adoption of this Regulation, the Council will not have any interest in proceeding with negotiations because the automatic adaptation - which excludes delegated acts and only covers implementing acts - has no deadline because it is transitional."
"For this reason, together with other fellow Members, I tabled an amendment that makes the automatic alignment genuinely temporary and I call on you all to support it in order to reinforce the role of the European Parliament."
"There is no reason, in fact, to come to an agreement at first reading over such a sensitive file that sets the rules for implementing the treaty for the coming years."
"This is the reason why, for this all-important file, we have the right - I would even go so far as to say the duty - to improve the text as much as possible and therefore proceed to a second reading without giving in to blackmail by the Council, which is threatening not to move on this file in order to force us to accept this negative agreement."
"After the budget, I think this is the most important file we have to vote on, because it redraws the balance of power between the European institutions."
"Here in this Chamber, we must vigorously defend the prerogatives of Parliament, which has been democratically elected and represents all European citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon introduces substantial changes to the process of developing and implementing EU legislation, by distinguishing between delegated acts and implementing acts."
"The previous primary legislation only provided for implementing measures."
"This regulation is essential for an orderly transition from the old system to the new system, and for appropriate use of the implementing powers granted to the Commission by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It strengthens the democratic principle because it recognises Parliament's right to control, increases transparency through the annual report and incorporates a review clause in order to perfect it based on experience."
"It therefore satisfies the requests that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs had made in this respect."
"In the area of financial services, it will help to increase legal security and the effectiveness of legislation."
"It complements the objective of the Omnibus Directive of limiting the powers entrusted to the Commission in the old framework that are compatible with the current framework to a period of three years from the entry into force of the new Treaty, and establishes provisions so that the technical implementing standards, which are part of the new supervision structure and the sectoral regulations in the area of financial services, can eventually be adopted."
"Therefore, as the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I view the report positively and I congratulate Mr Szájer."
"I would like to thank the President for his generosity and to give you all my best wishes for this festive season and for the coming year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a series of explanations are needed, including here in plenary, with regard to misleading debates which have taken place in the groups, in the Conference of Committee Chairs and in some cases in the committees."
"First of all, this regulation is not about deciding what delegated acts are under the terms of Article 290 and what implementing acts are under the terms of Article 291."
"This regulation will definitely not come to a decision on this."
"This is decided in the basic act."
"In other words, the law itself will decide on the authority under the terms of Article 290 or Article 291, if provision is made for this."
"The regulation only covers the procedure in the case of Article 291."
"My second point concerns the criticism of Article 10."
"This article also relates only to the procedure and nothing else."
"In this context, the Commission has once again clarified that it does, of course, intend to review all the existing acts from the pre-Lisbon period as part of the alignment and to make new proposals to both legislative bodies: Parliament and the Council."
"This has been reinforced once again in comparison with the previous Interinstitutional Agreement."
"The only thing which is really new is the procedure for external trade."
"I admit that the compromise which the Belgian Presidency has come up with is rather bureaucratic."
"There is no doubt about that."
"However, given the two blocking minorities in the Council, this was the only possible solution."
"For me, this question is all about weighing up the benefits."
"We also need to weigh up, as the rapporteur has said, what Parliament has negotiated."
"We have a procedure for reviewing implementing acts which is not provided for in the treaty."
"That is a very significant step forward, in particular with regard to the involvement of Parliament, which goes beyond the terms of the treaty."
"Therefore, when the benefits are weighed up, it is clear that this deserves our support."
"This is why I am in favour of the report as it is, without amendments."
"We will not be able to achieve any more in the first reading than we could achieve in a later conciliation process after an unspecified period."
"Mr President, the regulation that is being discussed today has been largely disregarded by all the committees over a long period."
"However, some people in this House have now woken up at the end of the process when the results are on the table."
"Some of them have unfortunately not attended the debate, which is a pity because it would have been very interesting to hear their views."
"As a former member, I have a clear memory of the spirit of the convention."
"It called openly for the European Parliament to be given specific rights in several areas, to ensure that it remained credible in the context of the institutions and with regard to the citizens."
"Despite the convention's demands, nothing was done."
"The very tough negotiations which the Belgian Presidency had with the Council were what enabled important progress to be made."
"I remember what Mr Lehne said."
"It was a question of the permanent possibility of investigating whether the Commission had exceeded its powers."
"Of course, some of the regulations are not exactly ideal, such as the international trade agreement, but nevertheless I agree with the outcome."
"I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency."
"It has made every effort to ensure that something was achieved."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur, who negotiated sympathetically and intelligently."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we vote on Mr Szájer's report tomorrow, we will give the go-ahead for one of the new instruments - on implementing acts - contained in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This will simplify the old comitology system."
"It is a measure that will ensure greater transparency during the adoption of legislative acts, regulating methods of control by Member States over the exercise of powers conferred on the Commission."
"The fundamental importance of the Regulation has made the legislative procedure complicated both at inter-institutional level and within Parliament where, however, because of the involvement - albeit belated - of all committees, I hope it will be possible to adopt the proposal at first reading."
"I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Szájer, for succeeding in achieving the priority objectives for the European Parliament: I refer to the guarantees to align the current comitology procedures with the new procedure, the right to scrutiny by Parliament and the Council, the creation of an appeal committee chaired by the Commission and the inclusion of a review clause that will make it possible to evaluate the efficiency of the procedure."
"Allow me a final comment on what was the last obstacle to the negotiations: the inclusion of the common commercial policy within the scope of the future Regulation."
"Although the final agreement will allow the application of a simple majority voting system for the adoption of anti-dumping measures during a transitional period of 18 months, subsequently the measures will be adopted by qualified majority."
"This solution was the outcome of a difficult compromise but I am convinced that it satisfies both the needs of industry and the European Union executive, removing decisions of a technical nature from the risk of dangerous politicisation."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I totally disagree with the last speakers."
"Personally, I find that this measure is harmful to the priorities of Parliament and is against the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We are about to conclude 70% of the agreements at first reading with the Council, but I fail to understand the rush to conclude such a sensitive measure as this at first reading since it concerns the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, which has extended our powers, particularly on commercial policy."
"At the very opening of the anti-dumping procedures, we are changing from the objectivity of legal certainty to an intervention by Member States, which threatens to become the outcome of bargaining between the Commission and Member States."
"I therefore think it is a step backwards, as is automatic alignment without any time limits from the old comitology system to the present system in the agricultural field, which strengthens the role of Parliament."
"Therefore, I do not believe it is wise to rush into an agreement with the Council at first reading, because we also run the risk of disputes before the Court of Justice."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank everyone for all the contributions, which reflect how complex an issue we are dealing with."
"Allow me to react to some of the comments."
"Concerning the review and our commitment to it in relation to all the relevant acts, we have here an extremely ambitious plan and I have been discussing it with Mr Lehne during our framework agreement discussions: we have 299 plus 153 acts to align."
"I think that if we say we would like to do it within the period of this legislature, it is a very ambitious plan."
"If I say it is 'our' ambition, I mean that on behalf of the three institutions because this clearly requires loyal cooperation from all of us."
"I would like to assure Mr Mitchell of the Commission's utmost respect for Parliament."
"I would like to highlight one paragraph in the draft Commission statement which is attached to the proposal."
"I will just read it out: 'While this alignment exercise is under way, the Commission will keep the European Parliament regularly informed on draft implementing measures related to these instruments which should become, in the future, delegated acts.'"
"So our commitment to transparency and clarity is absolutely clear."
"I would also like to confirm, here in this House, that we will offer Parliament the maximum amount of information."
"Parliament will receive all information at the same time as the committees, so we will do our utmost to keep Parliament informed also in this procedure."
"I think I have to thank Mr Lehne for clarifying the situation in the debate."
"What we are discussing today are implementing acts, and this regulation does not prejudge in any way whether we should use delegated or implementing acts in the future."
"Concerning the issue of alignment, I think Mr De Castro was not here when I was reading out the agreed statement of the Belgian Presidency with a full commitment to loyal cooperation to achieve this ambitious goal of full alignment in the coming years."
"I think there is a reassurance here that it is not only in Parliament' interests, but also in the Commission's and the Council's interests to proceed very quickly."
"I think this is very clear and I am sure that we will honour this agreement."
"Concerning the issue of politicisation of anti-dumping and countervailing measures, I think, actually, that we will see the opposite, because you know what the system is today: that a simple majority of the Member States' representatives can block a Commission proposal."
"This would be much more difficult in the future because you would need a qualified majority of the Member States representatives to block it."
"So I think that what we are doing here will actually strengthen the Union approach and strengthen the position of the Commission in the trade talks, exactly as prescribed and projected by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"If you will allow me, I will conclude by underlining the importance of legal certainty in this matter because, of course, when we are dealing with sensitive issues like trade, like anti-dumping measures, like countervailing measures, we need to have very well established procedures and we need to have a clear division of roles and responsibilities."
"Parliament needs the very clear scrutiny rights which have been given to it by the Treaty of Lisbon, and we need the legal certainty to operate in this very important legislative area because you know how often these measures are disputed in various international fora."
"Therefore, I would plead with the honourable Members to support these proposals without amendment because I think they are really good for the position of the European Union in world affairs."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to thank everyone for their contributions, both now and during the last nine months we have been working on this issue."
"First, a procedural thing."
"Many colleagues have voiced their worries about the fact that we are rushing into a first-reading agreement under pressure from the Council."
"Both the Commission and Council and several colleagues involved in the negotiations can testify that the pressure was the opposite."
"It was Parliament and myself who said to the Council that if it did not reach agreement then the whole thing could fall apart."
"We got a very clear commitment from both the other institutions because like Parliament, as Mr Šefčovič just mentioned, they are for the stability of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The later we accept, the later we adopt this kind of regulation, the longer the old comitology procedure - which we do not like because of its many problems - will go on."
"From that point of view, nine months is not a short time and could encompass two readings."
"There has been full transparency, and several colleagues can bear witness to that."
"I have been in the Conference of Committee Chairs six times during these nine months and have also met with shadows and coordinators from all the committees."
"It was I who decided to go for agreement because we were getting everything I wanted."
"Maybe the Council and the Commission do not like it, but we got everything."
"What does a rapporteur do when everything I and the different committees requested is there, although perhaps not in the form we want?"
"Mr De Castro is right."
"His requests are not in the form of the text of this regulation, but this is about implementing acts, and they are there in the Commission's commitment."
"I have done this alignment - the omnibus - before, and the same commitment was given by the Commission, which it honoured with very minor exceptions."
"In that sense, I thought I could trust this promise and if the Commission does not honour it, I will stand up and claim it and align, as Mr De Castro is doing."
"In that sense, there is no pressure."
"The pressure came from me."
"Through good cooperation in many difficult negotiations we agreed on something which I can unreservedly offer to the House to take on board."
"Thank you very much to everybody, especially to the colleagues who took part in this very difficult process."
"I apologise to the general public, which does not understand a word of what we are discussing, but I can definitely say that transparency and parliamentary control of European Union issues will be much better after this regulation is adopted."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"This legislative initiative on the control of 'executive instruments' by the Commission has been imposed by the Treaty of Lisbon, which includes this under the legislative powers of the European Parliament."
"It is also undeniably a positive piece of legislation overall, taking account of the existing situation."
"But several aspects fall short of full compliance with the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Amongst these negative aspects, two stand out."
"Firstly, there is no cut-off point for mandatory adaptation of the countless existing situations to the new system and to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It was for this reason that I tabled an amendment introducing such a clause."
"Secondly, and principally, the derogations provided for in the case of trade defence instruments (specifically anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures, as well as safeguard measures), according to which Member States will have more intrusive control over the Commission, are unacceptable, as they will make it more difficult to apply these measures and will lead to their politicisation."
"These measures are essential for defending European companies from competition from imports that benefit from such illicit benefits."
"There is no constitutional or political basis for this discriminatory treatment of commercial defence measures, which undermines the ability of the Commission (and the Union) to defend European industry against unfair competition from outside its own European internal market."
"Agenda of the next sitting : see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 09:00)"
"European Heritage Label (debate)"
"The first item is the report by Mrs Paliadeli, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Union action for the European Heritage Label - C7-0071/2010 -."
"Mr President, Commissioner, encouraging a European conscience that respects and defends multiculturalism represents a major challenge to the European institutions in their effort to achieve broad cohesion and solidarity between the citizens of the Member States of the European Union."
"Knowledge of our history, familiarity with our multicultural cultural heritage and information for the young generation about the ideas and people who were at the forefront in building the European Union may help to bridge the gap between the European Union and its citizens."
"The European Commission has undertaken, on the instructions of the Council of the European Union, to draft a proposal to transform the intergovernmental European Heritage label into a Community institution."
"Broad public consultation and an impact assessment have illustrated that integrating this institution into European initiatives would help to improve the image and credibility of the label, provided that it is based on clearly predefined criteria and emphasises the symbolic, rather than the aesthetic, nature of a monument or site; in other words, it would make a statement that European history is the result of a rich and mutually complementary common cultural heritage and that the European Union is rooted in strong values, such as freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, cultural diversity, tolerance and solidarity."
"We started with a very ambitious approach to the label; as a weapon in our foreign policy arsenal which would go beyond the borders of the European Union, it could be awarded to other states in Europe and - why not - even outside our continent."
"For the moment, it would appear to be more realistic for it to be used as a means of deepening cohesion between the Member States of the Union and for it to be restricted initially to its Member States."
"We countered the Commission's proposal that the label should be awarded to a maximum of 27 sites with a proposal that the procedure should be repeated every two years, in order to maintain the value of the institution and allow time for sites to be selected and then monitored, once the label has been awarded."
"We agree that, because of the symbolic value of the award, as a factor that contributes to European unification, transnational sites need to be favoured, because they support cohesion, promote the creation of networks and encourage cooperation between Member States or regions."
"That is why they should take first place in the quota."
"For practical reasons, one Member State will act as coordinator between the European group of experts and the Commission."
"We approached the transformation of the label not as an administrative transformation of the old transnational institution, but as a new institution with clearly defined selection criteria and binding obligations on the part of recipients if they are to keep it."
"The group of experts, the networking, the symbolic character and the monitoring of the awardees indicate a different approach which should not be confused with the previous transnational institution."
"That is why, in the aim of safeguarding the old institution and promoting the validity of the new institution, we felt that the transitional provisions in Article 18 in the Commission's proposal were not needed."
"We also sought ways of strengthening the role of the twelve-member team of experts in the Commission text by adding another member proposed by the Committee of the Regions, and we tried to ensure the team was more involved in the label award or withdrawal procedure."
"In the same context, and in order to strengthen the role of the European Parliament, we insisted on the Commission's obligation to publish a full list of pre-selected sites, before the final selection, and to advise the European Parliament and the Council accordingly."
"This will give the European Parliament and the Council time to react if any issues arise."
"To close this brief presentation, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission representatives and the Council for their creative contribution to the report which you will be asked to vote on shortly."
"I trust that we shall cooperate in the same spirit at the next stage of the consultation."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the European Parliament, especially, the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, and the shadow rapporteurs, for their solid support for the Commission's proposal on the European Heritage Label."
"As you know, this proposal was one of the first approved by the new Commission after it had taken office and it is one of our priorities in the cultural sector over the coming years."
"Our aim, through this label, is to give European citizens, especially young citizens, new opportunities to learn about their common and, at the same time, diverse cultural heritage and history and the development of the European Union."
"I am certain that this will help to bring European citizens closer to the European Union."
"The European Heritage Label will also help to increase cultural tourism and will bring physical and financial benefits."
"Cooperation between Parliament and the Commission on the label has been extremely constructive over recent months and I am delighted that our approach coincided on numerous basic issues."
"Most of the amendments that you approved today are completely in line with our ambitions for the new label."
"We share Parliament's view that the quality and validity of the initiative are of vital importance."
"We also appreciate the action you have taken to maintain maximum clarity, simplicity and flexibility in the rules and procedures, so that they are easy for the public to understand and for the Member States and the European Union to apply."
"However, a small number of your amendments are politically more delicate."
"I refer mainly to the transitional provisions deleted."
"The sites awarded the intergovernmental label and the Member States have huge expectations of the transitional period, which will give them the opportunity to participate in the new system quickly, provided, of course, that they satisfy the new quality criteria."
"This is possibly one of the main issues we need to discuss with the Council at our trialogues over coming months."
"However, I am certain that compromises will be found which are acceptable to all sides and which will safeguard the long-term success of the European Heritage Label."
"That is why we hope to continue his excellent cooperation with Parliament in this sector."
"Thank you once again for your excellent cooperation."
"Mr President, as is only right, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur not only on her work but, most of all, on her ability to listen."
"This report, while it may not appear very important in the overall context of this Parliament, seems to me likely to bring about real Community action."
"Small streams make great rivers."
"If the Committee on Culture and Education voted to keep the name of 'European Heritage Label' - for which the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) was hoping in particular - it is because this initiative is not limited to the period of history of the European Union, but focuses on the grand idea of Europe, a much older concept."
"The label is a powerful tool that should primarily promote European identity through cultural diversity."
"It should not be seen as a simple transformation of the intergovernmental initiative, but rather as a real tool which, based on experience, will bring real added value, both through the impetus it may give to the promotion of European values by Member States or local authorities and in terms of our citizens' knowledge of these values."
"Its aim is to strengthen European citizens' sense of belonging to Europe, and to help bring about a common awareness."
"At a time when public attachment to the European idea remains a major challenge we must face, Europe also needs symbols that develop and strengthen it on a daily basis, as unfortunately it would seem that European identity is an obvious fact that is yet to be invented."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I completely agree with all the other speakers that this is an excellent initiative and I am very pleased that the Committee on Culture and Education and Mrs Paliadeli are putting this forward."
"I would like particularly to thank our rapporteur who has done excellent work on this."
"It is a very good means of promoting Europe, of promoting our common culture and history."
"I am sure it will be a huge success and we have put in place various ways of making sure it is successful."
"The final sites will be chosen by a panel of experts who will have specialist knowledge in this area and, as I have said before, we will particularly be looking at cross-border sites to promote the idea of Europe."
"There are also particular criteria that we ask the successful candidates to meet: we want to raise the European significance of the sites chosen; the successful candidates will be expected to organise education events, especially for young people; there will be an exchange of ideas on initiating common projects with other sites awarded the label; there will be artistic and cultural activities which will foster dialogue; and there will be access, of course, for the widest numbers of the public to visit these sites."
"So I think the sites, when they are up and running, will have a huge benefit for Europe and will be something that people will be able to come to and enjoy, and will promote the idea of Europe and what we in Parliament and the EU are doing."
"So I commend this report to you all."
"I am sure when the scheme is set up and running it will be a huge success and I have been very proud to be part of this initiative."
"Mr President, the European Heritage Label is, without doubt, a very important project, for at least two reasons: firstly, it enables European citizens to feel closer to their common and diverse history and heritage; secondly it is a good tool for promoting cultural tourism and boosting the economy."
"I would therefore like to thank Commissioner Vassiliou and the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, for their initiative and their hard work, and I would like to take this opportunity to say that, although initially, it was an initiative by the Member States, we now need to give it a clearly EU dimension."
"This means that the European Heritage Label should not be the sum of the places selected by the Member States, but rather it should reflect a common European vision."
"Having a European vision requires common criteria and absolute transparency in the pre-selection process by the Member States."
"It also means that we must respect regional, cultural and linguistic diversity."
"Its success depends on us."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the promotion and development of heritage sites in Europe is a necessary and welcome project which deserves our full attention."
"Our rich and diverse cultural heritage is something that the citizens of Europe should be proud of and, indeed, is one of the primary reasons why millions of people from around the world visit Europe every year."
"The project has the potential to deliver for historical sites the possibility to access additional funding and to preserve and develop their facilities, which is a much needed asset during these tough economic times, but where we raise expectations for citizens, we have the responsibility to deliver."
"However, from the outset, this report was couched in a federalist language that sought to promote a fake or forced European demos, and the attempt to rename the scheme the European Union Heritage Label was politically based and would exclude thousands of potential locations whose history and heritage predates, and indeed overshadows, many contemporary sites."
"In addition, attempts by myself and others to ensure that the focus of the label remained on heritage, and not on political integration, were rejected."
"This will inevitably lead to the unfair exclusion of many important sites."
"Funding for this programme also raised serious concerns, especially given the austerity measures currently afflicting culture departments across Europe."
"I hope that we were able to contain this, going forward."
"The excessive proliferation of sites and the probable duplication of the UNESCO scheme are also likely to add problems."
"The central goals of this label should have been to preserve and celebrate our shared and diverse heritage, but unfortunately, we have not guaranteed that we will add value."
"This is something that we need to be mindful of."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased with this initiative, which aims to transform the European Heritage Label into a formal action of the European Union in order to increase its effectiveness, visibility, prestige and credibility."
"To this end, I should like to emphasise the importance of the professionalism of the members of the panel of experts appointed to evaluate the sites, as well as the rigorousness of the procedures for attribution of the label and reviewing its maintenance as time goes on."
"These elements are essential to ensure the specificity and quality of the label itself."
"The label must, however, focus entirely on symbolic and educational value, rather than on the beauty of the site - as other initiatives for the promotion of cultural heritage tend to - so as to clearly differentiate it from these."
"Therefore, I also agree that transnational sites should be held in particular consideration, in virtue of their symbolic importance."
"(DE) Mr President, a label of this kind makes good sense, but only under two conditions: the first is that it should have high visibility to ensure awareness - after all, we already have an abundance of symbols like this."
"The second condition is that the associated bureaucracy should not be allowed to become an end in itself, as with so many similar initiatives and EU institutions."
"It really would be a paradox of European cultural tradition if something that could be so beneficial to us, clearly setting out a position quite different from China in the way it deals with its ancient culture, or from the United States with its historically small repository of cultural sites, were to be seen in the final analysis as an extremely bureaucratic and complex way of creating jobs for the boys."
"We need to be quite clear about one thing: culture is the source for the inspiring ideas and visions that are frequently espoused here, but far less frequently put into practice."
"This particular opportunity to establish an identity that is also encompassed by the principle of subsidiarity, can only exist through culture, which is why we need to do even more in this area."
"I am also thinking of the specific promotion of writers and other artists, without the self-perpetuating bureaucratic organisations and institutions we tend to have in a European context."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to greet Commissioner Vassiliou and thank her for her strong backing for this initiative, just as I should like to thank Mrs Paliadeli and all the shadow rapporteurs for the good work they have done."
"Europe is experiencing economic and financial difficulties at present."
"Indeed, we are currently discussing how to intervene to help several countries of the European Union that are in difficulty."
"Obviously, that is an important thing to do, but Europe must not lose sight of the importance of the values that have allowed the Union to emerge victorious from the innumerable challenges it has had to deal with during its history."
"Europe's wealth lies in its history, its culture, its art, its leading figures, its landscapes, its symbolic places, its intellectuals, its philosophers and - dare I say it - in its civilisation."
"This label can represent all of this and highlight all the myriad forms of European identity that the Member States have contributed over time."
"We must now look at the negotiations with the Council to resolve a few differences of interpretation on several points."
"I believe the disputed points will be resolved swiftly and perhaps even easily, given the importance of this topic."
"I also believe that as soon as this report is definitively adopted, we shall all feel more European, due to the values and traditions we share."
"I believe that through the Commission, the work carried out by Parliament and with the Council, we really are doing a good job for all our citizens."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question from Mr Martin under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Mr President, I am much obliged to Mr Scurria."
"I greatly appreciate what he had to say on this matter."
"I would just like to ask him, as a representative of the largest group here in this House, how he would assess the risk that we may get tied up with too much red tape in relation to the administration and implementation of this cultural heritage label?"
"Does he have any proposals for ensuring that this is kept within reasonable parameters, so that we are not faced with a plethora of endlessly deliberating juries and our actual common goal is not missed, namely, a highly visible label that is also recognised accordingly in the media."
"(IT) Mr President, I am very happy to respond to Mr Martin because we know that the bureaucracy issue is sometimes what distinguishes and separates European citizens from their institutions."
"Seen from this point of view, I think the path set out by this report is quite clear."
"We shall also talk about it with the Council."
"Once the Member States have decided which sites the European label could be given to and once we have a panel of true experts coming together, who are given the chance to select the sites within a necessary but not excessive amount of time - and we still need to work out who will have the last word on this, but it is an issue that we shall have to discuss both with the Council and Commission - I do not see excessive bureaucratic issues from this point of view."
"There are bureaucratic issues for many other measures but not on this one regarding the label, which I think can easily be followed in a secure timeframe and with clear results for all European citizens."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to join in congratulating Mrs Paliadeli on the excellent work that she has done."
"I think that we can now say, once the report is adopted, that it is going to be the successful culmination of a new commitment to Europeanism, and I do not believe that it is trivial to make a commitment to Europeanism in the current times."
"I also believe that the decision of the Member States, the Commissioner and the Commission to place the European Heritage Label within the sphere of the European Union is going to help increase its visibility, prestige and credibility, but it is also going to strengthen the deep-rooted ideals of cohesion and solidarity between European citizens."
"The label is an important step towards European integration, because it is going to bring us and all citizens closer to our common history."
"When there are so many voices to be heard which so often are laying claim to individual history - frequently national history - I believe that an initiative such as the one that we are voting on today to lay claim to a common history and make it known has a really symbolic and extremely important value."
"I believe that what we are going to do with this European Heritage Label will also help the younger generations to understand the ideas that were behind the founding fathers of the European Union, so that they can see that this European Union, this European integration process that we are going through, is a process, and that like all processes, its conclusion depends on those that are working within it."
"I think that in this respect, the European Union is going to be what its citizens want it to be."
"I therefore urge everyone to work together."
"I obviously heard Mr Martin just now saying that we should avoid bureaucracy."
"Of course we should!"
"However, above all, what we need to commit to is our common history, and making it known."
"Mr Takkula has asked permission to ask a question."
"Mr Takkula, you may put a question to Mrs Badia."
"(FI) Mr President, my chief purpose was to ask to speak, because I am coordinator of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and because I would like, on its behalf, to thank Mrs Paliadeli for this magnificent report and to say a few words about the history of our people and about the European Heritage Label."
"So actually, my question is ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Takkula, one moment: the procedure... we are going to give you the floor soon as an additional speaker, because the representative of your group was indeed not present."
"We will call on you along with the various speakers who speak next and you will have two minutes to speak."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, a short while ago, when interpreting Mrs Badia i Cutchet's speech, the interpreter used the term 'Europeism', presumably in error."
"No such word exists in the Polish language and, in fact, I have the feeling that the initiative we are currently discussing is constructing something that does not exist: 'Europeism', or some kind of artificial creation, which is a pawn in a political game."
"I believe that what we are doing is unnecessary."
"As a famous philosopher once said, 'entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity'."
"It is my impression that the European Heritage Label represents an entity being multiplied beyond necessity."
"I will not mention the huge question mark hanging over the issue of how the label is to be granted and withdrawn."
"I will not mention the fact that the initiative will cost European taxpayers EUR 1 350 000."
"My question is of a fundamental nature, quite apart from these other serious matters, namely: why are we doing this?"
"Do we really need to construct something which is not Europeanness, but merely the Europeism I mentioned earlier?"
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, the current idea of culture is nothing new - we have heard it before during the discussion of other reports in Parliament and we have heard it again here today - it is on the verge of being considered instrumental in the European Union."
"This is expressed in various ways: whether in the context of so-called cultural diplomacy, in which culture is seen as a tool for foreign policy, or in the area currently under discussion of creating a European Union Heritage Label so as to, in the words of the rapporteur, 'enhance the Europeans' faith in the European Union and its leaders' and 'fill in the gap between the European Union and its citizens'."
"The rapporteur judiciously realises that there are other more-effective means of achieving this, about which a great deal more could be said."
"I should like to point out that no label will be enough to erase the visible effects the policies that the EU has been implementing and its economic governance have had on the citizens and peoples of Europe: in short, the plans of true social terrorism it has been putting into action with the connivance of national governments."
"We should also consider the effects of policies such as the common agricultural policy or the common fisheries policy, amongst others, on the destruction of important cultural labels and the live elements of the cultural and historical heritage of the European peoples."
"Let us consider the future disintegration, over the course of just a single generation, of coastal or secular rural communities."
"This initiative, which has a predominantly symbolic significance, is based on developing the fallacy of a single European identity and a single European culture and, moreover, on values such as freedom, democracy, tolerance and solidarity, via the particularly sensitive area of cultural heritage and, in turn, that of history, which gives rise to the serious concern that this will encourage the alarming procedure of rewriting history that we have been witnessing recently."
"Culture, like other historical phenomena, does not come from some kind of homogenous shared identity but rather, it is indicative of antagonisms, conflicts and cultural domination."
"Let us again ask ourselves about the meaning of the designation 'European Union Heritage Label', which is conferred on the basis simply of where the elements of heritage in question are located."
"Knowing, as we do, that European heritage is borrowed from many cultures and could also be claimed by the Islamic world, by the Mediterranean cultures or by the cultures of those people subjected to European colonialism, is it Heritage of the European Union or Heritage in the European Union?"
"Mr President, I should like to close by saying that, in general, with a few exceptions, the amendments tabled by the rapporteur have improved the Commission's draft, but in this case, the report's specific objectives are far less important than the misconceptions underlying it."
"(RO) Mr President, today, 16 December, we celebrate the 240th anniversary of Ludwig van Beethoven's birth, the composer of the united Europe's anthem."
"Given this excellent report from the Committee on Culture and Education, as a Romanian historian and writer, I would like to propose for a European Heritage Label an exceptional site which is unique in the world - St Andrew's Cave, located close to the place where the Danube flows into the Black Sea."
"As is confirmed by Origen, one of the fathers of the Christian church, who learnt about it from his father, who, in turn, learnt about it from Andrew's disciples, the first man to be called by Jesus Christ came here, to this small cave in the province of Scythia Minor, and spread the light of the Gospel."
"This is almost certainly the first Christian church in Europe."
"During the first few months of 2011, I am going to take the necessary steps to obtain community support for a grand project."
"I intend to erect an impressive statue of our Saviour Jesus Christ in the Romanian part of Transylvania, in the Braşov region to be exact."
"It will be 40 metres high, making it taller than similar statues in Brazil, Portugal and Poland."
"It will also have a church at its base where weddings, christenings and religious services to mark the great Christian feasts will be celebrated."
"In the dark days ahead, we will come through and emerge victorious only in the light of the Christian cross."
"(DE) Mr President, I am very pleased that this initiative, which is already implemented in some Member States, has now come before the European Union as a whole."
"It was right and proper that a biennial cycle should have been chosen for awarding the label."
"I would also like to express my thanks to the rapporteur in this matter."
"However, I must admit that I have a slight reservation about the fact that we must manage to draw a precise distinction between UNESCO's world cultural heritage programme and the European character of this label."
"Otherwise, it will be hard for our citizens to understand why this particular label has a special European dimension."
"I have taken a look to see what sites have been nominated by the Member States so far and have found, naturally enough, that they are primarily man-made structures."
"Our idea in the Committee on Culture and Education was not just to recognise buildings, although buildings are an important element, but, more importantly, objects of value and other sites, or even experiences, that are associated with European development."
"Which brings me to the last point in my comments."
"It will be particularly important to appoint appropriate experts to the juries who have assimilated these aims and who will help to implement and develop them."
"This being the case, there would be no need to fear the bureaucracy that could conceivably arise."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during a stage in its life in which Europe is undergoing a crisis of identity and prospects, I think that the establishment of a European Heritage Label that identifies those sites - both material and immaterial - of high symbolic and educational value for the history, culture and creation of the European Union, is particularly significant."
"My sincere thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, who efficiently took on board the proposals and additions suggested by many of us in the Committee on Culture and Education, providing, in particular, for procedures that are more certain and more respectful of the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the subdivision of tasks among Member States, the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"As some of my fellow Members have picked up on, we also strove to make sure there was no overlap between the label and other initiatives of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) or the European Council's historic and cultural itineraries."
"Indeed, on the basis of well-defined criteria, the Member States will present not more than two actively managed sites every two years."
"This is an important point: the Member States must show that they believe in the sites and therefore manage them in an educational way, involving the people."
"The Commission, meanwhile, will be responsible for pre-selection after hearing from a panel of experts, but it will also assume a monitoring role, will assess the effectiveness of the management of the sites every six years, and may also withdraw the label."
"Parliament comes out of this with a stronger role because not only does it appoint four of the 16 members of the European panel, but also because it has an active relationship with the list of pre-selected sites."
"I also support the solution provided to the complex problem of the marks already assigned on an intergovernmental basis to many Member States that, in any case, though not suitable for the new system and the new criteria, will retain their earlier mark and will not therefore be downgraded."
"I also appreciate the priority given to transnational sites, which will be a very interesting challenge for Europe, and the role assigned to the Committee of the Regions as part of an approach of subsidiarity, as well as the emphasis on the necessary involvement of Member States in the selection phase, including municipalities and regions, in order to avoid their being only partially involved."
"However, I think an extra effort by the Member States would also be useful."
"It would be very important for them to launch competitions aimed at young people in schools and universities to start a process to identify the sites, which would also become a way to reconstruct a common European history and destiny and mean that they, too, would contribute to the sense of belonging and European citizenship."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank you for the opportunity to speak for a moment on behalf of my group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, about this important report on the European Heritage Label."
"Listening to the debate today, sometimes my impressions recalled what a certain teacher once told me: anything that can be misunderstood will be misunderstood."
"By this I mean that some try to see this excellent project - whose purpose is to raise Europe's profile and show that Europe's strength lies in its diversity, in the fact that it is united in its diversity - as a threat to the notion of the nation state, or a threat to European identity, or to something else."
"It is not about that."
"I believe that this is an excellent initiative, and I would say that we need to know more about Europe."
"We need to know about one another, because in that way we can build a better Europe in the future."
"Europe is a mosaic of nations where common ideas about democracy, human dignity and freedom of opinion have developed."
"They are core values that we want to take forward."
"When we talk about the European cultural heritage, it has to be said that we have a very rich one."
"I believe that this small investment that we are making, EUR 1.3 million for the entire programme, will benefit those sites that acquire the European Heritage Label many times over, and even financially."
"The financial benefit is not what is most important here either: above all, it is the psychological benefit derived from a strengthened European spirit and a better understanding of how this Europe of mosaics was born and what its basis and foundation are."
"When we know our background and history, then we will also be able to build a sustainable future."
"Mr President, again I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, for her report."
"In my view, it is an excellent and necessary one."
"Furthermore, it is well worth moving ahead with the European Heritage Label project on the basis of the report."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, creating a European identity and increasing citizens' interest in the European Union and its origins are two challenges that the European institutions must face up to in order to achieve broad cohesion and solidarity."
"Furthermore, these challenges are at the heart of the goals of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Indeed, Article 3 of the Treaty establishes the EU's obligation to safeguard European cultural development."
"If the European dream is going through a difficult phase at the moment, this is not only down to the impasse regarding Europe as a political project, or the ongoing economic crisis, but is also due to the difficulties faced by a Union founded on an as yet unresolved identity."
"In this situation, it is more necessary than ever to reduce the gap between the European Union and its citizens, bringing the multinational yet shared cultural heritage of the European Union to its citizens and, above all, to future generations."
"This is the meaning and importance of a European Heritage Label: to bring Europe together in its diversity, promoting a shared culture and favouring integration between the places involved within its territory."
"In order to realise this objective, the new label will focus on the symbolic educational value rather than on the aesthetic beauty of a site, favouring cooperation between sites and supporting joint projects amongst them."
"I should therefore like to pay tribute to the excellent work done by Mrs Paliadeli and the rest of the Committee on Culture and Education, in particular, with regard to the procedure for selecting the sites and strengthening the role of the European Parliament during the selection process."
"I am sure that the Member States' decision to insert the label within the framework of the European Union will contribute to increasing its visibility and prestige, so as to realise the objectives of cohesion and solidarity among European citizens."
"(RO) Mr President, I, too, would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the excellent report she managed to produce and for the negotiations she conducted with the Commission and Council."
"Even though she failed to have the European Union Cultural Heritage Label established, the European Heritage Label is still excellent, as is the project itself."
"I firmly believe that if it follows in the footsteps of the European Capital of Culture project, it will be hugely successful."
"It is an excellent initiative, especially as it gives rise to cross-border projects."
"A number of states are collaborating in order to share the same values and traditions which they have enjoyed together for hundreds of years."
"I come from a city located at the European Union's eastern border, perhaps the largest cultural city on the eastern border, just 10 km from the border."
"However, I have also been to Santiago de Compostela, which is virtually on the European Union's western border - two cultural centres with very many things in common, but also with very many differences between them."
"One place is an Orthodox centre of pilgrimage, while the other is a Catholic centre of pilgrimage."
"We see the values we share most clearly when we go outside the European Union's borders, when we travel on other continents."
"We then get a very clear picture of the values that we have been sharing for hundreds of years and of the fact that we have a common culture and certain features that differentiate us from other peoples."
"The European Union, or rather European Heritage Label, acquires its significance therefore when we go outside the European Union's borders."
"I congratulate you once again on this report and I firmly believe that it will be a successful project."
"(HU) Mr President, I welcome the fact that in the course of this session, this is the second proposal we are voting on that intends to bridge the gap between the European Union and its citizens."
"Converted from the intergovernmental programmes of several European countries into an official EU action, the introduction of the European Heritage Label will strengthen the sense of belonging to the EU, and will reinforce the recognition of differences and intercultural dialogue."
"It will make citizens, especially young people, aware of the importance of their role in European history and European symbolism."
"It can raise our awareness of our common cultural heritage."
"The sites that are awarded the label will be more accessible, especially to young people, and the objects embodying our common history will be put to use more appropriately."
"What please me most, personally, are the organisational aspects of the action, namely, that the selection and supervision procedures will be conducted along common, unambiguous and transparent criteria, and professional exchange of experience will proliferate."
"As an elected Member representing a national minority, I note with satisfaction that in the case of Romania, for example, sites nominated by objective, international experts will also have the chance of being selected in addition to the four objects already holding the label."
"Such sites include the Teleki Library in Târgu-Mureş, which is known as one of the bastions of Hungarian culture, or the Black Church of Braşov, which is considered a quintessential example of Saxon Gothic architectural excellence."
"(CS) Mr President, the European Heritage Label is undoubtedly a good initiative, and a continuation of the intergovernmental project now operating since 2006."
"The aim of the initiative is to contribute towards the creation of a common European identity, increasing interest in the European Union and its values."
"The concept of 'cultural heritage' is very broad, and that is a good thing."
"I am delighted that the proposal for amendment incorporating industrial heritage into this category was also adopted in the report."
"Industry is one of the important components of common European history - after all, Europe was the cradle of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, and the beginning of the EU is linked to the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community."
"It is also linked, however, with the common history of movements for civil and social rights."
"One of the areas expected to benefit from the European Heritage Label is the area of tourism."
"I firmly believe that this is an opportunity to make use of the monuments of common European history to develop tourism in those regions which are not traditional tourist destinations too."
"This type of monument is, in my opinion, unjustly overlooked, and all that is required is to discover and make use of its potential."
"I therefore welcome and support the report very much, and in this context, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli."
"(PL) Mr President, in the period before the Treaty of Lisbon was enacted, we were faced with a situation in which the citizens of the EU were becoming markedly less interested in its affairs and activities."
"Adopting the Treaty of Lisbon was intended not only to provide a solution to problems relating to the need for better functioning institutions, but also to involve Europe's citizens more closely in the EU's activities, for example, by means of the citizens' initiative."
"The European Heritage Label is a further step towards building a European identity and strengthening the links between citizens and the EU."
"Over the past four years, the Member States have designated 64 sites with particular significance for Europe."
"By discovering our shared history and learning about the European Union's role and its cultural diversity based on common democratic values and human rights, we can strengthen the sense of belonging to a large European family, within the framework of the EU, in the inhabitants of our Community."
"(GA) Mr President, I welcome these proposals and I think they will grow and develop the tourism industry, something which is much needed these days."
"Despite all the criticism that Europe gets, I think most citizens still value Europe and particularly a label with Europe on it."
"I have seen that in relation to the European City of Sport."
"Limerick, in my own constituency, got that award recently and it was much valued."
"The same is true of the European Cities of Culture and it will certainly apply to the European Heritage sites."
"There are a few good things about this which should be commended."
"One is that you have to maintain the site, so that you will not get it forever without actually ensuring you deserve it."
"Secondly, there is the point made by Mr Martin, which was well answered by Mr Scurria, that red tape will not stifle it."
"I think we can be very proud of this."
"It has a lot of potential."
"(LT) Mr President, there are often discussions among citizens on the future of the European Union."
"The foundations of a strong Union and a successful future are built on trust and mutual accommodation, just like in a family."
"The European Heritage Label is a means for people to find out more about others, to find those things and recognise personalities and movements that symbolise the building of Europe."
"The identification of a shared cultural heritage is an opportunity to strengthen a single and united Europe."
"All nations and countries, we all have a different, varied historical experience, often painful, but it is these differences that go together to make up our family and form our European identity."
"In particular, I would like to emphasise the division of Europe that lasted for many years and the different or total lack of opportunities for the development of democracy."
"I am talking about Eastern Europe and occupation by the Soviet Union."
"However, there was always a struggle for the idea of a united Europe there too, and we must appreciate ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, nobody can accuse us of not being consistent."
"In the Treaty of Lisbon, we established citizenship of the EU for its inhabitants, and yesterday we had the opportunity to vote on the citizens' initiative."
"Today, we are adopting a symbol, namely the European Heritage Label."
"This will unquestionably boost the EU's identity and citizenship or, in other words, all the values that are of such importance to us."
"I believe that this label will act as an outstanding complement to both the UNESCO list and the European Cultural Routes, as well as the European Capitals of Culture."
"Anyone who travels knows the value and importance of such schemes."
"I believe that promoting European culture to the very heart of Europe, to Europeans, is a fundamental aspect."
"A good deal of Europe is still undiscovered in this respect, but the promotion of European culture outside Europe also plays a key role."
"What is most important is that this label be promoted successfully by the Commissioner and the Member States."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to take my turn in congratulating our rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, on her excellent report and on all her efforts to date."
"This new European Heritage Label highlights our culture, highlights the European spirit and satisfies all of us who frequently visit sites in Europe and think it is a shame that we do not highlight the added value of Europe, all these historical monuments that we badly need to advertise."
"At the moment, as you know, Europe is concerned not only with the economic crisis, as is only natural;"
"Europe post-Lisbon wants to highlight its cultural cohesion, the rich history, the mosaic that defines it."
"Of course, this needs to be done with the active participation of the European Parliament and I trust that negotiations with the Council on Article 18 will turn out well."
"(RO) Mr President, I welcome the intergovernmental European Heritage Label project being turned into a formal European Union initiative at a time when the initial project has not enjoyed the high profile and prestige which it deserves."
"This project allows us to open a door as well to countries which enrich our continent's culture without being part of the European Union."
"One key aspect is the re-evaluation of sites which have already been designated under the intergovernmental agreement, as well as ensuring fairness with regard to states with a different number of initially registered sites."
"In addition, in the case where the sites cannot be re-evaluated directly, it is important for them to have the opportunity to reapply for the label in order to offer them more opportunities."
"Awarding the European Heritage Label for an unlimited period, without a regular re-evaluation, would help make more efficient use of the reduced budget allocated to the project."
"The European Heritage Label will raise the general public's awareness of the diversity of our common cultural heritage and cultural tourism."
"(RO) Mr President, creating a European identity and increasing the level of interest in the EU are major challenges."
"They are capable of generating cohesion and solidarity on a large scale."
"The European Heritage Label could meet its objectives in a more effective way if it was managed as an EU initiative."
"It must be based on the same criteria and have a very clearly defined monitoring system."
"One of the upshots of this will be to boost cultural tourism."
"Just as in the case of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the label will increase tourist numbers and provide a fresh boost to local economies."
"I welcome the Commission's intention to use the European Heritage Label along with the other instruments designed to establish a stronger link between the EU and its citizens."
"I wish to end by stressing the importance of promoting intercultural dialogue."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it seems that the majority of Members who took the floor stressed the importance of this European initiative and the real added value of it."
"They stressed the importance of this initiative in promoting Europe, the common European history and heritage, the educational value of this initiative and its significance in creating and encouraging more cultural dialogue."
"I am very pleased and very grateful for this approval."
"I would like to make it clear that the experts who are going to be appointed for the decisions on this important initiative will certainly have the highest professional credentials to make sure that they choose not only the best and highest value sites, but also ideas."
"Let me remind you that this heritage is not only about sites, but also about intangible cultural heritage."
"For example, in Portugal, we have the decree which was the first decree in Europe abolishing the death sentence."
"That was included with the list of labels, so this heritage can be intangible as well."
"I also want to clarify that our purpose is indeed to have a simplified procedure - quality but simplification is important."
"That is why we have not accepted the Council's proposal that after the experts' group, the initiative would go to comitology, as that would create red tape and waste valuable time for the decision to be adopted."
"I would like to finish by saying that in these times of economic crisis which create divisions between the peoples of Europe politically, socially and economically, we need initiatives like this which will bring the people of Europe together."
"They will have a sense of identity, and we have to stress the importance of our common cultural heritage whose richness does indeed lie in its diversity."
"Common but diverse cultural heritage is what will unite us."
"I would like to thank you once again for your support, especially Ms Paliadeli and the shadow rapporteurs for this excellent cooperation we had, and I am looking forward to the final adoption of this important initiative in the near future."
"Mr President, I should like to start by stating that I share the views expressed, both on the impact assessment of the European Heritage Label and its added cultural value."
"The label alone cannot bridge the gap between the public and the European Union."
"It can simply help, together with other initiatives, to address the problem."
"Of course, I cannot hide the fact that, in times of crisis, such as the recent crisis we have been experiencing, with the savage attack on the euro and the European Union, the public does not look solely to culture to resolve their basic day-to-day issues."
"However, a knowledge of history and respect for multiculturalism may act both as a cohesion instrument and as an incentive to growth for local communities, by calling on them to cooperate at local, regional, national and transnational level, as stated in the Commission proposal and as accepted by us."
"From this perspective, the idea of a cultural heritage label for the European Union - my thanks to Mr Ivan who remembered the initial proposal - which is designed to enhance the European public's awareness of their common heritage and, at the same time, to support cultural tourism, is a positive step in this direction."
"Values such as democracy and freedom, which are rooted in Europe's cultural past, are as important as transparency and solidarity nowadays, especially if we want to bridge the gap between the European institutions and the citizens of the Member States of the Union and the gap between the citizens of the Member States."
"Of course, we shall need to address bureaucracy issues, but I can assure you that the transparency and composition of the European team of experts will be subject to extremely clear conditions."
"There is no doubt that the institution will operate with absolute clarity."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Turning the European Heritage Label initiative into an official EU action will provide particular added value to all the actions being carried out by Member States, while also making an important contribution to creating a common European identity."
"I welcome this initiative and the report that has been presented."
"I also want to mention that the European Heritage Label could be extended very successfully and with a beneficial impact to activities relating to traditional rural tourism, a flourishing sector in European states."
"Indeed, this is one of the proposals I am going to submit to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development when presenting the opinion on the role which rural tourism and agritourism play in achieving the EU's objective of turning Europe into the number one tourist destination in the world."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Paliadeli on her work on this report."
"Establishing and awarding the European Heritage Label is an initiative that deserves special attention."
"The European dimension and the significance of the sites put forward will help to foster European identity and a sense of European citizenship."
"Our continent's history is an important element that could contribute to the integration of the peoples of Europe."
"Our younger generation must be properly aware of our common European heritage because it is very important for there to be no variations in the different versions or attempts at populist interpretation, as this is our common European history and it reflects our entire cultural and linguistic diversity."
"The selection procedure must make sure that only sites of suitable quality are chosen."
"I believe that Member States should submit their proposals in close collaboration with local and regional authorities."
"This will help popularise the sites at national level and bridge the gap between the European institutions and European citizens."
"As a Member of the European Parliament, the only democratically elected body which represents its citizens, I believe that it needs to play a greater role in this initiative."
"I fully subscribe to the statement in the report that there is an enormous gap between the EU and the citizens of the European Member States, as more than half of them have a none too favourable opinion about the EU."
"With the renaming of the European Heritage Label as the European Union Heritage Label, and with the accompanying modifications, we are launching another grandiose, costly and superfluous campaign of EU self-advertising and propaganda."
"Disregarding such minor details as a monument to the Slovak nationalist and separatist, Stefanik, being deemed an exemplary artefact of the heritage of European Union cooperation, this new initiative, too, will fail to bring people closer to the EU."
"Furthermore, it is unclear that if the European Heritage Label does indeed not intend to duplicate the already existing UNESCO World Heritage List, then why is it intended to be extended to third countries, and which countries does the report have in mind in this regard?"
"Participation of Switzerland in the 'Youth in Action' programme and in the action programme in the field of lifelong learning (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation establishing the terms and conditions for the participation of the Swiss Confederation in the 'Youth in Action' programme and in the action programme in the field of lifelong learning (2007-2013) (12818/2010 - C7-0277/2010 - 2010/0231(NLE))."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that we have the opportunity to lead this debate today because I remember that we both always cooperated with Switzerland in the European Council and are therefore both aware of how important it is for Switzerland to participate in these programmes."
"In 2006, before these programmes were renewed, we, the European Parliament, were naturally aware that we do not exist in isolation, but that we should try to bring everyone else onboard with us."
"Although Switzerland is not part of the European Economic Area, it was interested in participating in the field of training and education."
"Like everyone else, I was very pleased with this development."
"In 2004, I was part of a delegation that visited the Swiss Parliament's Committee on Training."
"We discussed the relevant issues in detail, for example, mobility and cooperation between schools and universities."
"It was clear to me at the time that this motion would eventually be forthcoming and I welcome it now."
"In drawing up these programmes, we were not just thinking of our own interests, but also those of all neighbouring countries, such as the countries of the Western Balkans and Switzerland itself, situated in the middle."
"That is why we have made some good progress today."
"Concerning the previous debate, I can tell you now that Switzerland also intends to issue a request to join in the cultural programme."
"It is also interested in participating in the cultural heritage labelling scheme, something it can only do if it participates in this programme."
"Ladies and gentlemen, what is it that we need to do today?"
"We can either say 'yes' or 'no'."
"None of us would dream of saying 'no' because we have always been in favour of Switzerland coming on board. I should add that by 'coming on board', I mean that it will also pay its share."
"According to Article 218, our only choice is to say 'yes' or 'no', and, of course, we are going to give a clear yes to this."
"What are the key points of this agreement with Switzerland?"
"Naturally, the conditions, rules and procedures for projects and initiatives involving Swiss participants will be the same as for participants from the Member States and the projects they propose."
"Switzerland will have to set up a national agency, just as we all have done in our respective countries, that will coordinate the implementation of the programmes at national level and that will be required to make a financial contribution to each of the programmes each year."
"In 2011, this would amount to EUR 1.7 million for the 'Youth in Action' programme and EUR 14.2 million for the Lifelong Learning programme."
"With reference to the financial controls and audit provisions, Switzerland will be required to adhere to the provisions of the European Union, including those relating to the controls by the institutions of the EU and by the Swiss authorities."
"The agreement will remain in place until one of the parties pulls out."
"However, I do not believe that anyone would enter into a programme like this with the intention of ever withdrawing again."
"It is in the interests of the younger generation in Switzerland and, of course, of the young people from the countries surrounding Switzerland who would like to participate in school exchanges with Switzerland as part of the Comenius-Regio programme, or in individual school partnerships, as well as the Erasmus programme."
"Naturally, representatives from the Swiss authorities will be able to attend our committee meetings on points which concern their country."
"Let me say one thing here: we are anxious that Switzerland should take the plunge with this step."
"It has expressed an interest in such an arrangement for a long time."
"It is our hope that European awareness in Switzerland will be strengthened when the younger generation has an opportunity to interact with other young Europeans."
"Perhaps this will mean that future referenda will have a different outcome from those in the past."
"We are placing our faith in the younger generation and in these two marvellous programmes."
"I am confident that the cultural programme will be added in three years' time."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, according to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the conclusion of this agreement between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation needs the consent of Parliament before the agreement can come into force."
"I want to thank the Committee on Culture and Education, and particularly its chair, Doris Pack, for their constructive approach to the agreement."
"Since Switzerland refused to join the European Economic Area, no agreement, until now, has allowed direct or indirect cooperation in education between the EU and Switzerland."
"However, Switzerland has, for a long time, shown interest in our education and youth programmes."
"It has even developed a national support system to encourage partnerships with EU Member States' organisations active in these programmes."
"Furthermore, Switzerland has participated in the Bologna Process and the creation of the European Higher Education Area."
"Switzerland has also followed closely, albeit from the outside, the debate on education policies in the European Union."
"Switzerland will be the first country to take part in our programmes that is neither an EU Member State nor a member of the European Economic Area, nor a current or potential EU candidate."
"The Commission welcomes the participation of Switzerland in the two programmes."
"The agreement will allow Swiss education and youth organisations, as well as individual students, teachers and young people, to participate in the EU's Youth in Action and Lifelong Learning programmes on completely equal terms with EU citizens."
"Projects and initiatives submitted by participants from Switzerland will be subject to the same conditions, rules and procedures that apply to projects from Member States."
"Switzerland has established a national agency to coordinate implementation of the programmes at national level."
"It will make an annual financial contribution to each of the programmes and will attend programme committee meetings as an observer for the points that concern Switzerland."
"Thank you, honourable Members, for the good work you have done in this case."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, other than the Commission, I should also certainly like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Culture and Education, Mrs Pack, for the work and dedication that she has lavished on this dossier."
"What we are talking about today is important because it is an instrument like 'Youth in Action' that creates the spread of ideas, closeness and friendship amongst the countries of the European Union, but also, and above all, amongst those that are not part of it, such as Switzerland or other countries besides."
"It is the great richness of our multiannual programmes that, through actions such as 'Youth in Action', 'Erasmus', 'Erasmus Mundus', 'Permanent Education', 'Media', 'Media Mundus' and many others, they allow relationships to be built between the countries of the European Union and third countries."
"Through these programmes, you see, we have brought the European Union to life, allowing many citizens - primarily young people - to meet, swap experiences, come to know others and to become known themselves."
"We have given teachers and workers in general the chance to improve their professional skills and we have given directors, producers and associations of various countries the chance to do better work."
"Hence, these programmes are important and so we were a bit concerned when we did not see them on the Commission's Work Programme for next year."
"Today, therefore, today we are approving an important step, which makes the EU grow, strengthens citizenship on our continent, and - given that we spoke about it a little while earlier regarding the European Heritage Label - it is a step that contributes to creating this European identity of ours."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (PL) Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I endorse the rapporteur's draft report on agreeing to the participation of the Confederation of Switzerland in the 'Youth in Action' programme and in the action programme in the field of lifelong learning."
"The agreement has been appropriately negotiated and protects the EU's interests, and the legal bases for European programmes in fields relating to education, training and youth provide for Switzerland's participation."
"The principles governing this participation have been outlined in detail, which guarantees that the programmes will be implemented appropriately and fairly."
"Switzerland is keen to cooperate with the EU in the field of education, training and youth, and so our agreement should be self-evident."
"We are delighted that the EU's education programmes are so attractive and effective that other countries are joining them."
"The latest European Commission research shows that the 'Youth in Action' programme increases young people's linguistic abilities and their chances in the labour market."
"The opportunities for adult education are still not being fully exploited, however, even though there is enormous potential in this area."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, right from the outset, I wish to thank our committee's excellent Chair, Doris Pack, who also drafted this report."
"I might say that when this proposal was in the hands of Doris Pack, it was in good hands."
"As our worthy Commissioner knows very well, Mrs Pack has much professional experience and expertise in these very areas of lifelong learning and youth programmes."
"When preparations were being made regarding this issue, it was a joy to observe how well this work progressed."
"It is excellent that young people in Switzerland are also to share in the success stories that we in the European Union have created."
"It is quite true that even those who take a critical view of the European Union, who are even opposed to it, nevertheless unanimously agree that the European Union does indeed have success stories, such as the programmes that relate to lifelong learning, youth and culture."
"This is one of the best aspects of the European Union, and one which we should do much to ensure remains visible."
"It is because of the European Union and these programmes that we have been able to encourage young Europeans to pursue a path of education and training and to increase their personal capital."
"It has also, however, increased the capital of nations."
"In this connection, it is very important that Switzerland is not in any way excluded from this system of cooperation, even though it is not a member of the EU or the EEA."
"Instead, young people in Switzerland should be given the opportunity to participate in the programmes and things should therefore be taken forward on a reciprocal basis."
"I believe that that will generate added value in all respects."
"Mr President, finally, I wish to thank our rapporteur."
"I hope that this programme will be a success story for the Swiss too, as it has been for us, the citizens of the Member States of the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Culture and Education, where everyone acknowledged that it was a good idea."
"It really is a good idea which should be entirely uncontroversial, since it exemplifies the values we are discussing."
"In fact, this may well be one of those reports to which the Chamber can lend its unanimous support, even if Switzerland's situation is a unique one, as the Commissioner said."
"It is a very interesting country which is very special in political terms, and which engages in very interesting forms of cooperation with Europe while not being party to many European agreements, and for this very reason, it is worth building links with this country by means of uncontroversial and universally accepted programmes of this kind."
"Mr President, even though Switzerland has not yet decided to become a Member State of the European Union, it has long shown a serious interest in broad cooperation with the EU in the area of education and professional training for young people."
"After the establishment of the Youth in Action and Lifelong Learning programmes in 2006, a legal foundation was put in place for cooperation between Switzerland and the EU in this area."
"The European Commission, in accordance with the recommendations of the European Council following talks with Swiss counterparts, has drawn up an agreement making it possible for us to develop effective cooperation with our Swiss friends in the area of education and professional training of young people, as well as in the area of lifelong learning."
"The agreement is correct, balanced and expresses the interests of both signatories to expand mutual cooperation and support the exchange of knowledge and expertise in the interests of improving the quality of the education process."
"In my opinion, Commissioner, this agreement between the EU and Switzerland therefore represents a step in the right direction."
"(LT) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, and I agree entirely with her recommendations on the 'Youth in Action' and Lifelong Learning programmes and the participation of Switzerland in these."
"I would say that Switzerland is not just a beautiful and orderly country; it is of great interest to the European Union due to its direct democracy, the confederation of cantons."
"On the other hand, the European Union must also be of interest to Switzerland, because Switzerland is entirely surrounded by EU Member States."
"Finally, Switzerland is tuning its pulse of life to the European Union."
"I believe that once this programme has been adopted, it will be possible to do this even better."
"Switzerland will come even closer to the European Union, and the EU will understand Switzerland better; as our colleague Doris Pack mentioned, we will be able to anticipate better results in referenda."
"Mr President, I welcome the moves for Switzerland to increase its cooperation with the EU in the fields of education, training and youth."
"The Youth in Action programme is a very important programme for young European citizens."
"It is a programme that needs to be highlighted more, and its aims and objectives need to be realised, in particular, with regard to the European Voluntary Service's activities under the Youth in Action programme."
"Given that next year is the European Year of Volunteering, it is particularly significant that the European Voluntary Service - which supports young people's participation in voluntary activity and aims to develop solidarity and promote active citizenship amongst young people - is strengthened."
"In Ireland, volunteering in grassroots sports organisations offers sporting and leadership opportunities to thousands of young people."
"These organisations encourage active citizenship amongst young people, while promoting health, fitness and an active lifestyle."
"The programme and its voluntary measures should be enhanced and strong links should be forged with Switzerland in this regard."
"There are many possibilities under the Youth in Action programme, and any measures to enhance its aims and to encourage and support young people in the EU should be sustained and strongly encouraged."
"(LT) Mr President, rapporteur, I would like to thank you for your work and say that I really support your recommendation that the European Parliament should approve the Council decision on Switzerland's participation in the 'Youth in Action' and Lifelong Learning programmes, because the Commission's agreement with the Swiss authorities meets all the requirements, provisions and conditions."
"Furthermore, the Swiss National Agency will cooperate on the implementation of the programmes at national level and will contribute financially to each programme on an annual basis."
"This bilateral agreement is very important both for Switzerland itself and the European Union, because the young people of Switzerland will be able to take advantage of various opportunities according to the 'Youth in Action' programme and vice versa."
"The European Union's young citizens will be able to participate in all projects alongside Switzerland's young people."
"I am therefore delighted that although it is not part of the European Economic Area and is not an EU Member State, Switzerland is nevertheless cooperating closely with the European Union in the fields of education, training and youth affairs."
"Mr President, ever since I came to the European Parliament, I keep asking myself why Switzerland and Norway have not joined the European Union, and I wonder if it is because they have the best of both worlds."
"The benefits of being in the European Union without the obligations."
"Here today, I am a bit dubious as well."
"The Commissioner mentioned they will have to pay."
"Of course they will have to pay, but normally non-members pay more than members of clubs."
"However, I will bow to the superior wisdom and experience of Doris Pack in saying that this may be the way forward."
"It may help create greater European awareness among the citizens in Switzerland and they may one day join the European Union."
"If that happens, which I hope it will, I think all the credit will have to go to the Commissioner and Doris Pack for their enlightened approach."
"In this season of goodwill, I am prepared to go along with the proposals."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, European youth is a generation that has been given the privilege to grow up on a peaceful continent almost free of boundaries, which is characterised by mobility and multilingualism, and which also offers a wide range of cultural and economic opportunities."
"In order to ensure that more and more young people engage in active citizenship, we need to establish stable aid schemes in the field of youth policy."
"It is true that Switzerland is not a member of the European Economic Area, but it closely cooperates with the European Union, and it does so not only in the fields of education, training and youth."
"Since 2008, Switzerland has participated in, and financed, several projects that aim to reduce economic and social differences within an extended Europe."
"Switzerland has expressed solidarity with, and commitment to, the enlargement of the European Union, and aims to establish firm economic and political relations with the new Member States."
"I agree with the key points of the agreement on the participation of Switzerland in the programme, which would make it an equal partner ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if this programme is brought to fruition today, it is thanks to the determination of Mrs Pack and the will of Commissioner Vassiliou."
"As an Italian-Swiss citizen, I am happy that Switzerland is the first country from outside the European Union to participate in EU education programmes for young people, both in higher education and continuing skills training."
"Indeed, let us remember that even if Switzerland is not part of the European Union, it has made a major contribution to building the values and freedoms that are a shared heritage of the European continent."
"It is a symptom of the success of programmes such as 'Youth in Action' that Switzerland requests that the mobility of our European programmes be extended to their young people and therefore, it is of significant importance that Switzerland is not only requesting a larger economic area but also a larger educational area."
"I believe that it will be very interesting for the young people of the European Union and Switzerland to get to know each other better, and I am sure that this will lay foundations that will also have an influence on the future of the European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, understandably enough, Switzerland, which provides some of the financial backing for the 'Youth in Action' and Lifelong Learning programmes, now wishes to participate in these programmes."
"However, in the spirit of learning, it would also be good if the EU were to take a leaf out of Switzerland's book when it comes to direct democracy."
"When the Swiss population decides against the erection of minarets, this decision is accepted."
"Likewise, the recent initiative on the deportation of foreign criminals."
"The Swiss authorities are aware that when the people say 'no', they mean 'no', so that they do not simply continue to hold ballots until they get the result they want, as has happened in the EU in the case of Ireland, for example."
"The fact is that the original rejection of the constitutional treaty for Europe at that time may have made it easier for some Swiss to vote in favour of the Schengen and Dublin Agreements."
"They might find it easier to form an alliance with a loose federation of states than with a centralist European Union."
"This is something that cannot be concealed by the voices currently being heard in Switzerland calling for accession to the EU."
"Not everything in the European Union garden is rosy; centralising tendencies are on the rise and developments are moving inexorably in the direction of a transfer union."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to extend my very warm thanks to Mrs Pack and the Commissioner for taking this initiative."
"I think that Switzerland, an enclave surrounded on all sides by EU Member States, does, in fact, need to be open to the programmes."
"I think that young people are not always aware that, since they are not yet part of the European Union, they cannot benefit from this supranational European programme, which provides an excellent way to integrate young people and exchange best practices, and which really does ensure that cooperation and lifelong learning can be truly European."
"I would also, and most importantly, like to offer thanks for the fact that today, we will be able to transfer a model of European programmes to a country which is not a European Union Member State."
"In the same spirit of acceptance and invitation, I would also like to encourage Mrs Pack and the Commissioner maybe to extend similar schemes to include other countries that are willing."
"I am thinking here mainly about the Eastern Partnership and also the Balkans, or, in other words, countries that are not yet formally European Union Member States."
"(DE) Mr President, like everyone else here, I have the feeling that Switzerland may come increasingly closer to Europe in this way, eventually, and hopefully soon, becoming a full member of the European Union, something that is certainly greatly to be welcomed."
"We should be encouraged by this small white spot in the middle of the map of Europe."
"According to our estimates, the 'Youth in Action' programme will reach about one million people."
"The important prevailing aim is that youth organisations should take part."
"This is a signal to the next generation that their active participation is very welcome."
"I would also like to express my appreciation to Mrs Pack for her efforts."
"We need to reach out from the Union to other countries, in this case Switzerland, as this is the only way that we can achieve success."
"Simply waiting for the Swiss to ask to join the European Union will probably not be enough in times like these."
"In addition, we must not forget that financial support for the Committee on Culture and Education in particular gives us reason to hope that Switzerland will also join in other programmes soon."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank everyone for warmly welcoming this initiative."
"It was my pleasure to have signed this act between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation as my first act as Commissioner for Education, Culture and Youth."
"I welcome this development, and I wish Switzerland was also in a position to join us in the culture programme, which they cannot for internal constitutional reasons."
"As many speakers stress, we welcome the creation of closer relations between the youth of Switzerland and the youth of the EU Member States."
"We see it as a means of paving the way for greater support for the European project in Switzerland, which we hope will change its mind in future and decide to join us in the European Union."
"I also take note that honourable Members encourage other non-EU members to join this programme, something which we shall, of course, promote."
"Thank you very much for your support."
"Mr President, I am very pleased to see that some of my fellow Members from the ranks of the Euro-sceptics have voted in favour of this motion, agreeing how wonderful it is that Switzerland is to join this programme and that there will be greater European cooperation on education."
"This will open up horizons perhaps also for the Members themselves, but certainly for the younger generation in Switzerland."
"We are pleased with this."
"Mr Mölzer is no longer here, but I note that he did not mention the fact that Switzerland did not hold a referendum on this cooperation."
"It is indeed remarkable that Switzerland decided against such a step in this area in particular."
"After all, it can be sure that the younger generation has been waiting a long time for the opportunity for such cooperation."
"Mr Mölzer obviously failed to notice that a referendum did not take place in this case."
"The people do not need to be consulted on every single issue."
"Good things, such as accession to the European Union, will be self-evident."
"I hope that the younger generation will benefit from the fruitful cooperation in these education and youth programmes and that they will become real Europeans who, at some stage, will say: 'Now is the time for us also to join the European Union, sharing with the rest of Europe in all other policy areas."
"We are a single continent, and should also agree on these questions'."
"I am certain that these education programmes will play an important role in enhancing European awareness among the people throughout Switzerland."
"Thank you, Mrs Pack, I would like to congratulate you, not only on this report, but also on your hard work and enthusiasm, and also for being in Madrid at the weekend to promote the LUX Prize."
"I am not going to be able to be with you on the 17th, although I would very much have liked to be there."
"On the 18th and 19th, I will be able to participate in the meetings."
"Thank you, the truth is that Parliament needs people like Mrs Pack in order to achieve the effectiveness that we all need."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I find it encouraging that Switzerland wants to participate in the European Union's education and youth programmes, especially as this country is not yet a member of the EU or of the European Economic Area either."
"This involvement in EU programmes is also important from the perspective that we have not had, until now, a direct cultural and education agreement."
"However, Switzerland's participation in the Bologna Process and the creation of the European Higher Education Area guarantee that we can create together the conditions for achieving the 2020 strategy's objectives, establishing in the process a strong link between Member States and third countries."
"Meetings between young people, exchanges of experience between teachers and researchers and increased opportunities for lifelong learning will help us create a common European identity."
"However, I want to stress that we also need to consider including the other countries bordering the EU in our programmes because education and culture should not stop at our borders."
"This will enable us to rebuild the continent of Europe and encourage young people to become actively involved in shaping our common future."
"The participation of Switzerland, a country that chose not to be a part of the European Union, in the 'Youth in Action' programme and in the action programme in the field of lifelong learning cannot be ruled out a priori, but should be carefully evaluated."
"I therefore support the terms of the agreement reached between the Commission and the Swiss Government, so I am voting for the report by Mrs Pack."
"It is right to grant the benefits of the programmes to Switzerland, but it is also right to safeguard all the financial and other interests of the European Union."
"The aim of the Lifelong Learning programme, which is included in the Seventh Framework Programme, is to develop various forms of learning throughout people's professional lives, by supporting cooperation between education and training systems in countries participating in the programme."
"The programme's target group is not only students or secondary school pupils, but also adults, thanks to the Grundtvig programme, and training staff, for whom study visits are provided."
"The year-on-year increase in the budget earmarked for this programme, which amounts to nearly EUR 1.028 billion in 2011, is a sign of the justified need for development and cooperation in this field."
"In a time of such high youth unemployment due to a lack of education adapted to the needs of the labour market, and a lack of appropriate professional training for graduates, we must concentrate on making the maximum possible use of the opportunities afforded to us by the Lifelong Learning programme, and find a solution for such a difficult situation."
"I welcome the initiative to include Switzerland in cooperation in this area."
"I hope that the joint exchange of experience will help raise employment levels and increase the mobility of the labour market."
"Welfare of laying hens (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Paolo De Castro, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the welfare of laying hens - B7-0657/2010)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today represents an important opportunity to discuss the strategic issue of protecting animal welfare in agriculture."
"On 1 January 2012, the terms of Council Directive 1999/74/EC will enter into force, laying down minimum standards for the protection of hens, tantamount to the abolition of conventional battery cages as a system of rearing for the production of eggs."
"This method of animal housing will be banned in favour of systems of rearing that guarantee better animal welfare."
"Mr President, the memory of the Council of the European Union on Agriculture, held on 19 July 1999, is fresh in my mind."
"It was an important day, on which, as the representative of my country (at the time I was the Italian Minister for Agriculture), I contributed to the approval of this important directive by voting for it."
"Now, one year after the irrevocable entry into force of the new legislation, data show that European producers are proceeding to adapt their production system, but not without running into difficulties."
"What we need is a concrete commitment from the Commission to safeguard animal welfare, to protect producers who have adapted their system of rearing to Council Directive 1999/74/EC, and, at the same time, to effectively guarantee the passage of the new legislation, avoiding distortions in terms of market competition."
"This is why my fellow Members and I felt it appropriate to add this important topic to the agenda of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing."
"Hard work over recent months, involving all parliamentary groups, resulted in the oral question of 28 October 2010, which puts three important issues to the Commission:"
"Firstly, to report on the implementation of the new legislation within the Member States;"
"Secondly, the actions to be taken in the Member States to guarantee compliance with the terms of the directive, and compromising where necessary with those undertakings that show a genuine desire to adapt."
"Lastly, measures and guarantees to be adopted to avoid crises in the egg market in the coming years and to prevent unfair competition from third countries that are not obliged to respect the European Union directive within the European internal market."
"These are the queries to which we are awaiting concrete and definitive responses from the Commission."
"Lastly, we ask the Commissioner to guarantee a more transparent market, along the lines of the concept of so-called reciprocity of rules, in order to facilitate the prospect of greater international convergence on the animal welfare standards applied by the European Union."
"Attending to this matter, which we have discussed a number of times in committee since the start of the legislature, is essential to prevent Europe's efforts on animal welfare - our efforts, Commissioner - from being rendered useless by a market that is incapable of recognising the social values that are bound up in foodstuffs."
"We need to reduce the distorting effects of the possibility that producers outside the European rules system could translate the lesser restrictions they are subject to into greater competitive advantages."
"Mr President, adopting the motion for a resolution on the welfare of laying hens, which we will vote on this morning, could represent a first and important step in this direction."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I was asked by Commissioner Dalli to pass on his apologies for not being able to be here in person, but I was pleased to take this question as former Commissioner in charge of animal welfare and health."
"On behalf of the Commission, I would like to underline that the ban on conventional cages which was adopted in 1999 represents an important improvement for animal welfare in the European Union."
"Furthermore, it has stimulated intense debate worldwide."
"I also wish to highlight that Member States are primarily responsible for implementing EU legislation on the protection of laying hens."
"The Commission is making every effort to monitor enforcement in Member States, including through inspections carried out by the Commission's experts, and through the data provided annually by the Member States on the basis of a specific Commission decision related to animal welfare inspections on farms."
"Last month, in November 2010, official data for 2009 on production sites for laying hens were submitted to the Commission by 24 Member States."
"As of today, only 18 Member States have submitted complete data."
"This data shows that 66% of the production sites in those 18 Member States were keeping laying hens with free range systems, 29% with barn systems, 3.5% with conventional cage systems and 1% with enriched cages."
"However, the Commission is aware that important data gaps still exist and that three Member States did not reply at all while six Member States have only provided partial data."
"Therefore, the above picture is far from being complete."
"The Commission is continually asking Member States to complete the missing data on every possible occasion, including in the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and the meetings of the chief veterinary officers."
"Furthermore, the Commission asked Member States by a formal letter to submit their national action plans to implement the ban in order to better analyse the situation across the EU."
"At this stage, the Commission is concentrating its efforts to ensure that Member States take the necessary measures to implement the ban on conventional cages by the legal deadline."
"Member States are responsible for ensuring that eggs not produced in compliance with the directive on the protection of laying hens are not legally marketable according to EU legislation."
"A better picture of the situation will be available next year after the stakeholder meeting."
"The stakeholder meeting will take place in January 2011."
"Today, the import of shell eggs is very limited due to the short shelf life of the product as well as EU food safety requirements."
"According to EU legislation, packs containing eggs imported from third countries where there are not sufficient guarantees as to the equivalency of production standards are to bear the indication of farming method as non-EU standard."
"This label allows imported eggs not produced according to EU welfare requirements to be clearly distinguished."
"The Commission will further examine the situation with all relevant stakeholders, as I said, in a meeting to be held on 19 January 2011 in Brussels, where options to ensure the smooth enforcement of the directive will be discussed."
"Mr President, we are hurtling at breakneck speed towards a situation where millions of eggs will fail to comply with European rules."
"After all, as has been said earlier today, it is expected that 30% of all eggs produced in 2012 will breach the battery cage ban which we agreed in 1999."
"Commissioner, this is merely a matter of simple arithmetic."
"It costs the farmer 8 to 13% more to produce this kind of animal-friendly egg, from hens not confined in battery cages."
"On the other hand, whether we like it or not, the average consumer will still opt for cheap eggs and is prepared to pay only 3 to 4% more for this kind of animal-friendly egg."
"The competitive disadvantage that arises from this situation therefore appears to be very clear."
"The key question is: what are you, the European Commission, going to do to ensure that farmers who are complying properly with the rules and who have invested in alternatives are not penalised in favour of their colleagues who are lagging behind."
"Commissioner, please do not just fob us off with the same old line that Member States are responsible for implementation and checks."
"You are the guardian of the treaties, which is why all our eyes are on you."
"I also find it very unfortunate that we are still discussing data and relying on getting a better picture next year, because it will be too late then!"
"What are we going to do?"
"The pressure must be increased!"
"In our resolution, we are, of course, demanding maintenance of the cage ban, more inspections, that national action plans should ultimately have to be drawn up and an export ban on any eggs which are not produced according to the rules, amongst other things."
"Commission, it is your move!"
"If you do nothing, then not only will bona fide chicken farmers suffer, but so too, I fear, will your credibility and that of all European animal welfare regulations."
"Now, that is a situation that I believe we all want to avoid."
"Mr President, like the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr De Castro, 12 years ago, I, too, had the opportunity, as Minister for Agriculture, to participate in the decision to adopt the legislation that we are discussing here today."
"It was a very long and difficult debate because we were confronted with two contradictory values: establishing conditions for animal welfare and ensuring the sector's competitiveness."
"The solution reached was to favour animal welfare and allow a sufficiently long period for the sector to adapt."
"Although there is still one year until the new regulations come into force, the available data on farms that have not yet adapted are of concern to us, as the Commissioner indeed confirmed."
"We cannot allow companies that have invested and made a great effort to be in a position to comply with this legislation to be penalised or subject to unfair competition."
"I am grateful to the Commissioner for the information that she has provided us with, but we would like to obtain more detailed information on what point each Member State has actually reached."
"We would also like to know what specific procedures the Commission is thinking of following to ensure that companies can, in general, comply with this legislation on 1 January 2012, other than those the Commissioner has mentioned, and if there is actually a framework of penalties with a modicum of uniformity between the various Member States."
"This is the intention of the resolution that we are discussing today, which will, I am sure, be widely supported in Parliament."
"However, my group will be voting against removing, in whole or in part, points F, 8, 9 and 14, which contain wordings and objectives that we doubt are compatible with EU law and that will reduce the resolution's credibility if they remain."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the information at the beginning of this debate."
"Regardless of whether you have the complete picture or not, the hard fact is that, as of 1 January next year, 80 million eggs in the European Union are likely to be produced under illegal cage systems."
"That is going to be a fact."
"We have a 12-month laying cycle."
"There is no way that figure is going to change dramatically by that time."
"I would like to know what I am going to say to the likes of John Campbell of Glenrath Farms and all the producers in the United Kingdom who have spent, on average, GBP 2 million each to comply with the legislation and now incur an extra cost that is between 8 and 10% higher than under a conventional cage system."
"What do I tell our consumers back home, to whom we promised that, by 1 January 2012, there would be no more eggs on the market produced under the old conventional battery cage systems?"
"I know what I want this Parliament and the Commission to say."
"I want to be able to go back and tell them that we are going to take tough action to make sure that the legislation is complied with."
"No derogations and no extensions."
"After all, producers have had ten years to comply."
"I want Member States who are compliant to be able to protect their consumers and their producers by being able to ban imports of illegally produced eggs from those producers and countries which are not compliant."
"I also believe that the Commission should draw up a list, once it has the information, and name and shame those who have failed to comply."
"It is no excuse to say that we were not aware it was coming."
"Ten years is a long time in any business cycle to be able to prepare and invest."
"Commissioner, when you are winding up this debate, I hope you will give us a strong statement saying that you understand the concerns of producers and consumers and a promise of tough action that protects both of them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, your answers have failed to convince me."
"The details provided by the Commission in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development were also far from convincing."
"As Mr Lyon has already stated, this is a problem facing us down the line. From 2012 onwards, 30% of the eggs on the market will be illegal."
"However, we have no idea how to deal with them."
"Apparently, we are to trust states to meet their reporting obligations - permit me to ask why we do not initiate infringement proceedings or at least threaten such action, so as to make it quite clear that, at the end of the day, European law must apply in all Member States and to all farmers?"
"We have built up a very high level of credibility in respect of animal welfare, and this is something we must also defend."
"Citizens rightly expect these standards to be applied."
"The public is very sensitive to animal welfare issues."
"After all, we do provide funding and public support to the farming community because we have more stringent regulations in relation to environmental protection and animal welfare."
"It is not unreasonable to expect something in return from all Member States."
"For this reason, I should like to ask: What is the Commission going to do now?"
"We have already made a demand at committee level."
"We actually need to place a catalogue of measures on the table immediately."
"We cannot accept the possibility of further discussions aimed at extending deadlines."
"It cannot be that we now penalise those who have implemented policy by allowing others to work with transitional deadlines for even longer."
"This will cause farmers to lose faith in the institutions of the European Union."
"You raised a question in relation to labelling."
"What will happen with products that contain liquid egg instead of fresh eggs, for example?"
"How can we label such products?"
"This point must be regulated immediately at the very least."
"It has already been said several times that 10 years is a long time."
"Everyone in the European Union must have known that these deadlines would have to be observed."
"There can be no excuse for Member States, including new Member States, saying: 'Sorry, but we ran out of time."
"Ten years really was not enough'."
"The European Union is in pole position when it comes to animal welfare."
"We can use it to back up our arguments worldwide."
"We can use it in argumentation with consumers, which is why we must implement this consistently if Parliament and the Commission are not to lose credibility in relation to the implementation of European standards."
"For this reason, we are urgently calling on the Commission to take action, rather than wasting even more time risking a situation that will satisfy no one from 1 January 2012 onwards."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, first of all, can I also say I am not totally convinced by what the Commissioner told us today."
"There have been two occasions when officials from the Commission came to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and their performance and what they told us was not only unacceptable, it was abysmal and it was a disgrace."
"Now I have listened to what the Commissioner said and I have listened with tremendous interest to some of the things she did say, but she has not given us anything other than the fact that they are going to meet the stakeholders in January."
"So what are you going to say to the stakeholders in January, Commissioner?"
"What is going to be the outcome of that?"
"We want to know, because you have got to realise that, today, the last hens are already in the conventional cages that have got to meet that deadline."
"They are already there."
"There is normally a 13 to 14-month laying cycle for hens that go into conventional cages."
"Now, you made a comment during your remarks and maybe you will reply or enlarge on it: you said that eggs from outside the EU not meeting equivalent standards would have a different mark."
"What do you mean by that?"
"Will you take on board the point that eggs within the EU produced unlawfully after 1 January 2012 will either have the same stamp, will not be allowed to be exported outside the country in which they are produced or will not be allowed to go onto the market?"
"We have a terrible problem here because, as George Lyon said, there are 83 million eggs - we know that for a fact - which, on 1 January 2012 are going to be illegal."
"Now that is also a terrible plight for us in Europe, where people require eggs to eat."
"So what are we going to do here?"
"I really think we need to know where we are going."
"Will you give us an assurance that you will come back to this House in March with a proper proposal as to what you intend to do - what measures you intend to bring in - to actually control this situation?"
"As has been outlined by others, many producers have already spent millions of pounds in conforming to the standards."
"They cannot now be asked to take further pain by others who are not prepared to do the same."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, the Commission has created a huge crisis in the egg industry."
"Like it or not, 100 million birds will still be in cages on D-day - or should I say E-day?"
"There is neither the cash nor the logistics to prevent this."
"Insisting on the ruthless enforcement of its rules in a year's time from the comfort of an armchair may give the speaker a great feeling of satisfaction, but it could seriously jeopardise the long-term health of the British egg sector."
"Let us look at the practical implications."
"How do you remove and dispose of 100 million hens in 24 hours?"
"Or, how do you safely smash and dispose of 83 million eggs every day?"
"On the assumption that you somehow succeed in either of these, where will consumers turn for their 83 million daily eggs?"
"To Ukraine, to India, to Argentina, to Brazil, where all the eggs will have been laid in battery cages."
"Do any of these countries have a reputation for high welfare standards?"
"Once this trade starts, it will expand very rapidly by virtue of its competitive advantage."
"It will be very difficult to stop."
"It will completely undermine the efforts of colony egg producers in the UK."
"In effect, we will export a large slice of our industry which has just made massive investments to stay compliant with EU rules."
"I believe that an intra-Community trading ban is a complete non-starter."
"Not only will it be impossible to police across open borders, but it could be challenged by the WTO."
"So the least bad solution - and I say 'least bad' - is to allow temporary derogations to non-compliant producers with conditions attached."
"There are some naked images I enjoy looking at, but I do not enjoy the visual image of lorry-loads of naked, unstamped eggs leaving foreign battery cage units en route to the UK in 2012."
"Unstamped eggs are a gift to a fraudulent trader."
"We have learnt this the hard way in the UK."
"Our UK solution is to mechanically stamp eggs with the code numbers that represent their method of production at the laying farm itself."
"This operation is proceeding on my own farm at this very moment, and the machinery is reliable."
"The Commission say it is far too difficult for them to organise the stamping of a special code on non-compliant eggs, despite its obvious necessity."
"Yes, this is, of course, the same Commission that is forcing UK sheep farmers to unnecessarily identify sheep individually with unreliable electronic equipment."
"What a glaring inconsistency."
"The 'least bad' solution - and I use that expression again - is for the EU to insist that non-compliant Member States spend their regional funds on stamping machines and also to pay for an inspectorate whose staff are nationals of compliant Member States."
"This inspectorate will also visit packing stations and build up a database of the processors who use these battery cage eggs in their products."
"Most UK retailers are keen to avoid trading in battery caged eggs after the deadline, but they can only succeed in this if these eggs are properly identified."
"Mr President, this is not just a matter about hens in unsuitable cages, but it is about the ability of the EU to oversee the single market."
"States were given 10 years to comply by 1 January 2012 or the product would be illegal."
"The Germans, Scandinavians, Dutch, British and others have complied, but certain large producers have simply refused."
"This involves massive capital costs and to comply means borrowing money."
"The regulation has put about 15 pence on a dozen eggs."
"Those bandits who do not comply might be given more time and would be clearly rewarded because they would have been given a price advantage."
"Eggs from illegal cages will undercut those who obeyed the EU."
"One producer borrowed GBP 10 million to comply with this directive."
"He did the right thing."
"Is the Commission going to renege and make his eggs uncompetitive?"
"If more time is given, then the moral of this story is that, if the EU makes a directive, it pays to ignore it."
"(ES) Mr President, in January 2012, 400 Spanish egg producers could disappear, which is around 30% of the total number in my country, with the loss of the production of 300 000 tonnes of eggs."
"The European Union could stop producing the 80 million eggs, which amount to 2 million tonnes, and if we do not act very intelligently, the only thing that we would achieve would be that they would be covered by imports from third countries, whose animal welfare standards are much lower than those in the European Union."
"This 1999 directive, which requires that the space in cages for laying hens be increased, demands that we act intelligently and positively, because otherwise, we will only weaken European production and give extra trade opportunities to third countries where the amount of space per bird is much smaller than what we currently have in the European Union."
"This directive requires a great deal of effort from European producers, as in Spain alone, it is understood that the cost is around EUR 600 million."
"It should also not be forgotten that it has an economic impact that extends to the egg products industry and the food industry in general."
"I therefore ask for your support for the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) to paragraph 2, which asks for a solution to be found at least for responsible farms and responsible businesses that are in the process of transforming their farms and will have completed that transformation by January 2012."
"We need to support them in transforming their facilities and give them time to complete that process, thus preventing farms from suffering irreparable damage and preventing an overnight shortage in the EU market, which will consequently increase prices for consumers."
"We need to respect the directive, give the egg and egg products industries a chance and also respect the right to animal welfare and the right of consumers to a reasonable price."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, at this point, I would like once again to point out that a decision has already been made to ban the practice of battery farming in cages."
"The Member States and the egg producers have had plenty of time to implement the directive for the abandonment of conventional battery practices."
"The time has not run out quite yet - there are still twelve months to go before the practice is to be completely banned."
"I believe that we must ensure that battery farming is completely banned by 1 January 2012."
"It must be possible to threaten the Member States who have not succeeded in implementing the directive by then with legal action, such as financial penalties."
"We also need to ensure that eggs which originate from farming practices that do not comply with European law are not sold in the internal European market."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have known for twelve years that battery farming practices would be banned in the EU from 1 January 2012 onwards."
"How can it be that twelve years have not been enough for some Member States to implement this ban in good time and to prepare their poultry industry accordingly?"
"This is just one of many examples of how poor implementation leads to frustration."
"Egg producers in Member States who have implemented the changes in good time are already experiencing competitive anomalies that run counter to the principles of the EU."
"I am calling on the Commission to require that the relevant law should be upheld in all Member States and to do all it can to ensure that it is implemented."
"Eggs should no longer be produced in battery cages after January 2012 and the then illegal eggs should no longer be allowed to reach the shops, putting an end to their negative effect on competition."
"The farmers who have changed their practices to comply with EU requirements should not experience financial disadvantage while those who flout the changeover reap the economic benefits."
"It is impossible to explain to people in Europe why EU law does not apply equally in all Member States and why some Member States are always seen to be dragging their feet."
"The recent crises show where this can lead us."
"We need a Europe that acts in a concerted way, rather than one in which every member can do as it pleases, regardless of the rest."
"Mr President, like many mothers, I want decent animal welfare standards but I also want affordable eggs."
"I am not a poultry expert and my daughter's four attempts to keep pet chickens have all fallen prey to the local fox."
"Therefore, I would rather listen to the professionals - like the farmer, the keeper of 30 000 happy EU-compliant hens, that I visited in my constituency last month."
"In the UK, the pig-farming industry learnt - to its great cost - the mistake of introducing higher animal welfare standards unilaterally."
"The UK's egg farmers put their confidence in the Commission, and have invested hundreds of millions of pounds getting ready for this legislation."
"Public confidence in the EU is at an all-time low."
"You must protect those who have complied, in good faith, with this legislation."
"It is not time to play chicken with the egg farmers."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for the answer, incomplete as it is."
"There are very specific questions raised by the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and they have not been answered fully."
"I would particularly question the figures, and perhaps you might clarify them?"
"Did you say that 66% of production is now free-range?"
"That is not the information I have."
"I dare say that the information you have is therefore selective, and you do need to have a very thorough stakeholders meeting because those are, let me say, very enriched figures."
"They do not at all give the true story of egg production in the European Union."
"Let me also say that if it was easy to comply with this legislation and if our consumers really - and I mean this - really, really wanted welfare-friendly framing systems, they would pay the price for them."
"They want them."
"They do not value them, and they do not want to pay the price for these."
"I have not received one query from a consumer in my time here in the European Parliament since 2004 begging me to have this legislation implemented."
"Remember that, folks."
"That is the fact of the situation."
"Having said that, it is important that this legislation passed by this House is fully implemented and that those who have invested huge amounts of money to be compliant are protected by the European Union."
"I think the Commission knows it will have a legal problem on its hands."
"Let me address the market situation."
"There will be a very visible pile-up of eggs: 83 million of them on 1 January 2012 that are illegal!"
"Morally and ethically, we cannot dump those eggs."
"It would be horrendous if we did, and also the market would suffer and prices to consumers would rise, and there would be protests and revolt."
"The Commission needs to tell us what is going to happen on that day, because it is inevitable these eggs will be on the market and there will be a black market in eggs of some description, so we do need clarity on this."
"Those who are in the transition phase also need to know that there will be no roll-back, because they are confused about the messages they are getting."
"Of all of the issues we debated this week, this is a crucial one for our consumers, but also our producers."
"We need some answers from the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, as you will see, in this House we monitor compliance with legislation, including legislation that has not entered into force."
"If we extended that exercise to other sectors with deadlines still pending, we would have to have 15-day plenary sittings."
"Today, we are discussing a sector that does not receive aid from the common agricultural policy and is suffering due to increased feed prices."
"It is not easy for the sector to cope with additional costs, but it must do so in order to comply with the high production standards that we set in the EU."
"Everything appears to point to the fact that by 1 January 2012, producers in many Member States will not have been able to comply 100% with the deadline set."
"It is calculated that there will be a shortfall of 30% of production in order to cover the needs of the EU market."
"The result is that fresh eggs will be produced here, and they will indeed be more expensive for consumers."
"We will buy eggs for processing elsewhere, and we will close the proportion of EU production that went to that market."
"By then, I hope that we will have had more success in requiring mutuality in our relationships with third countries."
"I will conclude: the legislation will be compulsory from 2012."
"In the meantime, the Commission can enforce other legislation that is in force, such as electronic identification of sheep and goats, which adds value in terms of traceability and good veterinary conditions and also has a direct impact on animal welfare."
"(PL) Mr President, it is quite clear what the resolution under debate is saying - there are to be no exceptions and no derogations."
"The European Commission is to prepare instruments for enforcement and for penalising production that is not adapted to the requirements."
"Unfortunately, nothing follows, either, from the statement in the preamble to the resolution that some producers will have had 12 years to adapt, while others will have had eight and yet others only five."
"I would add that the producers who have been given the shortest length of time to adapt supported the adaptation efforts of their counterparts in the old EU Member States by buying their non-adapted cages, unaware of the problems they were causing for themselves."
"Experts have found evidence to show that demand for table eggs in the European Union will exceed supply after the Laying Hens Directive has been implemented, which, in practice, will mean imports from third countries of eggs produced in cages which are certainly not adapted."
"I therefore call on the Commission to assess the feasibility of maintaining the ban on the use of conventional cages from 1 January 2012 while also finding solutions and clearly defined criteria for those producers who will not complete the modernisation process by 1 January 2012, as referred to in two amendments supported by my group."
"According to its authors, the key argument in favour of adopting this resolution, aside from animal welfare and competitiveness, is the fact that the transitional period for making adaptations was well-known and enshrined in the directive, and that this deadline cannot be changed."
"I hope that the Members who accept this line of reasoning and vote in favour of the resolution will all be just as determined and unanimous when it comes to voting in favour of there being no further transitional period after 2013 for the differentiation of direct payments in the European Union, since a deadline of 2013 was enshrined in the Treaty for this transitional period."
"It is enshrined as such, and I do not think we should change it."
"(HU) Mr President, the debate so far has made it clear that there is a serious conflict of interests between those who have completed the transition to the new system and those who have not yet done so."
"However, there is also a serious conflict between the old and the new Member States."
"I completely agree with Mr Kalinowski in that the old Member States had far more time for the transition, and in fact, they passed on their old, obsolete structures to the new Member States prior to the accession of the latter."
"Even so, it is evident that the rules must be followed, and it is also evident that once again, the European Union is putting its own producers at a competitive disadvantage by specifying stricter rules for them than those it applies to external suppliers for imports."
"Not only does it require these rules to be observed, but also quite often fails to control them effectively."
"Therefore, I believe that the European Commission is about to take another decision which will put EU producers at a disadvantage in relation to external markets."
"(EL) Mr President, I fully acknowledge the need to safeguard equal terms of competition within the Union, for the benefit of producers who have complied with the enhanced requirements imposed by the directive."
"At the same time, however, we must support producers who undertake to comply, but who are unable to afford the high cost of adapting by the deadline set."
"Provision has been made so that products not produced in accordance with the legislation cannot be legally marketed and traded within the Community from 1 January 2012."
"At the same time, however, products produced to lower animal welfare standards will continue to be imported from third countries."
"In other words, when numerous farms in the Union are in danger of going out of business, due to enhanced animal welfare standards, products will be imported from third countries that do not even meet the specifications which apply in the Union today."
"Yes, we must protect animal welfare, we must safeguard the proper treatment of animals, but we must also protect the European social and productive fabric."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, although all European producers should respect Community legislation and make the necessary adjustments in time, it is estimated that 30% of egg producers will not have made them by 1 January 2012."
"Unfortunately, this state of affairs shows us that the European Commission has failed to convince producers that it is to their advantage and a policy that has failed to persuade the directly interested parties to defend it will have difficulty succeeding, whatever the policing measures imposed."
"We believe that an integrated approach, which links the cost of the investment with the benefit to both the producer and the consumer from the use of enriched cages, would do more to convince producers to adopt the measure and, of course, such an approach would safeguard the distinct difference of European products, based on quality, safety and animal welfare standards, and protect them against unfair competition on unequal terms from third countries, which is exactly what we fear will happen."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of animal welfare is one that this House has tackled many times and I believe that Parliament, together with the Commission and the Council, has made a considered and balanced decision."
"I do not think we can backtrack on this."
"We therefore have the duty to look for the best ways to apply this measure and, in this case, we must structure it with a view to responsibility and enforce it in a responsible way with regard to all those operators who are adapting their production process."
"It is clear that we shall not be able to postpone this date and allow an additional period of time for the transition to a responsible system of animal welfare."
"It is incumbent upon us to think about all those people who have begun the transformation process and are carrying it out during a time of crisis and investment difficulties."
"Therefore, I should like to emphasise the issue of the transition phase to you, which takes into consideration all those farmers who have begun the adjustment process in order to take account of animal welfare, but who have not yet completed it."
"At such a difficult time of crisis therefore, I believe that particular attention should also be paid to these producers."
"(RO) Mr President, I do not think either that it is fair for us to talk in general about a 10-year period which Member States would have had available."
"Romania and Bulgaria, for example, joined the European Union only three years ago, but rules are rules and they must be observed by everyone."
"However, I want to urge fellow Members to vote for Amendment 2, tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"There is a large number of producers who have already started making investments to modernise their rearing systems or who are about to initiate such investments."
"However, these investments cannot be made overnight and it would be unfair for the producers in question to be penalised."
"I want to emphasise once again that it only concerns those producers who have started modifying their rearing systems, and the amendment refers to compliance with certain clearly defined conditions."
"Mr President, United Kingdom producers have been investing substantial sums of money - pushing up their production costs - in preparing for the implementation of this directive because they know that Britain will implement the law."
"Why should they have to face unfair competition from countries that fail to implement the law or possibly are granted exemption or delayed enforcement?"
"The measure has been drafted with the barest minimum of enforcement, left to the precious care of greatly varying standards in 27 Member States."
"The language is hardly suggestive of uniformly severe enforcement."
"Words like 'proportionate' and 'dissuasive' have been used."
"I am not in favour of the EU passing laws on behalf of Member States at all."
"However, if such laws are passed, it is not acceptable for some countries to be forced to comply and others granted effective exemption."
"Will the Commission ensure that countries that fail to comply will be prevented from exporting eggs to countries that do comply, or at least that eggs from non-complying units will not be exported?"
"Our producers are demanding protection from unfair competition."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the subject being debated here today, allow me to start by reiterating that I believe, firstly, that directives should actually be complied with and that this is equally true for Directive 1999/74/EC, and, secondly, that concerns over animal welfare is a flagship issue that the European Union should uphold."
"That said, it is important to stress that adapting to the directive is quite burdensome for the sector's companies: 30% per hen in Portugal."
"Moreover, there is no specific support from the Rural Development programme for this purpose."
"As a result of the lack of capital in this sector, limited bank credit and the crisis in general, it is imperative and urgent to acknowledge that the adaptation of many companies has been delayed."
"It is therefore important to allow extra time for those companies - and only those companies - that have already started to adapt as required."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, none of us wishes to cast doubt on the need to implement a directive that dates back to 1999, as the credibility of this institution is at stake, and none of us wishes to cast doubt on the need to protect the wellbeing and health of animals."
"However, directives also need to be based on good sense, so today in this House, I should like to make a few good-sense observations."
"Firstly, between 1999 and today, there has been a deep economic crisis that has hobbled businesses, industry and consumption, so many businesses have not been able to make the adjustments."
"Should we not take that into account?"
"Secondly, rigorous application of the directive from 1 January 2012 would remove many businesses from the market, paving the way for the import of eggs produced using methods that are much less protective of the animals than those required and practised in the European Union, or to the relocation of European production facilities to outside the European Union."
"If this is what we want at a time of crisis - to favour a drop in employment and an increase in imports of eggs produced outside Europe, under different criteria than those imposed on our producers - then I think that we shall commit an injustice."
"We worked a great deal on the idea of a substantial transition phase and I feel that I support it."
"Commissioner, I am asking you to guarantee it as well."
"Mr President, as many colleagues across this Chamber have said, protecting producers who have complied with this legislation and spent vast amounts of money is absolutely right and is the duty of the Commission at this stage."
"However, I do feel that there is something the Commission needs to realise."
"I have spoken to many of my own farmers who find it difficult to find the money to invest in difficult financial and economic circumstances."
"I am interested in the reference to the marking or stamping of eggs."
"I have a recent letter from the Commission which actually indicates that an additional mark would have little or no benefit because the Commission did not believe that consumers would actually differentiate."
"Therefore, I would ask the Commission to indicate to us whether it has changed its mind on this issue or whether it simply does not know?"
"Again, I would ask the Commission to indicate if it intends to go down the route of an intra-EU trade ban."
"I have companies in my constituency which rely on the import of eggs from other European countries."
"Are they simply going to force these companies to rely on third-country imports?"
"Most certainly, the eggs there will have been produced under much less stringent welfare systems."
"(PL) Mr President, there can be no debate about the fact that farmers must adapt to the 1999 directive."
"We understand those farmers who have already invested money in modernising cages."
"We are not talking about giving more time to some farmers than others, as one of the previous speakers said, but about giving the same amount of time to everyone to meet the requirements made of them and to ensure that the standards are met."
"The terms 'illegal production' and 'consumer care' have a very nice ring to them, but I would like to know why we do not show the same determination in protecting consumers against the consumption of imported eggs produced in conditions which do not meet the requirements introduced in the EU."
"I always try to understand the situation of different groups of farmers in the individual countries, and I am in favour of solutions that help them, since I know that as a group, they are in an exceptionally difficult situation in terms of revenue."
"It is a shame that others in this House do not share the same view."
"(DE) Mr President, it must be clear to us all that the health of our animals and, by association, human health must be our prime concern."
"In the Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) scientific committee, where we carry out technology options assessments, we also have the 'Better Life' project, which looks at ways of improving future conditions in the area of nutrition and feedstuffs."
"For this reason, particularly in the context of the Eighth Framework Research Programme, I would ask the Commissioner to work to ensure that the research programmes in the areas of foodstuffs/feedstuffs are strengthened, so that there is an improvement in research into the safety of foodstuffs and the health of animals and humans in this area and so that we can prepare the appropriate documents here for the citizens of Europe in the future."
"Mr President, thank you for your indulgence."
"I wanted to mention two other points in my contribution."
"The issue of eggs in shell is quite visible and clear."
"There is, however, a massive market for processed eggs for the confectionery sector and we need to know what sort of labelling requirements there will be for that product."
"I think this is where we have the greatest concerns because more and more eggs are going into the processing sector, and my fear is that we will export our cages from the European Union and then import liquid-egg and dried-egg products from those very systems in third countries."
"I see you nodding in agreement."
"This is a very real problem for the European Union."
"My other concern relates to parallel production systems and a huge problem in the marketplace if we have enriched cages coming into production while the current systems remain in production."
"That could cause major problems for producers and, ultimately, for consumers."
"So the Commission has a huge balancing act to get this right."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it is obvious that there is no consensus on this issue."
"I have heard Members here pleading for no exemptions and no derogations and, on the other hand, I have heard Members pleading for an extension."
"It depends on which country they come from and on the stage of development in each particular Member State."
"Let me underline the Commission position."
"I want to repeat that, as of January 2012, conventional cages must be replaced by enriched cages or alternative systems."
"Therefore, eggs from conventional cages will not be legally marketable after January 2012."
"This is our position."
"The Commission is making every effort, and we are concentrating on our efforts, to support Member States in complying with this directive."
"What are we doing?"
"First of all, we are encouraging Member States to develop and complete national plans, in collaboration with the industry and major stakeholders, and we are receiving national plans which also incorporate sanctions for those industries, or those farmers, who are not in compliance with the directive."
"Secondly, we are exchanging information with Member States on good monitoring practices for reporting on progress with enforcement."
"We are organising visits by Commission experts to see that the directive is being implemented, and we are organising appropriate meetings with stakeholders."
"As I said, on 19 January 2011, we have a big stakeholders' meeting at which representatives of the Member States will discuss the current state of play, and we will see how best we can support Member States who are not in compliance, so that they can complete their compliance by the end of 2011."
"This is our position."
"After January 2012, if there are still eggs which are not legally produced, those eggs cannot be marketed, and if non-compliance is demonstrated, the Commission could, of course, undertake all the measures available under the current legal framework - initiating infringement procedures in order to ensure proper enforcement of EU legislation."
"Alternatives to infringement procedures are also being studied, with a view to preventing the possible illegal circulation of eggs produced in conventional cages after January 2012."
"Honourable Members made many other comments and I will make sure I convey all your concerns to Commissioner Dalli who, I am sure, will take serious account of your comments."
"Mr President, I know it is quite unorthodox to take the floor after the Commissioner has spoken."
"I am very happy with what the Commissioner has said."
"However, the conclusion that we are divided in this House on this issue is not justified."
"I would respectfully ask the Commissioner to look at the result of the final vote before judging whether this House is divided on this issue or not."
"I have received four motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Mr President, can I first of all support what Esther has just said."
"Can I also ask the Commissioner that if she cannot speak today, she would maybe let us have a statement in writing, because I do not believe this House is divided for one moment."
"Could she elaborate more on what she said on eggs from outside the European Union that do not meet equivalent standards to EU standards not being allowed in and having a separate mark."
"What mark does she propose for those eggs in the EU that are not allowed to carry a legal mark after 1 January 2012?"
"Mr Nicholson, I am sorry, it was not a point of order."
"As I said, the debate is closed."
"You had the opportunity to raise your concerns before we closed the debate."
"(DE) Mr President, I simply wanted to thank the House services because we have finished in an exemplary fashion today fifteen minutes before the vote, so that chaos will be avoided in the plenary sitting."
"This orderly procedure sends out the right signals to the public."
"I should like to express my particular gratitude to the House services."
"If only things were always like this."
"Thank you very much."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11:40 and resumed at 12:00)"
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Council Directive 1999/74/EC lays down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens under various systems of rearing with the added objective of protecting against unfair competition among producers in the different Member States."
"Although I support the principles of this directive, it must not be taken lightly that, as things stand, a great many European producers - having begun the process of converting their facilities - have run into real problems in completing the transformation and risk not being ready before 1 January 2012, the final deadline for complying with the directive."
"If we also bear in mind the real difficulties faced by many producers in obtaining financing to support conversion processes and the serious economic difficulties that they are still having to deal with today - with serious repercussions on the stability of their businesses and employment levels - I am convinced that something has to be done."
"Member States should intervene to promote measures that can help European producers in the poultry farming sector who, aiming to adapt to the new European legislation, have embarked on the process of converting their facilities but are very unlikely to complete it before the start of 2012."
"Support for strengthening the European Union ban on shark finning - Increased European Union support for grassroots sports - An EU homelessness strategy (Written declarations)"
"Written declarations 0071/2010, 0062/2010 and 0061/2010 have been signed by a majority of the Members in this Parliament and therefore, pursuant to Rule 123(3) and (4) of the Rules of Procedure, they will be forwarded to their addressees and published in the adopted texts of this session, together with the signatories' names."
"Madam President, on behalf of my co-signatories, Ivo Belet, Hannu Takkula, Mary Honeyball and Joanna Senyszyn, I thank all the Members for signing this declaration."
"It was significant that almost 50% of the signatories were women, so I would like to thank them very much for their cooperation and also pay particular tribute to Joanna Senyszyn."
"She did stalwart work and she might like to say a few words as well."
"So to everybody, I thank you and wish you all fun and games and lots of sport for Christmas."
"The next item is Written Declaration No 61/2010."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with some emotion and on behalf of my fellow Members, Mrs Thomsen, Mrs Lynne, Mrs Figueiredo and Mr Protasiewicz, that I would like to express my sincere thanks for your support of Written Declaration 61/2010 on an EU homelessness strategy."
"While today, the European Commission is presenting its flagship initiative - a European Platform against Poverty and Exclusion - this declaration sends a strong message from Parliament to the European Commission and Member States."
"The time for talking is over."
"It is now time to act."
"Specific proposals can now be implemented."
"Let us make sure that we have put an end to rough sleeping by 2015."
"I wish you all a happy holiday and I believe we will get off to a good start next year."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Besset has requested the floor."
"Please go ahead."
"(FR) Madam President, on behalf of my three fellow Members, Mrs Pietikäinen, Mrs Sârbu and Mr Davies, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the 410 Members of the European Parliament who signed Written Declaration 71/2010 on support for strengthening the European Union ban on shark finning, which we tabled."
"Indeed, this fragile species, like many others, is subjected to a veritable massacring at sea as a result of finning practices and the discarding of carcasses at sea following that mutilation."
"Thank you for having overwhelmingly signed this Written Declaration."
"It sends a strong signal to the Commission to bring about the strengthening of regulations to protect this species."

"Oral explanations of vote"
"(FI) Madam President, I would just like to say that I voted for this excellent report."
"Mrs Paliadeli has done a splendid job in building the European cultural heritage and its very own label."
"In my opinion, this is one excellent indication of how, ultimately, we can achieve special added value in the European Union at little expense."
"I believe that the sites that will receive the European Heritage Label will definitely benefit from it."
"It will be visible in the number of tourists they receive and it will help to make Europe better known."
"It is very important that we remember that Europe is united in its diversity, and it is important for us to ensure that the people of the different countries of Europe can discover the mosaiclike European identity on a wider basis."
"That is what I wanted to say, Madam President."
"When people here are leaving the House, it is a little difficult to concentrate, but I hope they will have listened to what I had to say."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Heritage Label is of fundamental importance for a continent that contains the majority of UNESCO sites, and it finally highlights the natural, archaeological, urban and cultural sites that have had an important role in the history, culture and integration of the European Union."
"Approval of the label is an important step for the process of EU cohesion and is also educational and formative for cultural dialogue."
"One can also see how this decision is a good omen for future generations, who increasingly will have a shared vision of European heritage, which can bring them together historically and culturally."
"As I thank the rapporteur for her efforts, I should like to offer her my heartfelt congratulations for the negotiations carried out with the Commission for a successful outcome to this initiative, which is so important for the future of the preservation of European culture."
"(FI) Madam President, I wish to say that the Lifelong Learning programme is one of Europe's success stories, and Mrs Pack should be thanked for her excellent work."
"I voted for this report, and I was especially delighted that those who are vigorously opposed to European integration can also see that projects like the Lifelong Learning programme are needed."
"It is very important that this programme can be extended outwards, and now Switzerland is to participate."
"Moreover, this will not cost us taxpayers in the European Union anything, as Switzerland is itself paying for its involvement."
"It is important that these best practices and best programmes that exist in the European Union are extended in this way."
"The Lifelong Learning programme and the Youth in Action programme are good examples."
"In this connection, I also want to welcome Switzerland to the European youth and culture programmes."
"Madam President, I would like to put one question to the House."
"Why is Switzerland doing so well?"
"You would have thought that a country particularly exposed to the financial sector would have suffered unusually during the recent banking crisis, but the Helvetic Confederation in 2009 had a GDP per head 214% of that of the EU."
"Its people are twice as rich as the citizens of the Member States."
"In part, of course, that reflects the deal that the Swiss have struck with Brussels."
"They are in the free market, they are covered by the free movement of goods and services and so on, but they are outside the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy, they control their own borders, they settle all their own human rights issues, they pay only a token contribution to the budget and they are free to sign accords with third countries in commercial areas."
"What a great model for Britain!"
"If seven million Swiss relying on bilateral free-trade agreements can give their people the highest standard of living on the continent, how much more so could we, a nation of 60 million, a trading maritime nation whose colonising and enterprising energies have touched every continent?"
"And we should not leave it at our relations with Brussels!"
"Having got the power back, we should copy the Swiss in their system of localism and direct democracy and push powers down to the lowest practicable level."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I abstained from today's vote on this report on comitology because once again, people are trying to make anti-dumping procedures inapplicable or linked to discretionary political choices which, as we know, are still one of the few worthwhile defensive instruments to prevent unfair competition."
"Even though Mr Szájer found a compromise with the Council, it really must be underlined that this proposal was unable to align commercial policy with comitology procedures, particularly in the part relating to trade policies, which damages European businesses at a time of serious crisis, creating fresh unemployment and a new wave of relocations."
"Without suitable rules against counterfeiting, there is no point talking about measures to relaunch the European economy."
"Madam President, I am going to put this as simply as I can."
"Irish taxpayers and EU taxpayers are being gouged in order to prop up the European banking system and the single currency."
"Yesterday, the House of Commons in my country voted through a bilateral loans package to Ireland which was supported, I think, by sincere and generous MPs thinking that they were helping a friendly country."
"But you do not help an indebted friend by pressing more loans on him at a ruinous rate of interest."
"Ireland has been ruined by the single currency."
"Between 1998 and 2007, it had real interest rates of -1%."
"Every Irish economist could see the crash coming but there was nothing they could do about it because there were no longer any Irish interest rates."
"There were no rates to be raised."
"Now, when the crash comes, it is worsened by the inability to devalue."
"A nation is being condemned possibly to a generation of deflation, debt and emigration so that we can keep this project of ours alive."
"Instead of helping to bail out the euro in Ireland, we should be helping Ireland to bail out of the euro and to re-establish its own currency, possibly with a temporary link to sterling, allowing it to pay off its loans and to re-establish itself as an independent and prosperous state."
"(RO) Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Andrikienfor her efforts in drafting this report."
"I would also like to say that I voted for Amendment 25 in its entirety as I feel that the climate of impunity in Russia is extremely dangerous."
"The European Union's intention is to defend on the international stage the same principles which also guide it internally, namely, democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"In any case, it is perfectly clear that numerous human rights activists have been killed in recent years, which raises a question mark over the development of genuine democracy in Russia."
"The message we wanted to convey to the Russian authorities via Amendment 25 is the urgent need to investigate the death of Sergey Magnitsky."
"The response from the authorities in Moscow to this initiative actually shows that the Russians are listening to the messages from the European Parliament."
"This is yet another reason for us to condemn vociferously the lack of any investigation into this case."
"We call on the Council to monitor this matter closely and to take the necessary measures, failing any progress."
"(PL) Madam President, the European Union stands up for the weakest members of society and those who suffer discrimination, and helps the poorest and those who are in need."
"We award the Sakharov Prize to recipients from around the world."
"However, the European Union frequently fails to enforce respect for human rights within its own territory."
"I would like to draw your attention to the continuing problem of discrimination against minorities, including the Polish minority in Lithuania, an EU Member State which is a signatory to international agreements and treaties on the protection of human rights and minorities."
"The Lithuanian Parliament was to take a decision today on whether to limit opportunities to receive education in a minority language."
"It has postponed the decision to the near future."
"Once again, I call on the Members of the European Parliament, the President of Parliament and the European Commission to ensure that observance of the principles of democracy and respect for the rights of minorities is enforced effectively in the EU Member States."
"Limits placed on the number of hours of mother-tongue instruction in schools and measures aimed at closing Polish schools in Lithuania are nothing other than discrimination against a national minority."
"Madam President, I also supported Amendment No 25, especially the second part where the European Parliament suggests considering 'imposing an EU entry ban for Russian officials involved in this case, and encourages EU law enforcement agencies to cooperate in freezing bank accounts and other assets of these Russian officials in all EU Member States'."
"I think that this is an absolutely crucial issue for both Russia and the European Union, and I strongly encourage the Commission and the Council to follow the advice of the European Parliament."
"The powers of the European Parliament have recently been increased."
"It is now time to stop declaring and act instead, causing real pain and trouble to those responsible for human rights offences."
"I think Russian and European Union cooperation can only have real prospects if a transparent solution is found to the Magnitsky and Khodorkovsky cases and those responsible are punished."
"(FI) Madam President, I voted for Mrs Andrikienė's report."
"I think that it is very important that we speak about human rights issues and bring them to the foreground."
"This lies at the heart of the European Union."
"We must also ensure that we practise what we preach."
"This is perhaps something of a problem."
"Of course, we have a lot of resolutions, but the challenge is how to live up to them."
"It all starts with practical realities."
"Perhaps I should have had the floor to raise a point of order on the matter regarding Mr Arlacchi's report."
"There were a good 50 on that side of the Chamber who stood up."
"My colleagues and I counted them."
"We found out that there were fewer than 40 of them, so no action resulted."
"If we treat some people in this way in this Chamber, people whose opinions are perhaps contrary to our own or those of the majority, there is no real justification on our part for criticising countries where there is a democratic deficit."
"We in the European Union have to be very careful to ensure that all the work we do here is in accordance with the law, EU regulations and all the legal provisions on human rights."
"That is why I believe that there is room for improvement here, so that we can be credible when we explain these issues to Russia and the rest of the world."
"We must ourselves ensure that we are not discriminating against any one minority."
"Everyone who works in the European Union must have the opportunity to enjoy full human rights."
"(NL) Madam President, in this debate, Parliament is once again following an all too familiar course."
"American NATO troops make a mess in Afghanistan and the European Union then has to step in as guardian angel and take the initiative on the issue."
"What is then the standard reaction of many in this House: if the EU did just a little bit more, then everything would be fine again!"
"President, this line of thinking gets one stage worse, if you read paragraph 63 of the report which recommends the involvement of Iran in helping to bring about a solution to the problems in Afghanistan."
"Madam President, I had to read this three times just to make sure I had not imagined it, but it really is there: 'recommends the involvement of Iran'!"
"I have rarely come across a proposal as strange as this."
"This is tantamount to using Beelzebub to exorcise the devil."
"I have therefore voted emphatically against this report."
"Madam President, I had the honour of visiting Afghanistan earlier this year with British forces."
"I met not only our own servicemen, but soldiers from Estonia and Denmark who are sharing their camp."
"I would like to begin by saying that I cannot adequately express my gratitude to the men and women from various of our Member States, as well as our allies overseas, who are pouring their energies into trying to bring peace to that unhappy, if beautiful, land."
"I would just like to say one thing about this report."
"We seem to be making one error as a Western alliance, which has to do with our policy of eradication of poppy."
"Members here who represent rural constituencies will know that there is no one on earth more conservative than the small farmer, but by our policy of razing poppy crops in Afghanistan, we have taken a population that used to have a strong interest in order and property and turned them into badmashes, into brigands, because of our policy of destroying a crop for which there is a market: there is a worldwide shortage of opiates and morphines."
"If we could only restore property rights, we would begin to give Afghanistan the basis of a flourishing civil society with an independent magistracy and, in due course, representative government."
"Madam President, I voted against the resolution establishing a permanent crisis mechanism for the eurozone, because in Ireland and Greece, we see the reality that such mechanisms are to bail out a crisis-ridden financial system dominated by speculators and assorted profit-seeking sharks at the expense of working people, pensioners and the poor."
"Today in Brussels, the European Council will most likely decide to amend the Lisbon Treaty to give itself more powers to impose strict conditionality on any financial assistance given to Member States, thus institutionalising the doctrine that society must pay for the crisis."
"I warn the Irish Government not to think it can foist this change to the Lisbon Treaty on the Irish people without a referendum."
"The Irish Government has already turned our country into a vassal state of the IMF, which is acting blatantly on behalf of the speculators and the financial markets."
"We demand a referendum on any change to the Lisbon Treaty so the Irish people will have the opportunity to resist being turned into full-time serfs of the financial markets."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I voted for the Commission proposal to expand the original concept of the European Heritage Label from an intergovernmental action to a formal EU action as a contribution to a stronger European identity."
"I voted in this way because I believe that the proposed purpose of this label should not be just the goal of promoting the internal cohesion of the European Union but also of demonstrating European unity and values outside its borders."
"The label should be evaluated and put into practice following effective demonstration of the results within the EU."
"I voted for this resolution on the Commission's proposal to use the European Heritage Label as a tool, among other more efficient ways, to fill in the gap between the European Union and its citizens, as a way to stress that European history is the result of the diverse, yet rich and complementary, common cultural heritage."
"I agree that the decision of the Member States to place the European Heritage Label within the framework of the EU will not only help increase its visibility, prestige and credibility, but will contribute to achieving long-sought ideals of cohesion and solidarity among European citizens."
"I support the rapporteur's position that, owing to the symbolic value of the label as a contributory vehicle towards European integration, transnational sites should be favoured since they promote commonalities; they promote networking and encourage cooperation and collaboration between States or regions."
"I believe that the idea of a European Union Heritage Label that aims to increase European citizens' sense of sharing a common heritage (through knowledge of history and participation in activities that promote intercultural dialogue) and envisioning the building of the EU as a long and ongoing process is a step in this direction."
"In 2007, several European Union Member States came together to create a European Heritage Label."
"That initiative was intended to 'strengthen the support of Europeans for a common European identity and to promote a sense of belonging in a common cultural space' by selecting a certain number of special sites across the continent."
"In 2008, the Council of the European Union presented the Commission with its conclusions, inviting the Commission to submit a legislative proposal that would enable us, as was the case with the European Capitals of Culture initiative, to turn this intergovernmental initiative into a real European Union label."
"Following the Council's suggestions, the Commission then instigated an impact assessment and public consultation."
"After that consultation, the Commission issued a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Union action for the European Heritage Label."
"That is the text I supported."
"I voted for this report because European history is the result of the diverse, yet rich and complementary, common cultural heritage."
"This demonstrates once again that the EU is rooted in strong values such as freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, cultural diversity, tolerance and solidarity."
"Owing to the widely recognised contribution of European culture to the world, the European Parliament approves of the idea of a label which would extend beyond the borders of the European Union and which could be used as an ambitious tool serving external policies."
"In order to achieve its political goal, the new European Heritage Label should focus on the symbolism and/or educational value of heritage sites."
"Furthermore, it should insist on close cooperation among the labelled sites so as to share best practices and initiate common projects."
"I would like to stress that the decision of the Member States to place the European Heritage Label within the framework of the EU will not only help increase its visibility, prestige and credibility, but will contribute to achieving long-sought ideals of cohesion and solidarity among European citizens."
"One of the things Europe is very rich in is cultural diversity, which is perfectly reflected in the diversity of its cultural, artistic, architectural and linguistic heritage."
"It is this diversity, along with a rich history and a great respect for heritage and its preservation, that makes Europe a unique place."
"However, although we all share a very rich and comparatively small area, the truth is that, in many cases, we are not very close to or interested in each other."
"I therefore think that this initiative could lead to closer ties between European citizens and increase knowledge of European heritage and the common values that we all share, making Europe a truly diverse union."
"In general, the amendments proposed by the rapporteur have improved the Commission's initial draft."
"However, there are also some negative aspects."
"Regarding the promotion of multilingualism, the amendments proposed by the rapporteur do not touch on the central issue and therefore fail to correct the serious flaw in the original proposal."
"Indeed, real and effective promotion of multilingualism is achieved, not 'by using several languages of the Union', but rather by using the various languages of the Union."
"However, what is more important than the report's specific objectives are the misconceptions underlying this concept."
"The European Heritage Label (or European Union Heritage Label) is based on developing the fallacy of a single European identity and a single European culture based on values such as freedom, democracy, etc."
"There is no single 'European cultural heritage'."
"Europe's entire cultural history, like its entire history overall, is not just built on diversity and admirable creative and progressive energy, but also on violent, antagonistic conflicts, on intolerance, and on multiple strands and contexts of cultural domination."
"The field of heritage is particularly sensitive because of its intimate association with history, which is cause for serious concern that this will feed into the worrying processes of rewriting history that we have been witnessing recently."
"The image of the European Union and its institutions in the eyes of its citizens is a matter of vital importance."
"Unfortunately, poll results show that a sense of European identity and unity is becoming increasingly rare among the European public, and the situation is the same for trust in the EU institutions."
"Promoting knowledge of our common history and common cultural roots may be particularly helpful in the process of bringing the EU closer to its citizens, and also in building a sense of cohesion and solidarity between them."
"The new European Heritage Label may be helpful in just this respect."
"Streamlining procedures and standardising the criteria for awarding the label will make it more prestigious and improve the EU's image, as well as increasing its citizens' trust in institutions such as the European Parliament."
"Today, I voted in favour of the report on a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Union action for the European Heritage Label."
"I believe that this is an interesting and valuable initiative which will help promote European culture and achievements and contribute to the development of tourism and individual regions."
"It is to be welcomed that we have emphasised, as Parliament, that the European Heritage Label will act as a complement to other cultural heritage initiatives, such as the UNESCO World Heritage List and the Council of Europe's Cultural Routes, and not duplicate these initiatives."
"in writing. - I welcome the Commission's proposal to use the European Heritage Label as a tool, among other more efficient methods, for bridging the gap between the European Union and its citizens; as a way of stressing that European history is the result of the diverse, yet rich and complementary, common cultural heritage; and as a means of appreciating that the EU is rooted in strong values such as freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, cultural diversity, tolerance and solidarity."
"The Member States' decision to place the European Heritage Label within the framework of the EU will not only help to increase its visibility, prestige and credibility, but will also contribute to realising long-sought ideals of cohesion and solidarity among European citizens."
"We are cheered by the Commission's proposal to use the European Heritage Label, together with other initiatives, as a tool to bridge the gap between the European Union and its citizens; as a way to stress that European history is the result of a diverse, yet rich and complementary, common cultural heritage."
"It represents an appreciation that the EU is rooted in strong values such as freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, cultural diversity, tolerance and solidarity."
"The decision of the Member States to place the European Heritage Label within the framework of the EU will not only help increase its visibility, prestige and credibility, but will contribute to finally achieving, on a large scale, the long-sought ideals of cohesion and solidarity among European citizens, creating a common European identity and increasing their interest in the Union and its origins - two fundamental challenges for the European institutions."
"The new label must, however, focus on symbolism and educational value, rather than on the beauty of a site, and must insist on close cooperation among the labelled sites so as to share best practices and initiate common research and development projects."
"Alongside other initiatives, the European Heritage Label is a additional way of bringing the European Union closer to its citizens and strengthening their sense of belonging to Europe."
"It will also enable us to further their understanding of the common history and heritage of Europe."
"The label will help encourage multilingualism and dialogue between cultures, and will support the establishment of networks aimed at promoting European heritage."
"It will stimulate economic attractiveness, particularly through cultural tourism."
"By supporting this label, we will improve multicultural dialogue."
"It seems to me that the effectiveness of the European Heritage Label is open to question precisely because Member States can decide for themselves whether or not to participate in the scheme."
"In addition - and here I agree with the rapporteur - the proposed selection criteria and the large number of sites that could acquire the label mean that quality and prestige could be lost."
"Close cooperation with existing initiatives in the area of cultural heritage, such as UNESCO World Cultural Heritage, may be a more effective approach."
"I did not vote in favour of the report because it does not deal in sufficient detail with the need to introduce a cultural heritage label based on the specified objectives."
"The decision to place the European Heritage Label within the framework of the European Union will ensure that citizens' sense of belonging to the European Union will increase, stimulating ideals of cohesion, solidarity and integration."
"I voted for the report on the European Heritage Label because Europe has set itself the goal of creating a common identity, bringing the EU closer to its citizens through awareness of this rich and diverse historical and cultural heritage with which everyone identifies and through which young people can learn and find out about their own identity, sharing it with the other young Europeans."
"Formalising the label will also help promote those places that have made history in the creation of Europe."
"I enthusiastically welcome the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a European Heritage Label."
"The goal of creating a joint European identity and promoting the Union's interests is crucial to peace and social cohesion."
"The proposed measure of promoting European heritage using a transnational website appeals to young Europeans and could encourage them to find out more about the continent's history, to familiarise themselves with multinational heritage and shared cultural heritage, and to find out more about the people and ideas that led to the creation of the European Union itself."
"This measure is of high symbolic and educational value, and will present European history and culture as a whole."
"I support the intentions expressed in the report of safeguarding the European Parliament and Council's effective participation in selecting the sites and content presented, so as to ensure that the initiative is very transparent and democratic."
"I congratulate Mrs Paliadeli on her excellent work."
"The European Parliament has today given the green light to the European Heritage Label, a register of historic sites whose importance transcends national borders."
"The European Union has around 500 million inhabitants, who mostly feel that they are, first and foremost, citizens of their countries of origin, and not European citizens."
"The lack of a strong European identity can be seen as an obstacle to European integration, but it is not at all surprising."
"The European continent is a vast patchwork of languages and customs, and the differences between the countries that form it are often more obvious than the common threads."
"This initiative will enable the sense of belonging to Europe to be strengthened, as well as creating greater cohesion between citizens of different countries."
"This is why it is important to highlight the places that celebrate and symbolise European integration, as well as those that celebrate the ideas and values of the European Union."
"In addition, just like the sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List, those bearing the European logo ought to attract more tourists, with beneficial effects for the local economy."
"in writing. - The formation of a joint European identity and the growth in interest in the European Union and its genesis are challenges with which the European institutions are faced in their bid to achieve broad cohesion and solidarity."
"There certainly are other, more radical and obvious ways to enhance the Europeans' faith in the European Union and its leaders (the recent financial crisis has shown that there is still much to be achieved at the upper levels of the administration)."
"However, knowledge of the history of our continent, familiarity with its multinational, yet common cultural heritage, and stepping up the education of the younger generation in the ideas and people who led to the building of the European Union may actually contribute to bridging the gap between the EU and its citizens."
"As a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, I voted in favour of Parliament's resolution on a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Union action for the European Heritage Label."
"The idea of establishing an EU label is important from the point of view of making citizens more aware of the European Union's history and cultural heritage, and of building a European identity and links between countries."
"By selecting sites in the individual Member States which have applied to be granted the EU's European Heritage Label, we will make people more aware of the fact that Europe's history affects all of us, regardless of where we live, our language or our culture."
"Changing the European Heritage Label into an EU initiative will help make it more credible, visible and prestigious."
"This, in turn, may translate into economic and social benefits, inter alia, by making the sites awarded the label more attractive to tourists."
"Selecting sites to be awarded the label will also help to increase the younger generation's interest in, and knowledge of, the ideas and peoples of Europe, and, in so doing, will bring Europe's inhabitants closer together."
"The European Heritage Label initiative is intended to promote the cities, people and activities that have contributed to the process of European integration."
"Its aim is to make citizens more aware of the fundamental values, such as democracy, solidarity, cultural diversity and tolerance, upon which our Community is based."
"The list of sites awarded a European Heritage Label will act as a kind of map of our continent's traditions and culture, and a map of places that have played a key role in forming the European identity."
"Europe's common, yet diverse heritage can strengthen its citizens' sense of this identity, and strengthen European cohesion."
"This initiative will create a platform for cooperation between the countries and regions of Europe."
"Furthermore, it may have a positive impact on the tourism sector, by helping to make regions more attractive and, at the same time, improving their economic situation."
"I agree that this scheme should become an official initiative under the auspices of the EU, as this will make it more widely recognised, credible and prestigious."
"The increased visibility of the scheme will make it possible for a greater number of citizens to identify with the labels, which symbolise and commemorate European integration."
"The scheme should operate in parallel and as a complement to UNESCO's international scheme and the European Capitals of Culture, since the European Heritage Label operates on the level of educational and symbolic values and, to a lesser extent, aesthetic and architectonic qualities."
"We should search for ways to strengthen citizens' sense of belonging to Europe."
"I consider European values, such as the Old Hungarian runic script, to be of great importance, and their recognition and appreciation through awards to be indispensable."
"In this case, however, we must preserve the tradition of giving this award to values actually located within the EU."
"It is unacceptable to extend it to third countries, as in doing so, we would only duplicate the UNESCO World Heritage List."
"On the other hand, I hope that this award will help us return to traditional European values, and awarding the label will truly be an expression of recognition."
"I abstained because of the abovementioned contradictions in the report."
"I voted for the recommendation on the conditions for Swiss participation in the Youth in Action programme and in the Lifelong Learning programme because I consider it a positive factor in European youth strategy; this is because it is a stage in the cooperation process with this country on sectoral policies within the European Union."
"As Switzerland is willing to participate in human, economic and social terms in this project involving young people, the European Union can only benefit from including the young people of third countries like Switzerland in the process of raising awareness of the EU integration process amongst the younger generations."
"I voted for this recommendation because I have no doubt that the EU's cooperation with Switzerland in the fields of EU education, science and youth affairs will be of mutual benefit to the improvement and effective implementation of policies in these fields."
"Switzerland participating in the 2007-2013 'Youth in Action' and Lifelong Learning programmes will give these programmes an additional impetus and will create opportunities for participant exchanges, for sharing experience, while, at the same time, preserving financial and other EU interests."
"The 'Youth in Action' programme is intended to develop and support cooperation in the European Union youth field."
"It aims to encourage the participation of young people in public life, particularly those with fewer opportunities or with disabilities, and foster initiative, enterprise and creativity."
"In turn, the programme for education and lifelong learning helps to develop the Union as an advanced knowledge-based society in accordance with the objectives of the Lisbon strategy."
"Supporting and complementing the action of Member States, it aims to encourage exchanges, cooperation and mobility between Community education and training systems so that they become a worldwide reference for quality."
"Switzerland, which is not an EU Member State, does not currently take part in these actions."
"I think that the opposite should be the case, and that we must include our Helvetian neighbours in these policies, in the context of an open Union."
"That is why I voted in favour of this legislative resolution that embraces Switzerland in these important actions."
"I voted for this recommendation prepared by the European Parliament because I approve of the Council's draft Decision on Switzerland's participation in the 'Youth in Action' and Lifelong Learning programmes."
"Although it has chosen not to join the European Economic Area, Switzerland is nevertheless cooperating closely with the European Union in the fields of education, training and youth affairs."
"This agreement is appropriate because Switzerland is committed to complying with the conditions and provisions laid down by the European Commission."
"Furthermore, projects and initiatives submitted by participants from Switzerland will be subject to the same conditions, rules and procedures as are applied to projects from Member States."
"Switzerland will conform to EU financial control and audit provisions."
"In accordance with the bilateral agreement, Switzerland will establish a National Agency to coordinate implementation of the programmes at national level and will make an annual financial contribution to each programme (in 2011, EUR 1.7 million to the Youth in Action programme and EUR 14.2 million to the Lifelong Learning programme)."
"Cooperation with Switzerland on education matters is an important step in EU-Switzerland relations."
"The two programmes in question support lifelong learning and the inclusion of young people in European integration, through tolerance and solidarity between young Europeans."
"The agreement between the Commission and Switzerland is adequate, given that Swiss participants in these programmes apply on an equal footing with all other young Europeans, and that Switzerland is committed to adapting to European rules and their supervision, as well as to contributing to both programmes financially."
"in writing. - I welcome the adoption of this report in my capacity as the Chairman of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Switzerland."
"The European Commission, the European Parliament and the Member States of the European Union agreed to establish the 'Youth in Action' programme, which puts into effect the legal framework to support non-formal learning activities for young people."
"The aim of this proposal is to provide for the participation of Switzerland in the Youth in Action and Lifelong Learning programmes."
"Switzerland is the only European country to take part in these programmes without being a member of the EEA, a candidate or a potential candidate country."
"Although it has chosen not to join the European Economic Area, Switzerland has shown sustained interest in closer cooperation with the EU in the education, training and youth fields."
"We are all very much aware that a good education system which ensures that young people receive the best possible education is enormously important for every country."
"A good level of qualifications, knowledge and education has a direct impact on culture and the labour market and, as a result, citizens' standard of living."
"Each country wants to be proud of its young people, and each young person wants the opportunity to get to know new cultures and languages and to acquire professional experience abroad."
"The European Union can be proud of its well-developed student exchange system and of its open labour markets, which mean that every young European has a great many opportunities for intellectual and professional development."
"Switzerland's participation in the 'Youth in Action' programme demonstrates that cooperation with the European Union, particularly in the field of education, is of great importance to the country."
"We should not prevent young Swiss citizens from enjoying the privileges and possibilities of a Community education."
"The attention being focused on education and training, on research and, in particular, on the resource provided to the European Union in its young people, is steadily growing."
"By providing new learning opportunities, we want to offer our citizens more chances."
"Education, training, cultural, research and youth programmes are a key element in this strategy."
"The aim of the 'Youth in Action' programme is to inspire a feeling of active European citizenship, solidarity and tolerance among Europeans, from adolescence to adulthood."
"The programme promotes mobility both inside and beyond the EU's borders and encourages the inclusion of all young people, irrespective of their educational, social and cultural background."
"As a member of the Delegation for relations with Switzerland and Norway, I voted for this report as I think that the agreement signed between the Commission and the Swiss authorities is completely appropriate and in their mutual interest."
"This will enable us to help as many young people as possible acquire new skills and offer them learning opportunities with a European dimension."
"in writing. - Although it has chosen not to join the European Economic Area, Switzerland has shown sustained interest in closer cooperation with the EU in the education, training and youth fields."
"Initially, the legal bases for the EU education, training and youth programmes did not provide for participation by Switzerland, but this changed in 2006 when Parliament and the Council adopted decisions establishing the 2007-2013 Youth in Action and Lifelong Learning programmes."
"In February 2008, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations about Swiss participation in the two programmes."
"An agreement was reached in August 2009 and the Council has already adopted a decision approving its signature and provisional application from 2011."
"I supported this proposal."
"The participation of Switzerland, a country that chose not to be a part of the European Union, in the 'Youth in Action' programme and in the action programme in the field of lifelong learning cannot be ruled out a priori, but should be carefully evaluated."
"I therefore support the terms of the agreement reached between the Commission and the Swiss Government, so I voted for the report by Mrs Pack."
"It is right to grant the benefits of the programmes to Switzerland, but it is also right to safeguard all the financial and other interests of the European Union."
"Although not a Member State of the European Economic Area, Switzerland has continued to show interest in cooperating more closely with the Union in the field of education, training and youth."
"The conclusion of this agreement on Switzerland's participation in the 'Youth in Action' programme and the action programme in the area of education and lifelong learning is a very positive consequence of that."
"Indeed, the notion of education and lifelong learning is vital to the competitiveness of the knowledge-based economy."
"It can be applied to every level of education and training; it concerns every stage of life and all the different forms of learning."
"We must develop and strengthen exchanges, cooperation and mobility."
"Furthermore, it is important to encourage young people to take part in public life, particularly those with fewer opportunities or with disabilities, and to foster initiative, enterprise and creativity in order to promote a sense of active European citizenship, develop solidarity and encourage tolerance."
"Understandably enough, Switzerland, which provides some of the financial backing for the 'Youth in Action' and Lifelong Learning programmes, now wishes to participate in these programmes."
"In the spirit of learning, it would also be a positive development if the EU were to take a leaf out of Switzerland's book when it comes to direct democracy."
"When the Swiss population decides against the erection of minarets, this decision is accepted."
"Likewise, the recent initiative on the deportation of foreign criminals."
"The Swiss authorities are aware that when the people say 'no', they mean 'no' so that they do not simply continue to hold ballots until they get the result they want, then express surprise at a drop in voter turnout."
"The Swiss example should give us pause to reflect on the concerns that people have."
"I cannot fully agree to the regulations described in this report, which is why I have voted against it."
"I voted for the recommendation on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation establishing the terms and conditions for the participation of the Swiss Confederation in the Youth in Action programme and in the Lifelong Learning programme (2007-2013), because I believe that the agreement negotiated with the Swiss authorities by the Commission is fairly positive, increasing the programme's benefits in Switzerland and safeguarding the European Union's interests, not least its financial interests."
"Today in plenary, we voted on the draft legislative resolution concerning the participation of Switzerland in the 'Youth in Action' programme and in the action programme in the field of lifelong learning."
"Although it has chosen not to join the European Economic Area, Switzerland has repeatedly shown its interest in closer cooperation with the European Union in the education, training and youth fields."
"Through this recommendation, we have concluded an agreement between the EU and Switzerland, granting the latter the possibility of participating in the 'Youth in Action' programmes and programmes in the field of lifelong learning."
"in writing. - Although it has chosen not to join the European Economic Area, Switzerland has shown sustained interest in closer cooperation with the EU in the education, training and youth fields."
"Initially, the legal bases for the EU education, training and youth programmes did not provide for participation by Switzerland, but this changed in 2006 when Parliament and Council adopted Decisions establishing the 2007-2013 'Youth in Action' and Lifelong Learning programmes."
"In February 2008, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations on Swiss participation in the two programmes."
"An agreement was reached in August 2009 and the Council has already adopted a Decision approving its signature and provisional application from 2011."
"Under Article 218(6) of the TFEU, the Council has to obtain the consent of the European Parliament before the agreement can enter into force."
"The Parliament and Council Decisions establishing the 'Youth in Action' and Lifelong Learning programmes, adopted in 2006, already provided in principle for Swiss participation."
"The agreement negotiated with the Swiss authorities by the Commission is quite adequate: it extends the benefits of the programmes to Switzerland, while safeguarding the financial and other interests of the EU."
"Switzerland is a country which has to contend with the problem of unequal access to higher education, despite having excellent education programmes."
"Let us hope that cooperation with the EU will mean that young Swiss people, particularly those from the immigrant population, will have a better chance of accessing education."
"Member States' experiences of programmes facilitating educational exchanges for young people show clearly that they not only promote a good education, but also play a positive role in terms of European integration thanks to acquisition of the languages, cultures and traditions of individual countries."
"At the same time, the Lifelong Learning programme represents an excellent opportunity to draw attention to the role of women in Switzerland."
"The country was the last in Europe to grant women the right to vote in federal elections, in the 1970s, and for a long time, women have constituted a social group which finds it difficult not only to participate fully in civil society, but also to access education and professional self-fulfilment."
"Today, middle-aged women wishing to join the labour market are often faced with the problem of a lack of qualifications or experience, since a considerable number of them stayed at home in order to look after their families, due to the high costs of childcare."
"The two reports on human rights in the EU and in the world represent a challenge to the workers who, as the capitalist crisis develops, are suffocating under the barbaric attack on their rights and life by the EU, capital and the bourgeois governments trying to get them to pay the cost of the crisis and save the monopolies' profits."
"It takes a great deal of cheek for the political representatives of capital to proclaim the EU as the guardian of human rights when it is in the process of adopting the new, even more reactionary NATO 2020 doctrine and is first in line when it comes to exploiting the people and natural resources and supporting puppet and reactionary regimes."
"At the same time, in all the Member States of the EU, labour and social rights acquired in hard, bloody fights are being slaughtered, grassroots and labour struggles are being savagely repressed, the immigrant hunt and racism are on the rise, fundamental grassroots freedoms and democratic rights are being restricted and communist parties are being outlawed and communist symbols banned in a series of countries."
"The standard references to alleged infringements of human rights in Cuba and other countries putting up resistance to the imperialist plans are raw threats, coercion and pressure to break the will of the people, so that they abandon their rights to freely decide their own fate."
"Traditionally, the plenary session in December is partly devoted to human rights."
"One of the ritual events that punctuate the session, apart from the awarding of the Sakharov Prize, is the adoption of the resolution on Parliament's annual report on human rights in the world and the European Union's policy on the matter."
"One of the Union's international commitments is indeed to promote democracy and human rights around the world."
"The report this year notes the continuation of grave violations in this area and a situation aggravated by the economic crisis, climate change, new technologies and the fight against terrorism."
"It recommends that the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon be implemented, in particular, through the new European External Action Service."
"Mrs Andrikienė, rapporteur of the text, states that the priority of a consistent European foreign policy should be to promote democracy and human rights."
"I voted in favour of the annual report on human rights in the world 2009 and the European Union's policy on the matter, because it examines, assesses and, in specific cases, provides an analysis of the European Union's work in the field of human rights and democracy and future challenges."
"As far as violence against women is concerned, the European Parliament expresses its deep concern about the entrenched gender-based discrimination and domestic violence in several countries, and points out that women living in rural areas are a particularly vulnerable group."
"I therefore approve of Parliament's requirement that women's rights be explicitly addressed in all human rights dialogues and, in particular, the combating and elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, all forms of harmful traditional or customary practices, for example, female genital mutilation and early or forced marriage, all forms of trafficking in human beings, domestic violence and femicide, exploitation at work and economic exploitation."
"As millions of children are still victims of rape, domestic violence and physical, emotional and sexual abuse, I agree that the EU must urgently take additional measures against child labour, and should apply more efficiently the instruments at its disposal."
"The role of the European Union as a human rights defender is a fundamental characteristic which the institutions must not relinquish and which must be maintained as a priority of diplomatic work."
"Annex I of this report is the best proof of this, as it lists all the situations in which there have been human rights violations that we in Europe have denounced or have not shirked from condemning; from Afghanistan to Somalia, from Russia to Iran."
"We do not turn a blind eye or bury our head in the sand, even when strategic partnerships are at stake, because individual interests cannot be put before defending freedom and human rights."
"In my opinion, the Union's position must remain as follows: interventionist and courageous, fighting for human rights and democracy."
"This report is part of a recurrent exercise in pure hypocrisy by the majority, dominated by the right and by social democrats, who claim the role of 'ambassador' for the defence of human rights."
"This is an exercise that is unmasking itself as it goes through the obvious contradictions that it contains, not least in making use of an alleged defending of human rights to promote intervention in countries where its own interests are at stake, whitewashing its allies and supporting them, particularly the United States."
"Examples of this include the case of the so-called CIA flights and the complicity of many EU countries' governments in the kidnapping, torture and illegal transfer of prisoners to Guantánamo Bay and the continued occupation of Afghanistan by NATO forces and the successive massacres of civilian populations under the pretext of combating terrorism."
"Further examples include the upholding of Israel's policy of apartheid over the people of Palestine and support for Morocco's continued occupation of Western Sahara. and support for the illegal US blockade of Cuba, condemned by the United Nations General Assembly on 18 consecutive occasions."
"These policies, like the majorities promoting them, leave a bad taste in the mouth: the time is coming when the people will be able to reject them."
"in writing. - The directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings aims at creating a more hostile environment for the human traffickers by punishing the criminals and guaranteeing stronger prevention and protection of the victims."
"It is unacceptable that human trafficking is still a state of fact in Europe affecting hundreds of thousands of people mostly from vulnerable social groups, such as minorities, women and children for reasons of sexual exploitation, forced labour, modern-day slavery, and others."
"I strongly condemn all exploitation of victims of human trafficking and therefore, I am in favour of strengthening protection of the victims and introducing higher sanctions for the traffickers."
"Improving the cooperation between EU countries and strengthening the coordination between various institutions and organisations at European, national and regional level is of particular importance for the successful implementation of the directive."
"The EU should use its international relations to commit its partners to curb human trafficking and ensure that the rights of the victims are respected worldwide."
"Moreover, it should include in its political dialogues with non-EU countries policy norms, standards and principles of the international human rights system for combating and preventing trafficking in human beings."
"in writing. - (LV) I am voting for this resolution and the proposal for a categorical demand to be made to the Russian authorities to bring the persons guilty of the murder of the Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, to justice, and I call on Parliament to consider the possibility of denying Russian officials involved in this case entry to the European Union, and of freezing these officials' bank accounts and other assets in all EU Member States."
"Such a demand would send a powerful signal to the Russian authorities that European Union citizens find the serious deficiencies in the Russian justice system, the selective application of laws in the interests of the authorities, and the fact that persons culpable of attacks on, or even the death of, the defenders of human rights, independent journalists and lawyers still remain unpunished far too often, to be unacceptable."
"This signal would confirm the EU's support for the defenders of human rights in Russia, who operate in especially difficult circumstances."
"Observance of human rights is one of the EU's fundamental values, and one to which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament pays particular attention, since it appears on the agenda of practically every meeting held by our group."
"It is important for Parliament as a whole also to devote its attention to this subject."
"We are seeing something of an improvement, albeit a slow one, in the situation throughout the world."
"There are still countries whose governments persistently violate human rights, yet there are also those where changes are afoot."
"The rapporteur's oral amendment reflected these positive trends in Russia."
"The situation in Cuba is, however, still a cause for concern, as demonstrated by the prize giving ceremony for the 2010 Sakharov Prize."
"I voted in favour of this report with conviction."
"in writing. - The annual report on human rights is inevitably a backward-looking exercise but I nevertheless welcome it."
"This report deals with the period July 2008 to December 2009, just before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I warmly welcome Cathy Ashton's commitment to human rights and her assurance during the debate that human rights will be mainstreamed into the work of the EEAS."
"I hope this will mean that when we debate the human rights report next year, we will be able to report a more coherent and consistent approach to human rights by the EU."
"This annual report aims to emphasise the European Parliament's strong determination and long-term efforts to defend human rights and democracy in the world through the development of an increasingly integrated and effective European policy capable of guaranteeing greater coherence and consistency across all policy areas, whether through bilateral relations with third countries or through supporting international and local civil-society organisations."
"In particular, we insist on the importance of conducting a thorough assessment of the human rights aspects of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), which should notably address the coherence and efficiency of the existing mechanisms such as the Action Plans, Progress Reports, Human Rights dialogues and the decision-making process of upgrading relations with non-EU countries."
"We should like to give greater visibility to the future accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights as an opportunity to prove its commitment to defending human rights inside and outside its borders."
"We therefore call on all Member States to support this and commit their citizens to it."
"The report on human rights in the world 2009 and the European Union's policy on the issue form an extremely important tool to reinforce the role of the European External Action Service (EEAS) with regard to human rights policy."
"Indeed, these things have always been the hallmark that makes the European Union stand out in the world."
"I agree with Mrs Andrikienwhen I underline that freedom of religion or belief constitutes, amongst all human rights, an essential and basic right that must be respected, and that conditions related to respect for human rights which feature in the bilateral agreements with non-EU countries need to be enforced more strongly and more effectively."
"It is therefore right to call on the High Representative to incorporate freedom of religion or belief into EU human rights policy and to give a thorough evaluation of the situation of freedom of religion or belief in the EU annual report on human rights."
"I am voting in favour of the report by Mrs Andrikienė."
"The European Union needs to do whatever it can to ensure that the principles and freedoms governing human rights are applied, so that it can play a leading role in this sector."
"A special human rights service needs to be created and, more importantly, areas in which there are EU representatives need to be monitored by the Union."
"The European Union must also supervise and closely monitor infringements of human rights in its Member States."
"I did not support this report since it does not deplore or criticise the EU's double standards regarding respect for and promotion of human rights, both in its Member States and in third countries with which it has special political and trade relations. As such, it does not state that EU governments have designed and implemented policies that are radically opposed to human rights in areas such as immigration, with mass expulsions and detentions based on race or security, allowing serious human rights violations such as detaining people illegally and transferring them to secret prisons where they are tortured."
"The EU itself has adopted directives that are contrary to human rights, such as, for example, the Returns Directive, and it has initiated or developed special trade or political relationships with governments of countries such as Morocco, Colombia or Israel which systematically violate human rights."
"Although I appreciate the fact that for the first time, the human rights situation in the non-autonomous territories of the Western Sahara is included, I do not support this report due to the omission of all the above elements and of the negative impact on human rights of the EU free trade agreements, not to mention its unjustified and exaggerated criticism of countries such as Cuba and Venezuela."
"The report on human rights in the world 2009 is very detailed and addresses a wide variety of issues."
"Unfortunately, I somehow get the impression that there has been a desperate attempt to pack in every possible issue here without following a clear strategy."
"The fact is that the promotion of democracy throughout the world must be an important issue for the Europe Union."
"However, this requires a clear approach and a definite, consistent strategy for resolving these problems, some of which are extremely difficult."
"Since there is no sign of such a strategy, I abstained during the final vote."
"Although it is more than 60 years since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was signed, there are still many places in the world where this Declaration is nothing but a piece of paper."
"Sadly, there are many such places in Europe too, a continent where the protection of human rights as one of the principles of democracy was born."
"The European Union, which we can boldly say leads the world in terms of human rights, is making significant efforts to ensure that at least minimum standards of human rights protection are guaranteed in other places around the world."
"I therefore congratulate my colleague, Mrs Andrikienė, for preparing a really comprehensive report, and for drawing attention to the complex situation worldwide."
"I hope that this report will contribute to improving the situation and that such reports will be shorter in the future."
"I voted in favour of this year's European Parliament report on human rights because it includes both countries that are geographically near to and far from the EU."
"In the report, the EP calls on China - the country with the highest number of executions - to make its national execution figures public, and thus allow for transparent analysis and debate on the subject."
"This should encourage the country to hasten the abolition of this barbaric form of punishment."
"On the other hand, it is shameful that the death penalty is still being used to this day in the democratic United States of America."
"The report expresses concern about children involved in, or otherwise affected by, armed conflicts or even forced to take an active part in them."
"In my amendments to this report, which were adopted by the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs, I urge the Commission and the Council to ensure that in relations with third countries, compliance with the EU Guidelines on Children and Armed Conflicts is mandatory."
"I also call for immediate steps to be taken by the EU and UN institutions to disarm, rehabilitate and reintegrate children who have taken an active part in wars."
"I urge the North Korean authorities to make concrete and tangible steps towards improving human rights conditions."
"I urge Pyongyang to allow inspection of all types of detention facilities by independent international experts, and to allow UN Special Reporters to visit the country."
"I also call on the North Korean authorities to lift restrictions on the ability of international staff to monitor the distribution of aid, and to ensure that international aid reaches the needy."
"This report on the annual report on human rights in the World (2009) and the European Union's policy on the matter details, exhaustively, human rights violations across the globe."
"The European Parliament's unshakeable determination and longstanding efforts to defend human rights and democracy across the globe by applying a firm and effective policy in defending human rights in the EU should be recalled here."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, a historic opportunity to deal with the gaps that still exist in EU policy on human rights and democracy is opening up."
"I therefore join the rapporteur in calling on the European External Action Service to comply fully with the objective and spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon, to ensure that respect for human rights and its promotion is at the heart of the various fields of intervention of Union external policy."
"Yesterday, the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to the Cuban citizen Guillermo Fariñas, who was absent."
"His chair was empty, because the Cuban Government would not have allowed him to return home."
"This is a shocking and symbolic example, serving as a brutal reminder that the human rights situation in the world is not improving."
"The practice of the death penalty close to home in Belarus, hangings and stonings in Iran, female genital mutilation in Somalia, mass rapes in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the murdering of journalists in Russia, 215 million children working, arbitrary detentions, unfair trials, censorship, and so many other barbarities that require the European Union to be steadfast and uncompromising."
"The report adopted today requires us to put human rights at the heart of the European Union's external action, in its development, defence, trade, fishing, immigration and justice policies."
"The universality of these values must take precedence over geopolitics, once again cynically revealed on 10 December 2010 when 15 countries made a cowardly response to China's express request that they boycott the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Chinese citizen, Lu Xiaobo."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Andrikienon her excellent work."
"Parliament's annual report on human rights - this year in relation to 2009 - is a point of reference for all those interested in the issue."
"This edition is even more important, because it is the first since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which grants the European Union greater powers in foreign policy."
"In fact, the greatest hope for human rights is the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon in terms of foreign policy: The European External Action Service must reflect the priorities and the spirit of the Treaty."
"One of the priorities of a coherent foreign policy should be the promotion of democracy and human rights."
"Lastly, I note that Parliament's annual report on human rights not only provides a long list of problems; it also suggests solutions."
"The report notes the abolition of the death penalty in several countries, the progress made on violence against women, the protection of children, the fight against torture, protection for human rights activists, the promotion of democracy and religious freedom, and so on."
"in writing. - As usual, the final text has good and bad news."
"Among the positive points: First of all, the amendment in two parts relating to Magnitsky was adopted with a large majority (+318, -163 and 95 abstentions)."
"S&D and ALDE amendments were all adopted (LGBT, death penalty/lethal injection)."
"Two GUE amendments were adopted (equal access to healthcare/treatment and Colombia)."
"However, among the negative points, we have to mention that the two amendments tabled by the rapporteur (EPP) relating to the EIDHR and the need to dedicate more projects to democracy instead of HR were adopted."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Andrikienė's report because I believe that we need to stress once again that respecting human rights is the reflection of a modern society."
"All human beings are born free and equal, and it is clearly our duty to do everything possible to ensure that this is the case across the world."
"Notwithstanding the fact that the European Union's external policy has made some important strides in recent years, the road to adopting a shared and coherent policy for the promotion of human rights is still a long one."
"First of all, the Council and the Commission need to improve the European Union's capacity for rapid response to violations in third countries."
"Beginning with the firm condemnation of the death penalty across the European Union, we need to strive to achieve and reaffirm human rights on a daily basis."
"In this vein, I should like to conclude by noting that, as Mahatma Gandhi said, the protection of human rights is the necessary precondition for peace."
"This should never be forgotten."
"The report on the annual report on human rights in the world in 2009 and EU policy on the matter provides a near total overview of human rights problems across the world."
"The report also takes up new types of human rights issues, such as human rights protection and the fight against terrorism."
"Thanks to the amendments of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, a chapter has been included on the role of human rights in the newly-established European External Action Service (EEAS)."
"This is very important given the fact that, as a new instrument, the EEAS is able to provide us with an opportunity to review the EU's human rights policy and to defend human rights worldwide in a more coherent and decisive way."
"I therefore support 100% the proposal to appoint a high representative, who, together with his/her service, will coordinate the Union's human rights policy on a permanent basis."
"The core message is clear: human rights should occupy a central place in the foreign policy of the European Union."
"There is still a long way to go, but Parliament will keep its finger on the pulse."
"That is an exceptionally positive thing."
"I voted for the report on a new strategy for Afghanistan."
"I believe that international aid should be channelled directly to the Afghan authorities, thereby circumventing intermediaries."
"Regarding the peace process, the EU's role should allow the Karzai government to be autonomous in choosing its dialogue partners, while insisting on the following prerequisites: banishing al-Qaeda, eradicating poppy cultivation, and a willingness to establish basic respect for fundamental human rights."
"As for the professional training of the police force, I agree with the objectives of focusing not just on increasing the number of police officers and soldiers, but mainly on training, on organisation, and on the relations of police forces with parallel judicial institutions."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution and supported a pragmatic approach towards Afghanistan and the new counter-insurgency policy which is geared to protecting the local population and rebuilding areas where security has been ensured."
"The new counter-insurgency policy must be given time to show results, there should be a political solution and negotiations with all sides should take place."
"I am convinced that any long-term solution must include concrete measures for the eradication of poverty, under-development and discrimination against women, enhancing respect for human rights and the rule of law, strengthening reconciliation mechanisms, ensuring an end to opium production, engaging in a robust state-building exercise, and fully integrating Afghanistan into the international community, as well as banishing al-Qaeda from the country."
"We have to pay tribute to the servicemen and women of all the Allied Forces who have lost their lives in defending freedom, and to express condolences to their families, as well as to the families of all innocent Afghan victims."
"The situation in Afghanistan is still a concern."
"Almost 10 years after the Western coalition drove the Taliban from power, peace and prosperity are still far from being a daily reality for Afghans."
"The strategy used for years in the country is flawed and must be changed."
"The Union must assert its views on the subject and take note of the failure of the United States' military policy in the region."
"Our troops are bogged down, and no hope of exit seems possible under such conditions."
"For these reasons, I supported Parliament's resolution calling for a new strategy for Afghanistan."
"The system that has been in place until now must be changed."
"We have to tackle corruption and waste so that international aid can at last fulfil its role."
"Peace will return through civil action."
"The coalition needs to be stricter when controlling these funds."
"On the other hand, we must stop interfering in Afghan affairs."
"The Afghan Government must be free to find its modus vivendi with all the groups that make up Afghan society."
"The path to development is still long, and we must not endanger these fragile balances."
"I abstained during the vote on the report on the new strategy for Afghanistan."
"The report does indeed contain several positive points and it acknowledges the highly unfortunate aspects of the current situation and the responsibility of the international community, especially NATO, the EU and the Member States, which are involved in various ways in the war in Afghanistan and the 'management' of its 'reconstruction'."
"The report also highlights the fact that the distribution of money and international aid does not reach the Afghan people."
"It also illustrates how negative and absurd it is for foreign troops to remain in Afghanistan, given that, apart from the human victim aspect, it proves that the situation has worsened in terms of the poverty of the Afghan people, the level of respect for women's rights, the spiralling rise in opium crops and even the emergence of mafia organisations and corruption through the privatised security system applied by the USA."
"Unfortunately, however, amendments by the conservative forces which contradict the original text have altered it."
"It welcomes 'new counter-insurgency policy', adopts President Obama's timetable, calls for closer identification by the EU with NATO and the USA and recognises the efficacy of and need for troops to remain and secure the area."
"Nine years after the start of the military intervention in Afghanistan, it is possibly the greatest challenge faced by Europe and its allies in terms of foreign intervention and global security."
"The truth is that in the last decade, despite the strong - and uninterrupted - international presence in Afghanistan, security in the country has deteriorated."
"Terrorists continue to be supported and trained and, on top of this, the main socio-economic indicators are unsatisfactory."
"At present, therefore, the main objective of the international community and of Europe should be to encourage the creation of a strong and stable government, so the peace process continues to be supported, insofar as it respects the three basic commitments listed in the report: (i) Afghanistan's commitment to banishing al-Qaeda from the country; (ii) eradicating poppy cultivation and combating drug trafficking; and (iii) a willingness to establish a basic respect for fundamental human rights."
"Within this framework, and in accordance with the international commitments that have been made in the context of NATO, the military presence in Afghanistan should be progressively reduced, while maintaining international support for peacekeeping and security with a view to post-intervention stability."
"This report is perhaps the best compromise that can be reached today on the new European strategy in Afghanistan."
"This is partly thanks to the numerous and crucial amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which made it less ideological and more pragmatic, and capable of recognising the criticalities discovered over nine years of operations on Afghan territory, as well as identifying the positives and lines of development to make the international community's presence more effective and favour the transition towards a complete hand-back of sovereignty to the Afghan authorities."
"A solely military response cannot be enough, it is true."
"It is, however, an essential precursor, in order to weaken the Taliban groups and drive them to cut all links with al-Qaeda and therefore to sit down at the negotiating table."
"Preventing civilian massacres remains a priority, of course, but we must not deny ourselves the use of drones, which are performing well in the areas around the border with Pakistan."
"The commitment to the European Union Police Mission in Afghanistan (EUPOL) needs to be reinforced in order to continue to train a police force that is capable of maintaining public order."
"The training of judges and administrative officials should be intensified in order to favour the strengthening of the Afghan institutions, reduce corruption and build the conditions to return Afghanistan to the Afghans."
"in writing. - This report highlighted many of the problems facing Afghanistan."
"The report is critical of the role of the NATO-US occupation and of human rights abuses in Afghanistan, in particular, the increased repression of women and higher levels of poverty."
"The anti-war movement has warned of these problems since the start of the war."
"However, I abstained as I could not support the report's support for the occupation and the 'surge' that has been carried out by the Obama administration."
"I abstained on amendments calling for more support to the Afghan State."
"I support respecting the sovereignty of the Afghan people, but the Karzai regime is corrupt and does not reflect the interests of the majority of the Afghan people."
"I call for all aid to be democratically controlled by the small farmers, workers and poor of Afghanistan."
"I note the tribute in this report to ordinary soldiers who have been killed and to the Afghan people who are victims of this war."
"I cannot agree, however, with the statement that military personnel died 'defending freedom'."
"This is a war carried out in the interests of the major imperialist powers and not in the interests of ordinary people."
"Where is our money disappearing to in Afghanistan?"
"I am pleased with the motion for a resolution on a new strategy for Afghanistan."
"The report highlights very well the many problems affecting that country."
"There is no military solution for Afghanistan, something the report also states."
"If the troops have not been able to bring peace to Afghanistan, neither has the money that we have poured in."
"The report even says that between 2002 and 2009, more than USD 40 billion in international aid was channelled into the country."
"Of this 40 billion, just six billion went to the Afghan Government, the remaining 34 billion being channelled into the country from elsewhere."
"As much as 70 to 80% of this aid never got to its intended recipients, the Afghan people."
"Furthermore, the costs of the war in Afghanistan over the period 20012009 amounted to more than USD 300 billion."
"However, these enormous sums of money are not doing the Afghan people any good."
"Instead, it is, for example, the arms industry, mercenaries and international companies that get to benefit from the money spent in Afghanistan."
"It is important that the report actually highlights this unsatisfactory state of affairs."
"in writing. - (LV) I fully support the report where it calls for efforts to reconstruct Afghanistan and an improvement in the human rights situation."
"It cannot be denied that the security situation in Afghanistan today is much better than it was nine years ago."
"People live in a freer society, girls can get education, and medical services are more accessible than under the Taliban regime."
"However, serious problems, in the resolution of which there has been no progress, still remain."
"This can especially be said about the war against drugs, as is rightly emphasised in the report."
"According to expert opinion, 92% of the world's opium is sourced in Afghanistan and is then distributed throughout the world, including the European Union."
"We must take into account the fact that the cultivation of opium poppies represents a significant source of income in rural areas, where other forms of earning a living are difficult to find."
"That is why the destruction of opium poppy plantations without offering alternative means of earning a living is not an effective solution."
"The government of Afghanistan must make more purposeful use of international aid to develop small enterprises and agriculture in regions where opium is currently grown."
"The European Union's investment in rebuilding Afghanistan is significant, but there is still much more to do."
"The most important thing is to guarantee security."
"I should like to stress that a premature withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan would not only be dangerous for the local population and a threat to the democratic world, but it would also thereby destroy all the good that has been achieved in Afghanistan."
"People have paid a high price for peace in Afghanistan, and we must not let them down."
"in writing. - The rapporteur decided to focus exclusively on four areas where, he believes, targeted action could bring about real changes: international aid, the implications of the recently launched peace process, the impact of police training, and the elimination of opium cultivation."
"Although I do not support every conclusion he draws, I did vote for this well thought-out and useful contribution to the debate on Afghanistan."
"The report on a new strategy for Afghanistan should be assessed positively overall, so I am voting in favour of it."
"The enormous problems that remain today in Afghanistan, each different and extraordinarily important for the future of this Middle-Eastern country, need to be dealt with using a new approach with a different definition of priorities compared to what has been done so far."
"The primary question - as the report we are going to vote on correctly identifies - is the fact that 'there can be no stability or peace in Afghanistan without the state first of all guaranteeing security for its citizens on its own responsibility'."
"In this regard, I hope that the rapporteur will reconsider the part in which he talks about the use of drones, perhaps through an oral amendment."
"This report paints a disastrous picture of the consequences of a NATO-led war in Afghanistan that has had the complicity and support of the EU."
"It is regrettable that the report does not condemn the war itself and hesitates between maintaining NATO military forces on the ground and going ahead with their necessary withdrawal."
"Despite this, considering all the important criticisms it contains, I will abstain from voting."
"One of the main reasons why I did not support this report is because not only does it suggest the immediate withdrawal of European troops, but also it 'welcomes and supports' the plan to strengthen EU action."
"Likewise, it scarcely questions the role played by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the grave human rights abuses committed."
"I consider it positive that the report includes the statements by General Stanley McChrystal in which he denies that there is sufficient al-Qaeda presence to justify the deployment of troops in Afghanistan."
"I also think that it is positive that the report calls for police training to cease being in the hands of private contractors as soon as possible, along with the recital stating that there is no obvious end in sight for the war in Afghanistan due to the militarism and warmongering that has taken place so far."
"I did not support the report because my firm, consistent commitment to pacificist values lead me to criticise this report, the spirit and focus of which are entirely opposed to the need to demilitarise the EU's foreign policy and its foreign relations."
"In general, the rapporteur has quite correctly recognised the situation in Afghanistan."
"He is aware that resources and troops are being deployed completely incorrectly in Afghanistan and that additional resources and troops will do nothing to change this."
"He has correctly recognised that the presence and disdainful demeanour of the Coalition is the primary reason for its absolute rejection by the local population."
"He is also aware that it is not possible to foist democracy and Western values on the people of Afghanistan."
"However, the rapporteur must be criticised for harping on themes such as women's rights which, although very important, are completely unacceptable at local level and therefore render the entire peace process even less likely."
"In addition, the rapporteur, despite identifying their negative effect, also calls for more troops and more resources for Afghanistan."
"I am convinced that the Afghan conflict is an unjust war and that the continued occupation of the country is of no benefit either to Europe or to Afghanistan itself."
"Europe's first line of defence is not at the Hindu Kush."
"It is for that reason that I have voted against this report."
"The Member States of the European Union who are fighting at America's side in the war in Afghanistan should withdraw their troops from this country as quickly as possible."
"The Afghan War will soon have lasted nine years and there is still no sign of any improvement in the security situation."
"On the contrary, the Islamist Taliban is growing in strength."
"Europe is wasting its resources instead of deploying them where they are urgently needed, for example, on the EU's Balkan borders."
"It is hard to see what European interests are actually to be defended in the Hindu Kush."
"It would seem that the primary concern is not to establish democracy in Afghanistan according to the Western model, as the Americans claim."
"Instead, economic interests play a central role, particularly because, according to the New York Times, it is estimated that around USD 1 billion worth of natural resources lie buried in Afghanistan."
"Obviously, the EU is required to help US concerns to exploit these riches without disruption."
"It is for that reason that I have voted against this report."
"This report on a new strategy for Afghanistan was prepared following on from the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in which it was discussed how to move forward with implementing the Action Plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan, and in which the first semi-annual implementation report was tabled."
"I fully support a strategy aimed at protecting the population and reconstructing areas where security is guaranteed, as well as political solutions in which all involved parties are called into the negotiations."
"I welcome the goal of gradually transferring responsibility for security to Afghan forces between now and 2014."
"I unreservedly support Parliament's call for the Commission to ensure total transparency in the financial assistance provided to the Afghan Government, international organisations and local NGOs."
"It is only by means of a transparent system that we will be able to maintain the coherence of aid and succeed in reconstructing and developing Afghanistan, which is the ultimate goal."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Arlacchi."
"The report adopted today proposes that the new European Union strategy for Afghanistan should be based on four key factors: full support for peace negotiations between the Karzai government, the Taliban and other insurgent groups; an extensive training plan for the Afghan police; the elimination of opium crops; and halting the international aid scandal, in which 80% of aid disappears during the journey from donor countries to Afghanistan."
"Regarding the last of these points, it is noted that international aid for Afghanistan ends up being spent in bribes, forms of 'legalised corruption' and all kinds of stealing, often financing the enemy."
"Since 2002, the EU alone has spent EUR 8 billion on this tortured country and despite this, the child mortality rate has risen, literacy levels have fallen and the amount of people living below the poverty line has increased by 130% over the last six years alone."
"In order to rectify the absence of coordination and communication among international donors, the EU is calling to set up a centralised database on all EU aid and to allocate funds directly to specific projects implemented in partnership with Afghan institutions."
"in writing. - The report adopted today is based on the extensive consultations that the rapporteur has been engaged in over the past six months on the situation in Afghanistan and its relations with the international community, in an attempt to explain why so little has been achieved in Afghanistan in spite of the huge amounts of money and effort expended over the past nine years."
"The gap between hope and reality in Afghanistan has become more striking than ever, and a new EU strategy in that country should thus start from this premise."
"The report focuses exclusively on four areas where targeted action could bring about real changes: international aid, the implications of the recently launched peace process, the impact of police training, and the elimination of opium cultivation."
"in writing. - This report has some useful references to the NATO/ISAF mission; to the deep problems of illiteracy and ill-treatment of women; to endemic corruption and the need for fresh thinking."
"It might have stopped there."
"However, it could not resist constant criticism of the coalition and, tacitly, of the US."
"It tries to find ways to elevate the EU role."
"It advocates increased 'EU funding' when clearly, the need is not more money but better control and use of the massive amounts already provided."
"The ECR therefore abstained."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that with this document, the European Parliament is strengthening its role in its relations with the Commission."
"I agree with the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs that it is of the utmost importance for Parliament to be able to fully and timely exercise its prerogatives and for the Commission to actively inform Parliament about all draft measures, amended draft measures and final draft measures that it intends to adopt under Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which provides that, where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts are needed and implementing powers are conferred on the Commission, the control on the exercise of such implementing powers by the Commission rests with the Member States alone."
"I feel that in light of the specificity and political sensitivity of implementing acts to be adopted under the external financial assistance instruments, and in line with the practice established with the democratic scrutiny dialogue, Parliament should have the opportunity to contribute to the process leading to the definition of the content of the draft implementing acts to be adopted under the external financial assistance instruments."
"In the architecture of the European Union, the Commission's role is akin to that of government in a typical State."
"The Commission has the legislative initiative, but also the power to implement regulations, directives and decisions."
"The Commission can therefore be considered the executive branch of the Union."
"It has derived powers, which allow it to take measures to implement texts adopted through the ordinary legislative procedure."
"Just as regulations and circulars in France must respect the laws in place, the implementing acts of the Commission are not independent from European laws."
"However, it is possible that, in exercising this quite natural power to implement, the Commission may exceed its powers, in most cases, without necessarily seeking to do so."
"For democratic reasons, it is for other EU institutions to monitor the Commission's activity so that the division of powers is respected."
"That is why I voted in favour of this proposal for a regulation laying down the general principles for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers."
"in writing. - I could not vote for this report because it sacrifices some of the European Parliament's hard won new powers in international trade for the expediency of an agreement with the Council on implementing powers in other areas."
"The Commission's proposal is a concerted attack on democracy."
"This report settles for amending it without actually condemning that fact."
"The Commission is the only group of civil servants in the world that remains outside the control of its government (the Council)."
"I shall be voting against this latest authoritarian move."
"There have always been efforts to centralise control within the European Union."
"These efforts seem to have increased recently in tandem with a rise in bureaucracy, despite all the statements to the contrary."
"It must remain a matter for the Member States to decide what powers they wish to cede to the EU and/or the Commission."
"This cannot be changed by judgments by the European Court of Justice, which seems to have been pursuing the principle of a centralised state in its judgments for years."
"Likewise, the Treaty of Lisbon cannot be exploited for this purpose, nor may such objectives be pursued under the pretext of crisis management."
"In theory, there is a clear acceptance of the subsidiarity principle."
"However, this is frequently ignored or skirted in practice."
"I voted in favour of the report because it basically goes against this trend."
"The compromise reached means that the commercial policy, including the instruments of trade defence, can be included within the general framework of comitology."
"This approach is entirely coherent and in line with both the spirit and the letter of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In particular, I fully support the need to strengthen the decision-making and implementation process, providing the Commission with the requisite instruments in the common interest of the European Union, the Member States and all economic operators."
"I support the principle that the Commission should adopt definite anti-dumping and countervailing measures and that the Member States should vote on the basis of a qualified majority."
"This report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation laying down the rules and general principles on control mechanisms by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers is motivated by the new rules on implementing acts introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This is a delicate matter, not least in terms of agriculture and fisheries issues."
"Under the current system of committee procedure, the common agricultural policy accounts for the majority of acts."
"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the current regulations on the committee procedure will have to be replaced by delegated acts and implementing acts, under the terms of Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"Problems with adapting existing legislation to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon are of the greatest importance, especially for policies - such as those on agriculture and fisheries - that have not been adopted under the codecision procedure."
"Only the test of new legislation, heavily amended by the European Parliament and the Council, will be able to indicate whether the route set out will result in the effectiveness and implementation of European policies."
"in writing. - In general terms, the report was well perceived by all groups and the amendments tabled by the committee reflect the agreement reached with the Council and Commission for a first-reading agreement."
"Our group is in favour of the agreement."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because there is a need for a permanent crisis mechanism in order to safeguard the financial stability of the euro The European Stability Mechanism and/or a European Monetary Fund should be based on solidarity, subject to strict conditionality rules and financed, amongst other sources, by the fines applied to Member States as the outcome of a procedure for dealing with excessive deficits, excessive debts or excessive imbalances."
"I believe that it is also important that the financing of the permanent crisis mechanism must be based upon the 'polluter pays principle', meaning that Member States creating bigger risks by their deficits and debt burdens should finance a larger proportion of the total assets."
"These penalties would be one of the means of avoiding financial and economic crises in euro area countries, such as the one that arose in Greece a few months ago and which is still continuing."
"The war against the workers, the self-employed and small-scale farmers is a strategic choice by the bourgeois governments and the EU in order to support the profitability of capital."
"The debt and deficit are simply a pretext."
"All the national governments in the Member States of the euro area and the EU are being called upon to step up the adoption and application of even more savage, barbaric and anti-labour and anti-grassroots measures coordinated by the EU, the ECB and the IMF."
"The summit will create the 'support mechanism', which is basically a bankruptcy mechanism."
"The debate on resources and the participation of private capital is wool over the workers' eyes."
"The aim is to ensure that the plutocracy does not go bust."
"Capital makes the markets more visible to the absolute regulator of Community mechanisms and amends the Treaty of Lisbon in that direction, so as to safeguard its profits by over-exploiting the workers and by plundering the wealth that they produce."
"Enhanced economic governance is being imposed in order to control capitalist restructurings and step up the attack on the life and rights of workers."
"In light of this all-out attack by capital and the plutocracy, there is an urgent need for a broader grassroots rally to radically reverse the power correlations for the benefit of the grassroots alliance and to achieve an exit from the EU, grassroots power and a grassroots economy."
"On Thursday, 16 December 2010, the Heads of State or Government agreed to maintain the financial solidarity mechanisms established several months ago in response to the crisis."
"This is to ensure the stability of the euro as a whole, in case of difficulties in one or more Member States of the euro area."
"However, the granting of financial assistance will remain subject to strict conditions, which I think is necessary."
"As does Parliament's resolution, I welcome this commitment made by Member States, which shows true European solidarity."
"Unfailing solidarity is today the best answer that we can give the markets."
"Important decisions were taken this year aiming to establish an EU framework for economic governance and financial supervision."
"The EU will see the launch of the European Systemic Risk Board, responsible for the macro-prudential oversight of the financial system in order to avoid periods of widespread financial distress and contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market, thereby ensuring a sustainable contribution on the part of the financial sector to economic growth."
"I approve of the proposal to establish a permanent European Stability Mechanism and so further reinforce economic governance, in order to be able to ensure effective and rigorous economic surveillance and coordination, which will focus on prevention."
"I agree with the proposal set out in the resolution that Member States outside the euro area should have the possibility to be involved in the creation of this mechanism and they should be given the opportunity to obtain financial assistance if necessary."
"I voted in favour of this European Parliament resolution which discusses the need for Member States to establish a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole."
"This instrument is aimed at effective and rigorous economic surveillance and coordination, which will focus on prevention and will substantially reduce the probability of a crisis arising in the future."
"In order to streamline the current processes of economic policy coordination and remove overlaps and to ensure that EU strategy is understandable to market operators and citizens, it is necessary to move to more integrated approaches and to bring about a change in the decision-making process."
"I agree that we must strengthen the involvement of the European Parliament in legislative procedures related to the crisis mechanism, so as to improve democratic accountability and to rely on the expertise, independence and impartiality of the Commission."
"As the European Stability Mechanism is meant to complement the new framework of reinforced economic governance, the European Parliament calls on the Commission to present a communication, following consultation with the European Central Bank, containing a comprehensive description of this permanent crisis mechanism."
"I voted for the European Parliament Resolution on establishing a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area, given that this kind of mechanism has become a necessity in the current economic and financial crisis."
"I also support this resolution as it calls for the mechanism to be inspired by the Community method, which involves decision making at a common European level."
"Having a permanent crisis mechanism is beneficial to all Member States, including those which have not yet adopted the euro, given the interdependency among Europe's economies."
"We voted against this resolution because we disagree with the positions being taken on the financial problems that the Member States are experiencing, without taking their causes into account, and without tabling fundamental measures for identifying a complete solution."
"Such solutions include the immediate abolition of the Stability and Growth Pact, the immediate amendment of the European Central Bank's statute and guidelines, the immediate end to the liberalisation of the capital market and the derivatives market, and the immediate abolition of tax havens."
"As the European Union does not wish to take any of these measures, it is opting for positions that scarcely reduce the current problem but that still have a significant dependence on the financial market and richer countries."
"The resolution also insists on imposing penalties on Member States that do not comply with the rules established, notably in the Stability and Growth Pact, which will exacerbate the situation as a whole of those countries with weaker economies."
"This means that the most important thing is the interests of the major powers, such as Germany, and that the much-trumpeted solidarity is still lacking."
"in writing. - We voted against CCCTB but did not want to defeat other important aspects of this report."
"Our support for the general provisions is not support for CCCTB."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with the proposals for resolutions, because we need to establish a permanent crisis mechanism that is credible, robust, lasting, grounded in the essential technical realities and inspired by the Community method, thus ensuring market stability and greater certainty."
"in writing. - I voted for the EP resolution on the permanent crisis mechanism specifically because of the fact that during the debates in the Committee on Economic Affairs, the texts relating to establishment of a minimum corporate tax rate in the EU of 25% were deleted."
"I firmly support the idea for Member States to keep their national tax policies."
"It is crucial to preserve tax competition as a tool to facilitate cohesion and boost EU economic growth."
"Otherwise, how shall we drive EU competitiveness if we eliminate one of the best instruments to promote it and what shall we solve if we harmonise taxes clearly without the agreement of all Member States?"
"I also support the proposition for Member States that create bigger risk by their deficits and debt burden to contribute more to the assets of the crisis mechanism because this would definitely encourage strict fiscal discipline and enhance the added value of having a proper economic and fiscal policy."
"I am greatly concerned by the establishment of a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area."
"This is a vitally important issue for the countries in the euro area, and for the remaining Member States of the European Union."
"Over 150 million EU citizens live outside the euro area."
"Stabilisation of the euro will make it easier for them to fulfil their ambitions of joining this area, and may protect the entire system from further turbulence."
"The resolution does not solve any problems in and of itself, but it can send a strong signal to the Council and the Commission and to the Member States."
"The resolution gives voice to Parliament's firm intention to strengthen the Union approach and European solidarity."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, and I have high hopes of it."
"in writing. - I welcome this resolution and, in particular, the oral amendment by Stephen Hughes which 'calls on the Council to provide the necessary political signal for a Commission investigation into a future system of Eurobonds, with a clear specification of the conditions under which such a system would be beneficial to all participating Member States and to the eurozone as a whole'."
"This report supports the establishment of the European mechanism for financial stability and the social cuts that this will entail."
"It requires full consistency with International Monetary Fund regulations and establishes the European Commission's control over national budgets."
"I shall therefore vote against this report, which I also condemn."
"The motion for a resolution placed before us today with the specious title 'Establishing a Crisis Mechanism' is, in fact, a desperate attempt by the EU imperialists to bind all EU Member States together in a common European destiny, following the principle of 'United we stand, united we fall'."
"Right from the start, the euro was a completely misjudged construct that was bound to fail."
"It is not possible to shoehorn together states with completely different national economies under a single shared currency."
"Because there is no desire for greater integration or for the transfer of taxes between the peoples of Europe, it will be necessary to abolish the existing monetary union and to establish a hard currency union."
"For this reason, I favour bringing this business to a close instead of allowing it to lurch from one disaster to the next."
"I am therefore voting against this motion for a resolution."
"I should like to reiterate what was said yesterday during the debate and say that I am very happy about the approval of Amendment 12, even if I would have added an even more direct reference."
"We need to find new and innovative instruments to finance the crisis mechanism."
"Through the issue of Eurobonds, the crisis mechanism would be financed on the markets, drawing on foreign capital and people looking to invest, without any negative effect on national budgets."
"A mechanism based solely on pro-rata contributions, under the form of mere provisions of reserves, would imply a major burden on Member States, which would have to find the cash or capital to deposit without this bringing any yield or return."
"In a situation like the one at present, where Member States are asked, on the one hand, to implement severe budget policies to reduce deficits and debts and, on the other, to pay contributions to participate in the stabilisation fund, there is a real risk of collapse."
"in writing. - Among other things, this resolution calls on the European Council to specify as soon as possible the Treaty changes required in order to establish a permanent ESM."
"Parliament recalls that it has welcomed the establishment of a financial stability mechanism to address the risks of default by sovereign borrowers, partly using Article 122 TFEU as the legal basis of this plan, and that it has noted the inherent democratic deficit and lack of accountability of the Council's rescue package decisions, which did not include consultation with the European Parliament."
"It also demands that the European Parliament be involved as colegislator in forthcoming crisis rescue proposals and decisions and underlines that, from a rational, practical and democratic point of view, consideration of the economic governance legislative package cannot be dissociated from the decision taken by the European Council to create a permanent crisis mechanism."
"I voted in favour of this resolution which calls for democracy to be restored in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) following the presidential elections which took place on 28 November 2010."
"The illegal decision by Côte d'Ivoire's Constitutional Council, whose members appointed the outgoing President, to change the results declared by the election commission in contravention of a law that the Constitutional Council has a duty to implement, goes against the will of the people of Côte d'Ivoire as expressed when they voted in the elections."
"This decision must be overturned because otherwise, this country will be unable to break free from the political deadlock that followed the elections and the instances of violence already being reported will increase."
"In the interests of the welfare of the people of Côte d'Ivoire and peace in the country, I therefore support the appeal to Mr Laurent Gbagbo and the call for him to step down and hand over power to Mr Alassane Ouattara, to whom the electorate gave their votes as a sign of their trust."
"For many years, Côte d'Ivoire was the archetype of good decolonisation."
"The exemplary student of new-found independence, in the 1970s and 1980s, the country experienced considerable growth."
"Unfortunately, a latent political crisis has gradually undermined Côte d'Ivoire."
"The last presidential elections brought the opposition leader, Mr Ouattara, to power."
"The outgoing president, Mr Gbagbo, refused to hand over power."
"Ever since, the country has sunk into unbelievable confusion."
"Two parties are fighting for power and serious incidents have cost supporters from both sides their lives."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution calling on Mr Gbagbo to respect the results of the polls and make way immediately for his legitimate successor."
"The text also supports the action of the African Union, which is currently putting pressure on the country in order to ensure a return to democracy."
"The manner in which the second round of Presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire took place is regrettable."
"Violence, resulting in deaths and injuries, eventually led to the evacuation of international observers, a fact that raises a big question mark over the correctness of this poll, but also over the post-electoral progress in this country."
"I hope that this country, which was once a model of democracy for the African continent, will successfully rise above the impasse of electoral confrontation."
"Massive participation at the ballot box, despite the tensions, expresses the major preoccupation of the Ivoirians for the future of their country."
"I therefore believe that it is essential for the will of the citizens, expressed by voting in an election that has been cancelled six times in the past, to be respected."
"Côte d'Ivoire has the chance to bring to an end a decade of political, military and provisional government crises that divided the country into loyalist south and rebellious north."
"The only viable solution is for the will of the electorate to be respected."
"The situation in Côte d'Ivoire is to be condemned at all levels."
"It is worrying to note that the sovereign will of the electorate is not respected and that the presidential candidate who won the elections, according to Côte d'Ivoire's Independent Electoral Commission, has been blocked from taking up his post by the Constitutional Court."
"There were related cases of serious attacks on freedoms during the second round of the elections, not least a climate of tension and violence that led to several deaths and injuries."
"The political situation in Côte d'Ivoire is untenable, the attitude of the Constitutional Court is unacceptable, and Mr Gbagbo's ill grace in losing goes against the principles of democracy and the rule of law."
"in writing. - I fully support the call in this motion for Mr Gbagbo to step down and hand over power to Alassane Ouattara, the democratically elected President of Cote d'Ivoire."
"We have a duty to make sure that the election results coming in from the polls are respected, for they express the will of the people of Côte d'Ivoire."
"The results issued by the Constitutional Council of Côte d'Ivoire go against the will of those people."
"We cannot accept this unconstitutional, anti-democratic hold-up."
"On 28 November 2010, Mr Ouattara was declared the legitimate winner of the presidential elections by the Independent Electoral Commission of Côte d'Ivoire (CEI) and by almost the entire international community."
"It is imperative for the stability of the country and the sub-region as a whole that the stalling strategy being used by Mr Gbagbo should be brought to an end as quickly as possible."
"The political situation in the Côte d'Ivoire is extremely critical."
"In principle, I believe that it is not the job of the European Union to play the role of the world's police force because foreign countries must be able to determine their own destiny without needing the blessing of the EU or USA."
"However, in this case, we are not faced with the will of the people of the Côte d'Ivoire, but rather with the tyrannical subjugation of this people by an established elite."
"Some years ago, we had a situation in Europe where people were forced into a highly dubious form of state by political powers who had the necessary military means at their disposal."
"It is important that these powers should not be driven from their positions by violent means."
"However, it is equally important that peaceful means should be used to put pressure on these persons, so as to make it difficult for them to continue with their unjust policies."
"For this reason, I have voted in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"This resolution is motivated by the serious political and institutional crisis taking place in Côte d'Ivoire following the second round of the presidential elections on 28 November 2010."
"The elections, which were monitored by the United Nations (UN) and the European Union, took place in a generally satisfactory way."
"However, the results presented by Côte d'Ivoire's Independent Electoral Commission, announcing Mr Ouattara's victory, were rejected by the country's Constitutional Court, which reversed the result, alleging fraud in some areas and declaring the current president, Laurent Gbagbo, the winner."
"As the only source of democratic legitimacy is universal suffrage, whose results were certified by the UN, the European Parliament is using this resolution, for which I am voting, to call on Mr Gbagbo to resign and hand over power to Alassane Ouattara, and to strongly condemn the acts of intimidation directed at EU observers."
"Through this resolution, Parliament welcomes the European Council's decision to adopt specific measures against those obstructing the process of peace and national reconciliation, and supports the EU's decision to impose sanctions on Laurent Gbagbo."
"in writing. - Huge consensus, today, on the vote on the situation in Côte d'Ivoire."
"The EP Resolution, voted through with a big majority, states that the EP considers that the sole source of democratic legitimacy is universal suffrage, the results of which have been certified by the UN, and therefore calls on Mr Gbagbo to step down and hand over power to Alassane Ouattara; urges all the political and armed forces in Côte d'Ivoire to respect the will of the people that was reflected by the results of the 28 November poll, as announced by the CEI and certified by the UNSG Special Representative; and deplores the violent clashes that preceded the proclamation of the results of the second round of presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire and expresses its deepest solidarity with the victims and their families; regrets also the political obstruction and attempts to intimidate CEI members, which ultimately delayed the announcement of provisional results, thus hampering the due course of the democratic electoral process."
"I think it was a good idea for the Commission to attend Parliament today to report on the ban on the use of unenriched cages for laying hens, which will enter into force from January 2012."
"The implementation data are not very encouraging and, hence, very tough action is required against Member States that, out of indolence, have not made any progress for a while."
"The prohibition of these cages has been known since 1999, and those Member States that joined later were perfectly aware of having to take action on this issue according to precise timescales."
"Delay is unacceptable."
"Deadlines must be respected to make the European Union's actions credible."
"The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union requires the EU to enforce its policies, bearing in mind the welfare of animals as sentient beings."
"We must not always hide behind the problem of competitiveness, which should not be considered as an issue of quantity and prices but, above all, of quality, environmental sustainability and ethics, too."
"The critical and aware consumer must be at the heart of a new economic model that the EU should spearhead."
"I therefore hope that the Commission will proceed swiftly and determinedly to implement Council Directive 1999/74/EC, to protect both animals and consumers."
"I voted for this resolution, as I advocate some flexibility for those who have already started this adaptation process but who have been unable to complete it because of the current crisis."
"From 1 January 2012, the rearing of laying hens in unenriched cages will be banned, and this will establish the minimum standards relating to the protection of laying hens."
"It is therefore important to know that the Commission can show what progress has been achieved by the Member States in preparing for the ban on the rearing of laying hens in conventional batteries from 1 January 2012, what measures it will take against Member States whose producers do not comply, and what measures it will take to prevent potential unfair competition from third countries in the EU egg market from 1 January 2012."
"Just over 10 years ago, the European Union passed a directive intended to protect laying hens from the appalling rearing conditions in which too many farms were keeping them."
"Basing their argument on the significant deterioration of the situation in the sector, undermined by rising feed prices caused by cereals market speculation, a number of Member States have requested a review of the directive."
"It should be applied no later than 2012."
"Two years away from the deadline, many farms are nowhere near meeting the new standards."
"Parliament's current resolution calls on the Commission to stand firm on this issue."
"It welcomes the consultation that the Commission has initiated with professionals from the sector, but urges the Commission to refuse the additional time that some farmers are requesting."
"It has been 10 years since the directive entered into force."
"After 1 January 2012, eggs laid by hens kept in battery cages of less than 550 cm will no longer be sold."
"However, many factory farms are still not up to standard."
"There could be a shortage of eggs and rising consumer prices in cases where some Member States are not ready to comply with the ban."
"This would also lead to increased imports of eggs from third countries, which do not always abide by European health standards."
"That is why Parliament has sounded the alarm."
"Producers and Member States have been called to order so that they will act quickly, particularly considering that, to date, they have had more than 12 years to comply with legislation."
"Producers who have made investments in order to comply, and breeders of free-range hens, should enjoy fair competition within the European Union."
"The issue raised here is fundamental, not just from the point of view of animal hygiene and welfare, but also the need to ensure the applicability and effectiveness of Directive 1999/74/EC, preventing potential distortions of competition."
"It has already been demonstrated in other situations relating to animal transportation that failure to apply and comply with EU rules by certain producers and distributors creates situations of unfair competition and market distortions."
"The Union therefore urgently needs to demonstrate coercive capacity in the application and following of its directives throughout its territory, in order for the market to function more efficiently, and without deviations and distortions by respecting these same rules."
"The banning of conventional battery cages in 2012 represents an enormous success for animal welfare."
"However, these uniform standards must apply throughout Europe, otherwise they are pointless."
"It is vital that we fight for this Europe-wide deadline in the interests of animals and of producers who have already invested in alternative farming practices."
"In order to establish equal competition, the Commission must ensure that eggs that are not produced in the correct way are not allowed to reach the European market."
"At the very least, consumers must be able to identify eggs and egg products produced in compliance with European standards."
"I was the Christian Democrat spokesman on animal welfare in the German Bundestag when Parliament decided on this ban."
"At the time, I defended the resolution because it was to apply to the whole of Europe."
"I expect the Commission to take suitable steps to ensure that the deadline is met in all Member States."
"This means that there should be no more conventional battery cages in use in Europe after 2012."
"The ban on rearing laying hens in traditional cages enters into force in January 2012."
"The risk that many businesses will not be in compliance alarms us."
"We also fear possible shortages of supply and price increases on eggs, given that eggs from farms which are not in compliance with Council Directive 1999/74/EC will be banned from sale."
"I voted for the resolution because a delay would be unthinkable, but we have supported countries such as Spain and Portugal in bringing in an instrument that guarantees a 'soft' transition for businesses which have begun to change their rearing systems but which will not have completed the process before the deadline."
"It is not my desire to harm animal welfare and ask for a delay, but to underline a few essential points that need to be reiterated with force."
"Firstly, for the principle of reciprocity, the European Commission is asked to implement a monitoring system to supervise the quality of eggs imported into the European Union and guarantee total respect of European standards and rules."
"Subsequently, the Member States are asked to include measures in their regional development plans to support the laying-hen sector in this difficult time."
"in writing. - I strongly support this resolution which demands that all the provisions of Directive 1999/74/EC on the welfare of laying hens be fully implemented by all Member States by the deadline of 1 January 2012."
"It declares that any extension of the deadline, or 'phase-in period', for any Member State is unacceptable - considering that producers have already had 10 years in which to comply - and would have grave ramifications for the successful and timely implementation of any future animal welfare rules."
"It also requests that the Commission launch swift and effective infringement proceedings, with heavy and dissuasive fines, for lack of compliance with all elements of the directive."
"Eleven years on from a provision having been passed, it is hard to understand how it can be that so few steps have been taken for its implementation."
"This can mainly be laid at the door of the Commission, which, in the past, has often watered down its former provisions, so that they were no longer taken seriously."
"If it indeed proves to be the case that here, too, a lazy compromise will be reached, this will once again undermine the credibility of the EU."
"It is my fervent hope that by 1 January 2012, there will no longer be any illegal battery farms in the market or, at the very least, that these will be hit with such punitive taxes that they will no longer enjoy any competitive advantage."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of the report."
"I voted in favour of Amendment 2 initiated by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) because a large number of producers have already started to invest with a view to modernising their rearing systems or are at the point of launching such investments."
"These investments cannot be implemented overnight and it would be unfair for the producers in question to be penalised."
"This amendment will allow an important number of Romanian - and not only Romanian - producers to start modernising works in the coming period so that they will not have to cease their activities."
"Council Directive 1999/74/EC stipulates that from 1 January 2012, unenriched cages can no longer be used."
"European farmers will have to choose whether to convert their systems to use enriched cages - which are more spacious, to improve the animal's wellbeing - or to rear laying hens on the ground, outside, or in organic systems."
"According to recent surveys, it is thought that 30% of European farms still use unenriched cages."
"Real difficulties in adapting to the new system before the deadlines set by the directive have been observed."
"This is the case in Italy, for example."
"Through the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting of 22 February 2010, the European Commission has stated that no exceptions are provided for in the application of the ban."
"An amendment to the resolution, however, meant that a possible alternative solution was reached for those producers who have started to replace their systems of rearing in favour of the new cages."
"I therefore voted for it."
"The welfare of animals in general and of laying hens in particular is a serious business."
"To prove it, not only did the European Union legislate on the subject by means of a 1999 directive prohibiting battery cages for laying hens from 1 January 2012, but the transposition of that text also caused a disagreement between the Walloons and the Flemish in 2004."
"In this debate, it is essential to be sensible and to find a solution which takes into account both animal welfare and the economic interests at stake."
"Those who say that Community rules should be complied with, that unfair competition between breeders should be prevented, and that a 12-year transitional period is ample time to write off the investments are right."
"However, the opponents, who are demanding a little flexibility in the rules, especially at this time of austerity, and saying that the switch to enriched cages or non-cage systems will cost the poultry sector, a non-beneficiary of direct aid from the common agricultural policy, a huge amount of money, are also right."
"That is why I supported the three amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which reflect the everyday reality for all European breeders."
"in writing. - With the adoption of this resolution, the EP calls on the Commission to maintain the requirement for a ban on battery cages by 1 January 2012, as laid down in the Welfare of Laying Hens Directive (1999/74/EC), and strongly to oppose any attempts by Member States to secure a deferral of that deadline; it stresses that, as a matter of principle, postponement of the ban, or derogations from it, would seriously harm the welfare of laying hens, distort the market and penalise those producers who have already invested in non-cage or enriched cage systems; and it expresses its deep concern at the substantial numbers of Member States and egg producers behind schedule for meeting the 2012 deadline."
"I definitely support the idea that a solution must be found to cases where a producer has already started to replace the cages, but will presumably not complete this process before the expiry of the twelve-year grace period."
"Such farmers must be given assistance in order to ensure that they can complete the upgrading of their farms as soon as possible despite their meagre resources."
"For this reason, I voted for the proposed amendment."
"I voted against the resolution, although I am firmly in favour of protecting animal welfare."
"There can be no disputing the need for adaptation to comply with the requirements of the directive, which introduces a ban on conventional cages, but we should give all Member States the same amount of time to implement it."
"The difficulties faced by many European producers in adapting to the regulations that are to enter into force as of 1 January 2012 will bring about a shortage of table eggs on the market and a significant rise in the price of such eggs, a fall in the sector's competitiveness compared to imported eggs from third countries, and, most likely, production being stopped or greatly scaled down."
"Before the final introduction of the ban, we should assess the state of implementation of the directive, as an assessment of this kind could lead to proposals for transitional solutions for the gradual withdrawal of unenriched cages without putting producers who have already complied with the regulations at a disadvantage."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome you to the afternoon sitting."
"The sitting is resumed and is the last sitting before the Christmas break and the New Year."
"I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Executive Committee of the German War Graves Commission (Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge) from Baden-Württemberg under its chair, Mr Nothelfer."
"Based in Baden-Württemberg, the Commission tends the graves of 90 000 victims of war and tyranny in Baden-Württemberg alone."
"We thank you for your work and welcome you to the European Parliament."
"1."
"Malaysia: the practice of caning"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Malaysia."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Malaysia is a wonderful country with age-old traditions and cultural riches."
"As members of the ASEAN delegation, we have frequently seen for ourselves how quickly and remarkably this country has grown."
"The resulting increase in economic power has led to Malaysia achieving top ten ranking when it comes to world growth rates, a fact that has greatly impressed us."
"It is for this reason that I would like to state on behalf of my own group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, as well as all those here who signed the resolution, that we find it impossible to understand why Malaysia still practises this outmoded method of chastisement, which harkens back to the country's colonial past and which seems almost mediaeval to us in Europe."
"We are not alone in voicing this criticism: lawyers in Malaysia itself are equally opposed to the practice."
"Caning violates all United Nations human rights agreements and we believe that things need to change quickly."
"We welcomed the charter of the ASEAN states, which emphasises in several articles and the preamble that - and I quote - 'the promotion and protection of human rights' is among the essential requirements of the ASEAN Charter, which has also been ratified by Malaysia."
"Malaysia has long espoused democratic principles."
"However, this also involves the rule of law with universal standards."
"This is something we shall repeat again and again when we are in Malaysia and the ASEAN states, and the European Parliament will underline this with this resolution."
"author. - Mr President, the practice of caning - the hitting of a person with a cane - is a form of corporal punishment that is often applied in Malaysia and this is a reason for concern, because tens of thousands of people are subject to this kind of punishment, particularly immigrants, and the list of offences that can lead to caning is growing."
"Malaysia is thus violating its commitment to Resolution 8/8 of the UN Human Rights Council, which states that corporal punishment can be tantamount to torture."
"The legal process leading to this form of punishment is often lacking and immigrants are not being informed about the charges against them, or are being denied the right of access to legal counsel."
"We welcome the outspoken call by the Malaysian Bar Association - which represents 8 000 lawyers - for the abolition of caning."
"The European Parliament calls on the Malaysian authorities to enact a moratorium on caning and all other forms of corporal punishment, while working on the abolishment of this law in letter and in practice."
"The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia and the Malaysian Law Reform Committee should make adequate recommendations to the government concerning the abolition of corporal punishment laws."
"Mr President, this resolution condemns the practice of caning in Malaysia."
"The term caning should not be understood to mean an outmoded, harmless educational instrument, but is rather a horrific, demeaning and humiliating punishment, which is banned under the UN Convention against Torture."
"Anyone who doubts this should take a look at a video showing how this punishment is meted out in Malaysia."
"In terms of their brutality and horror, these images are nothing other than documentary evidence of torture."
"Malaysia uses this horrific and humiliating practice to punish at least 66 misdemeanours and approximately 1 000 people are beaten in the country's gaols every year."
"In addition, in recent years, this brutal treatment has also been extended to migrants entering the country without papers and to drug addicts."
"It is estimated that a group of between 350 000 and 900 000 people are affected."
"We therefore urgently call on the Malaysian Government immediately to desist from this horrific, demeaning and humiliating practice and to repeal the relevant laws in the medium term."
"Malaysia is a member of the UN Human Rights Council."
"As the previous speaker pointed out, this body also equates the application of corporal punishment with torture."
"For this reason, Malaysia would do well to remain in this body, but also to uphold the principles represented there."
"author. - Mr President, Malaysia has moved towards a more Islamic form of governance in recent years."
"This is of some concern because Malaysia could be an important ally for the EU, being a strategically placed democratic Asian country with a developed economy."
"Sadly, Western concepts of human rights are less developed in Malaysia."
"However, I am unsure as to why we have singled out Malaysia here."
"Malaysia is a Muslim majority country and such punishments are commonplace in many Sharia law-based countries, and are mandated by the Koran which serves as the ultimate legal authority for all Muslims."
"Indeed, caning is a relatively mild punishment compared to some of the other extremely brutal methods of punishment used in some Muslim countries, including amputation, lapidation and beheading."
"Caning should also be seen in the Asian cultural context: for example, neighbouring secular Singapore also sentences criminals to caning, and the Indonesian province of Aceh, which receives a lot of EU aid, has recently introduced caning under its Sharia law policy."
"In EU Member States, traditional implementation of corporal punishment is rightly banned, and let us hope that Malaysia one day will follow our enlightened example."
"But it is not at all clear in my mind that caning is illegal under international law, as stated in the resolution."
"Mr President, when you love someone, you have certain expectations of them."
"It is the same when it comes to relationships between states."
"States with whom we have a particularly close relationship do not fall into the same category as some terrible dictatorships on other continents."
"Malaysia is a valued close partner of the European Union."
"Its constitution is, in some respects, an example for a European constitution."
"That is why we view what is going on in Malaysia so seriously."
"Mr Tannock, caning in Malaysia was not introduced by Sharia law, but is a carryover from British colonial times."
"Just as British colonial power no longer exists and Great Britain has changed in the meantime, Malaysia must also change and try to abolish this antiquated and barbaric punishment, which violates international law and human rights."
"I want to be very clear on this."
"For decades, Malaysia has been a country characterised by tolerance between the various ethnic groups and religious communities."
"The country should stick to this path and it will do so as a particularly close partner of the European Union, which we hope will succeed in banning this barbaric form of punishment."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I would like to ask a question of Mr Posselt, for whom I have enormous respect."
"I am not an international lawyer, but I can see no evidence whatsoever that international law forbids caning."
"It is very clear that it forbids war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and so on, but caning, in my view, is not forbidden by international law."
"The Convention on Torture, which Malaysia has not actually ratified, says that caning could amount to torture but is not always necessarily torture."
"So could Bernd perhaps explain to me why caning is illegal - as he stated again and as it is stated in the resolution - and against international law."
"If we do not stick to the facts, we bring this House into disrepute, in my view."
"Mr Posselt, that was not, in fact, a question from Mr Tannock."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, I interpret that last contribution as a question and would like to state in reply that caning does indeed constitute torture and that the prohibition on torture is integral to human rights and international law, irrespective of whether or not a particular country has ratified these principles."
"Mr President, Malaysia is one of those states for which cooperation with the European Union, although recent and relatively modest, appears to be rather positive."
"This is particularly true in economic terms of course, but also socially, in relation to education, women's rights and the most vulnerable populations."
"However, when it comes to democracy and human rights, the situation is far from ideal."
"Worrying signs persist."
"The situation we are discussing today is an unfortunate illustration of this."
"While Malaysia has signed a number of international conventions, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), it still refuses to sign others and, in particular, the International Convention against Torture."
"Malaysia is one of the countries that apply the death penalty; indeed, this is a mandatory sentence for drug trafficking convictions."
"Corporal punishment is common practice in Malaysia and can be administered to anyone: men, women - notably those who are accused of illicit sexual relationships - and even children, for schoolchildren guilty of serious disobedience."
"What is worse, for those who are sentenced to receive such punishment, it is carried out with the help of doctors, in violation of their medical ethics, with said doctors being responsible for resuscitating the offenders before they suffer the rest of their sentence."
"Worse still, in recent years, the Malaysian Parliament has extended the list of criminal offences that are punishable by caning."
"Today, there are over 60 of them, including illegal entry into the country."
"In addition, since 2002, when this offence was created, thousands of refugees have suffered this punishment, this torture."
"The Malaysian Government must stop these practices."
"At a time when the European Union's dialogue with Malaysia seems to be bearing fruit, should the European Union not do everything possible to persuade Malaysia to make progress in this area?"
"Mr President, I would like to begin by quoting some data from a study conducted by Amnesty International this month, in December 2010."
"At least 10 000 convicts and at least 6 000 refugees are caned each year in Malaysia."
"There are numerous canings in detention facilities, and Mr Tannock has said that, unfortunately, Malaysia is not the only country in which anachronistic punishments of this type are applied: there is also talk of Singapore."
"What is, however, problematic in the case of Malaysia is the fact that a more significant number of crimes and offences attract a caning sentence: to be more precise, 66 in Malaysia, compared with 30 in Singapore."
"We are talking not only about violent or sexual crimes, but also drug taking, and especially infringements of immigration provisions."
"I concur, on the other hand, with the perspective that my colleague, Mr Posselt, has embraced, saying that we are talking about torture, which is absolutely prohibited under international law."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Parliament's resolution is timely and important."
"Thousands of people are subject to caning in Malaysia every year."
"Caning is an inhuman and degrading form of punishment which should be abolished everywhere in the world."
"Caning is a form of torture."
"According to Amnesty International, a Muslim woman was caned last year in Malaysia where Sharia law is applied."
"The reason for the punishment was drinking beer."
"Amnesty International has also reported on the caning of refugees and immigrant workers in Malaysia."
"We urge the government of Malaysia to abolish caning as a form of punishment."
"We also call on the Malaysian Government to ratify the Protocol to the United Nations Convention on Torture, as well as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"Mr President, we are pleased by Malaysia's economic development and the improved living conditions of the Malaysian people."
"At the same time, however, we are incredulous at Amnesty International's report describing the widespread use of the punishment of caning in Malaysia."
"This really is a harsh punishment, use of which is often over the top, as it is sometimes meted out for minor and very dubious offences."
"In my opinion, it is particularly cruel to hand down this sentence to illegal immigrants or people found on Malaysian territory without valid documents, including political refugees from Burma."
"The ruthless nature of this punishment, however, conceals the unspoken truth regarding the traditional conditions and nature of the punishment of caning as practised in Malaysia."
"Many of the misdemeanours which carry the punishment of caning are related to violations of Islamic religious law and customs deriving from this law."
"An example of this is the case of Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno, who was sentenced to caning in 2009 for drinking beer in a bar."
"The situation requires our response."
"Mr President, traditional Islamic Sharia law, which is applied even in many moderate Islamic countries, permits corporal punishment for infringements of the law."
"There was the notorious case from Malaysia of a punishment of six strokes of the cane imposed on the model Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno for being caught drinking beer."
"After the announcement of the punishment, however, which was to have been performed with a rattan cane in a women's prison, the punishment of six blows of the cane, handed down to a 32 year old mother of two children, was commuted to three months' community service on the basis of a ruling by the Malaysian sultan, Ahmed Shah, who supervises compliance with Islamic rules in Malaysia."
"Things went rather worse, however, for 46 year old Indonesian, Nasarudin Kamaruddin, who got 6 blows of the cane and one year in prison for the same offence."
"Judge Abdul Rahman Mohamed Yunos, who also sentenced Kartika Shukarno, said of the judgment 'The aim of the verdict is not to punish but to teach'."
"A similar argument was used in defence of his ruling by Wee Ka Siong, Deputy Education Minister, when he justified the corporal punishment of children in schools, adding that the punishment could be carried out only by directors of schools or assigned persons, that parents would be informed about a punishment, and that a witness would be present when the punishment was carried out."
"Ladies and gentlemen, what we are talking about is nothing exotic."
"It is everyday life in the so-called moderate Islamic world."
"We must therefore not hesitate to provide help to people in these countries in abolishing such mediaeval punishments and customs, if we can do so by means of diplomacy or in other ways."
"(PL) Mr President, we absolutely should condemn the use of caning and all forms of corporal punishment and inhumane treatment."
"Malaysia cannot invoke its domestic legislation, under which at least 66 crimes carry the punishment of caning, in order to justify its ruthless methods, which are tantamount to torture and which are considered illegal by international law and conventions."
"Amnesty International reports of an increasing number of refugees and emigrants subjected to caning in Malaysian prisons are also alarming."
"The European Union, which has had more effective methods at its disposal to facilitate the protection of human rights since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, should show greater initiative in the fight against the brutal treatment of people throughout the world."
"Furthermore, the observance of human rights should be a key condition set by the European Union for the development of further political cooperation with Malaysia."
"(PL) Mr President, Malaysia is an economic tiger."
"It is a highly developed country which acts as a model for the entire region of South-East Asia."
"This tiger faces a major problem, however; namely, the use of caning as a punishment."
"Of course, one can talk of respect for cultural identity, and of the fact that we Europeans should be particularly sensitive when it comes to imposing our models on other continents."
"In this case, however, we really are talking about human rights, which are indivisible and transcend the borders of continents, races and religions."
"It is my view that the European Parliament not only should, but must, resolutely defend the fundamental right of human dignity, and caning most certainly violates this dignity."
"Mr President, inflicting physical pain is against human dignity."
"Caning is a gross violation of human rights."
"It is against the right not to be tortured, but also against the right not to be subject to inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment."
"In Malaysia, over 10 000 people suffer from this form of corporal punishment every year."
"Accounts show that the pain is so great that victims often lose consciousness."
"Reports show that a number of officers carrying out the punishment are eager to accept bribes to spare the victims."
"Therefore, in addition to gross human rights violations, we have government officials committing a crime by taking advantage of people's suffering."
"I call upon the Commission and the Council, as well as on the Malay Government, to urgently work for an immediate moratorium on the practice of caning, followed by its elimination from the law."
"Beating up people and whipping people on behalf of the government must stop."
"(RO) Mr President, I consider it regrettable that in Malaysia, the practice of caning has reached such high proportions and is following an upward trend."
"Instead of restricting this practice, the Malaysian Government encourages it."
"The authorities invoke a groundless argument, according to which caning is legal and has a considerable effect, in the sense that it diminishes criminal activities."
"Moreover, prison officers receive financial rewards for caning prisoners."
"Estimates confirm that the situation is worrying: more than 6 000 refugees and 10 000 convicts are victims of this practice each year."
"I believe it is very important that victims from outside of Malaysia should have the right to a fair trial."
"Currently, they are refused basic services, such as interpreting or legal counsel."
"(FI) Mr President, caning by order of a court, where the person receiving the punishment is tied to a frame and his or her back and buttocks are beaten with a stick, is unethical and violates human dignity."
"In Malaysia, this practice has reached epidemic proportions."
"A state that considers corporal punishment an effective way to prevent crime is not one governed by the rule of law, and the EU should not extend additional trade benefits to such a country."
"Such cruel and inhumane forms of punishment should be ended, in whichever country they occur."
"With this resolution, Parliament is quite rightly urging the Malaysian authorities to put an end to corporal punishment and torture immediately, both in its legal system and in practice."
"(PL) Mr President, canings have been carried out in Malaysia since the 19th century, when Great Britain colonised the area."
"The Malaysian Government has recently added yet more crimes to the list of those punishable by caning, and the punishment is meted out for as many as 66 different misdemeanours."
"Prisoners sentenced to caning are detained in prison without any idea of when their punishment will be carried out."
"Amnesty International estimates that around 10 000 sentences of caning are handed down every year, and that 60% of those sentenced are illegal immigrants who do not even understand the punishment due to the language barrier."
"The country's authorities do not see any need to change the law, however, as they regard caning as an effective way to fight crime."
"The European Union has been cooperating closely with Malaysia for eight years."
"EUR 17 million were earmarked in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective to develop the Malaysian economy."
"It is therefore justified to call on our partner to ratify the UN Convention against Torture, and to condemn in no uncertain terms the practice of caning as incompatible with the position of the UN Human Rights Council."
"(RO) Mr President, more than 10 000 citizens are whipped or caned annually in Malaysia, where the legislation stipulates this punishment officially for 66 infringements."
"The list of these crimes has been extended in the last few years, which indicates a worrying tendency."
"The victims are both local and foreign, with numerous and grave abuses being committed against the latter, from the absence of the necessary information or an interpreter to the violation of professional ethics by doctors and the absence of legal assistance."
"I, too, urge European institutions to intensify their efforts in relation to the abolition of this punishment which, under international law, is the equivalent of torture, and to exert pressure to bring about the observance of the right to an objective and impartial trial in Malaysia and the end of the mean treatment of migrants and asylum seekers."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission condemns the use of corporal punishment."
"It conflicts with international human rights principles and norms, as set out by the United Nations."
"These principles are also reflected in the European Union guidelines for EU policy towards third countries on torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."
"The recent report by Amnesty International on the practice of caning in Malaysia is worrying."
"However, the Commission would like to suggest widening the resolution to cover all countries where judicial caning unfortunately still occurs."
"The European Union, together with the United Nations, has quite regularly raised the question of caning with Malaysia."
"Some Member States also did so in the context of the ratification of the UN Convention against Torture and during the UN Human Rights Council's universal periodic review, which took place in February 2009."
"Only last week, at the United Nations seminar on the occasion of Human Rights Day, Malaysia was urged to ratify more UN conventions, in particular, the UN Convention against Torture."
"In early 2010, the same question was raised by the EU Head of Mission directly with the Minister of Foreign Affairs."
"It is an issue to which we pay a lot of attention."
"The European Union and Malaysia will soon begin negotiations on a partnership and cooperation agreement, which will contain provisions on human rights."
"Once this agreement enters into force, it will provide a sound formalised basis for a reinforced and regular dialogue with Malaysia on human rights."
"In the meantime, we will continue raising this issue with the Malaysian authorities."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"2."
"Uganda: the Bahati Bill and discrimination against the LGBT population"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Uganda: Bahati Bill and discrimination against lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people."
"Mr President, Commissioner, exactly one year ago, we adopted a resolution in this House concerning gays and lesbians and the Bahati Bill in Uganda."
"Why return, one year later, with an almost identical resolution?"
"Because the problem is far from solved."
"Firstly, the evangelist movement 'The Family', which was behind this Bahati Bill, has not given up, and we can still see this bill reappearing in Uganda."
"The second reason is that, last October and November, Uganda's Rolling Stone newspaper carried out a name and shame campaign and published a list of Ugandan homosexuals, who were immediately tracked down and attacked and are still in hiding as outcasts today."
"The Ugandan Constitutional Court has stopped the publication of this newspaper but it is clear that the atmosphere has deteriorated."
"This is a manhunt."
"Thirdly, only 13 African countries recognise homosexuals' rights."
"The remaining countries have very different laws, but some of them - Sudan, northern Nigeria, Mauritania - still punish homosexuals with death."
"Yet, and I shall end with this, very recently, the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries made a statement - a somewhat one-sided one in my view - to the effect that they were aware that this issue regarding homosexuals bothered us slightly, but that these aspects were part of their culture."
"No, they are human rights, they are universal values, and we really do want these universal values to be strongly defended by the Commission and by the entire European Union."
"author. - Mr President, societies in Africa are, in general, socially conservative."
"In many African countries, sadly, homosexuality is indeed outlawed."
"Many people in Africa feel threatened by efforts to promote homosexuality, particularly when those efforts are led by NGOs and organisations based in the west."
"There is a widely held perception in some parts of Africa that liberal democracies are trying to push their own, more tolerant, values on societies with very different and ancient traditions."
"But, be that as it may, it does not excuse or justify the rampant homophobia that exists widely in some parts of Africa."
"Sadly, this homophobia is often stirred up by governments and their media mouthpieces."
"Uganda is yet again in the news for the extremism and hysteria of some of its legislators."
"They are supporting a bill that would impose the death penalty, or life imprisonment, on homosexuals, depending on the nature of their so-called crime."
"I, like the ECR Group, reject this draconian bill, which would be an atrocious violation of individual rights, and call on President Museveni to veto it."
"Uganda is a country in which the majority of people survive on a dollar a day: surely the country's legislators can find better ways to serve the interests of Ugandan society than to make gays subject to criminal prosecution."
"author. - Mr President, the so-called Anti-Homosexuality Bill before the Ugandan Parliament provides for the punishment of homosexual acts by imprisonment for terms ranging from seven years to life, or even the death penalty."
"The European Parliament strongly condemns this bill and, in so doing, we are not imposing European values on other states, as some have suggested, in an attempt to avoid responsibility for human rights violations and responsibility for protecting citizens from being attacked on the basis of their sexual orientation."
"The real threat and the climate of fear were underlined in the October and November issues of Rolling Stone, a local newspaper, which listed the names and personal details of people alleged to be homosexual, inciting readers to harm or hang them."
"Several people were consequently attacked."
"In fact, homosexuality is legal in only 13 African countries and it is a criminal offence in 38 others."
"In Mauritania, Sudan and northern Nigeria, it is punishable by death."
"The Ugandan authorities are obliged, in accordance with the Cotonou Agreement, to observe international and human rights, and the Commission, the Council of the European Union and the External Action Service should also make full use of the toolkit for promoting and protecting the enjoyment of human rights by all LGBT people."
"author. - Mr President, the Anti-Homosexuality Bill by David Bahati in the Ugandan Parliament that provides for the punishment of homosexual acts by imprisonment of between seven years and life, as well as the death penalty, is simply unacceptable."
"Let us remember that in Africa, legal homosexuality only exists in 13 countries, and is a criminal offence in 38 countries, whilst in Mauritania, Sudan and northern Nigeria, homosexuality is punished by death."
"This is why we need to reiterate once again the fact that sexual orientation is a matter falling within the remit of the individual's rights of privacy."
"It is guaranteed by international human rights law, according to which equality and non-discrimination should be promoted, while freedom of expression should be guaranteed."
"This is why we need to denounce again any attempt to incite hatred and advocate violence towards any minority group, including on grounds of sex or sexual orientation."
"We need to remind the Ugandan authorities of their obligations under international law and under the Cotonou Agreement."
"This is why I also ask the Commission and the Council, and the European External Action Service as well, to make full use of the toolkit to promote and protect the enjoyment of full human rights by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in their dealings with Uganda."
"Mr President, the attempts being made to discriminate against Ugandan citizens on the grounds of their sexual orientation are a serious matter."
"On this issue, Uganda has the support of many African countries which do not want the international community or the European Union to exert pressure on them to decriminalise homosexuality."
"The misunderstanding is based on the fact that we believe that a ban on discrimination in this area is a universal human right, as Mrs De Keyser said before."
"The majority of African countries do not see it the same way, and this is why dialogue is so difficult."
"We say that we cannot remain silent on such matters, and they say that we are interfering in things that have nothing to do with us."
"The draft amendments to Ugandan legislation really do represent a radical change."
"They introduce the possible use of the death penalty for repeated infringements of the prohibitions already in place, or for aggravated homosexuality, although it is not, in fact, clear what this is supposed to mean."
"We do not agree with these proposals, and we hope that they will not be passed."
"Mr President, Uganda is one of the African states where homosexuality is still severely repressed."
"Indeed, it has one of the most notorious and harshest reputations in this area, since Uganda, under the leadership of American fundamentalist evangelists, of which the Ugandan Head of State is a close associate, has launched a veritable crusade against homosexuals. We have lost count of the numbers of people who have suffered persecution and torture simply because of their sexuality."
"Muslims and Christians have united - a first in the country - to condemn this abomination."
"Christopher Senyonjo, a 70-year-old Anglican bishop, was banned from officiating by his superiors for having been one of the few to have taken a stand in favour of homosexuals."
"The bill already mentioned may indeed reappear at any time."
"It goes as far as to sentence to death homosexuals suspected of being HIV positive or of having relations with minors. It calls for them to be reported."
"The local newspaper Rolling Stone, which has nothing to do with the magazine of the same name, actually published lists with the names and addresses of gay leaders under the revolting headline: 'Hang them!'"
"The publication of this rag has been temporarily banned, but the damage has been done, as has already been said."
"In Africa, homosexuality is very often seen as an evil from the West which is causing Africa to lose its ancestral values."
"NGOs say that 500 000 of the 32 million inhabitants of Uganda are gay."
"Many of them apply for asylum in European countries."
"Could we at least do our best to ensure that special consideration is given to these applications, and indeed to all men and women who are victims of oppression and torture?"
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I am alarmed by the use of criminal law against consenting same-sex relations taking place in private."
"This is already part of Ugandan law and the punishment can be life imprisonment."
"However, the Bahati Bill would make things even worse."
"The death penalty could be used, while association and expression of LGBT issues would be effectively banned."
"The new bill will increase the climate of fear and hostility in a country where persecution of LGBT people is already under way."
"People would be required to report on each other on privacy matters."
"The lives of these people will be endangered."
"Human dignity will have no meaning in Uganda if such a law is adopted."
"We must not let this happen."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, of course, much has changed in this last year."
"On 23 November, this House itself reiterated the principle of the universality of human rights and non-discrimination as a basis on which to enhance our partnership with the JPA."
"This House also called for the reinforcement of the principle of non-negotiable human rights clauses and sanctions for failure to respect such clauses, inter alia, with regard to discrimination, etc. based on sexual orientation."
"The fact is that these countries choose to work with us."
"They choose to have partnerships with us."
"We have the ACP JPA, we have the Cotonou Agreements."
"Therefore, we are asking them to engage with us on shared, universal principles."
"These are non-negotiable."
"If they do not want to operate on that basis, I call on the Commission and the Council to take the necessary sanctions to reinforce the fact that we have principles which we will stand up for."
"Equally, in the future of the EU-Africa Strategic Partnership, we urge that all actions conducted under the terms of the various partnerships be pursued without discrimination on any grounds, including sexual orientation."
"It is not colonialism to stand up for the rights of others."
"Human rights are universal and indivisible, and to stand back and do nothing when somebody else's basic human rights are attacked is to be complicit in that action."
"You cannot promote homosexuality in Africa."
"Anyone in Africa who woke up and said: 'Today I am going to be homosexual' would be insane."
"Their life would be under threat and their family would have to turn them in to the police."
"Imagine you are that person and take the action necessary to defend those rights."
"Mr President, the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, ban discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation."
"The European Union not only has obligations in relation to human rights within its territory, but also an international duty to insist on compliance with these rights and to criticise abuses when dealing with third countries, particularly when we provide financial support through the European Development Fund to third countries like Uganda, which have entered into partnership agreements with us."
"Accordingly, we actually have the right to comment when these third countries fail to meet the human rights requirements set down in such partnership agreements."
"Hence, Uganda must respect international human rights standards because it was party to the Cotonou Agreement, which sets down our organised development aid to the ACP countries."
"Just one year ago, we called on Uganda not to follow through on its plans for a law to criminalise homosexuals."
"One year on, the situation has deteriorated."
"There is still the threat of long prison sentences or even the death penalty."
"With others, I myself demonstrated in front of the Ugandan Embassy in May of this year."
"This had no effect."
"We wish to emphasise once again that the EU is generally opposed to the death penalty and to homophobic legislation of this kind."
"Mr President, this is an interesting and important debate."
"I would like to draw your attention to two problems."
"Firstly, the fact of the matter is that Uganda is not an island of discrimination in a sea of respect for human rights."
"Three quarters of African countries have extremely harsh regulations on this issue, which are tantamount to discrimination."
"This is unquestionably not so much Uganda's problem as a wider problem involving the whole continent and African culture."
"The second question is as follows: it goes without saying that Uganda does not lead the field in respect for human rights in Africa."
"We know of many examples of violations of human rights, which means that this matter is part of a wider problem, and we must, of course, speak openly about this problem."
"(RO) Mr President, our resolution is aimed at extremely serious cases of human rights violations and, unfortunately, the punishment of homosexuality as a criminal offence is the norm in Africa."
"This is reflected in the legislation of 38 states, with only 13 African states considering it legal."
"In this context, the bill attempting to enforce certain sanctions in Uganda, from prison sentences to capital punishment, represents a serious attack against human rights, including the right to privacy."
"The publication in a local newspaper of a black list of 100 individuals accused of homosexuality and the incitement of readers to hang them is an example of a concrete threat to a community blamed for its sexual orientation."
"As indicated in our resolution, our measure is not aimed, as we are often accused, at the imposition of specifically European values, but at the defence of human rights, which is one of the major objectives of the European Union."
"I believe that in this sense, the European External Action Service and the other European institutions need to impose more severe sanctions in order to ensure compliance with the international agreements to which Uganda is a signatory."
"(RO) Mr President, we also discussed Uganda and homosexuality in this House several months ago."
"Since then, nothing significant has happened."
"Certainly, sometimes it is said that 'no news, good news'. In this case, however, this is not true, because while David Bahati's project was not voted for, it was not withdrawn, either."
"It remains blocked in the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, and all the international pressure exerted did not manage, in the end, to bring about this effect, namely, the withdrawal of the project."
"What is truly horrific, and some of my fellow Members have already expanded on this, is the anti-gay campaign that is taking place in this country."
"We obviously continue to count on the rationality of the authorities and, eventually, on the victory of a principle which says 'No to discrimination'."
"Mr President, the hate campaign in Uganda against gay and lesbian men and women is truly appalling."
"The whipping up, by some religious elements and by sections of the media, of a vicious and reactionary homophobic campaign, which includes threats to kill gay people, means that very many lesbians, gays and bisexual and transgender people in Uganda are now living in great insecurity and fear."
"It is contemptible that some politicians are also using this issue and whipping up hatred, proposing even the execution of people who are gay."
"I salute the courage of members of the gay community in Uganda who bravely fight each day against this menacing threat to their identities and their very lives."
"The homophobic campaign is driven by smears, lies and distortions about gay people and what being gay means."
"The strongest message must go out to the Ugandan Government - including a review of aid, although, of course, we do not want to hurt ordinary Ugandans."
"We should encourage active solidarity with organisations in Uganda which champion the rights of gay people, to assist them in this crucial fight for justice and human rights, and for the basic right to be who you are."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the draft Anti-Homosexuality Bill which was introduced in the Ugandan Parliament raises serious human rights issues."
"The protection of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people is a priority for the EU."
"I fully share the European Parliament's concerns about the situation in Uganda, but also in other countries where punitive and discriminatory legislation against LGBT people has been adopted or is under consideration."
"The Commission considers that the criminalisation of homosexuality as foreseen in the draft bill goes against obligations under the United Nations Human Rights Convention, to which Uganda is a party and by which it consequently has to abide."
"The draft bill also goes against the United Nations declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity."
"The EU Presidency and the EU Head of Mission in Uganda raised this issue with the Ugandan Government on several occasions during meetings with the President, Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice in formal political dialogue meetings, and also with the Uganda Human Rights Commission."
"The publication by the Rolling Stone newspaper on 2 October 2010 of a list with the photographs and names and addresses of people who were identified as gay, together with the headline 'Hang them', was an outrageous act that put the lives of these people at risk, and we fully condemn it."
"The European Union delegation continues to monitor the situation closely, together with the EU Member States' missions represented in Uganda, as well as with partner countries like Norway and the United States and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights."
"The matter has also been addressed in the technical Human Rights Working Group, which is a forum for developing partners in Uganda to discuss, monitor, coordinate and take concrete action in human rights-related cases."
"The Commission intends to keep raising its concerns in relation to the draft Anti-Homosexuality Bill and to other actions to persecute LGBT people in Uganda on every occasion."
"The Commission will continue to support local human rights organisations in their efforts to change attitudes in the country and to improve the legal situation for LGBT people."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the next debate."
"3."
"Eritrean refugees held hostage in Sinai"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the subject of Eritrean refugees held hostage in Sinai."
"author. - Mr President, about 250 Eritrean migrants are believed to be held hostage in the Sinai desert and inhumane treatment and rape are reported while these people await a ransom that needs to be paid to human traffickers for their release."
"Recent events are part of a network smuggling sub-Saharan migrants through Egypt to Israel that has been operating in the Sinai since 2007."
"The Egyptian authorities are making welcome efforts to investigate the information provided by the UNHCR. Diplomatic procedures with the Egyptian authorities should be stepped up by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to eliminate the trafficking networks and prevent people from being smuggled."
"At the same time, Egypt should improve the treatment of refugees according to international standards."
"This means that, during the justified defence of borders, no excessive or even lethal force should be used against immigrants or refugees, and this advice is something that we might also give ourselves in the EU once in a while."
"Mr President, the situation is very serious."
"We think that this issue - which is also being trailed by Europe's media - ought to be dealt with by the European Union and by Parliament, as well as urging the Commission to look into it, since it is a real humanitarian emergency."
"In this case, the Member States must do everything to try and help these refugees to leave that territory and we think that they could be accepted in European states."
"We call on the Commission to do everything possible to carry out this action, including using the funds available through the European Fund for Refugees."
"author. - Mr President, the ECR Group condemns the appalling treatment being suffered by these innocent and mainly Eritrean victims of what amounts to a modern-day form of slavery inflicted by people traffickers."
"We welcome, too, the efforts made by the Egyptian Government to investigate the allegations and secure the refugees' release, but we should also be focusing on why these unfortunate individuals flee in the first place."
"The answer is because the regime of Eritrean President Afewerki is one of the most repressive on the planet."
"Anyone with a chance of fleeing his dictatorship does so, and some are able to build a better life for themselves elsewhere."
"Those unable to leave Eritrea are either subject to open-ended conscription in the army, or have to scratch out a living on the fringes of an economy bankrupted by years of futile war with neighbouring Ethiopia, widespread corruption and mismanagement of the economy."
"Eritrea has never held a national election."
"Recent disclosures from the WikiLeaks website show that US diplomats described Afewerki as a cruel and defiant leader."
"I have no compunction about saying so publicly."
"We should do all we can to unseat this appalling African tyrant, we should end all EU aid to his regime and we should suspend the Cotonou Agreement privileges that his country enjoys."
"Mr President, every year, there are thousands of people who, driven by the difficult situation in the Horn of Africa, try to cross the border between Egypt and Israel."
"Many of these people end up, unfortunately, in the hands of Bedouin traffickers."
"We are talking about criminal networks that have no consideration at all for human dignity, as the lives of these people become a bargaining chip."
"According to the information provided by NGO activists working for the protection of these emigrants, incredible sums were requested, reaching up to USD 8 000 for the release of each person."
"Certainly, we cannot remain indifferent to the suffering of these people who are subjected to a treatment of exceptional cruelty."
"Moreover, I would like to draw your attention to the vulnerable situation of women, who are repeatedly subjected to rape."
"At the same time, I believe that we should have a constructive attitude in this case."
"This means that we should recognise the efforts undertaken by the Egyptian authorities for their release and, in particular, support this country in the fight against human trafficking."
"We therefore have need not only of tough words, but of cooperation and concrete actions in this extremely complex issue, where a single state cannot cope."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation of the Eritrean refugees currently in the Sinai desert is very serious, as has already been described by several fellow Members."
"Naturally, we must deal severely with the human traffickers who are currently holding these refugees hostage and demanding extremely high ransoms for them."
"However, at the same time, we must also protect the victims, because we cannot just want to deal harshly with the traffickers and then completely forget the victims."
"We also need to acknowledge the reasons that led them to be in the Sinai desert: their migratory route used to be through Libya, but the agreements between Italy and Libya, and between the EU and Libya, portrayed so many times here by the Commission as good news, mean that people coming from what has - quite rightly - been called a 'giant concentration camp' and 'Africa's North Korea' have nowhere to run."
"Action is needed, therefore: not just action in Egypt, which is clearly doing far less than it should be, but also in the European Union itself."
"To start with, I call on the European Commission to quickly send a delegation to Egypt in order to find out what the situation is on the ground."
"Action is also needed in all our institutions, because Eritreans are a clear case for resettlement, a policy that we have alongside the European Refugee Fund."
"These refugees cannot return to Eritrea and cannot remain in a transit country: the only solution is resettlement."
"Ladies and gentlemen, do you know why the resettlement package is not moving forward?"
"It is not moving forward because in May, Parliament had already done its part of the codecision procedure on the resettlement case, but because of the famous dispute over delegated acts, the Council refused to do its bit."
"If the resettlement package had been adopted, we would now have the emergency procedure that Parliament inserted into the report that I myself wrote and which was adopted here with 500 votes: the European Commission would be able to start an emergency procedure to resettle these refugees."
"As the Council did not do its part in what we should be calling 'a co-indecision procedure', those people are in the Sinai desert, who knows for how long?"
"This co-indecision procedure has consequences for the real lives of real people and it is time that the Council did its share of the chores."
"Mr President, it is thanks to a telephone call between an Eritrean priest in Italy and an Eritrean hostage that the European public learned that unprincipled human traffickers are now threatening to shoot the stranded Eritrean hostages if a ransom is not paid."
"The hostage takers have shown no scruples and have already beaten or shot some people."
"This brutal crime prompted a closer look at what is happening at the border between Egypt and Israel, an area in which an increasing number of refugees are stranded as they try to enter Europe or Israel, but lack the necessary papers."
"There is a military exclusion zone on the Egyptian side."
"Anyone entering this area will be answerable to a military tribunal."
"According to Human Rights Watch, at least 85 unarmed refugees have been shot there since 2007, trying to cross the border."
"The Israeli Government talks of more than 1 000 migrants trying to enter their country without papers each month and has started to increase security and monitoring along the border."
"In addition, a large detention camp has been set up in the Negev Desert."
"We are calling on the relevant governments to cooperate with the United Nations Refugee Agency and to guarantee the protection and rights of refugees at their borders."
"However, we also clearly recognise that we in Europe have a responsibility for the fate of those migrants who are turned away from our outer borders and who find themselves unable to return to their homes, suffering human rights violations as a consequence, as in the case of these Eritrean refugees."
"Mr President, the situation of the Eritrean refugees in Sinai is tragic."
"They are looking for a better life, but they often meet with death, torture and oppression."
"They are exploited and cheated."
"The Egyptian authorities are attempting to fight the problem of human trafficking, but their response is not always effective."
"We must help the refugees, the hostages and all those who need our help."
"We should support the Israeli and Egyptian authorities in their fight against human trafficking."
"It is also worth giving some thought to the reasons behind these dangerous occurrences."
"I believe that we should aim to improve the situation in Eritrea itself and in other countries in the Horn of Africa, since improving the situation in African countries may reduce migratory pressure."
"We will not solve the problem by combating the social ills which are themselves caused by migration."
"We can only limit the less desirable effects, and the extent to which the determination of refugees is preyed upon."
"I would ask you to support the motion for a resolution by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"We are convinced that our motion for a resolution is an improvement on the joint resolution in this instance."
"Mr President, Egypt is not just turning a blind eye to the horrific treatment and exploitation of African refugees attempting to escape over Sinai to Israel from their countries, specifically Somalia and Eritrea."
"Egypt is also deporting them, even though they obviously qualify as refugees and asylum seekers, as they come either from one country that is in a terrible struggle with terrorism and without law or order, or from another - Eritrea - that is one of the most oppressive and tyrannical in the world."
"In fact, the Egyptian authorities are practising a policy of shoot to kill and 85 migrants have already died in Sinai since 2007, according to a Human Rights Watch report."
"We call on the Egyptian authorities to comply with their obligations as regards human rights and migrants and refugees in particular, and for them to work with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees."
"We also call on the European authorities to do the same and to fully support what Mr Tavares was saying on this subject regarding the possibility of resettlement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us be honest."
"The resolutions, as they are currently worded, are a watered down version of what we started out with at the beginning of the week."
"Let us once again be clear: 'The situation is serious'."
"We are also highlighting the fact that Eritrean refugees in the Sinai are being held hostage."
"Yet, we are not prepared to discuss the links between Italy and Libya and the closing of Europe to migrants, as a result of which political refugees have had to flee to other places."
"They are now having to take routes which are even more dangerous than before."
"Anyone who leaves Eritrea automatically becomes a political refugee, because it is impossible to go back and, if you did, you would be putting your family in danger."
"What pains me is that we, in this House, are not prepared to say: if Europe so badly wants to protect itself from migrants, it will have to open up its embassies in Eritrea, in order to make it easier for people to apply for asylum."
"We were not permitted to include that proposal in this resolution."
"When I hear the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) refer to all the things that need to happen in Egypt, then I think: what is it that we have to do and how can we refuse to accept that people are at risk here, simply because we are reluctant to take on the responsibility?"
"We are shutting people out and, in so doing, we are putting lives at risk."
"Mr President, the Sinai border has become a route via which thousands of Eritreans fleeing their own country attempt to get a better life."
"In their illegal pilgrimage for freedom, however, they are dependent on the assistance of smugglers who are willing, at a price, to help the refugees across the Sinai border, even without the necessary papers."
"In this lawless trade, refugees in the hands of the smuggling gangs have almost no rights at all, and are dependent on the vicissitudes of fate and on the whims of those into whose hands they have, for a fee, entrusted their own fate."
"The death of seven Eritrean refugees killed on the Egyptian-Israeli border reveals to us something of the grim plight of refugees illegally journeying in search of freedom."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is therefore quite right for us to engage in a solution to this problem and, together with the governments of the affected countries, to help to find a civilised solution to the problem of the Eritrean refugees."
"Mr President, on 7 December, the UNHCR expressed concern that some 250 Eritrean refugees are being held in Sinai by Bedouin smugglers."
"We are aware that these refugees were compelled to pay a specific amount of money for their wish to live in better conditions."
"Reportedly, the refugees are kept in containers in the desert and are often beaten."
"The attitude of the Eritrean Government itself is alarming: instead of protecting its citizens, it considers them unwanted dissidents."
"We call for rapid and joint action, primarily by Egypt and Israel, to stop the traffickers, to dismantle this organised crime network and, certainly, to strengthen efforts to protect current and future refugees by implementing UNHCR provisions and standards."
"(RO) Mr President, right from the outset, I wish to emphasise that I support without reservation the resolution put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"Despite the clarity of the text, an agreement has not been reached with the other groups for the adoption of a common resolution, which is regrettable."
"The situation in the Horn of Africa is an alarming one."
"This region has become one of the important action centres of organised crime groups, given the high number of African emigrants in transit in this area."
"The 250 hostages have suffered an inhuman and degrading treatment, and their situation is getting worse."
"Moreover, the prerequisites of an imminent release do not exist, as the families of the hostages cannot pay the requested ransom."
"Therefore, the European Parliament should send out a clear message for their release."
"Urgent action must be taken against criminal organisations, they should be brought to justice, and torture camps should be permanently closed."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally, I deeply condemn the way the Eritrean refugees are treated, and likewise of course, I support the fact that the European Union should take steps to resolve the situation of these refugees as soon as possible."
"However, the direction formulated in this report is, to put it simply, a dead end."
"I consider two points to be utterly bewildering."
"That we set up a fund in order to aid these refugees is completely acceptable to me insofar as there are currently millions of citizens in the EU living in existential uncertainty and extreme poverty."
"Over three million people in Hungary are living below the poverty line, the majority of pensioners cannot afford to pay for their medicine and, as a matter of fact, this trend has been on the rise across Europe."
"Therefore, we should first be looking to help people in Europe while, at the same time, also expressing our empathy with the refugees, of course."
"The other issue is that Member States should admit the refugees voluntarily."
"When will you realise that the European Union is saturated with immigrants?"
"The EU should act as a mediator between Eritrea and the Eritrean refugees to ensure their safe return home."
"(RO) Mr President, the vast majority of Eritrean citizens that can now be found in the Sinai Desert have fled out of the way of an oppressive regime and, as such, should be regarded as refugees according to UN standards."
"Therefore, I believe that we need to insist that Egypt meets its international obligations to provide them with assistance."
"However, the matter of greatest concern, I believe, is the inhumane treatment these migrants are subjected to when held as hostages in the desert in expectation of a ransom."
"In particular, the claims of rape by dozens of women are revolting and should mobilise the international community."
"In the same way, human trafficking in Africa has reached alarming proportions."
"Dozens of migrants were killed by Egyptian security services in recent years while attempting to cross illegally into Israel."
"I believe that human trafficking in this area should be combated with other methods, and I think that access on the part of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is necessary in order to ensure vital assistance for these people."
"(PL) Mr President, Eritrean refugees are in a tragic situation."
"When considering this tragedy, however, we should also remember the reason for this state of affairs."
"The fact of the matter is that fundamental human rights are widely violated in Eritrea."
"Mass persecution occurs on a huge scale, with political opponents, Christians and also thousands of ordinary people as victims."
"This is the real reason behind the tragic problem we are discussing today, and this is why we must do everything to change the EU's policy towards the Eritrean authorities, all the more so when we remember that the current leader of the country was warmly welcomed in Brussels by the European Commission in 2007, even though he is responsible for such terrible suffering by so many people, which forces them to flee and brings about ever more tragedies of this kind. This is why it is time for a pragmatic and decisive policy towards this tyrant."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament."
"The reports received speak of several hundred refugees, from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia, apparently being held hostage in Sinai by traffickers requesting hard payment for their release."
"Since the first notification, we have been following the case, establishing the facts, assessing the situation and taking appropriate action."
"The European Union delegation in Cairo has close contacts with local civil-society organisations and liaises with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' regional representation in Cairo."
"They are very much following the case."
"In coordination with the embassies of the EU Member States, the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been approached."
"The EU has expressed our concerns, as well as our strong belief, that the Egyptian authorities should take appropriate measures to liberate these people and grant them appropriate protection."
"There are reports of ongoing investigations to find the group of refugees, and we hope that things will be clearer in the next few days."
"This case is not the only cause for concern."
"Migrants and refugees in Egypt still suffer from many protection gaps."
"The most serious incidents are reported in the Sinai."
"Many migrants intending to cross to Israel via the Sinai border are subject to abuse and mistreatment."
"We have raised this issue several times with our Egyptian counterparts in the framework of the regular subcommittee meetings discussing either migration issues or political affairs, including human rights."
"The latest occasion when the point was raised was at the meeting of the EU-Egypt Association Committee on 14 December in Cairo."
"The EU has regularly invited Egyptian authorities to improve the quality of the assistance and protection offered to asylum seekers and refugees, and has offered financial and technical assistance in this endeavour."
"The EU has also invited the Egyptian authorities to ensure that the principle of non-refoulement is observed for all migrants in need of international protection, including Eritreans."
"The EU has asked that the UNHCR be given full authorisation to implement its mandate throughout the entire territory of Egypt, including in the Sinai region."
"There have been some positive developments that should be stressed."
"In the spring of this year, Egypt adopted new legislation criminalising human trafficking and also protecting its victims."
"Another welcome development was the adoption of a Transplant Act, which criminalises organ trafficking."
"We hope that the Egyptian administration will now take effective measures to ensure efficient implementation of this legal framework, and we have offered our cooperation in this field."
"We will continue to support the work of the UNHCR and civil-society organisations to ensure better living conditions, as well as proper legal protection, for migrants and refugees living in the country."
"We will continue to follow with care the case of the hostage refugees in Sinai and we will pursue our contacts with the Egyptian authorities in this regard."
"I truly hope for an early solution to this case and I regret the reported loss of eight lives so far."
"Mr President, the Commissioner has read his well-prepared answer as if no one had addressed the Commission with particular points."
"You asked to speak on the Rules of Procedure."
"You should speak on that and not something else."
"Mr President, of course it is a point of order."
"We particularly asked the Commission to indicate if it would send a delegation to Egypt to see the situation on the ground."
"The Commission could at least ask for the completion of the resettlement."
"Codecision will give you power ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Unfortunately, that is not a point of order."
"Naturally, you are free to put this question to the Commission and the Commission can decide whether to answer you."
"Otherwise, this matter does not come under the Rules of Procedure."
"That brings the debate to a close."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law(debate)"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"1."
"Malaysia: the practice of caning ("
"(RO) Mr President, before we proceed to the vote, I would like to request on behalf of my group that when we vote on the situation of Eritrean refugees, we abandon the roll call vote for a joint resolution and request a roll call vote for the resolution proposed by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"You have heard your fellow Member's request."
"If there are no objections, we shall proceed as suggested."
"I see no objections."
"2."
"Uganda: the Bahati Bill and discrimination against the LGBT population ("
"3."
"Eritrean refugees held hostage in Sinai ("
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment aims to make our judgment on Egypt's actions more incisive."
"It is not only a matter of acknowledging that Egypt has at least done something, but asking it to intervene quickly and immediately to free these hostages, urging the country never to use lethal force to repel people crossing the Sinai."
"The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is also called upon to make immediate contact with the people currently being held hostage."
"'urges the Egyptian authorities to take all necessary measures to secure the release of Eritreans held hostage, to avoid the use of lethal force against illegal immigrants crossing the borders of the country, to protect their dignity and their physical and psychological integrity and to guarantee that detained migrants have the opportunity to contact the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and that the High Commissioner has access to all asylum seekers and refugees in custody'."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add a paragraph to the resolution, which we feel is important and will not affect the structure of it too much."
"It concerns paragraph 9 of the joint resolution."
"I shall read it: 'invites Member States to tackle this humanitarian emergency through the voluntary resettlement in the European Union of all the asylum seekers involved in this crisis; asks the European Commission to coordinate this operation and use available funding through the European Refugees Fund'."
"(IT) Mr President, I should like to ask the proposer of the amendment to clarify an issue."
"According to the text read out, the requested intervention concerns all those who request the right of asylum."
"I should rather say 'those who have the right of asylum', because 'who request' is too dangerous, as there is the risk that anyone can request the right of asylum."
"Vice-versa, by coordinating this amendment with the intervention of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, it will be the latter that will assess this."
"In any case, I should ask the proposer to modify the amendment with the words 'those who have the right of asylum'."
"I am aware that ten percent is generally sufficient."
"However, that would not have been enough in this case."
"Anyway, I did ask in advance and you had plenty of time."
"We will now vote on this amendment."

"Statement by the President"
"I have several things to say as we begin."
"There are five brief points."
"Thursday, 27 January, will mark the 66th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau German Nazi concentration and extermination camp."
"Every year on this day, we honour the memory of the more than 1 million people who were murdered there."
"This gives us the strength to work together to build a peaceful future for a united Europe, a Europe which will not experience such nightmares again."
"Secondly, on 13 January, the people of Lithuania celebrated the 20th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday', when the Soviet army tried to overthrow the democratically elected government of the independent Lithuania."
"Lithuanians defended their liberty, and today enjoy equal rights as members of the Euro-Atlantic community."
"In remembering this anniversary, an anniversary which is important for Europe, we express solidarity, today, with the people of Belarus, who are also our neighbours, and who are still waiting for freedom and democracy to come to their country."
"Thirdly, on 23 December 2010, the European Union ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities."
"The Convention, together with the European Commission's disability strategy, will enable equal civil, political and economic rights to be guaranteed by 2020 to the nearly 80 million citizens of the Union who are affected by some kind of disability."
"Fourthly, I would also like to reiterate that we are seriously concerned by the disappearance of the Chinese lawyer, Gao Zhisheng."
"According to the latest reports, he is being mistreated and subjected to torture."
"The European Parliament has already taken up Mr Zhisheng's case several times."
"Today, I would like to call upon the Chinese authorities to reveal the place where he is being detained and give details of his state of health."
"Finally, since our last meeting before Christmas, the Belgian Presidency has ended, and the leadership of the European Union Council has been assumed by Hungary."
"We are going to talk about both presidencies during this part-session of Parliament."
"Since our last meeting, important political events have also taken place."
"I am thinking of the election in Belarus and the recent clashes in Tunisia."
"Both of these are on the order of business of our plenary part-session."
"I would also like to remind everyone that several serious natural disasters struck in the last weeks of the Christmas period."
"We sympathise with the victims' families, and we would like to express our condolences to them and to the governments of the countries affected."

"The final draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 13 January 2011, pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take the opportunity of the order of business to formally request that Baroness Ashton comes to the Chamber of the European Parliament to report on the actions that have been taken, or that she will take, regarding what is happening to the world's Christians."
"We should like her to come here with a report, so that Parliament may be informed about everything in detail."
"I am sorry, Mr Salatto."
"We are having an official debate about that on Wednesday at 15:00."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to refer to Rule 173 on compliance with the Rules of Procedure, in order to point out that Rule 116 is being infringed, because this is the third consecutive plenary part-session of the European Parliament which has not included Question Time with the Council in the order of business, as provided for in Rule 116."
"Please could you explain why that is and what the reason is and ensure, in future, that you defend the right of the European Parliament and of its members to exercise parliamentary control over the Council."
"We will make a decision about this very soon."
"It concerns the Treaty of Lisbon and the new relations between the European Parliament and the Council."
"We now have a bicameral parliament in the European Union."
"The European Parliament and the Council legislate on equal terms."
"Relations in the Union have changed, but I would propose that we do not continue this discussion, because this matter will be clarified in the near future."
"Thank you, Mr Chountis, for calling attention to this. It will be clarified very soon."
"(DE) Mr President, what I find questionable is the fact that, with a view to possible future changes, a parliamentary right - namely question time - is being withdrawn without any basis whatsoever."
"As you said yourself, the decision has not yet been taken."
"That being the case, we should continue with question time until a decision has been taken, rather than pre-emptively acquiescing to a decision that has not yet been made."
"I will tell you quite honestly that I think it is wrong because, in matters relating to foreign policy and enlargement policy, the Council is not a second Chamber but a body that, clearly, we must subject to parliamentary scrutiny."
"(Applause)"
"I would like to thank both of you for raising this matter."
"I want to assure everyone that I will raise this at the next meeting of the Conference of Presidents this Thursday."
"As you know, the order of business is drawn up at these meetings."
"We will decide how this matter will be handled in future."
"The Conference of Presidents is responsible for the order of business, and we will discuss the matter this Thursday."
"Thank you."
"We proceed to the order of business."
"Monday"
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that the debate on the situation in Tunisia be wound up by the adoption of a resolution, which is something we had not been planning."
"So there is a proposal to adopt a resolution on the matter."
"I understand Mr Cohn-Bendit wants to say something about this request."
"Mr President, you are aware that the events in Tunisia have got out of hand, and also we can be pleased that Mr Ben Ali has left the country."
"The situation in these next few weeks will therefore be very tense in Tunisia."
"I think that Parliament needs to draw up a short resolution to ask some very specific things of the Council and the Commission."
"You are aware that elections may be held six to eight weeks from now, so we do not have the time to wait until February."
"The Union must act, we must act now, and our action must be based on a resolution that we should vote on on Thursday at noon."
"I understand that, in view of the situation, this House will be very enthusiastic about finally being able to approve a resolution on Tunisia."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not believe that the resolution will alter the situation in Tunisia, so therefore I am against it."
"Concerning debates held pursuant to Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left has made a request for the debate on 'Brazil: extradition of Cesare Battisti' to be removed from the agenda."
"Mr Tavares would like to move this request."
"Mr Tavares, you have the floor."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, some colleagues took the initiative of putting an urgency resolution on the agenda on Brazil's refusal to extradite Cesare Battisti to Italy."
"I understand their motives, but as I shall demonstrate, this is not, at present, a human rights case."
"It is not an urgent case and it is not even a 'breach of the Rule of Law' case."
"Furthermore, it comes at a terrible moment when Brazil is facing the worst natural disaster in its history."
"Cesare Battisti is in prison."
"He is awaiting the decision of the Brazilian Supreme Court and the Supreme Court is currently not in session during the southern hemisphere's summer holiday."
"There is no reason to believe that there will not be an independent decision."
"I expressed my solidarity with the families of the victims in this case, and rest assured I have no sympathy with political violence either from the right or the left, but we should use the urgencies to debate Southern Sudan, the case of Buchtar Tabuni in Indonesia, or the Palestinian man shot dead in his bed."
"Is the Parliament going to allocate to President Dilma Rousseff, just after her groundbreaking election and for no sound formal reason, the kind of debate that we usually reserve for people like Mugabe?"
"I would ask you to remove Brazil from the urgencies on the agenda."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group and, I think, all of Parliament, I should like to really emphasise our sympathy with the people and government of Brazil for their real sorrow in relation to the floods of recent days."
"Hundreds of people lost their lives and we should like to make our sympathy felt."
"At the same time, on behalf of the proposers and, I hope, all of Parliament, I reiterate our firm intention to debate this issue, because the request for justice has still not been heard, and because the Cesare Battisti issue needs to be further deliberated upon by the European Parliament, which must make its voice heard in the international arena."
"(NL) Mr President, I would like to support the request made by Mr Tavares because this is not a matter of urgency."
"Mr Battisti is in prison and there is no reason to believe that he will be released any time soon."
"We should not, in my view, interfere in the personal matters of people who are still on trial."
"Documents received: see Minutes"
"Statement by the President of the European Parliament on the situation in Tunisia"
"President. - Ladies and gentlemen, it is with great anxiety, but also with great hope, that we have been watching the events which have unfolded in recent weeks in Tunisia."
"Peaceful demonstrations in defence of legitimate demands turned into bloody clashes - which we deplore - when the Tunisian authorities turned against their own citizens."
"Today, we pay tribute to the victims of these events."
"We extend our profound sympathy to all those who have lost family or friends."
"In particular, we remember the first victim of the clashes - a young man named Mohamed Bouazizi."
"His tragic gesture has forever become a symbol of Tunisian society's wave of democratic feeling."
"Let us observe a minute's silence in memory of our Tunisian friends."
"Please stand."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Thank you."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the 'Jasmine Revolution' continues."
"In many respects, this is a truly historical time."
"I would like to express profound respect for the courage and determination of the citizens of Tunisia."
"It is they who are the source of the changes."
"It is, however, only the beginning of a long road."
"As Europeans, we share the aspirations of Tunisians and want to go with them on the road to achieving these aspirations in full."
"Europeans are particularly sensitive to social justice, equal opportunities, free speech, democracy, genuine pluralism and the ability to shape one's own political future."
"This is why we do not remain indifferent, today."
"In addition, we call for the changes to be peaceful in character."
"They must serve justice and the rule of law."
"Furthermore, we have some fundamental demands."
"Firstly, the release of all those who have been arbitrarily arrested."
"Secondly, the conduct of independent investigations into serious charges of corruption, and also into cases of death and the abuse of force."
"Thirdly, transparent and truly democratic presidential and parliamentary elections, monitored by local and foreign observers and, fourthly, we support the efforts to create a government of national unity which would represent all Tunisians."
"The European Union and Tunisia have been linked by a partnership for many years - they are our neighbours from across the Mediterranean Sea."
"This partnership must, above all, be in the interests of our citizens - Tunisians and Europeans."
"Our partnership, if it is to be credible and significant, must support the Tunisians on their road to profound change."
"We must help Tunisia achieve success."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us support the Tunisians."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the recent popular uprising in Tunisia is unprecedented in the modern history of the country."
"On 17 December 2010, a young university graduate set himself on fire out of sheer desperation after police seized the fruit and vegetables that he was selling for a living."
"Less than a month later, nationwide protests have brought about the definitive departure of President Ben Ali."
"The European Union has condemned the violence of the repression during the last days of the regime."
"As I speak, the security situation remains precarious."
"Looting and violence are still being reported."
"Tunisia remains in a very delicate phase, although the first news about the formation of a national unity government is just coming in."
"Despite some uncertainty, the message of the Tunisian people is loud and clear: Tunisia wants to be a stable democracy that fully respects fundamental rights and freedoms."
"It wants free and fair, inclusive elections."
"The people want to write a new page in their history and we want to support them in that endeavour."
"Respect for the Constitution and the steps being taken, as we speak, to bring together a national solidarity government, are moves in the right direction."
"Of course, this is only a start."
"The European Union has never ceased to remind Tunisia of its international obligations in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"Ever since the start of my term of office - since my hearing before this House in fact - I have repeated that enhanced status clearly means enhanced commitments in all areas of our relationship, including fundamental freedoms and human rights."
"I have stressed in all meetings with the Tunisian authorities, on behalf of the European Commission, that they had to deliver on their democratic and human rights commitments."
"At the very first session of negotiations on the action plan for statut avancé, I insisted personally, in an unprecedented and extremely clear way, that any use of the new Article 61a of the Penal Code would be seen by us as incompatible with statut avancé and with our shared values."
"And, by the way, if there were still sceptics on both sides who thought that these values were shared only in theory, they should listen again and again to the voice of the Tunisian street over the last days and weeks."
"What was this if not a solemn demand for democracy and for more economic justice?"
"As Catherine Ashton and I stated this morning, the European Union stands ready to support a truly inclusive electoral process with appropriate guarantees."
"We hope its modalities can be announced as soon as possible, once the government of national unity has been shaped and starts its work."
"We are ready to provide immediate assistance in preparing and organising the electoral process, as well as lasting support for a genuine democratic transition."
"We are also working on a broader package to assist - as soon as the situation stabilises - with, inter alia, economic development, close attention to the social problems faced by Tunisia's youth, and consolidating the rule of law and the judiciary."
"We will, of course, continue consulting closely with this House and with the Member States on this process."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy is based on essential values shared by the European Union and its partners: democracy, human rights and an open market economy, with a view to building together a shared area of democracy, stability and prosperity."
"The Commission has always stressed that these values were an essential component of our neighbourhood policy, towards both our southern and our eastern neighbours."
"With its strong middle class, high level of education, closeness to Europe and overall moderation, Tunisia is well placed to take the leap towards democracy that people have now asked for with such force and courage, and I think everyone should agree that the European Union also has a strong interest in a democratic, prosperous and stable Tunisia."
"We have a long-standing and robust relationship with Tunisia and close links between our peoples and our business communities."
"It is my ambition, and that of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, that we should now strengthen our bilateral relations on the basis of new commitments by our partners on governance, respect for the rule of law and for fundamental freedoms, and economic and social reforms."
"We will do our utmost to help the Tunisian people to turn their aspirations into reality."
"Mr President, the recent events in Tunisia should encourage us to reflect with a sense of responsibility on at least two issues."
"Firstly, on whether policies to support the status quo in countries that lack democratic freedoms really contribute to stability, in this case, in our immediate vicinity."
"Secondly, Mr President, we should reflect on whether the disappearance of Mr Ben Ali from the political scene is sufficient to guarantee that a real democratic transition will be brought about."
"In my view, Mr President, the answer to both these questions is no."
"Therefore, Mr Füle, there needs to be a thorough reflection around why the Neighbourhood Policy, in the spirit of the Barcelona Process, has not had the intended democratising effects, and how we could or should make adjustments to it."
"Secondly, experience has shown us in many cases that, when there is a power vacuum, the most radicalised and extremist parties replace the process, hijack it and want to ruin it."
"Mr President, if it is simply to defend freedom, extremism is not a vice; if it is only to defend justice, moderation is not a virtue."
"This ethical imperative means that the European Union must mobilise all its efforts to help ensure that this process is not derailed."
"I welcome what Mr Füle said about providing electoral assistance to Tunisia, but I think that it is even more important to go a step further and support Tunisia through a European Union electoral observation mission."
"It is not only because of this ethical imperative that is etched in the genetic code of the European Union that we should do this, Mr President, but also in our own interests: because there is no point travelling first class if there is a passenger in economy with a bomb in his suitcase."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we share the concerns about what is happening in Tunisia and express our sadness about the many people who have lost their lives during the protests."
"The new and confused situation that began after the flight of former president, Mr Ben Ali, must now lead to the objective that many have asked for: the start of economic and social reforms to match the expectations of the vast majority of the population and the opening up of democratic forums, to ensure that civil society and the various opposition forces are increasingly involved in public life and in government."
"Obviously, all countries have the right to determine their own path, but we are keen for these reforms to be carried out and for the changes to be real and not merely window dressing."
"What is happening in Tunisia at the moment poses questions for all of us and poses questions for Europe, with all its delays and mistakes."
"In 1995, the European Union launched the partnership programme with the Mediterranean in Barcelona."
"This was supposed to include economic, political, military and even social and human cooperation, but not even in the two key objectives has this been achieved."
"In terms of the economy, there has been a drastic reduction in regional and infrastructural projects because the funds never arrived from Member States and those from the Commission remain in standby."
"The promised free trade zone does not exist, but the most obvious failure is on the political level, and we need to be fully aware of this, Commissioner."
"The Union for the Mediterranean was launched in 2008, but remains a façade."
"The summit that was supposed to be held in November 2010 has been postponed indefinitely."
"The problem is that the various European governments are not interested and do not see any interest in real cooperation."
"They prefer to maintain relationships with questionable regimes that are wedded to the defence of their undemocratically managed national resources, whilst millions of young people live without any future prospects but emigration, which is increasingly difficult."
"It is no great surprise then that, spurred on by the economic and social crisis, the protests in Tunisia have turned into a tidal wave capable of having a heavy impact on the existing power structure."
"European political realism is no longer useful as a result of the fear of Islamic fundamentalism, and perhaps the time has come to finally shelve that post-colonial attitude that tends to re-emerge every now and then in relations with north African countries."
"Indeed, taking Barcelona as a starting point, Europe needs a new vision of its southern reaches and the Mediterranean, which must be more credible than in the past."
"This implies a complete overhaul of the partnership and neighbourhood policies that have been followed thus far, and I would insist that you attend to this, Commissioner."
"We cannot hide the fact that both the Commission and the Council were even ready to start discussions with Tunisia for an advanced status agreement."
"On the basis of what criteria it was thought that all this was possible is still to be explained."
"We need to change tack - change gear - and we are telling the Commission and the Council that this can be achieved by showing more conviction in giving Parliament a role in the elaboration and application of a new idea of partnership with the countries of the Mediterranean."
"All of this is not solely in the interest of these countries but is, above all, in the interest of Europe."
"Many of the problems that Europe appears to have can only be tackled and resolved by a productive and virtuous relationship with all the Maghreb countries."
"Supporting economic and democratic reforms, as well as simultaneously deploying all the necessary antidotes to fundamentalism and terrorism, is a difficult road but is the only one to take."
"There is reason to hope that the tragic and bitter lesson being imparted by Tunisia can serve to give all of us a better understanding of what is worth doing and what is worth changing in terms of Europe's actions."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Tunisian people for their bravery, courage and persistence in speaking up for opportunities and freedom, and I hope all can refrain from using violence and that there will be free and fair elections soon."
"Citizens spoke out against an oppressive regime which has used bullets and killed its youth."
"Only weak governments go to such lengths to preserve their artificially obtained corrupt power and wealth."
"Regimes derive their legitimacy from providing for the wellbeing of their citizens, not from closing universities and access to information and free communications."
"With regard to access to information, the Tunisian opposition used the Internet, and the Internet is becoming more and more important for peaceful opposition across the world."
"I learned about the uprising by the citizens' movement in Tunisia through the Internet and eyewitness accounts that were posted there, but it took about a month of the struggle before mainstream media and political leaders woke up to the realities of the street."
"In the same week - last week - the French Minister for Foreign Affairs offered help to the Tunisian Government in the form of riot police and assistance in policing."
"What is the Commission's reaction to that offer, and where was the help for citizens in support of their rights?"
"(Applause)"
"The confrontation between the Tunisian Government and its people took place on the virtual highways of the Internet as much as on the streets."
"The Tunisian Government was known for being among the most advanced in the use of filtering and censoring software, and over the past month, it spared no efforts to repress people through these technologies."
"Repressive regimes across the world continue to use technologies to silence free speech."
"Today is Martin Luther King Day and it was Martin Luther King who said that a time comes when silence becomes betrayal."
"Commissioner Füle, that time has arrived."
"The United States has lost significantly in terms of credibility in its fight for leadership in Internet freedom."
"The EU has a struggle ahead, about which we will speak tonight in relation to the upcoming Hungarian laws."
"But the young, freedom-loving generation across the world is looking to the symbolic example that Tunisia has given and is looking to the EU for support, and there is no reason why we should not lead in defending people's freedoms, including on the Internet."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I admit that I would have liked this Parliament to measure up to the pride of the Tunisians who managed to defeat the dictator Ben Ali."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the dictator has fallen, but the dictatorship, the structure of the dictatorship, still exists in Tunisia."
"Today, we need to be very careful."
"European governments and the majority of this Parliament have, for years, supported the structure of the dictatorship, and the Tunisian dictator."
"Just last week, most groups rejected a debate on Tunisia and refused to condemn Ben Ali."
"The French Foreign Minister's actions are just the latest example of the West's complicity."
"Why is this?"
"Because of fear; because people were afraid of Islamism."
"We are right to fear Islamist dictatorship, but what do these young people, these Tunisians who were absolutely not Islamists, who were fighting for freedom, have to do with that?"
"Mr Bouazizi, who immolated himself, is the Jan Palach of Tunisia, and when Jan Palach immolated himself, this whole Parliament was behind him."
"We are not even able to stand behind Mr Bouazizi - that is the truth about this Parliament."
"Now the Commission needs to act."
"It simply needs to say one thing; it needs to say to the Tunisians that it will not be possible for a democratic election in a country which has just emerged from dictatorship to take place within two months."
"No democratic basis exists in the country."
"There is no freedom of expression, and the media, radio and television are not free."
"A state printing office is all that exists."
"It is for this reason that I ask the Commission to take the money from the association agreement and to use it to support freedom of expression in Tunisia and not to support Tunisian government organisations."
"Second, the transitional government is not a government of national unity."
"Why?"
"Because the majority of those who fought or those who are in exile have not yet returned, and are not recognised."
"Time is therefore needed so that democratic forces - not the forces 'recognised' by Ben Ali, but truly democratic forces - can develop."
"The European Union must demonstrate that, for us, what is happening in Tunisia is the key to understanding and hope for all Arab countries."
"Democracy and Islam can go together, and if we are able to support the fledgling Tunisian democracy, we will see that in Egypt, Jordan and Syria, and everywhere, the people and peoples will rise against their dictators."
"We have a responsibility, all of us here, because in the end, Tunisians - who form part of the Arab world - are showing us that the hope of freedom that we saw in 1989 in the Eastern Bloc is now being born in a country such as Tunisia."
"Tomorrow, we will see this in Algeria, and the day after in Egypt and Jordan."
"For that reason, therefore, it is unthinkable that this Parliament could remain seated and say: 'Yes, perhaps; we do not know'."
"We did not know in 1989 how Poland would turn out."
"We did not know how Russia would turn out with Gorbachev."
"If we ask for an assurance every time people demand freedom - that is, if we ask them to tell us that the situation will definitely progress in a particular direction - we will never support freedom, and that is why I ask the Commission to move, give something, show the Tunisians that the realpolitik now is the policy of supporting democracy and no longer the policy of supporting the dictatorship structure."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the upheaval in Tunisia is undoubtedly a reflection of people's frustration at the country's political stagnation and its relative economic stagnation."
"The flagrant corruption and wealth of the ruling family elite contrasted sharply with the high levels of poverty and unemployment among ordinary people."
"Former President Ben Ali paid the supreme price for failing to meet the expectations and aspirations of his people, but I do not agree with some assessments, particularly in the Green Group, that his government was one of the most repressive in the Arab world."
"Tunisia has been an example, in some ways, of a modern, secular and progressive Arab country."
"For example, polygamy and veils were banned and foreign direct investment and tourism were encouraged."
"Tunisia has managed to resist the efforts of violent Jihadis to undermine the integrity of its secular society."
"It is therefore essential that Tunisia's political leaders - the new leaders that will now emerge - protect that legacy, because Salafist extremists will undoubtedly try to take advantage of the chaos and turmoil that will advance their dangerous agenda, which obviously also threatens European political objectives, including foreign policy objectives."
"Tunisia's new political leadership also needs to understand that poor governance and gross inequality offer a fertile breeding ground for violent radicalism."
"I am encouraged that the interim leadership has promised substantial reforms because embarking on such a path will greatly strengthen Tunisia's relationship with the European Union."
"In the meantime, my group calls for maximum restraint by the security forces and for the arrest and trial of the ancien regime's presidential guard leadership responsible for the shooting, in the last few days, of innocent bystanders, in a futile attempt to destabilise the country."
"I congratulate the army on its professionalism in protecting the Republic's institutions."
"We in the EU must give the new Tunisian government of unity every assistance and also afford every assistance to EU citizens, including British citizens, who are stranded, having been in Tunisia on a holiday."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with some pride and much emotion that I speak in this House today on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left."
"The reason is that very few of us in this House have denounced the abuses of the Tunisian regime and what people had to go through who dared, against all the odds, to criticise it and denounce its practices, and particularly the torture of human rights defenders."
"It took the self-immolation of a young man of 26 to make the Tunisian people rise up and no longer be afraid, because they felt quite alone."
"The hope of freedom has been born there."
"It took more than 50 deaths before the European Union dared to make a timid statement calling for restraint in the use of force, but without calling into question the sacrosanct EU-Tunisia partnership and without condemning the violence, Mr Füle, until Saturday."
"The least that we can say is that the Tunisian regime has hardly heard you since your appointment."
"These words about 'restraint in the use of force' stuck in my throat."
"The European Parliament has been mute apart from a timid statement by the Maghreb delegation."
"It was only on Saturday that you spoke out on this, Mr President, and today a majority in the European Parliament rejected a written resolution."
"However, the European authorities manage to be more vocal towards other regimes."
"As a French person, I know what the responsibilities of the French Government are, and I will not revisit the proposals of our Foreign Minister."
"Obviously, for some people, the colonial era is not yet over, but let us hope that all of this is consigned to the past."
"Thanks to the courage of the Tunisian people, the Tunisian miracle, so dear to some people here, has collapsed within a few days and has shown its true face."
"Today, the European Union has a great responsibility to stand by the Tunisian people in their democratic transition, but without interfering in it."
"The European Union must monitor the electoral process and make sure that an independent investigating committee sheds full light on what has happened - on the violence and the corruption."
"The Tunisian people must no longer be pillaged."
"The assets of the Ben Ali and Trabelsi families must not only be monitored; they must be frozen."
"The European Union has failed."
"There is a long way to go before the Tunisians regain confidence."
"Things are still difficult today, it is true, and what is happening in the country may provide a good example for the Maghreb region."
"We know that identical uprisings may take place in all those countries in which the West still puts its own interests above those of the people concerned."
"Men have already immolated themselves in Algeria, Egypt and Mauritania."
"It is time to move from words to action where democracy and human rights are concerned."
"It is time for the European Union to restructure its partnerships with the countries of the South and to finally construct them on the basis of democratic requirements, respect for human rights and equality, or else it will effectively pave the way for fundamentalists."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, you made some remarks at the beginning of the debate about free and fair elections and good representative government and you asked us to support the people of Tunisia."
"No democrat could disagree."
"People will tolerate a lot from incompetent, corrupt governments, but push them too far and they will rebel."
"It is a doctrine of internal security services that any population is only three days away from riots and civil unrest when the food supplies run out."
"Are there any parallels to be drawn between what is happening in Tunisia and the European Union?"
"The EU gives undemocratic and incompetent government."
"It has a political class that is increasingly detached from the wishes of its people."
"There is high youth unemployment in many countries in Europe as a direct result of EU policies."
"There are already riots and civil unrest in Greece due to its purely ideological commitment to the European single currency."
"Countries like Spain, Portugal and Ireland may soon follow Greece as their economies become untenable in the straitjacket of the euro."
"Do not think that it cannot happen in European countries."
"When governments become the enemies of their own people, then the people will eventually rebel."
"I agree with what you said in your introduction but let us see those principles applied in Europe as well as in other countries of the world."
"This item is closed."
"Harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Mrs Stihler, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Council position at first reading with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC [10753/3/2010 - C7-0267/2010 -."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, it is a good way to start the New Year with this debate and tomorrow's vote on the deal concluded under the Belgian Presidency on this important report on construction products."
"I would like to start by thanking all colleagues who made this possible for their hard work, their thoughtfulness and commitment to making this proposal a reality."
"I would also like to put on record my thanks to the IMCO Secretariat and to the Belgian Presidency, in particular, to Mr Vertessen and Mr Haerynck for all their dedicated work."
"As I said in my report quoting the poet Robert Frost - 'Good fences make good neighbours' (with an implied question mark)."
"It is important that we maintain the momentum to complete the internal market and break down barriers to trade."
"As Mario Monti in his report on the Single Market acknowledges, 'Europe is still in a phase of 'market construction' that requires breaking down barriers to cross border activity, cutting dead wood of national administrative and technical barriers and overcoming corporate resistance'."
"With this proposal we have attempted to make the single market work more effectively, we have attempted to have clearer and more transparent systems in place so that products placed on the market are of the highest standards and that the construction industry has a fairer market place to trade within."
"Currently, the construction industry is facing the economic challenges caused by the global financial meltdown of 2008 and exacerbated by the slow economic recovery we face across the EU."
"We should never forget what an important sector the construction industry is - 12 million EU citizens are directly employed in the sector and 26 million EU citizens are dependent on it - that is 38 million people reliant on the sector."
"For economic growth, construction is essential for jobs and employment."
"It is also one of the most dangerous sectors to work within."
"Taking Germany, whose safety record is second to none, one construction worker in 5 000 will suffer a fatal accident during their lifetime."
"The health and safety of those who work at the coalface of construction should always be remembered and it is important to have acknowledgement of this in the report."
"It was with this in mind that we successfully managed on both sides to come to some agreement on the issue of labelling hazardous substances, so that the report was in line with REACH but also helps those who work with products which, in the past, have led to chronic conditions and death - conditions such as asbestos-related mesotheliomia and, to an extent, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused by working conditions and by inhaling dust."
"The proper labelling of hazardous substances can help those with these lung conditions and illustrates how interlinked our work here is."
"I am proud of the fact that this report was conducted and concluded under the European Year of the Lung."
"Lung health is so often neglected and I was delighted that in this Parliament, we recognised its importance."
"I would also like to briefly comment on SMEs."
"In Parliament, we are urged to 'think small first' and this should carry throughout our work."
"This is why we have managed to create a second stream for smaller corporations to place their products on the internal market and the system should make it cheaper and more practical for SMEs to reach a larger market place which can only increase their trading potential."
"On the separate issue over transparency concerning who serves on technical bodies and how they work, I think that we have moved the bodies which approve products further than was originally foreseen."
"The transparency over processes and the approval of products can only help break down the walls and barriers which exist in the European Union today."
"This should help companies in the EU and, in particular, the special conditions set for micro-enterprises are also helpful in these tough economic conditions."
"In the European Union, we should always strive for better regulation."
"Along with my shadow rapporteurs, I have modified the sections of the report which are no longer relevant or which were so unclear that no one was able to follow them or ensure their application."
"For an industry such as the construction sector, it is imperative that the rules are clear and I look forward to seeing the difference these particular changes will make."
"The scale is huge and the challenges many, but today, these new rules which will come into force through Member States in the next 24 months will help the construction sector as we attempt to create economic growth and, through this, jobs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank the President, who is doing us the honour of chairing a debate on an issue that is so very important for industrial policy and the internal market."
"I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, who worked exhaustively on this proposal and, thanks to her commitment, has enabled us to reach an agreement at second reading."
"I also wish to express my sincere thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and the Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mr Harbour."
"Your collective efforts were crucial in reaching a turning point in negotiations between the European institutions on this extremely technical dossier."
"The Commission welcomes the second-reading compromise between Parliament and the Council since, irrespective of its technical nature, this is a dossier of great importance."
"The adoption of the regulation on construction products represents an inestimably significant step forward for the entire European construction sector."
"Construction products account for 3% of gross domestic product in Europe and, in terms of employment, activities related to the construction sector account for 6.5% of Europe's GDP and 7.5% of employment."
"Altogether, this means that the construction sector accounts for 10% of the European economy, as the rapporteur noted in her speech."
"Furthermore, the adoption of the regulation on construction products constitutes an important step forward in terms of simplifying and improving the legislation, whilst, at the same time, consolidating the internal market for construction products."
"This was also the first practical application of the principles enshrined in the Small Business Act."
"In effect, EU law will finally provide European enterprises - and particularly micro-enterprises - with tools that help them rather than the exact opposite, that is to say, forms to fill out, bureaucratic procedures and extra obligations."
"I cannot but be satisfied by this outcome, particularly with regard to the solutions provided to three issues that had been thought, in the past, to be more complicated."
"Firstly, with regard to the issue of hazardous substances, the Commission will draft a report on this important issue, keeping Parliament informed and, if necessary, presenting any further legislative proposals."
"Secondly, there is the special treatment reserved for micro-enterprises, which have always been considered essential in order to safeguard the principles of the Small Business Act."
"The outcome achieved satisfies this criterion as it retains the possibility for simplified procedures for micro-enterprises."
"Lastly, various parts of the text recognise the need to reduce the administrative and testing obligations on enterprises, partly by introducing simplified procedures for CE marking, but also by keeping the use of European Technical Assessments optional."
"In any case, as indicated by the Statement by the European Commission annexed to the Council's position at first reading, we will need to check that the chosen solutions are truly the best to deal with existing needs."
"In particular, we will have to avoid subjecting enterprises - and particularly micro-enterprises - to unjustified or, in any case, unnecessary administrative obligations."
"We intend to monitor this aspect carefully and will add our conclusions to the report to the European Parliament and the Council, which is to be drawn up five years after the entry into force of this regulation."
"I should also like to clarify that the Commission intends to work closely with the European Parliament and, naturally, with the Council, with regard to the implementation of this regulation."
"To this end, I have asked my services - whom I thank for the contribution they always make to the legislative work of the Commission - to draw up a road map for implementation, which I intend to send to you as soon as possible."
"This looks, in particular, at the so-called comitology aspects."
"Parliament is a key partner of the Commission and I can assure you that I intend to continue to work closely with you, including with regard to the next phase in the adoption process."
"Besides, 14 years in this Chamber were not spent in vain."
"Finally, the Commission felt it necessary to present a statement regarding the departure from the common agreement between the institutions, relating to the deadline to submit an objection to delegated acts."
"The Commission is keen to stress that the principle laid down in the draft common agreement provides for a two-month period to submit objections, which may be extended by a further two months."
"In this case, the Commission holds the view that there are no special circumstances that can justify the violation of this principle."
"The Commission regrets the fact that the principle agreed in the draft common agreement has not been respected and emphasises in its statement that what has happened in the construction products case cannot set a precedent."
"I should like to thank Parliament - including through the President, whom I thank again for having participated in this debate - for the interest with which it examined this simplification proposal."
"To conclude, I should like to highlight the advantages that we can expect from this new regulation, as well as those created for the producers and users of construction products, as well as national administrations."
"We also confirm the Commission's willingness to adhere to the obligations contained in the text of the regulation, in particular, to draw up the reports that have been requested."
"Thank you once again Mr President, and thank you honourable Members for the commitment and cooperation you have shown."
"Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to all those who played an active part in bringing this regulation to second reading."
"This regulation - as its title suggests - represents an improvement on the existing directive."
"In the past, of course, building regulations were, to some extent, a core domain of national autonomy."
"The fact that we have succeeded here in bringing the European internal market to the fore with a regulation is very positive."
"Secondly, for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, the regulation contains a number of important relaxations which will facilitate their economic activity and their dealings in Europe's internal market."
"Finally, consumers will, of course, also benefit from this regulation because it will considerably improve the safety and reliability of construction products."
"I can also speak for our shadow rapporteur, Professor Mayer, who, on account of some constituency-related business, has, unfortunately, had to remain in his constituency today."
"He asked me to mention that ultimately, at second reading, this regulation represents a compromise, a good compromise in his view, but there are nevertheless still a few issues that will need further work."
"I am very grateful to Mr Tajani for pointing out that Parliament will also be involved in the follow-up work that remains to be done."
"As shadow rapporteur, Professor Mayer feels it is not enough simply to regulate the behaviour of manufacturers of construction products and the sale of their products; this regulation must be supplemented by legislation that also establishes the principles and practical rules for the use and installation of construction products."
"In this regard, Professor Mayer believes that the Commission should consider giving the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) a mandate to produce a standardised European regulation."
"He would also like to point out that the Commission is required to monitor whether the new Construction Products Regulation leads to adequate harmonisation in all areas and does not result in further safety problems and unfair competition."
"However, after listening to what Commissioner Tajani has had to say, I am sure that we will achieve this together."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my very sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, who has done some very important work in this highly technical area."
"It is not only a technical report that we have before us; it is also a highly political report - a report in which high political standards also had to be respected."
"It was necessary to balance the various interests of industry, safety and the protection of workers, and, in the view of the European Parliament and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the rapporteur has succeeded admirably in doing this."
"It was essential to respect the interests of the industry and to see where their problems are in this area of construction products."
"It was also important to find a balance between the large and the small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Our view was that the Commission was right to suggest that small enterprises need fewer rules."
"However, that does not mean - and this is where the Commission's proposal was improved upon - that a lower level of safety should be permitted."
"The level of the standards must also be genuinely high, something that we managed to achieve in this area."
"Of course, it is also important to place safety at the forefront."
"This is of particular importance for consumers because, where a construction product is manufactured and installed, it must be ensured that the user of the product is ultimately just as safe as those who worked with it beforehand."
"The third point that was particularly important to us, as Social Democrats, was improving worker protection and the fact that this has also been explicitly incorporated once again."
"Mrs Stihler also attached a great deal of importance to this in her remarks."
"After all, these construction products often involve work with hazardous substances and materials."
"It is extremely important to ensure that the highest possible level of protection is indeed achieved in this area."
"This level of protection will also need to be considered later - and that is something that we probably still need to work on, Mr Tajani - in connection with the disposal of these products once they are no longer needed."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur most sincerely once again for her truly splendid work."
"Madam President, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Stihler and all the shadow rapporteurs."
"I believe we have achieved a good compromise in this second reading, even if - as is always the case with compromises, of course - not all sides are satisfied."
"I would like specifically to pick up on Professor Meyer's comments, as communicated by Mr Schwab. I believe that we still have work to do with regard to labelling."
"We now have good harmonisation of construction products, by which I mean the manufacture of construction products."
"However, the area where we still have work to do is that of the installation and use of construction products."
"One option is for the Commission to continue its work in this regard in the area of the Eurocodes and for there then also to be a mandate for this in the area of the Eurocodes in order for progress to be made."
"The other option is for us to harmonise the field of application and use so that we do not fall back to the national level in this regard and only have European harmonisation in relation to the products themselves and not in relation to their use."
"We need to do more work in this regard, and the Commission will also receive our full support if further measures are necessary."
"I would like to mention one further point that was important in the debate regarding whether or not we should vote in favour."
"Unfortunately, the Belgian Presidency made an error during the negotiations."
"Following the first reading, it introduced new areas in the second reading - Articles 8(3) and 8(6) - without Parliament's full consent."
"The Hungarian Presidency has now addressed this in a letter."
"However, I do not believe that the Hungarian Presidency has truly understood the conflict."
"I would like to point out once again that, in future, if it introduces new items in the second reading, I expect the Council to actually approach Parliament and try to reach a good compromise with us."
"Nevertheless, in view of the result, we do not believe that it would make sense to reject this compromise on account of a procedural error of this kind."
"We will vote in favour of this compromise because we believe that it is an important step towards further harmonisation of the sector, a sector of major economic importance."
"The compromise therefore receives our support at this second reading."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Stihler for her hard work."
"It has been a very long road."
"In Europe today, the construction sector directly employs 12 million EU citizens."
"In addition, approximately 92% of the manufacturers of construction materials are small and medium-sized enterprises - this amounts to over 65 000 individual businesses."
"Clearly, the construction sector is vital for the European economy, and we have a responsibility to the industry to help support it, especially after the economic crisis."
"There are many aspects of this report which produced something of a stalemate between many of us, such as the nature of EU legislation."
"It is not perfect, it is a compromise."
"Key issues included the declaration of performance or CE marking, where a successful agreement was made to ensure micro-enterprises do not face the same burdens as larger companies."
"On tackling and identifying hazardous substances in construction products, we managed to broker a compromise ensuring no conflict with existing REACH regulations."
"I hope that this second-reading agreement will have real results and will encourage the free movement of construction products, improve standards across the EU, and promote the recycling of construction products in future whilst, most importantly, not increasing bureaucratic burdens on businesses or confusing consumers."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the compromise reached in relation to some specific points that I feel are of vital importance to effectively achieve the objectives that we are proposing to reach under this legislative proposal."
"I am referring to the retention of the rules on simplified procedures, which are surely designed to lighten the burdens and reduce the costs incurred by enterprises, and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Indeed, I think that in the context of a negative economic situation like the present, it is absolutely essential to recognise the importance of the role played by small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up one of the fundamental foundation blocks on which our economy is based."
"Furthermore, by introducing simplified procedural mechanisms and, in particular, by reducing the time it takes to place new products on the market, the new regulation definitely favours innovation."
"At the same time, it also protects consumers, allowing them to gain faster access to innovative products without foregoing the guarantees of quality and safety that have to be ensured by CE marking."
"Therefore, in my view, the agreement reached represents an excellent compromise that will strike the right balance between the needs of producers and those of consumers, thereby guaranteeing the proper functioning of the market in a sector that is truly the driving force of our European economy."
"(EL) Madam President, I must thank Mrs Stihler for the excellent work she has done."
"We have all been talking about a technical issue."
"Luckily, Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, has highlighted the fact that this is not just a technical issue; it is also a highly political and economic issue."
"We all know that construction is a basic pillar of the economy."
"We all know that small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of our economy, an economy that, within the framework of the European Union, is in an extremely difficult situation."
"Thus, Mrs Stihler's report is also of great political importance and she has made an excellent job of it."
"We have managed to achieve a compromise, a good compromise for everyone."
"We have managed to strike a balance that will give us simple procedures, which can be applied without compromising the standard of small and medium-sized enterprises and, at the same time, the best possible result."
"We have managed to sort out the issue of hazardous substances."
"We all remember - and the older ones here remember very well - the issue of asbestos contamination of the Berlaymont building, which was closed for five or six years."
"Imagine what would happen to entire states in the European Union if we were unable to handle the question of hazardous substances."
"Finally, we still have to deal with the question of safety and transparency."
"Here, too, I think that Mrs Stihler has done an excellent job in her report and in the compromise achieved."
"To close, I trust that we shall deal as well with the construction of the European state as we have done with construction."
"Madam President, as chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I want to associate myself very much with many of the remarks - in fact, all the remarks, I think - that people have made on the work that Catherine Stihler has done."
"I think that taking over a complex dossier for a second reading and coming into our committee to do that has been a tough task which she has done extremely well."
"I would remark that it shows the importance of the second-reading procedure in this House, because we have been able to make significant improvements to the text of the position that we received from the Council."
"As Mrs Rühle in particular pointed out, we had some disagreements with them."
"We have a letter from the Hungarian Presidency on some of the detailed issues which will be published with the Minutes."
"I just want to make two concluding remarks in endorsing this agreement."
"The first is to say to you, Commissioner, in thanking you for your work with us, that we need to work very closely with you on the implementation of this proposal."
"As you pointed out, there are important aspects of comitology here and my committee is absolutely behind the need to follow up these proposals very seriously."
"Secondly, I think that this is an absolutely crucial sector and we do need to keep it under review, as many colleagues have said, to make sure that there are, in effect, no market barriers put in place that are going to stop it contributing vitally to the European economy."
"(CS) Madam President, I am very satisfied with the text of the Construction Products Directive agreed between the rapporteurs and the very helpful Commissioners Tajani and Barnier for today's second reading."
"This should simplify the market for construction products."
"It unifies enthusiastically, it simplifies documentation and it removes various unnecessary bureaucratic practices."
"The view that the construction of buildings constitutes the provision of building services and not the marketing of products, and that construction activity also includes the incorporation into a building of any non-serial manufactured components, has finally prevailed, which is something I welcome."
"Firms in the Czech Republic also applaud this small reform, because the old directive increased their costs without bringing improvements in quality."
"The IMCO committee, of which I am a member, has come together and adopted the text unanimously, including the simplifications for micro-enterprises."
"I trust that Parliament in its entirety will do the same tomorrow."
"It will be another sign that the legal environment in the EU is improving in a way that will support the unified market."
"(DE) Madam President, I am not convinced with regard to all of the points of the compromise, but I know that the new regulation represents a definite improvement on the current legal situation."
"First of all, we will get a standardised European technical language for the performance of construction products and streamlined and simplified procedures."
"We have made progress with the European internal market and, in so doing, we have benefited the companies and also, through standardised safety requirements, the consumers, too."
"In principle, I regard relief from bureaucratic regulations for micro-enterprises to be important and sensible."
"However, we also need to take account of the fact that micro-enterprises that process construction products are also users and must also be protected."
"I am therefore pleased that my proposal was included in the compromise."
"This provides for simplified procedures for micro-enterprises in connection with the evaluation of the performance characteristics of construction products."
"However, if they apply such a procedure, they must prove the equivalence of the procedure used with the procedure that is actually provided for throughout Europe."
"This is the only way to ensure that the details of the performance characteristics are also accurate and reliable and that the safety of buildings is also ensured throughout Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the words of Mr Harbour when he stresses the importance of the text that we are debating and that will be adopted thanks to this agreement from Parliament."
"This is because it is a new piece of legislation that will give important guidance to the market but, at the same time, will establish good rules to allow small and medium-sized enterprises to expand, above all, in this final phase of the current crisis, during which we must do everything possible to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises can create new jobs and grow."
"This is the aim of the European Commission, which is backed up by the real commitment of the European Parliament, partly as a result of the implementation and development of the Small Business Act."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises will benefit from simplification, including a reduction in red tape."
"However, as Mrs Gebhardt said in her speech, these rules for the liberalisation and development of the market also provide real guidance on safety, which is of great importance for construction sector workers, but also consumers."
"I believe that this report is heading in the right direction."
"However, the Commission does not intend to stop with the adoption of the legislation that has resulted from the agreement and the compromise between the Council and Parliament."
"We want to keep working on this over the coming years, and I should also like to assure Mr Harbour - who stressed the need to move forward - of our commitment to produce a road map for implementation, which I will forward to you as soon as possible."
"During this debate, many of the honourable Members have spoken about harmonisation in the construction sector, particularly with regard to safety."
"I am fully mindful and aware of the problem and I am pleased to have drawn up the Eurocodes with the European Standards Organisation, since these are harmonised rules specifically relating to construction safety."
"As you know, the Commission is currently preparing a communication on standardisation, which will be submitted for the attention of Parliament and the Council within a few weeks."
"Therefore, Madam President, honourable Members, I believe that today and tomorrow, we are taking an important step forward."
"To reiterate, it is not only a matter of technical rules, though I should like to thank the rapporteur for her patience in dealing with the technical rules, which, in any case, represent a snapshot of a major political commitment."
"Behind the technical details there lurks an important economic choice favouring small and medium-sized enterprises, which can create new jobs over the coming years, as well as favouring half a billion European citizens."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, thank you to all colleagues who have taken the time to speak this afternoon and evening."
"I think Commissioner Tajani's comments about partnership working, the road map and the issue of Eurocodes, which Mrs Rühle and (I think) Mr Schwab also mentioned, are important and that we take forward the good cooperation that we have had."
"It is a compromise that we have reached and there are some things colleagues might have liked in this compromise that we did not manage to get in, but Parliament managed to secure 75% of the amendments that we thought were important within this text, and that is no mean feat."
"There is something that struck me throughout this debate."
"The construction sector is so vitally important to our economies for future growth, for jobs, that I would like to ask the President whether we can make sure there is an annual debate in this House on the construction sector, to take forward the cooperation that the Commissioner has offered to us and to make sure that we always place the importance on the construction sector that this House should do, given that 38 million people rely on the construction sector for their jobs."
"So, thank you, Madam President, thank you, Commissioner, and I look forward to the weeks, months and years ahead, because the construction debate will continue in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and I for one will certainly be following it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 18 January 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for the content of her report."
"Construction products is one of the European economy's sectors which is both vulnerable and important and which we need to harmonise."
"I use the term 'vulnerable' not only because of the way in which this sector has responded to the recession, but also, in particular, because of the number of workers and SMEs it has, 12 million and approximately 65 000 respectively."
"I strongly support the notion that we must acknowledge the need for a high level of health and safety at work where construction products are involved."
"I am also clearly referring not only to accidents at work, which occur fairly frequently, but also to hazardous substances used in work processes."
"I want to add one final point."
"The single market for construction products requires support appropriate to its size and specific nature, including for the vulnerable aspects which I mentioned at the start of my speech."
"Consequences in the European Union of the dioxin animal feed incident (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the dioxin animal feed incident and its impact on the European Union."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, as you are well aware, the New Year started with a serious incident of dioxin contamination of animal feed in Germany."
"The Commission services have been monitoring developments closely and in full cooperation with the competent German authorities."
"I have already started considering possible measures which will ensure that our high-level food and feed safety system will become even more efficient."
"But let me start with the facts of the incident first: the incident came to light when a compound feed manufacturer notified the German competent authorities on 22 December 2010 after having received the analytical result from a laboratory that a sample was found to be non-compliant with EU legislation after self-controlled tests."
"Between the middle of November and middle of December of last year, a biodiesel manufacturer delivered seven consignments of fatty acids intended for technical purposes to a feed fat manufacturer who also produces fats for technical use."
"This latter company was, at the same time, a registered feed fat manufacturer; apparently, blending of feed grade fat and technical fat took place."
"Four of these consignments delivered in the second half of November were later found to be contaminated with dioxins."
"The other three delivered to feed mills in the first half of December 2010 were not contaminated."
"However, until this was verified and for purely precautionary reasons, all consignments were regarded and treated as potentially contaminated."
"A total of almost 2 300 tonnes of potentially contaminated feed fat was delivered to 25 feed manufacturers in Germany."
"No deliveries of feed fat were made outside of Germany."
"Between 100 000 and 200 000 tonnes of feed containing 2% to 10% of the potentially contaminated fat were delivered to about 4 800 farms in Germany."
"As a strictly precautionary measure, all farms were blocked; their commercial activities suspended; there were laying hen, fattening poultry, goose, pig, dairy cattle, bovine and rabbit farms."
"Some deliveries of potentially contaminated feed for breeding hens were also made to France and Denmark."
"No food of animal origin from the blocked farms can be placed on the market until the farms are unblocked."
"This can only happen after it is ensured through analytical results and investigations that the farms are not contaminated at levels above those provided by the EU law."
"Currently, of these 4 800 farms that were originally blocked, 939 farms - mostly poultry and pig establishments - remain blocked."
"It appears that no contaminated food was traded or exported from Germany since the incident was notified, with a few exceptions."
"In the end, analytical results showed that the products were compliant with EU legislation."
"This is an example of the effectiveness of the EU's traceability system and we will continue to be vigilant in this respect."
"The fortunate element of this incident is that the observed levels of dioxin in food where EU limits were exceeded have not been very high, which means that no immediate health risk for the consumer is expected as a result of the consumption, if any, of the contaminated products during a short period of time."
"What has the Commission done to help manage the incident?"
"My services have been in constant contact with the German authorities and they immediately disseminated all information to Member States through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed."
"They have also been in touch with the competent authorities in third countries, providing a clear picture of the incident to our trade partners."
"Moreover, Commission officials met with stakeholders in the fats and oils industries to explore ways of further strengthening the monitoring of dioxin in feed."
"I personally contacted the German Federal Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Ilse Aigner, on 6 January, and we exchanged views on what needs to be done to avoid similar contamination and incidents in the future."
"Today, I again contacted the German Minister, as I was concerned by the recent news from last weekend that a feed manufacturer did not provide a full list of farms which received potentially contaminated feed, and provided incorrect information as regards the use of contaminated feed fat in compound feed, resulting in an additional blocking of several hundred farms."
"This concerns a very serious infringement of EU food safety provisions."
"Let me say it clearly: the German authorities are fully engaged in dealing with this contamination and are doing their best to deal with it urgently and decisively."
"I am informed that they are making available additional capacity for testing so that this is done and finished in the shortest possible time."
"However, it is important that the wider implications for the approach towards the safety of animal feed at EU level are also urgently addressed."
"For this reason, a team from the Food and Veterinary Office will visit Germany next week to assist the German authorities and to inform our overall knowledge and understanding of how this contamination happened and how it can be avoided in the future."
"The German authorities are informed and have agreed to this visit."
"I know that we can count on the full cooperation of our German colleagues."
"This incident will also be discussed during the Agricultural Council which will take place in Brussels next Monday, 24 January."
"As I have already mentioned, we are reflecting on measures including legislative ones."
"The incident has highlighted the necessity to ensure the effectiveness of national control systems which underpin the confidence of all EU Member States and third countries in our food and feed safety measures."
"In order to address this issue, I am exploring the possibility of establishing a strict segregation of the production of fats and oils intended for feed and food purposes from the production of fats and oils for technical uses, and I am considering the possibility of legal requirements on reinforced controls on dioxins at different stages of the feed chains."
"I am confident that these measures, when endorsed and adopted, will bring the necessary improvements to our already solid food and feed safety systems."
"Madam President, Commissioner, thank you Commissioner for the factual presentation of this dioxin scandal in Germany."
"It makes me extremely angry, including in my capacity as a farmer, that again and again, we have to deal with scandals of this kind where the cause can seemingly be attributed to carelessness, but also to criminal activity."
"We can put as many laws and regulations in place as we like - in Europe, we have some of the most stringent laws on the production of food and we have the lowest limit values for ingredients that could harm the health of our consumers - but still we are not immune to such dangers."
"That is why it must also be a requirement - and the Member States are also responsible for this - that if the public prosecutor determines that criminal activity is involved, the magnitude of the penalty must be increased substantially."
"Such people must not get off with a fine - prison sentences are called for here."
"They must be put away so that they cannot cause such a disaster again."
"Commissioner, I am very pleased that you have acknowledged that the German authorities took the appropriate sequence of measures - that was also my impression in Germany."
"There was a certain amount of political commotion about the matter not being dealt with correctly."
"We all need to get together and, where necessary, supplement the strict provisions that we have in place."
"You mentioned one particular matter with regard to which you have our full support."
"I, too, am in favour - and I am also speaking on behalf of my group - of the introduction of the strict segregation of food production from the production of other products to prevent such mix ups from happening."
"You have our support, Commissioner, when it comes to improving our provisions and regulations further to enable us to better prevent such scandals in future."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I am rather surprised by your remarks."
"My perception of the press - at least in Germany - is somewhat different."
"It makes me extremely angry, too, that again and again, we are faced with scandals in the area of food safety."
"We cannot allow this to happen."
"I am aware that regulations and laws alone cannot prevent criminal activities in this area."
"However, we must do everything we can to make it as difficult as possible for those responsible."
"The Commission must call on the Member States to urgently review the level of their penalties in this area."
"The wilful and negligent handling of food and feed must not be punished with trivial penalties."
"Often, the fine is so low compared with the profit that it is paid out of the petty cash."
"It is also extremely important to increase the number of state inspectors."
"The current example in Germany demonstrates very well that the principle of self-checking has major shortcomings."
"I would like to point out that the polluter pays principle needs to be applied consistently throughout the whole chain - from trough to table."
"After all, the safety of our food begins with what we feed to our animals."
"Innocent people should not have to suffer the consequences of the criminal behaviour of others."
"As yet, it is not clear who will pay for the losses suffered by farmers as a result of the dioxin scandal."
"One thing is certain: it will not be the polluters that have gone bankrupt, as there is absolutely no money left there."
"This is unacceptable."
"In this regard, a European fund should be considered that all feedstuff manufacturers would have to pay into."
"The problems that keep occurring in connection with food safety continue to make one thing clear: for the whole process chain, for both food as well as feed, we need to ensure complete traceability."
"The EU regulation and national legislation need to be improved in this regard."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we have experienced four incidents of this type in Europe within 10 years."
"While we must be pleased that our rapid alert system has worked properly, it is completely unacceptable for this type of incident to have occurred."
"The health of European consumers must not be the adjustment variable in a system which prioritises cost reduction and which essentially indirectly encourages such incidents when the penalties are as weak as they are."
"However, Commissioner, we need to have the confidence of our fellow citizens, as you know better than anyone."
"What actions are you intending to take, then?"
"You spoke just now - and I am pleased about this - of a requirement to segregate the production of industrial oils and oils intended for food."
"This must be an obligation, Commissioner, and not simply an option in the manufacturing process; that way, we will have much more certainty."
"Second, it is totally unfair that manufacturers can declare insolvency in this way."
"What actions can we take, Commissioner, to ensure that such acts do not go unpunished?"
"Responsibility is still the best guardian of security."
"Lastly, what actions do you intend to take to improve the supervision established by the Member States?"
"The alert was given nearly three weeks after these oils were delivered."
"Of course, that is hardly the Commission's fault, but, quite simply, it is a problem for consumers in the meantime."
"Do you think that we can improve the situation in this regard, Commissioner?"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that the confidence of consumers has been badly shaken once again and consumers are, quite naturally, asking themselves what the national authorities are doing and what is the EU doing to put a stop to the work of these contaminators."
"In contrast to the Commissioner, I do not believe that it was an accident or mere chance."
"I believe that behind this, there is a system whereby particular companies earn millions from a blend of substances that do not actually belong in feed."
"They then evade liability and farmers and consumers pay the price."
"I believe that this needs to be our starting point, and we of course also need to ask ourselves whether the checks are being made in the wrong place?"
"In Germany, there are a handful of companies in the feed sector that work with fat."
"Why do we not apply targeted checks there?"
"Why do we rely on self checks and receive values rather randomly that then require state checks to be carried out ex post?"
"In other words, we need a risk-based form of monitoring throughout Europe."
"Therefore, Commissioner, my question to you is: what is the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) doing in this regard?"
"Is this a German case or are there other cases in Europe that are perhaps yet to be discovered?"
"I believe we are in agreement that we need a positive list of what feed is actually permitted to contain."
"We need strict authorisation rules for the companies and we need a liability obligation and the separation of the commodity flows."
"However, I believe - and this needs to be reiterated here - that we also need a fundamental change of course in many policy areas, because, at the end of the day, feed for animals should come from our fields and not from industrial enterprises."
"Farmers need to know what they are feeding their animals, and consumers also need to know where the feed comes from."
"We need to ensure that this is the case."
"We can, and must, start the agricultural reform here, by turning this situation around again, because ultimately, the whole of agriculture suffers as a result of the damage caused here by a few criminals contaminating feed, and that is something that we must prevent as a matter of principle."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I sympathise totally with the position that many German farmers find themselves in at the present time."
"I had this experience about two years ago in Northern Ireland when we went through a very similar exercise."
"The people who really suffered in this were the farmers who were not actually involved in any way at all."
"I think the word 'criminal' has been mentioned here and there are those with criminal intent who have been involved in this."
"We have to ask why they do it, and whether they are doing it to make a lot of extra money, as Mr Häusling says."
"If they are, they should be prosecuted for it."
"But we should make it very clear that it is not those who are producing food that are responsible."
"It is the providers of the feed to those who are producing the food that are responsible."
"We must take action against these people to make sure that it does not happen and to restore consumer confidence."
"I can well understand why consumer confidence should be shaken at this moment."
"As someone said, this has happened before and it should not be allowed to happen again."
"Let us not simply go wholesale and bring in new legislation."
"Let us implement what we have."
"Madam President, grinding, mixing, cheating - these are the three buzzwords of the feed industry in Germany."
"Since 1999, there have been five dioxin scandals in Germany alone."
"Feed manufacturers and large food companies are clearly not concerned about EU directives and national legislation when it comes to making large profits with cheap food."
"Competition for the lowest price in the food market is fierce in Germany."
"Feed for intensive livestock farming is therefore intended to be as cheap as possible."
"State checks are rarely carried out on feed and food producers."
"The state has increasingly relied on self checking by the manufacturer and saved itself the expense of employing qualified staff."
"Under these conditions, technical fat waste contaminated with dioxins was able to find its way into the feed and foodstuffs chain."
"The current dioxin scandal could have been prevented if the fat had been tested for dioxins before it was mixed into the feed."
"The contamination would then have been detected in time."
"Numerous consumers have now been contaminated with additional dioxins once again."
"Eighty percent of our intake of dioxins enters our bodies via foodstuffs of animal origin - in other words, meat, milk and eggs."
"Foodwatch is rightly demanding that feed manufacturers be placed under obligation to test every batch of feed ingredients for dioxins and PCBs before they mix the feed."
"Absolutely no ingredients that do not comply with the limit values may be included in the feed."
"Highly contaminated batches must be destroyed, and it must be possible to prove that this has indeed been done."
"That is the only way to prevent further adulteration and dilution of contaminants."
"Laboratories must also be placed under obligation to report cases where the limit values are exceeded to the national supervisory authorities."
"We need to introduce a labelling requirement for meat to enable its traceability."
"The current and previous food scandals in Germany have shown that routine state checks on the feed manufacturers and animal producers are essential."
"How do you intend to implement that Commissioner?"
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, consumers and farmers must be better protected against irresponsible feed and feed fat adulterators."
"We must put a stop to the work of these adulterators throughout Europe."
"One fellow Member has just spoken solely about Germany, but we have unfortunately had dioxin and other similar scandals in the past in other Member States, too."
"First and foremost, it is a matter for the public prosecutor, because these are criminal acts."
"I hope that the public prosecutors in Germany and the organisations from other countries that may perhaps still be involved - there was also mention of the Netherlands being part of the chain - will work faster than the public prosecutors in Ireland."
"There, the people responsible for a scandal in 2008 have only now been prosecuted."
"We need to be faster in this regard in general."
"I would ask that we put this scandal - and it is a scandal - into the right perspective."
"The values were a maximum of four times too high."
"That is bad, and there are good reasons why we have a precautionary level that must not be exceeded."
"However, the precautionary level has been deliberately chosen so that we only reach the range in which long-term damage was seen in animal experiments at 100 times this limit."
"Thus, there is no acute risk; it is a matter of precaution."
"In the case of the scandal in Belgium in 1999, the values were 700 times higher than the current EU limit value."
"We have also reduced dioxin contamination in the environment to a tenth of what it was in 1990 through EU measures - for example, through chemicals legislation, improved standards in connection with waste incineration plants and so on. Nevertheless, we need measures that have to be taken in the foodstuffs chain throughout Europe."
"We need dioxin monitoring, we need segregation of the fats, in my opinion, we need an EU-wide purity requirement for feed, and we need better protection for farmers who are not able to prevent such carelessness and criminal scheming from occurring again and again in the feedstuffs chain."
"(PT) Madam President, I cannot stress the point enough that Europe has unquestionably far more rigorous quality standards for food products than anywhere else in the world."
"Our consumers, our export markets and our producers alike all demand that we make a huge effort and significant investment to maintain these standards."
"If the contamination that occurred recently in Germany had happened in many other parts of the world, the chances are that we would not even have heard of it."
"It did not, however."
"It happened right here in the European Union."
"What happened in Germany is unacceptable, and not only must it be fully investigated, but the perpetrators must also be held responsible for what appears to be a crime rather than an accident."
"The origin of the contamination still remains unclear and I find that very alarming."
"There appears to be no clear definition of the liability of the German authorities for any failure in their supervisory responsibilities."
"It seems that the fact came to light due to a company communication and not through the controls implemented by the authorities."
"The people responsible for this have not been identified and the seriousness of the situation demands objective elucidation on the part of the Commission."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current dioxin incident is more than just a scandal."
"The people of Europe have been shown their reflection."
"How long have we been complaining that there is an extreme fight for prices and survival going on in agriculture, fuelled by the insatiable demand for ever cheaper food."
"For a long time now, this fight has been more than simply a trial of strength."
"Individuals are increasingly resorting to criminal means and methods."
"However, we will all lose out in the end as a result."
"We can enact more laws and directives, we can carry out more checks at even more cost, we can impose more severe penalties - none of these things will succeed against the criminal energy fuelled by such a tough fight for existence."
"We must finally tackle the causes of this problem."
"We must at last put an end to the constant demand for more and cheaper food."
"As a farmer, I have experienced the powerlessness against the criminal activities of certain individuals - as in this case - on my own doorstep."
"Together with my professional colleagues, I have shuddered at the thought of who will be next in line and innocently drawn into this maelstrom."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commission: what do you and your colleagues intend to do to restore the value of food?"
"I welcome your proposals, but with these you will not solve the main problem."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this scandal gives me a real sense of déjà vu, because the course the crisis has taken is, indeed, almost identical to the one that occurred twelve years ago in Belgium."
"Far too many incidents over the past ten years have shown that there are quite a few players operating in the animal feed oils and fats industry who, out of unscrupulous greed and in a criminal way, are prepared to commit fraud, fraud that is detrimental to farmers' income and consumer health."
"That is unacceptable."
"Hence, there is indeed a need for the existing legislation to undergo a stress test."
"I hope that the Agriculture Council will comment on this."
"However, there is also a need for monitoring and surveillance."
"There is still a great deal of self-monitoring in the industry."
"National authorities need to carry out additional, more stringent checks on all forms of self-monitoring."
"This should be done in a proportionate way."
"Secondly, I think that the Irish Food and Veterinary Office should carry out more monitoring."
"We need more monitoring of those doing the monitoring."
"I have read that, in the past ten years, the FVO has undertaken only three missions."
"That is too few and we need to increase that number."
"Commissioner, are you going to instruct the FVO to carry out a number of missions regarding the dioxin problems?"
"Madam President, over the many years it has been in operation, the European Union has created an enormously complex structure of various rules and regulations, which ought to give the public the impression that the Union cares about the purity and quality of our food."
"In order to reinforce this message, it has employed many different specialists, inspectors, vets and officials, developing a complex institutional behemoth to guarantee European food quality."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today we see how well it is doing."
"Europe is awash with badly contaminated foods, and our bureaucratic apparatus clearly does not know what to do about it."
"In order to understand the seriousness of the situation, let us recall what this wheeler-dealing with food has served up for us."
"The scientific community considers dioxins to be the most poisonous chemical that man has ever produced."
"They are carcinogens of the most serious category, but they also cause reductions in cell and hormonal immunity, greater susceptibility to infection, reduced fertility, increased abortions, dysfunctional ovaries, childbirth problems, greater infant mortality, problems with the development of the central nervous system, pathological changes to steroid hormones and receptors, and so on."
"They do not break down."
"They accumulate in the tissues of living organisms, and the World Health Organisation states that if a quantity of dioxin amounting to one grain of rice gets into circulation, it is equivalent to the annual limit for one million people."
"We are also finding out today that the German company Harles and Jentzsch has been adding dioxins to animal fodder, and has supplied up to 3 000 tonnes of dioxin-contaminated fat to the market since March 2010."
"According to current findings, contaminated eggs have made their way to the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and contaminated meat to France and Denmark."
"I would therefore like to ask, Commissioner, how is it possible that a company supplying feed mixes to thousands of farmers is not registered in a regulated control system?"
"What sort of cooperation can we be getting from state institutions in Germany when a company can produce feed mixes without, at the same time, being registered in a system of control?"
"What sort of veterinary controls can there be at farms, when veterinary inspectors have failed to identify the contamination of the fodder since March 2010?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, what is happening about the disposal of these foods?"
"We talk about the disposed eggs and the disposed meat and what ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Madam President, we are dealing with a scandal, but calling it a scandal is putting it too mildly."
"It is a major threat to the life and health of thousands of people."
"I hope those who are responsible will be identified and appropriately punished, but I hope this matter will also be cause for reflection on the model of agriculture which has arisen in the European Union."
"Agriculture has become an industry."
"We do not have animal husbandry any more - we have meat production."
"We have huge farms, we have the animal feed industry and we have animals raised on feed - and the feed contains dioxins."
"The feed also contains genetically modified materials which have not been fully tested, and this model of agriculture does not work."
"It is a model which does not guarantee food safety."
"The solution is greater respect and regard for those farms, which we still have in Europe - in Poland and in other countries - which are based on feed they produce themselves."
"We ought to support this."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, the company responsible knew as early as March 2010 that it was selling products with dangerously high dioxin levels."
"How is it possible that this was not detected by any of the national authority inspections, so that action could be taken at that stage?"
"Are the current mechanisms for monitoring the safety of our food really adequate?"
"It would appear that they are not because, if they were, this dioxin crisis could have been prevented."
"There seems to be any number of food scandals."
"Not just the dioxin crisis, but think also of the cloned products that ended up in our shops unnoticed last year."
"We have enough rules, but the monitoring of food safety must be more effective and more frequent and, moreover, the results of these inspections should be made public."
"This is about the safety of our food and the health of our citizens."
"In addition, I call on the Commission to support the claims for damages being brought against the companies responsible by the duped farmers who unknowingly poisoned their own cattle."
"Madam President, I would like to declare an interest: I am a British egg producer."
"The dioxin contamination appears to be a consequence of the failure to adhere to the more rigorous processing standards needed for animal feed, as opposed to the less demanding process used to convert rapeseed to biofuel."
"The EU's enthusiasm for biofuels can therefore have unintended consequences."
"In my view, however, this is not a matter for the EU."
"It will not be solved by - and certainly does not need - extra regulation."
"The Germans have identified a problem, they have told us about it and they are taking the necessary steps."
"In the UK, we have a comprehensive assurance scheme called the Lion Code."
"It covers both animal feed production in the mill and egg production on the farm, thus ensuring that incidents like this are highly unlikely."
"So, if any of you are insistent on top quality eggs, 'ask for the Lion' and British producers will be delighted to supply you."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I believe that we should be pleased, because we may be talking about a crisis today, but this is because our system has worked."
"We have the strongest consumer protection system in the world."
"Consumers need to bear that in mind right now."
"However, the system did not work properly, and before we come up with another one, I believe that we must carefully and comprehensively look at the reasons why the problem was discovered so late, and we must ask ourselves about the causes of this delay."
"However, I think that, apart from denouncing the criminal act itself, we must also question why it happened."
"I believe that, because of our actions, the agricultural and agri-food sectors are in a race towards low costs and towards the lowest prices on the supply side, and we are no longer shielded from deviations such as this type of unacceptable behaviour."
"So, Commissioner, do you intend to increase the penalties for such acts?"
"My second question is about how we will provide immediate support - and I mean immediate - to the breeders concerned."
"This is because the margins are so weak that, if some people do not receive support very soon, or even advances on amounts owed to them, these breeders will disappear by the time the procedure reaches a conclusion at what I would call 'normal' speed."
"(DE) Madam President, may I ask the previous speaker a question?"
"He said that, essentially, the system works."
"I would be very interested to hear whether he is aware that it was not the system but consumers who helped to discover what had happened here."
"Secondly, with regard to the information that the previous speaker is in possession of, I would like to ask him whether he is also aware that there are studies that show that citizens would be happy to pay a bit more if they could be sure that the products are of a high quality and have come from animals that have been kept in a way that is appropriate for their species."
"(FR) Madam President, I think that the Member who asked a question actually had a comment to make on a situation rather than a question to put to me."
"Obviously, we know that the system has gone wrong."
"However, with regard to European consumers, I would like to emphasise how strict our protection system is."
"We cannot let the statement that nothing has been done go unchallenged, given that we have the highest standards in the world."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should also like to thank Commissioner Dalli for coming to the Chamber today to report on this case, which is a source of great concern for European consumers."
"Next week, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, will also meet to look further into the debate on the consequences of this serious episode."
"Despite the fact that Europe is very much committed to food safety, further efforts in terms of transparency and checks are needed in order to avoid further cases of food contamination."
"I would note that last year, Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on agricultural product quality and, above all, that this Chamber adopted the regulation on the provision of food information to consumers at first reading, introducing obligatory marking of the place of origin of agricultural products on labels."
"Unfortunately, this important development stalled on 8 December in the Health Council."
"We shall try to reintroduce it at second reading, because it is an important objective for protection and transparency in favour of European consumers."
"Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction, showing that it is on the side of consumers."
"We hope that the Council and the Commission adopt a similar attitude."
"(SV) Madam President, Commissioner, I have to agree with what several of my fellow Members have already said, namely that, to a large extent, the current legislation is working."
"That is not where the problem lies."
"The problem lies in compliance, control and sanction systems."
"We do not have the right at EU level to interfere in sanction systems, and we have to remember that if we make laws but do not, at the same time, have any sanction systems for them, we are simply enacting a large amount of legislation that will be completely ineffectual."
"This will not work."
"However, the Commissioner mentioned something that is extremely important."
"I was rapporteur for the regulation which forms the basis for the feed checks."
"The Commissioner mentioned the issue of the strict separation of raw materials intended for the feed industry and those intended for technical purposes, in this case, fat."
"My proposal ten years ago was for all products of uncertain origin to be dyed."
"Quite honestly, I think it is a very great shame for the farmers who are affected time and again by toxins in feed but are unable to do anything about it."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to be one of the signatories of this oral question because I believe that it is essential, after the incident of recent weeks, to open a debate on food safety."
"To what extent are the products that millions of Europeans consume every day healthy and nutritious?"
"Are we really sure that the products on our kitchen tables are safe?"
"Quality of raw materials is essential to guarantee the authenticity of the final product."
"Constant monitoring, from the field to the table, is the only way to avoid the contamination of food products and immediately identify potential risks."
"This latest incident in Germany confirms the need to make origin marking on labels obligatory for all products, including processed products, as Mr De Castro has already emphasised."
"We must protect the consumer's right to know the provenance of every product bought, and the safety of our food can only be guaranteed by all operators sharing the responsibility."
"It is true that current European legislation already provides for controls and procedures to guarantee that the food that ends up on our tables is fit for consumption and that the risks of contamination are reduced to a minimum, but we must now aim to make a daily contribution to improving the quality of these measures."
"I am proud to point out that tomorrow, the Italian Parliament will approve a law that extends obligatory origin marking to all food products that do not already have it."
"Finally, we will know the provenance of products such as pork, long-life milk, fruit, vegetables and some drinks, such as orangeade."
"I hope that Europe can take inspiration from this law."
"I will make an active commitment to ensure greater transparency, information and protection of consumer rights, which are instruments that I consider essential to promote healthy, wholesome food."
"(SV) Madam President, the important question now is how can we avoid new scandals and new risk situations."
"It is a positive thing that the Commissioner is going to Germany, and it is clear that the Council of Agriculture Ministers must discuss the matter."
"It would have been a scandal in itself if it had not done so."
"There are still things that need to be done in this area."
"We need strong sanctions, so that the Member States realise that they have to take a decision in this regard."
"Above all, we need to put a stop to the self-controlled tests."
"For other sectors and companies, it is absolutely clear that compliance with the legislation is to be monitored by independent authorities, but this does not apply in the sector that produces the very food that we eat."
"It is absolutely no good blaming large-scale farming, price competition and whatever else."
"As consumers, we do not want to eat contaminated food."
"We need to ensure that consumers are informed about it when it does actually happen and that they are made aware of the fact that they should not have to eat contaminated food."
"Madam President, the December contamination in Germany which we are discussing today and the blatant breach observed in our food safety chain not only seriously put at risk the health of thousands of consumers, but also revealed remaining weaknesses in our food traceability system."
"It is indeed more than worrying that the German authorities, and the Commission itself, were not able to guarantee that none of the contaminated raw products, such as eggs, entered the food chain by being included as ingredients in processed food."
"Traceability is quite often seen as a burden for the food industry, but it appears crucial when it comes to an emergency situation such as the one discussed today and should be considered as a prerequisite in protecting consumers' health and safety."
"I would therefore like to put two questions to the Commission."
"Firstly, can it now be certain and confirm that none of the contaminated eggs or any single product affected entered the food chain via their utilisation in processed foods?"
"Secondly, does it intend to reinforce traceability and information measures in order to guarantee an optimal protection of consumers in future food crises with health implications?"
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the German dioxin scandal has shaken the confidence of European consumers and they are rightly demanding the highest level of safety and complete traceability in food production."
"Ultimately, agriculture's international reputation has been damaged by the negligent behaviour of large animal feed producers."
"I call on the Commission urgently to restore confidence in high quality European agricultural production, which meets the highest standards."
"Identification of all of those responsible and limitation of the damage in the German dioxin scandal are just the start."
"Swift and comprehensive measures need to be taken to prevent such practices by animal feed manufacturers in the future."
"The animal feed chain is not somewhere to dispose of waste, and industrial waste products have no place in animal feed."
"I call for more stringent, EU-wide rules, particularly with regard to transport."
"Even one contamination of animal feed is unacceptable."
"However, above all, what is essential is that a full and comprehensive inspection of these companies is carried out."
"No farmer who is inspected several times a year can understand the current practice with regard to checks on large animal feed producers."
"Nevertheless, it should be noted that in the case we have just been discussing, the ball started rolling as a result of self reporting and the competent authorities responded correctly."
"The most important thing, however, is to turn our attention to the farmers who have unfairly suffered damage."
"They urgently need support, because the damage that has occurred must not, under any circumstances, be passed on to them."
"The existence of thousands of farmers is currently under threat."
"Last Friday, the producer price in the pig fattening sector came in at EUR 0.23 per kilogram."
"By the end of last year, pig producers had already had to cope with a drop of EUR 0.13."
"The situation is made worse by the fact that the cost of feed has risen sharply in recent weeks."
"We need to find solutions to this quickly."
"Consumer confidence in agricultural products must not, under any circumstances, be jeopardised by greed and negligence."
"Madam President, as we have heard, dioxin is a dangerous chemical which is known to cause cancer, and in this instance, it entered the food chain when chemicals meant for use in biofuels were accidentally used in animal feed."
"Some test results from the Agriculture Ministry in Schleswig-Holstein have shown that the fat in the feed contained 77 times the approved amount of dioxin."
"The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed is designed to protect European consumers from exactly these types of contamination."
"By the time the alarm was raised, contaminated products were all over Germany and other parts of the EU, even in UK quiches, which were removed from supermarket shelves as a precautionary measure."
"This is not the first dioxin scare."
"We have had problems with mozzarella from Italy, pork products in Ireland and cattle products in Northern Ireland."
"What we want to know from the Commission is why this rapid alert system has again failed to protect consumers, and what the Commission is going to do to put it right."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, twelve years after the Belgian dioxin scandal, dioxins have now been found in feed in Germany, a country with a tradition of discipline and reliable institutions."
"This means that the control system is not strict, targeted, transparent and objective enough and is not accompanied by adequate disincentives and penalties."
"These gaps must be plugged with a serious sense of responsibility towards consumers, especially at a time when the economic crisis is encouraging people to resort to illegal solutions in order to reduce production costs."
"We cannot, especially in times of unfavourable economic conditions, expect problems to be self-regulated on the basis of a system of moral values."
"Of course, consumers must have immediate and full information on the risks to which they are exposed."
"The European Union is proud of the fact that it has adopted strict terms for safeguarding public health and for protecting the environment and the welfare of animals."
"However, it must also ensure that they are applied without derogation, if it does not want its policy to be simply confined to ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Madam President, let me start by saying that, as far as I am concerned, this is not negligence, it is a deliberate crime."
"What is it that we need?"
"There are a couple of important things that we need: firstly, a mandatory EU-wide labelling requirement, but it should indicate not only the place of slaughter, but also the place of origin."
"Consumers are currently being deliberately misled."
"Studies quite clearly show that people would be happy to pay."
"They just want the chain - where the product comes from and where it really originates from - to be fully traceable."
"Secondly, we need more stringent checks."
"At the end of the day, it was not a food inspector or an EU food safety agency that made the discovery, but the company itself."
"Thirdly, we need the clear segregation of food fat and fat produced for technical purposes."
"I totally agree with Pythagoras, who once again quite aptly said: 'everything that humans do to the animals comes back to them'."
"Madam President, in Ireland two years ago, in December 2008, we had a problem."
"I wonder what the Commission has done in the two years to avoid this current crisis."
"I have a specific question: Member State authorities are crying out for guidelines from the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers."
"On the feed hygiene regulations, they want guidance and a workshop."
"Will you please make a commitment tonight to give them what they are requesting?"
"I have three other points to make."
"We need very clearly to identify the high-risk products, the high-risk processors and the location and names of the high-risk producers, and, at the very least, we need total segregation of products that are destined for the animal feed chain and, thus, for the food chain."
"It is not rocket science."
"We also need, as others have said, controls along the way so that we detect those who continue to try and break the rules to make money."
"Cutting costs is about cutting corners."
"The problem is that it costs Europe billions; it takes away consumer confidence and ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I am not an agricultural romantic; in other words;"
"I do not believe the advertising slogans about the happy hens and the happy pigs, because my daily experience is rather different."
"However, I do nevertheless believe that consumers in Europe have a right to food that is safe."
"Hence, my first major demand is that we need stringent checks and we need tough penalties."
"However, I believe today's discussion has made it clear that we also need a different agricultural structure in Europe."
"Commissioner Dalli, who is responsible for health, is with us today and, to some extent, he is the one in the firing line."
"We also need to take the lessons we have learned from this scandal and use them in our agricultural reform to provide a structure for the agriculture industry in Europe that, on the one hand, meets the needs of agriculture and farmers and, on the other, also ensures safety for consumers."
"I would ask that we truly learn from this scandal."
"Madam President, we have had a number of incidents like this over the years."
"I would have thought that by now, the importance of traceability and quality assurance would be well understood and that the structures and regulations ought to be in place to prevent incidents like this."
"This raises a number of very serious concerns."
"Firstly, it is extremely damaging to consumer confidence in the food industry and, secondly, it is always the farmers who are the innocent parties."
"It is always the farmers who suffer a disproportionate effect when compared to the consequences for the food processing industry."
"I am reasonably satisfied that the German authorities, and the Commissioner and his team, took reasonable, appropriate and swift action when they were aware that there was a problem."
"Nevertheless, a number of very serious questions arise - questions about the behaviour of some sectors of the processing industry where, clearly, more needs to be done by way of prevention, more needs to be done by way of punitive powers where the consequence of this action ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, the discovery of products contaminated with dioxins and their distribution through various commercial channels is a most serious occurrence."
"Notwithstanding the fact that those responsible for what happened must be properly identified, the consequences clearly established and the destination of the contaminated products properly traced, this incident also requires us to reflect more carefully on the complete failure of the existing regulatory model."
"Here we have an example of the consequences of a market-orientated common agricultural policy, which promotes models of intensive production for export, which in turn favours large-scale agro-industry at the cost of small and medium-sized agriculture and family farming."
"This renders local production and consumption completely unviable instead of promoting it, as is necessary in order to guarantee a far greater degree of traceability."
"This is yet another example of the need for a fundamental change in the current common agricultural policy in the interests of public health and food safety and quality."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, one may note a certain exasperation in relation to these repeated crises, of which there was one in Belgium in 1999, a large-scale crisis very similar to the current one."
"To put it very clearly, we have the strictest measures in the world."
"I do not believe that we should make them stricter."
"We simply have to make them function better."
"Probably one of the first measures we should adopt is to increase the penalties imposed on these criminals, because this is obviously not about a clumsy intermediary - it is a crime organised by white-collar criminals who want to maximise their profits."
"Second, another priority could be to strengthen the controls and ensure that they are more in line with the risks posed."
"Third, as Mrs Stihler said, the RAPEX rapid exchange system, which normally serves to ensure that all the Member States are warned of a potential risk, has probably shown certain weaknesses in this regard."
"I would have liked your opinion on this matter, Commissioner."
"(DE) Madam President, the German animal feed industry has a good system of self-controlled tests."
"However, this system does not work in the case of criminal activities and schemes."
"If someone intentionally or illegally mixes prohibited substances into animal feed, he will also intentionally avoid these self-controlled tests."
"Following on from what my fellow Members have said, I think there are three more important principal conclusions: firstly, we need more state checks."
"Secondly, we need it to be a requirement to report all of the results of feed tests, and these must also be produced during the relevant checks."
"Thirdly, we need tougher penalties for the criminals."
"This is not a minor offence - it was done with intent."
"Finally, I would like to point out that, in this animal feed scandal, it is the farmers who are suffering the most, because at the moment, they are not able to sell their products at all, or if they can, it is at a huge loss."
"Madam President, when I listen to the comments that have been made - and here I would like to thank all those who participated in the debate - I cannot help but reflect on the criticism we receive, not just with regard to this issue, but on almost everything we do as Europe; on the additional bureaucracy we impose on everyone when we draw up regulations and require certain control procedures."
"Consumers, entrepreneurs and businessmen all accuse us of imposing barriers that impede things from functioning smoothly."
"However, when cases such as this one on dioxins occur, it clearly emerges, as we have heard today, that there is, in fact, a need for certain control systems that are currently in place."
"Indeed, we come to realise how important they are and how diligent we must be in implementing them."
"As a consumer, I would be extremely unhappy to have to experience a situation of this sort, as would all European consumers, because it threatens to shake our trust in the safety of European products."
"Moreover, it angers me to find out that this happened because of persons who have intentionally broken the law, and that it was not out of genuine error."
"In fact, as the final speaker has just said, no system can function where criminality is present."
"Where there are persons who want to break the law, then it is impossible to guarantee a system that will operate smoothly and without a hitch."
"This is why we need to do our utmost to ensure that we have the finest of safety nets possible in place, woven with the tiniest mesh possible, in order to avoid these criminals from slipping through the holes."
"I have been involved in the drawing up of legislation in my country since 1987."
"In my 23 years of experience in the field, I have always found that the biggest challenge is not deciding on which clauses to enter into a piece of legislation, but trying to anticipate how that law will be broken and therefore to try and counter it from beforehand."
"I believe that that is the current reality of the situation."
"We do not want another occurrence of this sort to take place and we must do all that we can to guarantee that our system is at least capable of promptly catching those who try to sneak past the rules that are already in place, and the ones which we draw up together."
"We can only act when we know what is going on, not when we are in the dark as to what is happening."
"Here, I would like to comment on the Rapid Alert System."
"I do not believe that this system did not work - indeed, it worked as it should, because the second we were alerted to the situation, the information was sent out to everyone."
"That is what the Rapid Alert System is all about, and in that respect it worked very well."
"We also need to strengthen our rules and regulations."
"I agree with what Ms McGuinness said as regards the importance of establishing guidelines and laying down requirements that ensure the strictest control over food chains that carry health risks."
"To this end, one of the things we are trying to do, or are going to suggest, is not to focus solely on certain risk elements and require simple company registrations, such as those of feed mills, and leave it at that."
"Instead, post-approval should be granted after certain due diligence exercises have been carried out."
"We must ensure that this incident is now kept under control."
"I am in constant contact with the competent German authorities and am satisfied that they are doing everything in their power, not only to contain the situation as quickly as possible and to collect all the information necessary to form a clear and whole picture of the situation, but also in terms of the action they are taking."
"I have been informed, for example, that the feed mill producer who passed on false information by claiming that he had supplied just ten farms, when in fact he had supplied nine hundred, is already undergoing proceedings that have been initiated by the prosecution authorities in Germany, as this false information could have potentially led to significant consequences."
"We can also rest assured that the products that Germany exported, and that were intended for the food manufacturing market, such as eggs, were tested and found to contain very low levels of dioxins, since they were mixed with other non German products in the food manufacturing process."
"At this juncture, since my speaking time is up, I would like to make one final comment."
"I fully agree that we should impose the harshest of sanctions on those who take advantage of the system."
"However, it is necessary to understand that these kinds of measures are not something that we can draw up or lay down in our capacity as the Commission."
"Rather, it is up to the Member States to decide to enforce them on a national level."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The EU should urge Germany and all the countries involved in this matter to take the appropriate measures to remedy the situation by imposing sanctions and ensuring that all those involved in the dioxin crisis take full responsibility for the extensive damage caused to the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, and to consumers."
"The fact that some animal feed producers have been aware of this dioxin contamination since March 2010 without reporting it to the authorities is completely unacceptable."
"I therefore call for the utmost transparency in informing all the Member States and third countries of all the details surrounding the potentially contaminated feed."
"All food products that do not conform to EU legislation must be identified and recalled from the market."
"It is necessary to ensure that every measure is taken to protect public health, and for rapid and detailed information about the development of the situation to be available; this must be reported with the utmost accuracy and transparency, so that we can return to normality as soon as possible and restore vital consumer confidence in the food chain."

"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, at this early stage, to express my thanks to all my fellow Members for the work that we have carried out together on this issue, which has enabled all the political groups in this Parliament to reach a common position and has allowed them to table an oral question and to draw up a resolution to accompany the voluntary partnership agreements."
"The subject is an important one."
"As you all know, the forest is receding."
"Every two seconds, across the world, the equivalent of a football pitch is destroyed; within a year, an area the size of Greece is deforested."
"Clearly, this is a tragic situation."
"It is tragic from the point of view of diversity: a few thousand plant and animal species are threatened, and the forests which are most affected - tropical forests - contain half of the world's biodiversity."
"It is obviously tragic, too, from the point of view of climate change: deforestation is responsible for 20% of greenhouse gas emissions."
"Finally, deforestation puts some hundreds of millions of people in danger - people who either live in the forests or live off them."
"Forest exploitation and the forestry industry are among the principal causes of deforestation, particularly in the area on which we are focusing today: the Congo basin."
"It is estimated that 20 to 40% of the timber felled and exchanged in the world is illegal timber."
"The issue that we are raising today is therefore obviously a crucial one."
"These voluntary partnership agreements have been approved in the context of the approval procedure within the Committee on International Trade."
"Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, this procedure allows the European Parliament to express its view."
"At the same time, however, it can only say yes or no."
"Hence, this debate is extremely important because it allows us to go into more detail, and it allows you, Commissioner, as a representative of the Commission, to respond to the questions that Parliament is putting to you."
"These agreements are important; they allow us to ensure the traceability of timber."
"They also put in place independent verification procedures, and supplement forest policies and governance in the countries concerned."
"Today, we are talking about the Republic of the Congo and Cameroon."
"However, I would like to make an initial point before going into these agreements and Parliament's questions: we really must differentiate between legal timber and sustainable timber."
"Obviously, we are dealing with the legality of timber here, but legal timber does not necessarily mean sustainable forest exploitation."
"Therefore, the first general question that I would ask the Commission is: how will the Commission act to ensure overall consistency on the issue of forests - 2011 is the International Year of Forests - while taking account of what was said in Nagoya and what was decided in Cancún, in particular, on the REDD+ mechanism, and taking account too of the trade agreements that have been negotiated, which are sometimes responsible for deforestation through liberalising trade in timber?"
"Next, we are still waiting for an answer from the European Commission on the question of biofuels and indirect changes in land use."
"As you know, Parliament has asked you to integrate these issues into the criteria for evaluating the sustainability of biofuels."
"More specifically, concerning the voluntary partnership agreements, there are many positive elements: we greatly appreciated the negotiation efforts and, in particular, the involvement of members of civil society in Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo."
"We know that it is not easy and, from this point of view, these voluntary partnership agreements seemed to be a success."
"As I was saying just now, however, a number of questions and requests remain."
"Commissioner, are you ready to come, for example, every six months, or six months after the signing of an agreement, to update us on the implementation of the agreement?"
"I ask because it is clear that the negotiation and the implementation of the agreement may be of a very different quality."
"We would therefore like you to come and tell us if the parties concerned, in particular, the members of civil society, continue to be involved in its implementation."
"In countries in which it is still not easy to complain, particularly when corruption exists, have complaint mechanisms been provided for - in particular, independent ones - so that these members of civil society can complain about poor implementation and report that they are no longer being listened to?"
"In the same way, we would like you to regularly report on the impacts of the implementation of these agreements, so that you can tell us where we have got to with them, both in terms of the overall consistency of the Commission's actions on forests, and in terms of their specific implementation on the issue of the legality of timber."
"Lastly, a final point: you claim that there is no budget in these agreements."
"Yet we will obviously need budgets to support these policies, so can you clarify the budgetary issue in relation to these voluntary partnership agreements?"
"author. - Madam President, the tropical rainforests in Cameroon and the Congo are precious and we must welcome this voluntary agreement to address the sustainability of the harvesting of the timber that they contain."
"The forests belong not only to the people of these countries but they are part of the ecosystem of the planet, they are key to the life-sustaining systems and they contain billions of tonnes of carbon."
"Halting deforestation is one of the ways that we should be tackling climate change, and governments around the globe have been trying to do this for years."
"These two countries should be congratulated for their courage and foresight in signing up to these voluntary agreements with the EU."
"However, regulating and enforcing these agreements will prove a challenge."
"Heaven knows, building in sustainable management of our own continent's resources is hard enough."
"But the will is there and for that we should be very pleased."
"Careful management can bring down illegal and unsustainably imported timber."
"At the moment, the amount of timber that is illegally harvested and imported into the EU constitutes almost one fifth of the timber products on our markets, despite Parliament and others trying to tackle this."
"Enforcement will be made easier with the involvement of local people and civil society in these countries, and we must ensure that their right to be heard and involved is maintained and listened to."
"After all, they have the most to lose if their forests are removed."
"The widespread removal of tropical timber is driven by an insatiable appetite for products to grace our homes."
"We should value this resource better and take greater care of the resource that not only sustains a whole host of plant and animal species but is slow growing and takes many years to reach maturity."
"We must take care not to undermine our own efforts to fight deforestation and climate change by simultaneously providing the largest market for illegal timber products in the world."
"The result of these agreements may mean that tropical timber reaches a higher price, and that is something that we should not object to."
"It is not only a limited resource, but it is the only thing that local people have to sell."
"They know the true value of their resource and with this agreement, so will we."
"These people are our eyes and ears in the forest and we need their help to enforce the agreements."
"They need us to support their ability to voice any concerns."
"These agreements are a two-way process and we look to you, Commissioner, to be able to enforce it."
"The VPAs (Voluntary Partnership Agreements) are good for the planet, good for our partner countries and good for the EU."
"We must ensure that the agreements work and that any breaches are monitored and addressed."
"Then we must look to other countries in Africa, Asia and South America to sign up to similar agreements as soon as possible and I look forward to working with you and the Commission to achieve this."
"author. - Madam President, let me begin by thanking Yannick Jadot for his exemplary cooperation with his shadows."
"We all worked extremely well on this report and I am delighted - as he has said - that we managed to reach a broad consensus."
"The agreements with Congo and Cameroon, taken together with Ghana, means that some of Africa's most vulnerable forests are now covered by Voluntary Partnership Agreements."
"The existence of these agreements, as the two previous speakers have said, is to be warmly welcomed."
"They provide a mechanism for tackling the massive illegal trade in timber."
"They provide an opportunity for the better management of a vital natural resource and, hopefully, they will bring greater transparency and help us tackle corruption in the forest sector, which, unfortunately in Africa, is endemic at the moment."
"But, while welcoming these agreements, I nevertheless share with the rapporteur a number of concerns."
"I would just like to express three this evening."
"First and foremost, the danger - it is not the intention, but there is a danger - of agreeing such a framework is that it is seen as providing a framework for large-scale exploitation of our forests, leading to the opposite of the purpose of the agreement, namely, further degradation and further deforestation, thus contributing to the very destruction of the global environment we are trying to avoid."
"What we want is an agreement that contributes to the conservation and sustainable management of our biodiversity resources."
"I agree with the rapporteur that this means that the Commission has to constantly monitor the situation and report back regularly on how the agreement is progressing."
"Secondly, indigenous people, who are so often the victims of environmental exploitation, should benefit from this agreement."
"The promise in the Voluntary Partnership Agreement by the Congolese Government to promote a law ensuring that the rights of indigenous people are promoted and respected must be delivered upon."
"Again, I urge the Commission, in their contact with the government, to continually press for the delivery of this promise until it is there on the statute book in the Congo."
"Thirdly, we must ensure - and I agree with Catherine Bearder who mentioned this - that appropriate funds are available to properly implement this agreement."
"No matter how good an agreement is on paper, without the resources to carry it out, it is a meaningless piece of paper."
"As has been indicated, there are no financial packages attached to the agreement itself."
"It is up to us - both the Commission to propose, and Parliament and Council to put into the budget appropriate budgetary facilities - to make this agreement work."
"That means we need to have money to verify the legality of timber coming into the European Union, we need money to train, equip and give the technical expertise to those operating in the African countries we have VPAs with, and we also need resources to carry out the monitoring that I have already mentioned."
"So we need to make sure, in the coming months, that we deliver the financial framework to make a success of these agreements."
"I repeat that these are good agreements but, like all agreements, they will depend on the goodwill and vigilance of individuals - the non-government organisations, the Member States, the Congolese and Cameroon governments - to deliver on their promises to make sure these agreements work in practice."
"They should lead to better management of our forests and better management of vital global resources but, if wrongly handled, they could take us in the opposite direction."
"We look to the Commission to keep a beady eye on the progress that is being made."
"author. - Madam President, we agree with the general approach of Yannick Jadot to this issue."
"I welcome any agreement that guarantees protection of the rainforests of our planet, if such agreements also advance the protection of the indigenous people of the forest and give a better life to the majority of the people in the countries concerned."
"It must be said at the start that both the Republic of Congo and Cameroon have highly repressive governments."
"Cameroon is very high in the Corruption Index kept by Transparency International, and in the Republic of Congo, there has been horrific exploitation of some sections of the population, notably the pygmy people, although a new law has just been passed and people will wait to see what this does to protect indigenous people."
"The logging industry in these countries is implicated in corruption and in the exploitation of workers and the deforestation involved is a huge threat to the livelihoods of the indigenous people."
"It is for this reason that the original resolution of the European United Left Group calls for the logging industry to be in public ownership and under democratic control, crucially involving workers in the industry and the indigenous communities in the forests affected by logging."
"The Left's resolution also points out that illegal logging is related to poverty levels in the countries concerned."
"It can provide an income for individuals and their families who would otherwise go hungry, and therefore, ending illegal logging is also linked to ending the poverty and deprivation of many communities in the relevant countries."
"This will not be done by the corrupt local elites, nor by European multinational corporations whose key motivation is private profit, but by the forestry workers and the indigenous peoples themselves taking democratic ownership of their resources."
"In this sense, the people of sub-Saharan Africa can take inspiration from their brothers and sisters in Tunisia in their heroic struggle against a corrupt dictatorship over the past weeks."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, several countries that export tropical hardwood have started to sign voluntary partnership agreements with the EU under the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan."
"The European Union will provide support for forest governance reforms and capacity building, in particular, the implementation of traceability and legality verification systems for wood-based products."
"There is something I believe to be particularly important: if it helps to improve transparency and prevent environmental damage in connection with forestry activities, then it is a good thing for the partners to commit to amending and improving current legal provisions."
"I also expressly welcome the fact that the European Union has made a commitment to provide support for capacity building in the timber producing countries, particularly in connection with the implementation of traceability and legality verification systems for timber and wood-based products."
"There are two more points I would like to mention."
"The idea behind the voluntary partnership agreements is to put an end to the trade in illegally felled wood and products made from this wood and to help to stop deforestation, forest degradation and their effects in the form of CO2 emissions, as well as the loss of biodiversity, throughout the world."
"Further large-scale exploitation of tropical and other particularly species-rich forests with a high carbon storage capacity is irresponsible and may lead to further deforestation and forest degradation, with devastating consequences for the environment worldwide."
"These agreements are therefore a small, but positive step in the right direction."
"I am in complete agreement with the points made by the previous speakers."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation and I would be very pleased if we could make real progress with these agreements in order to make our world a little bit better."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Jadot, for his support for the Voluntary Partnership Agreements on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade with Congo and Cameroon."
"I hope this House will follow the recommendations for consent to conclude these two agreements."
"This would also encourage the parliaments in both Cameroon and Congo to complete their consideration."
"It is important that both the European Union and our partner countries endorse the VPAs, since illegal logging is a problem for all."
"I know that illegal logging is just the visible tip of the iceberg."
"Basically, we are talking about starting to work together for sustainable management of forestry resources."
"And, to answer one of the rapporteur's suggestions immediately, I could say that, yes, I am ready to come here every six months, as Parliament calls me, to monitor the implementation of these agreements."
"It is true that this is a commitment."
"There are risks but this is the only way, in my opinion, to achieve really sustainable management of this resource, because if we do not do this, we will not manage to be successful through declarations alone."
"For our partner countries, there is a lot of commitment, but I believe that one important factor is the loss that results from illegal logging."
"Each year, USD 10-15 billion is lost in revenue."
"Illegal logging also has extremely negative consequences for indigenous peoples, for biodiversity and in terms of climate change."
"At the same time, it is also important to emphasise that the EU is one of the biggest markets for tropical wood."
"This means that our approach is extremely important in how the whole issue is being addressed."
"Of the tropical wood arriving in the EU, 20% comes from illegal sources, so we have an obligation to ensure that we source only legal wood."
"The climate change issue is another concern for everyone, and the protection of forests needs to start somewhere."
"It is very simple to say that we need to pay to protect forests: it is a simple formula, but applying it requires a lot of commitment from both sides."
"I shall try to answer a couple of questions that have been put to me."
"On enforcement and implementation, the VPA establishes a joint committee to monitor implementation of the agreement."
"It will also establish an independent audit to analyse the legality assurance system and its effectiveness and efficiency."
"There is also an annual reporting mechanism, and the annual report will be made public and will definitely be available to the European Parliament."
"Moreover, in preparation for the VPAs, we have involved civil society and indigenous peoples."
"Until now, they had been completely left out of the process, so we have agreed, under the new agreements, to set up multi-stakeholder committees to monitor, or guide, the implementation process where indigenous people are involved."
"In addition, the VPAs include a complaints mechanism, and the independent auditor will have access to, and will rely on, information from a wide array of sources, including civil society and communities."
"There is a definite cost in terms of resources."
"Between 2002 and 2008, the EU contributed EUR 544 million to forestry in general in the developing world, some of it directed to FLEGT work in individual countries."
"The Commission has so far spent a further EUR 35 million to support FLEGT more generally, and we will spend EUR 35 million more between 2011 and 2013."
"I would emphasise, too, that Member States also make fiscal contributions."
"We have also dedicated human resources to the implementation of FLEGT."
"I have seven civil servants dealing with this, and they are working closely with the European Forest Institute and national forest authorities."
"An additional effort has been made in the form of the Illegal Timber Regulation, adopted in 2010 as a key element of the FLEGT action plan, and this will complement the VPA approach."
"It will discourage unregulated, unsustainable exploitation of forests."
"The recent agreement in Cancún on action to reduce emissions due to deforestation and forest degradation (known as 'REDD') will facilitate further Commission support for developing countries."
"Our future work on forest governance through VPAs will be helped by the fact that REDD makes provision for governance and for observance of the rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities."
"I take note of the human rights situation in partner countries."
"I agree with the draft motion for a resolution that the Commission should continue to focus on these issues."
"I can assure you that we keep human rights issues at the centre of our political dialogue with the partner countries, and I can assure you that the fight against corruption is one of the issues we address when dealing with the partner countries."
"But I would emphasise one particular point that represents encouragement for the whole process: the fact that partner countries feel engaged."
"Without real engagement from our partner countries, given all the weaknesses at administrative level, we cannot protect forests more effectively."
"I know that this is the start of the process, but it is a start being made by both sides, and I am always ready to come to Parliament to report on how the implementation is going."
"However, with FLEGT, we are definitely not taking a wrong step."
"It is a step in the right direction: we are not increasing the risk."
"Perhaps we are not providing entirely sufficient solutions, but at least it is a decent step that we can be proud of."
"Composition of Parliament: see Minutes"
"EU-Cameroon forest law agreement - EU-Republic of Congo forest law agreement - FLEGT voluntary partnership agreements (continuation of debate)"
"We now return to the debate."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these partnership agreements between the European Union, Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo should, in principle, turn out to be good news for these populations, and good news for biodiversity."
"However, this is only one stage in a long process which the European Parliament will follow closely."
"If we want this agreement to allow for the introduction of a regulated, transparent and environmentally friendly timber trade which benefits local populations, rather than a few groups of dubious legality, the European Union must ensure that the rights of the local and indigenous populations are fully respected and that the latter actually participate in the consultations."
"It must help strengthen the capabilities of all those involved; it must contribute to the fight against corruption and to the introduction of real forest governance."
"The agreements must not be a pretext for continuing to pillage the natural resources of developing countries."
"Rather, they must help restore a balance in relations between the European Union and these countries."
"Madam President, these Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) agreements that we are to vote on tomorrow concerning Congo and Cameroon are important European tools, or weapons, in the fight against illegal logging and, for that reason, I welcome them."
"Illegal logging is a huge problem, both in terms of the environment and from an economic and social point of view."
"At the same time, it is important to remember that it is rarely the problem itself, in this case illegal logging, that creates the conditions for trade in illegal timber."
"Instead, this is a symptom and a consequence of many other problems that, in many cases, are even more serious - poverty, lack of ownership rights, corruption and, in certain cases, war."
"The problems are greatest in some of the world's poorest countries."
"I am therefore very pleased that the Commission bore that in mind when drawing up and negotiating the agreements."
"We could say that we have provided free trade in exchange for the countries concerned making reforms to strengthen ownership rights, fight corruption and ensure the introduction of reasonable forestry legislation."
"That fact that we are tackling the root causes rather than the symptoms is what gives us the best indication that what we are going to do tomorrow is a step in the right direction."
"At the same time, it is important to remember, particularly ahead of forthcoming negotiations with other countries, that in our fight against trade in illegally logged timber, we must not prevent poor countries from exporting one of their more valuable raw materials."
"We must not make it harder for them to use wood, which is a fantastic natural material."
"The good is not the enemy of the best."
"I would like to remind you that my country, Sweden, became rich at one time precisely by exporting timber."
"We must not prevent the poor countries of today from taking that opportunity."
"As you now go further and negotiate the agreements, I hope that you will continue to fight specifically against illegally logged timber and not against the trade in timber."
"Madam President, the European Commission has initiated the process of concluding voluntary partnership agreements with countries which export timber to the European Union."
"In this context, I think that it is important to set up a structure promoting the active involvement of local communities, with a view both to monitoring the agreement's implementation and improving the forest governance framework and, last but not least, in order to prevent corruption as much as possible."
"Involving civil society in the process of drafting the agreement with Cameroon is a positive indication of this."
"At the same time, specific measures are required to continue this kind of dialogue in all the signatory countries."
"It is also important to aim at developing a socially and environmentally sustainable timber industry, including through the reduction of deforestation and forest degradation in these countries."
"The agreements must comply with the European Union's international environmental and sustainable development commitments."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, we are debating Voluntary Partnership Agreements."
"These are lovely words, they are good words: they represent a European Union that is not trying to impose its will upon developing nations but is trying to lend a helping hand to achieve common goals."
"Yet the practicalities of an agreement with a state the size of Congo create all sorts of daunting problems."
"The size of the state alone is something akin to that of Europe; the governance for much of that state is non-existent; corruption levels are quite extraordinary - Transparency International puts the Republic of Congo almost bottom of its league table."
"Then there is the number of staff we have working to ensure that this agreement delivers on its goals - just a handful of people; the profits of illegal logging are absolutely vast and perhaps greater than anything we can offer by way of compensation; and the markets for illegal wood are in countries like China, which may not be paying anything like the attention that we pay, and the respect that should be paid, to maintaining forests."
"All these problems suggest that voluntary partnerships, however good our intentions, will have difficulty delivering the goals."
"So what assurances can the Commission give us that every possible step will be taken to ensure that our high ambitions here will truly be realised, and that we can all have confidence that these voluntary partnership agreements, as we make them in future, will deliver on the goals we have set?"
"Madam President, the Earth's forests are the lungs of the planet, and we must do everything we can to protect them."
"At a time of rapid global population growth and, with that, a generally increasing need for resources, jobs moving to distant parts of the world and an economic crisis, I think that in the EU, we need more European timber rather than importing exotic timber from countries where it is difficult to control illegal logging and where we cannot control the corruption either."
"By clearing tropical forests, we are reducing the biodiversity in the areas concerned and contributing to the extinction of a long list of endangered species."
"We are also altering the climate."
"This is completely unnecessary, particularly when there are perfectly good alternatives."
"If we learn to plant more forest in Europe again and use more European timber, these problems will disappear."
"Why should our garden tables be made of wood from the rainforest and why are exotic parquet floors better than floors made of EU wood?"
"However, having said that, and because I cannot stop EU citizens using exotic and tropical timber, it is important that these agreements are adopted."
"It is important that we help to ensure that there is an improvement in the control of timber products and the timber we import."
"We must try to safeguard ourselves against corruption, which is extremely difficult, as reflected in the agreements."
"I am therefore under no illusion that we will succeed in putting an end to all illegal logging in either Cameroon or Congo - unfortunately."
"I would have preferred the agreements to be binding rather than voluntary."
"However, it is clearly better to have voluntary agreements than no agreements at all and therefore I support them."
"In general, however, I hope to see more initiatives to protect the world's forests, particularly when it comes to the EU's agreements with countries from problematic parts of the world."
"(DE) Madam President, in my opinion, although the partnership agreement with Cameroon in the forestry sector is indeed praiseworthy and comes during the International Year of Forests, it is also a very convenient way for the EU to improve its image."
"However, as to whether the agreement is worth the paper it is written on, I have my doubts, unfortunately."
"After all, corruption is a topical issue in Cameroon."
"Accusations against the state by environmental organisations claim that the government is very well aware of the environmental crimes of the forestry industry but is preventing monitoring and prosecutions from being carried out."
"After all, foreign companies are said to control more than 60% of the timber production and processing and three quarters of the timber exports."
"Only if it can be guaranteed that foreign companies are no longer wiping the floor with local companies, which completely lack forestry and environmental expertise, and if Cameroon gets to grips with the corruption, will this sort of agreement have any meaning."
"With all the concern about the destruction of the rainforests, this must not be used as an excuse to prevent forest owners in Europe from exploiting their forests, because forest management in most EU Member States is exemplary."
"(PL) Madam President, a month ago, I was in the Republic of Congo with the delegation of the Committee on Development, where our talks with government representatives and with experts and non-governmental organisations also covered the FLEGT initiative."
"The timber industry is a very important one for the country."
"After crude oil, it is the second largest source of export income."
"It should be remembered that what happens to income from crude oil and how it is used is not completely transparent or clear to us, or at least the information is sent with a long delay."
"At the same time, the government of the Republic of Congo is expressing concern about the future of its forest areas and is planning a huge afforestation campaign."
"Of course, we still do not know if this afforestation programme will be successful, but we should certainly wish the government of Congo all the best in its endeavours."
"This is why it is so important to strengthen legal trade in timber."
"It is equally important for FLEGT to operate in neighbouring countries, because otherwise, as a result of smuggling, for example, the agreement may prove to be ineffective in practice."
"Neither do we yet know if the standards we are promoting on the legal trade in timber will come into force and operate globally - some speakers have already called attention to this problem."
"One way or another, we must try to ensure that the system proves effective."
"We must also help in putting pressure on other importers, from outside Europe, to ensure the gradual elimination of illegal trade in timber."
"The FLEGT initiative is important, both for reducing poverty and for protecting the environment - for controlling the phenomenon of deforestation and developing a diversified economy in many countries."
"In the case of the Republic of Congo, this goes hand-in-hand with another need, which is the need to develop agriculture and reduce food imports."
"Thanks to FLEGT, international trade in timber can become fairer, more sustainable and more environmentally friendly."
"We hope this will be the case."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, my congratulations on the completion, to all intents and purposes, of negotiations on these two agreements."
"However, I should like to express my concern at the fact that the FLEGT negotiations with Indonesia and Malaysia have deadlocked."
"Commissioner, the Commission has an important instrument in its hands: the regulation on timber."
"This regulation exempts the countries with which a FLEGT agreement has been concluded from the scope of the regulation."
"It is an important instrument for giving new impetus to the negotiations."
"We really do need to conclude FLEGT agreements with all countries with important tropical forests in either Asia or Latin America and with the major timber dealers, such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, China and numerous other countries."
"These countries are taking their own way forward; they are adopting their own procedures for modernising and monitoring legal logging."
"The question is: are we doing what we need to do?"
"Are the 27 Member States passing decisions regulating imports of timber from FLEGT countries?"
"Finally, a series of delegated acts is needed for the timber regulation."
"We have two years until the regulation applies in full."
"The Commission needs to speed up the procedures, to issue delegated acts, so that the countries know the details and what they need to do to adapt."
"(GA) Madam President, without a doubt, this is a much more important question than the publicity it will receive."
"One of the great scandals of the 20th century was the continuous and systematic chopping down of forests, especially in the Third World, done not by individuals who knew no better and cannot be faulted, but by big greedy businesses and corrupt governments."
"That is why this agreement is to be welcomed wholeheartedly and I hope it will be implemented, because if it is not, it will not be worth the paper it is written on."
"On the broader front, we also have to ensure that other policies of the European Union do not contribute to continued deforestation."
"I am referring to the proposed agreement on Mercosur which many people feel will encourage farmers to chop down the forests in those countries so that they can export agricultural products into Europe."
"So we have to be vigilant."
"(GA) Thank you."
"(PT) Madam President, illegal logging in Central African countries, such as Cameroon and the Congo, constitutes a threat to the integrity of resources on which the local communities and indigenous peoples depend for their existence and way of life."
"Indeed, it is a threat to an ecosystem that is home to enormous biodiversity and plays a very important role in regulating biogeochemical cycles."
"Given the advancing destruction of the tropical rainforest in this region - and let us not forget that it is fed by the demand of operators and importers in industrialised countries, particularly countries in the European Union - the solution cannot possibly be to legalise what is illegal today, the unsustainable exploitation of the rainforest, which would be nothing short of a legitimisation of the theft of land from the local communities and the occupation of vast areas of rainforest by timber companies, as has been occurring."
"The European Union's development cooperation and aid policy has a very important role to play here in supporting the diversification of the economy of these countries and turning a model based heavily on the extraction and export of a small number of raw materials to industrialised countries completely on its head."
"(DE) Madam President, I believe that the subject of timber will occupy us even more intensively in future."
"For this agreement, it is therefore important that we provide appropriate support in the area of research and, above all, that, in terms of education and training, we make sure that the small and medium-sized enterprises in Cameroon and Congo have the opportunity to develop further in terms of their environmental knowledge in this area."
"I am therefore very pleased that this debate is taking place."
"It is important for all of us that the demand for timber is satisfied in future, too."
"(DE) Madam President, forty percent of Cameroon's surface area is covered in forest."
"Yet, we have to say, that although Cameroon is the largest exporter of tropical wood in Africa, in no other country are the forests being so extensively cleared."
"Experts estimate that, in 10 to 15 years, the ecologically important tree species from the Congo Basin will have disappeared if the logging continues as it has done."
"What can we do about this?"
"What is important for the protection of Cameroon's tropical forests is, above all, that corruption is combated, both at the level of the officials and also where the private tenant farmers are concerned, that effective criminal prosecutions continue to be carried out and, of course, that sustainable forestry is practised."
"Where a lot of felling takes place, there must also be regeneration."
"Something that is very important is better training in logging work in order to avoid premature damage during clearing."
"Above all, European companies must take some responsibility, because around 80% of the yield is shipped to Europe."
"The EU must also act accordingly in this regard by taking direct and decisive measures."
"A voluntary agreement is all well and good, but in this context, it will not get us anywhere."
"We need to make the companies accountable."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the debate definitely went beyond the scope of this Voluntary Partnership Agreement."
"It is not only trade that affects forests: the forest is an energy resource for these countries, and population growth also has an impact on the forest."
"So I would like to emphasise again that this is a first step in addressing just one of the areas of concern."
"I know that it is not a solution, but you have to start somewhere in addressing the issues."
"Also, I would not like to discourage you with regard to the level of commitment of the countries concerned."
"I know that dealing with these countries is sometimes not simple, but they are countries with a difficult history."
"They got their independence 50 years ago, and not exactly in the same circumstances as some of our countries got independence, so things take time."
"It takes time to establish state institutions capable of fighting corruption or establishing the management of resources, and they are on the right track."
"In Africa, in particular, they have economic growth even in times of crisis, and this means they are getting stronger and getting better."
"I realise this is just one indicator, but overall, there has been encouraging news, and the only way we can improve the process is by working together."
"That is where we come in with sustainable forest management: we are talking about Congo-Brazzaville (the Republic of the Congo) and Cameroon today, but we are also working with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and with Indonesia."
"We are still negotiating but we have high hopes of a positive conclusion."
"So I would say that the risks here are minimal."
"Commitment is the starting point and I look on this process as a very positive one."
"We should also consider the global commitment to fight climate change."
"Cancún gave some assurances that other parts of the world also take things seriously in that regard."
"We are not the only ones who would like the world to be fair and sustainable, and other parts of the world will learn from us."
"Let us take, for example, energy efficiency drives."
"We made a start, and other parts of the world have followed."
"The same applies to resource efficiency."
"If we can use less timber, then other parts of the world will definitely learn from our example."
"I believe there are a lot of ways in which we can lead."
"Last but not least, I would like, once again, to guarantee that the Commission will conduct monitoring, not only by my own staff, but also through the EU delegations and the Member State delegations that we have."
"This is one of the processes in which we share our efforts with the Member States."
"The Commission does not simply work alone and, in many respects, Member States' experience has been particularly crucial in concluding this voluntary partnership agreement."
"I would ask this House really very much to deal with this consent process because I believe it is a healthy process, it goes in the right direction and, at the same time, does not provide the answers on all the issues that you have raised today."
"Madam President, Commissioner, once again, I would like to thank the Members who have spoken."
"I believe that we have almost all spoken in the same terms: making this essential point about VPAs, which provide the link between development, the environment and the strengthening of civil society."
"I believe that, if there is one tool that we can use today to bring about sustainable development in these countries, particularly the African countries, it is undoubtedly the strengthening of civil society."
"As long as the only or the main expression of democracy in those countries is the vote to elect the President, then as we have seen - as the history of Côte d'Ivoire unfortunately reminds us - we will not make sufficient progress."
"Therefore, strengthening civil society - the fact that it plays a constant role in the implementation of these agreements, in the monitoring of forest exploitation, in the discussion on the conditions of this exploitation and in the sharing of revenues linked to this forest exploitation - is essential."
"It is through this strengthening of civil society, too, that we will respond best to the argument that we often hear concerning China: 'Why should we meet the criteria for strong cooperation with Europe - social, democratic and environmental criteria - when China makes a mockery of them in terms of corruption and pillaging?'"
"Well, strengthening civil society is the best defence against this system which China, in particular, is trying to impose on the countries of the South."
"Then, as you said, Commissioner, Europe is a large market for tropical timber, but it is also - and this is essential for all exploiters and for all industry - a stable and lucrative market, and that is also a very important tool in these countries."
"Thank you for your desire to work with the European Parliament."
"We are very happy about this future collaboration."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday (19 January 2011)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I am delighted that, after five years of negotiations, Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) on forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT) have been concluded with Cameroon and with the Republic of the Congo."
"These agreements will help ensure good forest governance by granting FLEGT licences to timber products from these countries and thus guaranteeing the sustainable exploitation and management of their forests."
"It is essential to have a system by which to monitor movements of timber and derived products from harvesting right up to export."
"Twenty to thirty per cent of world industrial timber production is illegal, as is 60% of the harvesting that has taken place in Africa over the last 10 years."
"These VPAs will therefore help preserve the forests in these countries by combating illegal harvesting, which causes significant environmental, economic and social damage."
"The main advantage of these VPAs is that they will apply to all exports between the EU and these countries, together with all other timber importing countries."
"I hope that this VPA system will be rolled out quickly to other forest countries."
"in writing. - FLEGT voluntary partnership agreements were a good basis on which to build international cooperation to tackle the problem of deforestation. And they continue to show their relevance today, especially in the context of last year's illegal timber regulation."
"Countries which adhere to such voluntary schemes are able to give certain guarantees about the legality and environmental sustainability of their timber sources."
"There are clear benefits in terms of environmental protection, although we should be mindful of the fact that trade in legally harvested timber is not necessarily sensitive to the needs of indigenous people."
"It is important that, as more VPAs are agreed, their effects are closely monitored and that their terms take full account of the needs and human rights of people who are dependent on forests, but who often do not have a voice in the management of those forests."
"Interim Partnership Agreement between the EC and the Pacific States - Interim Partnership Agreement between the EC and the Pacific States (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"the report by David Martin, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the recommendation on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part (05078/2010 - C7-0036/2010 - 2008/0250(NLE)),"
"the oral question to the Commission on the Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part, by Vital Moreira, David Martin, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade - B7-0807/2010)."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, firstly, I would like to say that I know that, for good reasons, Commissioner De Gucht cannot be with us this evening."
"I would like to thank him for taking the trouble to call me last week and explain why he is unable to be here, and I would like to thank him and his team at DG Trade for their cooperation and, in particular, Martin Dihm for all his assistance."
"I have tried, in my role as rapporteur, to follow on from the good work of the previous rapporteur, my former colleague Glyn Ford."
"I am fortunate that the adoption of Glyn's resolution in 2009 meant that Parliament already had a clear position on the EC-Pacific Interim Economic Partnership Agreement."
"Parliament's formal position then is the one that I have tried to follow in my report and question today."
"I would like to thank Donatella Pribaz, who was the committee administrator responsible."
"This turned out to be her last report for the committee before her promotion, so I would like to wish her well in her new job and thank her for making my task here easier."
"Finally, in terms of acknowledgements, I would also like to welcome the presence here of the Ambassador for Papua New Guinea and to thank him and his staff for their close collaboration."
"The insights they provided allowed me to make specific input to the report."
"Firstly, I would like to make a few general remarks on the agreement and the regional context."
"Secondly, I plan to discuss three specific aspects of the EPA which I believe it is important to highlight: namely, Aid for Trade, the Fijian political situation and fisheries."
"Thirdly, I will comment on the future of EC-Pacific trading relations."
"In terms of the background and regional integration, this interim - or goods only - EPA has been negotiated with two Pacific states - Papua New Guinea and Fiji."
"These are the two Pacific island states that have the highest levels of trade with the EU and have key exports destined for the EU market: tuna and sugar respectively."
"The EPA gives Papua New Guinea and Fiji duty-free and quota-free access to the EU market in return for the gradual liberalisation of their markets over a 15-year period."
"Papua New Guinea has committed to liberalising 88% of EU imports on the date of application of this agreement, and Fiji will liberalise 87% over a 15-year period."
"The remaining 12 Pacific states either enjoy duty-free and quota-free access through the Everything But Arms scheme or, because of their low level of trade with the EU, have very little interest in an interim EPA."
"Nevertheless, I believe it is important that, as we move towards a full EPA, we should pursue our objective of regional integration and continue to press for a full EPA involving all the Pacific states."
"In terms of the content of the resolution, Parliament has to consent to this agreement before it can be ratified."
"We will vote on Wednesday - as you have indicated, Madam President - on two different reports, firstly, on consent, which I am recommending that we give, and secondly on the accompanying motion for a resolution."
"There are other issues in the motion for a resolution but, as I have said, I want to comment particularly on three."
"First, regarding Aid for Trade, funding for implementation is crucial to achieving the agreement's objectives of economic diversification and poverty alleviation."
"It is important that a fair and equitable share of the EUR 2 billion set aside in the 2007 Aid for Trade strategy is directed towards the Pacific region."
"It is also important to highlight that this interim EPA was conceived as a short-term measure to safeguard the Pacific's trade preferences following the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruling."
"Bearing that in mind, it should not be seen as a sign of EU acceptance of the political regime in Fiji."
"I would urge the Fijian Government to make moves towards democracy."
"I hope that the necessary reforms can take place to allow financial support for the Fijian sugar industry to be allocated."
"On fishing, the fisheries sector plays a key role in Papua New Guinea's economy and - importantly - provides employment and income to its citizens."
"In the three tuna processing plants which export to the EU, there are 5 700 employees, the majority of whom are women."
"This is a country where it is sometimes difficult to find good employment for women."
"I support the purpose of the flexible rules of origin in this agreement, namely, to develop the processing industry, but it is essential that the industry develops in a sustainable manner."
"Environmental considerations are paramount and I have asked, in my report, for the Commission to monitor this aspect and to report back regularly to Parliament on compliance with the regulation on illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing."
"I appreciate that there are some concerns in this House - and specifically in the Committee on Fisheries - about the potential impact of Papua New Guinea's tuna imports on the EU industry."
"However, when we look at the latest figures, we can see that during the period 2003-2009, imports made up around only 2% of total preserved and prepared fish imports and around only 3% of preserved and prepared tuna imports."
"I do not believe that this low level of imports will threaten the domestic EU industry, especially if we take into account the limited capacity of the Pacific states' fishing fleets and the limited on-land processing capacity."
"Nevertheless, it is, of course, right that we should continue to monitor the situation and that, if there are any unexpected increases in fishing products coming from Papua New Guinea, the Commission should take appropriate action."
"As I mentioned earlier, I hope that the Pacific states can agree a comprehensive regional EPA."
"In my report, I have recommended the inclusion of several points of substance in future negotiations, which I hope the Commission will take into account. These include intellectual property."
"Too often, we talk about intellectual property from one side only, but I hope that we will look at intellectual property in terms of including traditional knowledge."
"I also hope we will add transparency in government procurement as well as provision for issuing working visas of up to 24 months."
"As we move towards a full EPA, I hope the Commission will involve all the Pacific states but, in the meantime, let us press ahead and get the interim EPA with PNG and Fiji on the books and working as a demonstration of what we can achieve in the future."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and particularly for his positive attitude on consent to the interim Economic Partnership Agreement with the Pacific states of Papua New Guinea and Fiji."
"I hope that this House will follow his advice."
"Consent by the European Parliament - for the first time on a trade agreement under the Lisbon Treaty - has important political significance because this is a trade agreement with a long-term development focus and because of the momentum it will provide to ongoing negotiations on the comprehensive EPA with the Pacific region."
"Back in 2007, the immediate purpose of the interim agreement was to secure continued access to the EU market for those countries in the Pacific region which most depend on it, given the impending expiry of the Cotonou trade regime."
"The Commission's commitment to concluding negotiations on a comprehensive EPA with the Pacific region as a whole remains unchanged and we are currently engaged in negotiations with our Pacific partners."
"We can go forward only if we accept the special nature of the Pacific region and tailor the EPA accordingly."
"We are talking about small and remote island states which differ greatly in their economic situation, development needs and relations with the EU."
"Some countries have 'least developed country' status and are therefore covered by the EU's Everything But Arms trade regime; some have little, if any, trade with the Union."
"We are therefore open to entering into the trade relationships that best suit the Pacific region as a whole, and the ongoing negotiations will inform the ultimate choices."
"Whatever approach we opt for, it is absolutely crucial to ensure that any agreement will indeed contribute to the development of the countries concerned."
"That is why there is also financial assistance to enhance trade capacity."
"That is why we will allow partner countries in the developing world to exclude more sensitive products from the trade agreements: something that we would not allow other countries to do."
"In this context, I have duly taken note of the concerns expressed about the derogation in the interim EPA from the standard rules of origin for fisheries products."
"It is precisely for development reasons that we granted this derogation and we did so on the basis of our informed judgment that Papua New Guinea's small market share makes it unlikely that its tuna exports could damage the interests of the EU industry."
"The European Union and Papua New Guinea have applied these rules provisionally since 2008 and, whereas export figures have fluctuated, no upward trend has been detected."
"Let me also reassure you that the Commission does not intend to offer similar arrangements to any other region."
"The Commission will, in any event, closely monitor the implementation of the derogation and will report to Parliament on the basis of a study which will be prepared before the end of 2011."
"Some of you were also present in September last year when the current elected Prime Minister addressed the INTA Committee."
"He expressed the readiness of his government to grant EU vessels and investors access to Papua New Guinea's waters."
"We take this oral declaration very seriously and we will continue to engage with our partners till it comes to fruition."
"Parliament's consent will allow us to launch the implementation mechanisms provided for the agreement; one of these is the Trade Committee, which could be convened this spring and which provides a platform for raising all the issues relating to mutual obligations under the interim EPA."
"Your vote is therefore crucial to helping us move forward on this and other important issues."
"With regard to Fiji, the country did sign the interim EPA but it does not apply it provisionally."
"This makes Papua New Guinea currently the only country provisionally applying the EU-Pacific interim EPA."
"Fiji continues, for the time being, to have access to the EU market under the Market Access Regulation, since the Council has not adopted trade sanctions."
"As you are aware, the EU decided to suspend development aid to Fiji because of the political situation in the country."
"Resumption of aid would presuppose progress in governance in Fiji and, in particular, a return to democratic principles of government, but at the moment, there is no tangible progress in Fiji in this regard."
"The EPA we have discussed today is only an interim arrangement to ensure that access to the EU market is not lost."
"The Commission is fully committed to continue negotiations on a comprehensive EPA with the Pacific region."
"Mr President, Commissioner, exemption from the rules of origin is based on a very serious calculation error by the Commission regarding its impact, not only on the EU tuna sector, which is very serious, but also on the Pacific region, which we are seeking to help."
"Meanwhile, the real beneficiaries are almost exclusively the greedy fleets from China and South-East Asia and their processing industries."
"The Directorate-General for Trade established this exemption based on the fact that Papua New Guinea does not have the fishing capacity to exploit its resources."
"However, according to the most recent data from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, there are 41 seiners under Papua New Guinea flags operating in the area, which, in 2009, had a catch total of almost 500 000 tonnes. Out of this catch, more than 75 000 tonnes ended up in the European Union (semi-processed and processed), which makes Papua New Guinea one of the six main exporters to the European Union."
"It is not, therefore, true, as you say, that in order to develop Papua New Guinea's fishing sector, other fleets needed to be given free entry."
"Under no circumstances can the European Union shirk its commitment to sustainable development."
"However, we are seeing that, under the protection of this exemption, and in order to bring in Asian investors, Papua New Guinea has amended its legislation so that it is not possible to make complaints about environmental damage, and has implemented investment rules that allow local workers and cheap labour from Asia to be hired, along with the worst imaginable labour standards."
"If we add to this the fact that, in the regional fisheries organisation that I mentioned, Papua New Guinea is leading other countries in flatly refusing to sign up to any international rules to manage and control fisheries, the result is that, while the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries is going the whole hog to combat illegal fishing, others are opening their doors to it."
"Commissioner, I have just come back from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, and I am well aware of the position that Papua New Guinea has taken."
"I therefore maintain the position of the Committee on Fisheries of asking for the exemption to be suspended in the review of the agreement that we are discussing."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for the PPE Group, I would like to start by saying that we welcome the increasing role of the EU as a trading power in every region of the world, including the Pacific region."
"The agreement, as it is now, is not a perfect one, not least because it is not a comprehensive EPA, but only an interim one."
"We hope that the Commission will be in a position to negotiate, in due time, a comprehensive EPA including a larger number of countries in the region."
"Secondly, the current agreement concerns only a small part of EU trade, since the share of EU trade accounted for by the whole of the Pacific region is just 0.06%, and yet some areas have caused us concern, most notably on the issue of the derogation from the rules of origin for fishery products."
"In our resolution, we raise our concern that a number of countries, such as the Philippines, Thailand, China, the United States, Australia and others, will be able to take advantage of this derogation and potentially export large quantities of processed fisheries products to the EU, potentially harming the interests of the EU fish processing and canning industry."
"We therefore encourage the Commission to act on Parliament's request for it to conduct an impact assessment study and, in the event that the assessment demonstrates a destabilising effect on the EU's fish processing and canning industry, for it to initiate the procedure leading to suspension of the exceptional arrangements in this agreement regarding rules of origin."
"Mr President, the current Interim Partnership Agreement signed in November 2007 by the European Commission and the states of Papua New Guinea and Fiji was heavily criticised by civil society and politicians in the Pacific region."
"They highlighted the adverse impact the agreement has had on the level of regional solidarity and the political desire for economic integration in the region."
"The region was split into groupings which negotiated on an individual basis and under pressure to reach an interim agreement with the European Commission."
"At the same time, granting originating product status and an exemption from EU customs duties for fish products originating from Papua New Guinea and Fiji is believed to have led to a processing centre for these products, including some non-originating products, being set up by companies from neighbouring countries with the aim of enjoying the benefits of the exemption."
"This process would have an adverse impact on the industry, workers and local incomes, given that the fishing industry is one of the most important creators of jobs in these countries."
"It would also mean unfair competition for EU products."
"As a result, the agreement may have had the opposite to the desired effect."
"Therefore, the European Commission must ensure that the future partnership agreement will make a contribution both to the development of a sustainable local fishing industry which creates jobs and to closer regional integration, for instance, through negotiating the future agreement with the entire Pacific region."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, one of the objectives of the EPAs is to promote regional integration."
"What we have seen so far is that this is not happening."
"On the contrary, in the case of the Pacific, the EU is undermining unity by offering interim agreements to some ACP countries, with special conditions attached."
"The derogation from the rules of origin for fish processed in Papua New Guinea and Fiji is an example of this."
"I believe that this derogation is potentially hazardous and that it must be thoroughly evaluated in 2011, as already agreed."
"I say this because it is important to have facts when discussing this matter."
"What are the effects on global fish stocks, on employment and on the environment in Papua New Guinea?"
"What are the social conditions of the workers?"
"All this must be fully and transparently assessed, and then the derogation may or may not be abolished on that basis, and not on the basis of complaints from the Spanish fishing industry which, itself, fishes in Papua New Guinea but never lands fish there - and, by the way, does not pay customs duty when it sells the fish as European on the European market."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think that it is a slight exaggeration to call the Interim Economic Partnership Agreements 'Pacific Agreements', since, of the 15 ACP States in the area, only two are signatories to them."
"Obviously, these agreements more often take the form of bilateral agreements than of genuine regional agreements, bilateral agreements which deviate from the much vaunted objective of the EPAs, namely, regional integration."
"It is hard not to see in this an illustration of what members of civil society are complaining about, in the Pacific as well as in Africa, namely, the fact that a number of ACP countries have been forced to sign individual agreements because the Commission has not managed to turn the EPAs into a genuine instrument of development partnership."
"The strong pressures exerted on the ACP States by the European negotiators were criticised by the ACP countries themselves during the 92nd Session of the ACP Council of Ministers, which took place in Brussels from 8 to 12 November 2010."
"The reality of the EPAs negotiated by the European Commission is so tragic that they failed even before they came into force."
"They were such a failure that a number of ACP countries are asking the Member States of the European Union to examine the possibility of revising the negotiating mandate given to the European Commission in June 2002."
"(DE) Mr President, in conjunction with the current market situation, the reform of the EU sugar market regime will result in the EU sugar price falling below the international price."
"With this price situation, the long-term supply commitments with the sugar cane producers in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific will probably be very difficult to maintain."
"The fact that farmers in the ACP countries would prefer to sell their goods at higher prices on the world market instead of selling them cheaply in the EU may have contributed to the difficulties experienced in connection with the new ACP agreements."
"If this incentive is now being removed and, at the same time, they have to accept a most favoured nation clause, coupled with the fact that the state revenue will fall as a result of the loss of revenue from duties, it is no wonder that the ACP countries were so hesitant."
"In this regard, attention surely needs to be paid to fisheries, and not only whether Papua New Guinea and Fiji have granted other trade partners access to their fishing waters."
"Perhaps we should also investigate whether the accusations are correct that, for example, on account of the EU restrictions and catch quotas, the Spanish fishing fleet has relocated to the Pacific and is fishing there under a foreign flag."
"(ES) Mr President, I would also like to express my concern regarding the impact of this agreement on the canned tuna fishing sector, which is very important in Spain and particularly in Galicia, my constituency."
"This negative impact is, as has been said, due to an unprecedented and ill-founded concession: the exemption from the rules of origin for processed fish products, when requested, due to not having sufficient indigenous raw materials."
"That was the first thing that Papua New Guinea did, and the exemption is being applied."
"Papua New Guinea is thus becoming a major platform for the processing and export of tuna from the European industry's major competitors: the Philippines, Thailand, China and the United States."
"It is really they who are the major beneficiaries of the agreement."
"It is estimated that this tuna production will ultimately amount to 400 000 tonnes per year, destined for the European market, which currently consumes a total of around 710 000 tonnes. The impact will be very serious, as the prices of the tuna from Papua New Guinea are one third lower than the price of European tuna, due to the country's low wages and non-existent environmental standards."
"In my region, Galicia, this is considered to be unbeatable competition, which will have serious consequences for employment."
"I want the impact assessment announced by the European Commission to be as rigorous as possible and to take into account the short and medium-term consequences of this exemption from the rules of origin."
"I hope that it will put an end to the application of this exemption as soon as possible."
"It is an exceptional and temporary measure, but it appears that in Papua New Guinea, they consider it to be a permanent one: otherwise, the investments would not be made."
"I also hope that this exemption is not included in other agreements or in the final agreement."
"Currently, however, there is a problem with the provisional agreement, and it must be rectified."
"(ES) Mr President, as is being said here, the partnership agreement with Papua New Guinea and Fiji includes an exemption from the rules of origin."
"As the rapporteur said, it particularly affects tuna."
"What do we want from this agreement?"
"We want the fisheries sector to develop and poverty to be overcome in these archipelagos: in other words, we want development aid."
"However, what negative effects are there due to third countries benefiting from this preferential treatment?"
"Here, we are hearing the complaints that are being made."
"We want a balanced situation."
"The Commission has just told us that there is clear research, but the opinion being expressed here is that this is not the case."
"In 2008, it was said that there was no distortion of any kind, and we were told that there would be an impact assessment."
"We want a balanced situation."
"We want a review, consultation and checks."
"We want to know whether this agreement is aiding development in this archipelago."
"We also want to know whether health measures - which are very important for imported products - are being complied with, along with sustainable fisheries management, and combating illegal fishing, which is essential."
"Another very important element that would show us how the third countries that may be based in Papua New Guinea work is compliance with international employment rules."
"We want to maintain this agreement and help it to be fulfilled, but we also want this agreement to be used to benefit the development of Papua New Guinea and Fiji and not to damage the Spanish industry."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to draw your attention to the derogation from the rules of origin granted to Papua New Guinea concerning processed fishery products, especially canned tuna."
"I believe that the derogation is extremely dangerous."
"This ACP country benefits from preferential access to the European market; that is, from a total exemption from all customs duties on the canned tuna that it exports to our market."
"I am not questioning the development policy implemented by the agreement."
"However, the derogation from the rules of origin on canned tuna is totally unacceptable."
"This derogation allows external operators to set themselves up in Papua New Guinea, and so it benefits jobs and the local population only to a very limited extent."
"We must allow development aid, but fair and effective aid which benefits the regions concerned."
"Community imports of tuna increased from 9 200 to 16 200 tonnes between 2008 and 2009."
"They doubled in just one year."
"This phenomenon can only get worse if this derogation is maintained."
"What is more, these products do not respect the same social, health and preservation standards for resources that are imposed on European products."
"In particular, it is impossible to verify the origin of catches."
"Ladies and gentlemen, has the European Commission not taken the time to read my report on the origin of imports of fishery and aquaculture products in the European Union?"
"If not, the situation is hopeless."
"We cannot sacrifice European jobs and the quality of the products sold on the European market in this way."
"I do not want a situation which will have a destructive effect on the European processing industry to be introduced indefinitely."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as coordinator for the Committee on Fisheries, I find the fisheries aspect of this interim agreement particularly interesting."
"In this regard, there were a few controversial issues at the start with regard to the relaxation of the rules of origin for Papua New Guinea."
"I support the Commission's idea of using this relaxation to stimulate the economy of one of the poorest countries in the world."
"I am convinced that this is also something that should be of concern to those of us involved in fisheries policy."
"At the same time, I can understand the concerns of the European industry, but I cannot honestly imagine that the relaxations granted will lead to Papua New Guinea becoming a serious competitor of our canning industry."
"However, we need to be vigilant, because it will clearly not help anyone if we relocate half our canning industry to the Pacific region."
"In this regard, I have to say, however, that during the debate on this agreement, we have been presented with very contradictory information regarding the question of the extent to which investments are being made in Papua New Guinea and which states are profiting indirectly from the relaxation of the rules of origin."
"I would therefore urgently call on the Commission to closely monitor the application of this derogation and to submit a report to Parliament in a timely manner on the impact on Papua New Guinea's development and on the European canning industry."
"If this arrangement does not have the desired effect in Papua New Guinea and entails unacceptable losses for European companies, we will have to make a different decision when we come to negotiate the final agreement."
"Please keep us informed of developments."
"(ES) Mr President, I would first like to clarify that I am in favour of strengthening trade links between the European Union and Papua New Guinea that promote the development of the region, but it must be sustainable development."
"I sincerely believe that this agreement, as it currently stands, is not a good one."
"I am entirely against one clause of the agreement, which I consider to be unfair: the exemption from the rules of origin, because not only does it endanger the sustainable development of Papua New Guinea, but, as we have heard here today, it endangers a whole European industry: the canning industry."
"This concession should have been absolutely exceptional, and it should not have been applied in the case of Papua New Guinea."
"Moreover, let us not forget the serious precedent that this measure is setting, and will set, for future European Union negotiations."
"In my opinion, there needed to be a much clearer and firmer resolution in this respect, stating categorically that, at the next review of the Interim Partnership Agreement, the exemption from the rules of origin will be permanently suspended."
"I therefore want to ask the Commission to take into account the dramatic consequences that this concession is going to have, firstly, for the European canning industry, and secondly, for the sustainability of the environment and natural resources of Papua New Guinea, and the very negative precedent being set for future negotiations."
"However much the Commission has said that it will not be a precedent, the pressure will be there."
"I therefore ask the Commission to decide to put an end to the exemption from the rules of origin as soon as possible."
"Mr President, I actually came down to participate in the next debate but I have been watching this debate from my office and I am concerned, like others who have spoken in the debate here, about the idea of flexibility on rules of origin."
"In the last seven days, there was a programme on British television, part of a whole Channel Four series about the fishing industry, in which, I am afraid, the European Union's fisheries policy came in for severe criticism, and we are getting lots of e-mails from concerned citizens."
"This specific issue did not arise, but I would just like to stand up and support those colleagues who have expressed huge concern about a proposal that is supposed to be positive as a development tool but, in fact, could be quite negative, not just from a European perspective, but also for the very countries we are trying to assist."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this was an extremely interesting debate."
"There is poverty in the world."
"We need to deal with it."
"One way would be the transfer of financial resources, but it is much better to give the people the opportunity to make a decent living from the work they do."
"The three tuna processing facilities in Papua New Guinea which are authorised to export tuna to the EU employ around 5 700 people, most of whom are women."
"Jobs are at stake in Papua New Guinea, which is one of the most poverty-stricken countries."
"When it proposes derogations, the Commission takes due account of the risks involved and looks to create safeguards."
"The Commission takes the view that it is highly unlikely that Papua New Guinea's exports will cause any serious disruption to the EU's fishing and canning industry given the low volume of trade between Papua New Guinea and the EU, and Papua New Guinea's low market share in the EU tuna market of around 3% in recent years."
"Provisional application dates from 2008, and we have some experience with figures."
"It will not cause any disruption to Europe's fishing or canning industries."
"The development of trade flows will be further analysed in a study on the effect of the implementation of the special rules of origin for fishery products which will be prepared in 2011."
"In addition, the Commission will monitor trade with PNG and will not hesitate to take appropriate measures if a serious disturbance of the EU market becomes evident."
"The Interim Agreement explicitly allows for the application of such measures in its Chapter 2 on trade defence instruments."
"There is no indication at this stage of any negative impact of Papua New Guinea's exports of fishery products on the canning industry in other ACP or GSP+ countries."
"This aspect will also be looked at in the study I have just mentioned."
"I should like to add that, independently of any special rules of origin or preferential trade agreements, countries and companies exporting fish or fishery products to the EU will always have to comply with the regulation on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and with the EU's health and food safety requirements."
"I believe that the Commission has considered the matter very carefully before bringing this measure forward."
"I shall now turn to a broader issue: the EPA in general."
"Trade is far from simple."
"As I have said, the only way to eradicate poverty is to allow growth in the developing world."
"It is true that regional cooperation is rather difficult at the start."
"It is not just trade agreements that make regional development happen."
"That is why we have earmarked EUR 45 million for aid for trade in the Oceania region."
"This is three times more than was provided for under the ninth EDF."
"It is only by facilitating trade flows that you can expect regional trade to take place."
"If we look at all developing countries, basically all trade is based on monoculture - one particular export item with a high fluctuation rate."
"This has a highly disruptive effect in the countries concerned."
"When we talk about migratory flows, security, safety and justice in the world, we cannot just say that we do not care about it."
"We should care about it, and our departments have carried out an extensive study."
"We are proposing very decent measures which are completely in line with all the European Union's objectives."
"I believe that the measure is right and that the necessary safeguards are in place in case anything goes wrong."
"I believe we have judged this correctly and I therefore lend my support to this agreement."
"author. - Mr President, I will be brief."
"I find myself almost, indeed entirely, in agreement with the Commissioner on this subject."
"Firstly, to repeat, it is important that we sign the interim EPA because, if we do not, existing trade preferences for Papua New Guinea and Fiji will disappear, under the WTO ruling."
"The interim EPA is precisely that: it is an interim arrangement, and I agree with all the colleagues who say that our objective in the long run should be a full, comprehensive EPA with all the Pacific countries, encouraging regional integration in the Pacific."
"But we have to take this step at the moment to ensure the continuation of preferences for the two largest countries in the Pacific region."
"On fishing, the Commission has made it very clear that what we have here is an exception."
"This will be the only derogation."
"There are no other parts of the world to which we intend giving such a derogation."
"Why are we giving a derogation to Papua New Guinea?"
"I will tell you: it is because Papua New Guinea is literally on the other side of the world, and the likelihood of EU fishing fleets exploiting that area extensively is limited, although they are free to do so."
"There is nothing to stop EU fishing fleets fishing in Papua New Guinea waters and landing their catch and getting their catch canned in Papua New Guinea - and, as has been said earlier, that would be very good for development, and indeed we should encourage it."
"But the situation at present is that Chinese boats, Thai boats and boats of other Asian nationalities are fishing in Papua New Guinea's waters and landing their fish back in their own country, giving no opportunity for development in Papua New Guinea."
"There is a development opportunity here in terms of providing jobs, particularly for women."
"We often complain that we do not do enough in our development policy to encourage downstream activity."
"Here, we are actually doing something positive for downstream activity."
"As the Commissioner has said, in order to qualify, the fish still needs to meet all the standards under the regulation on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing."
"It has to meet all our sanitary and phytosanitary conditions."
"That is absolutely essential."
"The three factories in Papua New Guinea meet these standards at the moment and are providing useful jobs."
"If we have a sudden increase in the number of factories, and a sudden surge in imports from Papua New Guinea, then, of course, we will have to revisit the situation and potentially take action."
"At the moment, however, the statistics speak for themselves."
"This agreement has been in place since 2008."
"There has been no surge."
"There is no threat to the European tuna industry."
"I have met, as rapporteur, with the leaders of the Spanish tuna industry and they themselves have said to me that there is no current threat."
"What they are worried about is the future."
"They accept that at the moment, there is no serious threat to the EU industry."
"So let us not exaggerate the situation."
"Let us not make a poor developing country pay for our preoccupation with our own self-interest."
"I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 19 January 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Fiji and Papua New Guinea intercedes in the complicated and complex integration process in the Pacific region."
"Unfortunately, it provides almost no development support for either of the two states."
"I would like to remind you that the military coup in Fiji in 2006 was unanimously condemned by the European Parliament, the Council and also by the Commission."
"With the conclusion of this trade agreement, the dictatorship that has been in place up to now will be recognised as a contracting party of sorts."
"The efforts of our partners in Australia, New Zealand and other countries of the region to restore democracy in Fiji will be undermined by this agreement."
"When I criticised the suppression of democracy by the military in Fiji in our meeting of the Committee on International Trade, the response from its representatives was: 'But we are in control!'"
"What I regard as sheer cynicism, seems now to satisfy the demands of the Commission for the legitimacy of its fellow contracting parties."
"My group will vote against this agreement."
"I am in favour of suspending the agreement until democracy is restored in Fiji."
"International adoption in the European Union (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission, by Mrs Angelilli, on international adoption in the European Union - B7-0670/2010)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the years, many of my fellow Members and I have become aware of the problem of abandoned children, orphans and street children."
"Amongst the associations that contacted me was the Amici dell'adozione."
"There are many abandoned children, not only in the developing world, but also in Europe."
"These are children who become invisible and end up in the vicious circle of poverty and social exclusion or, worse still, are exploited by organised crime for begging, illegal work, prostitution, organ trafficking or illegal adoptions."
"Often, these children spend their youth shuttling between social workers and orphanages."
"We must guarantee these children the right to be adopted and the right to have a family."
"A child should spend as little time as possible in an institution."
"Obviously, the aim is the best interests of the child, so the ability to be adopted must certainly be granted warily, under the scrupulous supervision of the competent domestic authorities."
"However, where suitable conditions exist, children have the right to be adopted, above all at national level, but also at international level, within the European Union."
"I know that the Commission is aware of this, even if it is a matter of purely national competence."
"However, some sort of cooperation between the Commission and Member States would be desirable to ensure good practices and strategies capable of guaranteeing the utmost transparency and to prevent possible illegal and casual adoptions, but also to ensure the maximum level of cooperation from Member States in guaranteeing the right of adoption and preventing children from being abandoned to themselves or, as I said before, abandoned to an institution."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for bringing forward this important question."
"The protection and promotion of children's rights is a priority for the Commission, especially since the launch of the communication entitled 'Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child' in 2006."
"The strategy on the rights of the child focuses on the fundamental rights of children, including the protection of the best interests of the child as enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Commission is determined to ensure that all fundamental rights encompassed in the Charter are duly respected by all EU actions, both legislative and non-legislative."
"This practice will be upheld and further developed in the forthcoming communication on the rights of the child that the Commission will be publishing this year."
"As of this year, 2011, the Commission will also be reporting annually on progress made on the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We have to remember that the provisions of the Charter are addressed to the institutions and bodies of the Union, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, and to the Member States, only when they are implementing Union law."
"We therefore have to remember that, currently, no European Union legislation on international adoption exists."
"The subject is regulated by the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on protection of children and cooperation in respect of inter-country adoption, as well as by national laws."
"All the Member States are party to that Convention, but the EU is not."
"Its aim is to implement Article 21 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by establishing safeguards to ensure that inter-country adoptions take place in the best interests of the child and that the child's fundamental rights are respected."
"Internationally, the Commission supports the accession of third countries to the 1993 Hague Convention on inter-country adoption and its correct implementation by participating in relevant meetings of the contracting parties."
"The Commission does not consider specific European rules on intra-EU adoptions to be necessary, as all 27 EU Member States are parties to the Hague Convention."
"That being said, the Commission is closely following the issue of international adoption within the European Union, given the link between adoption and children's rights."
"The Commission has taken steps to see how countries are implementing the convention on adoption, and, in November 2009, provided a forum for an exchange of views on the issue."
"The Commission's Green Paper on the free circulation of public documents, published on 14 December 2010, addresses the lack of mutual recognition of adoption decisions as civil status acts between Member States and its impact on the freedom of movement of EU citizens."
"This is a specific step which addresses the question raised today."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the issue of international adoption is particularly important, and Mrs Angelilli has done well to bring it to the attention of the European Parliament in this sitting."
"We need leaner, simplified procedures."
"The current costs of adoption are particularly significant, ranging from EUR 20 000 to EUR 30 000 per adoption, and there are difficulties in providing a real response to the need for a family and for budding parents to become just that."
"We are talking about vulnerable and often abandoned children who sometimes disappear from sight."
"I am referring, in particular, to flows of illegal immigrants and the many children who, having been accommodated in immigration centres, are subjected to the disgraceful conditions of the slave trade, in which so many of them are often caught up."
"We need to promote the family."
"The Italian model, and that of other places, can be followed."
"We need to cut the costs related to international adoption, provide favourable loans from banks, introduce those leaner, simplified procedures that I mentioned, with proper supervisory mechanisms for monitoring what is going on in the Member States, ensure real prevention of trafficking in human beings, on which Parliament recently intervened with a specific dossier, take real action to combat illegal adoptions, and ensure transparency."
"What is more, if we want to restore the central role of the family - as we often say in this Chamber - we must make sure that the associations, which are very often the key vehicle of these adoptions, are characterised by particularly high standards of guarantee."
"I would conclude, Commissioner Georgieva, by saying that if there is a suggestion to be made, then it is the following: why not provide a European system of accreditation for these associations, and ensure that they work transparently, clearly and practically, but with a high level of guarantees to truly protect the inalienable and inviolable rights of children?"
"Mr President, we are talking here this evening about a very sensitive topic, since we are talking about the smallest members of society, about those who need our love and need our care."
"The problem of abandoned children is becoming more serious in Europe."
"The situation that has arisen today is, to a very large extent, due to immediate surroundings."
"Through the law on adopting children in an international context, it is possible to avoid a situation where many children are forced to live in children's homes, where, despite the enormous care they receive, they never feel the real love of a mother or a father's caress."
"It is therefore necessary to make the adoption system more effective, so that the youngest abandoned children can find a replacement family."
"It is necessary, for example, to restrict the rights of biological parents who show no genuine interest in a child for a certain period of time."
"This would shorten the period which a child spends in a children's home, as the child is not, so to speak, legally free."
"In this way, it would also be possible, to some extent, to eliminate unnecessary delays in the overall adoption process."
"Many agreements on the protection of minors provide a legal framework for the efforts of the competent authorities to act for the benefit and in the interests of these children."
"Protecting children's rights is also one of the main aims of the European Union."
"It is therefore necessary to continue taking appropriate steps to ensure, in particular, that the best interests of children are protected under all circumstances."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Angelilli for this initiative and Commissioner Georgieva for her response."
"This is an important debate."
"Very many children throughout Europe today lack a home to call their own and a family to protect them and to keep these vulnerable little children warm and safe."
"This is a dream for those children who grow up in institutions."
"All of us must now do our utmost to make sure that orphan or abandoned children do not have to grow up in children's homes and other institutions, but in families where they will receive the affection that can carry them right through to their adult lives, so that they will become healthy, rather than damaged adults."
"We have differing views in our Member States about who can form a family."
"I nevertheless believe we could all agree that, although a family may look different, what is important is that the child receives love and care."
"I hope that we will also be able to agree about the importance of cooperation on political strategies and instruments for international adoptions."
"I assume that the Commission will take the lead in this work."
"I am also looking forward to working together with my fellow Members to draw up a joint resolution on this matter."
"If we are able to help to bring together an abandoned orphan child and a family that is longing for children, we will have made a very important contribution."
"We must also remember how important it is that our smallest brothers and sisters are well treated."
"If we give them love, we will make life a little brighter on this planet."
"I believe that is something that all of us must do throughout our lives, regardless of our role in society."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, adoption is a positive way of providing a new family for children who cannot be brought up by their birth parents, or children who lose their parents."
"To adopt a child in the UK, checks and vetting procedures are robust, and prospective parents need to be accepted by an adoption agency."
"The welfare of the child is, and should be, at the heart of the adoption process."
"The issue of inter-country adoptions is more complex than national adoption, but I am very grateful to the PPE Group for bringing this issue forward."
"Whilst it is to be commended that we try and move forward in it, I have concerns that international adoption does bring risks - risks that have already been mentioned, such as child abuse and malpractice, that undermine the welfare of the child."
"That is why I believe that all Member States need to ensure that their adoption laws are regulated in a way that promotes the interests of the child."
"Member States must work together to ensure that the legal process of adoption between the providing and receiving countries is transparent, robust and holds the child's welfare as its priority."
"(BG) Mr President, Commissioner Georgieva, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give the example of Bulgaria, where the problem of abandoned children is becoming increasingly serious and urgent measures are needed to resolve the situation."
"Systems like Bulgaria's, which give a large percentage of children for international adoption are damaging."
"Having said that, the childcare systems being what they are, international adoption may be the only opportunity many of the children in children's homes have for a family and a normal life."
"When improving the overall system, we should be careful not to deprive them of that opportunity."
"We need measures which will not only make the international adoption procedure easier, but also guarantee our children's interests, and that the so-called 'adoptive parents' are not just after European citizenship, which is something that is possible at the moment."
"It should not be my job to ask whether they are doing it for altruistic reasons or for their own benefit."
"That is the job of those who conduct adoption interviews, who will have to look out for our children's interests."
"The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and its underlying philosophy must be the basis for international adoption laws within the European Union."
"(RO) Mr President, I welcome the interest shown by my Italian fellow Members in the situation of abandoned children, an interest which we all actually share."
"Nevertheless, this issue comes under national jurisdiction only."
"I asked to take part in this debate as I come from a country which is being subjected to pressure to resume international adoptions and amend the legislation currently in force."
"However, in Romania, there are more families wishing to adopt than children available for adoption."
"Our legislation, which numerous international experts were also involved in drafting, is completely in line with European legislation."
"Turning now to this resolution, I must say that the phrase 'the right of the child to be adopted internationally', as specified in point d, is not recognised by the UN and Hague conventions."
"International adoption is just one option."
"These children end up in the system due to the precarious situation in which the families they come from find themselves, which, according to international legislation and conventions, should not constitute grounds for adoption."
"This explains the large number of children in care homes."
"However, 22 966 children do have a parent."
"Romanian legislation provides for parental rights to be revoked only in the case of abuse."
"Therefore, these children are not eligible for adoption."
"This also applies to the 22 285 children in foster care."
"The rationale behind the resolution must be focused on the best interests of the child, as my fellow Members before me have also said, and not on those of the adopter."
"It is the duty of each state and not of anybody else to choose the most appropriate outcomes for its children."
"Finally, I recommend that everyone becomes more familiar with national legislations."
"I am referring by this, for example, to a number of children's courts in Italy which issued seven adoption judgments in 2009 relating to children from Romania, with complete disregard for our legislation."
"(RO) Mr President, I welcome this debate during the European Parliament plenary session, starting with the assumption that the protection of children's rights is and must be a priority for every Member State in our Union."
"The ultimate goal of everyone in this Chamber is to promote children's interests."
"It goes without saying that common, strict criteria implemented by Member States are required to improve the care and living conditions for children living in institutions and who have been abandoned and to ensure their protection when they are adopted, especially in the current climate, where budget austerity seems to be the only thought which the European Union's right-wing governments have."
"Therefore, the first step is to provide appropriate care for these children."
"The second step is to combat child trafficking and prostitution."
"The third step is for us not to forget, for the children's sake, that priority must be given to adoptions by family members and national adoptions."
"The fourth step is that only then should international adoptions be considered."
"On this matter, we can but learn the lessons from the past, as opening the gates to international adoptions in Romania led to the creation of unprecedented child trafficking networks and cases involving children being abducted and sold to the West, in cooperation with European and international organisations."
"Between 1997 and 2000, Commissioner, Romania 'exported' 9 150 children."
"My country will never accept such an abomination again."
"Finally, I would like to ask, through your good self, for Commissioner Reding to explain the allegations which have appeared in the Romanian and international media concerning the European Agency for Monitoring International Adoptions, a proposal which also seems to feature in the study commissioned by the European Commission."
"A fellow Member is still waiting for Commissioner Reding's reply to a question."
"(DE) Mr President, only recently, we held an international workshop in the large plenary chamber of our Parliamentary building in Brussels on Parental Responsibility and the Protection of Children, which I had the honour of leading."
"In Europe, there are more and more vulnerable and abandoned children who should not be living permanently in orphanages."
"It is therefore our duty as legislators to strengthen the right to international adoption within the EU in order to help these children."
"Article 24 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights also demands this when it states: 'Children shall have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their wellbeing'."
"Although we have the Hague Adoption Convention and a Council of Europe convention, these are not enough."
"In practice, major legal problems still arise in connection with international adoptions."
"In these cases, only international regulations which eliminate the differences in national regulations that still exist and replace them with clear and simple principles can help."
"In this regard, and with all our legislative zeal, we must not lose sight of the fact that the EU must cooperate with the Hague Conference on International Private Law in order to ensure a coordinated procedure."
"Thus, the EU should not reinvent the wheel in this area."
"I welcome the Commissioner's statements in this regard."
"(PL) Mr President, this is a very important subject, but also a sensitive one."
"As you know, during the previous parliamentary term, we discussed the issue of the adoption of Romanian children by parents in Israel, and this caused serious problems, including of a political nature."
"Now we have another initiative."
"It is, I think, motivated by good intentions, but, as can be seen, it is causing a lot of emotion."
"I think we need to be very careful here not to throw the baby out with the bathwater, so that in our concern for a good future life for children, we do not cause a situation in which we take a short cut and open the door to hasty adoptions and, in fact, allow children to be taken away from their parents."
"I would like to warn very strongly against this."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that the topic of inter-country adoption and of abandoned children was included in the European Parliament's agenda."
"I find it extremely important that high priority is given to child protection issues across the board, in the European Parliament as well as in the European Union."
"We must all set an example when it comes to abandoned and neglected children."
"They also have the right to grow up to become healthy adults, both in body and soul."
"To achieve this, it is imperative that these abandoned, neglected and orphaned children grow up in a family and in a healthy environment."
"We must do everything in our power to ensure that as few children as possible end up in orphanages."
"The issue of abandoned children becomes particularly relevant when we think of an ageing Europe where every child is also a keystone of our own future."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your thorough answer."
"While we know that the Hague Convention essentially governs inter-country adoption, we also know that 26 of the 27 Member States are signatories to it."
"You are also correct when you say that how this international convention is implemented is a question of subsidiarity."
"At the same time, I feel that we cannot afford to be ambiguous."
"Life forces us to concern ourselves with the issue of children not only when scandals erupt or when it is discovered that a hundred children were sold here, or several hundred or more than a thousand children were sold there."
"The other side of the coin is that we must ensure that the thousands of children we know about in the European Union can be put up for adoption."
"This topic cannot be avoided because the European Union has a responsibility to protect children's rights while, at the same time, we are also seeing that the issue of adoption and, as a matter of fact, as its direct consequence, international legislation and international practice, blow certain rights out of proportion, making the adoption of children impossible and thereby curtailing their other rights."
"Commissioner, I really would like to ask that we move forward as regards your comments in your introduction concerning the lack of an international law that could already exist in the European Union on accepting adoption documents in Member States."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question of inter-country adoption is at least as important as the issue of cross-border divorces and also deserves the same level of attention, particularly because it most often concerns children who are emotionally, financially and, in every other possible sense, at the mercy of decisions made by adults."
"These children deserve the highest degree of protection by the Community."
"The interest of those who submitted verbal questions as regards the issue of inter-country adoption was concerned primarily with the legislative environment."
"The overview of the practice is at least as important as legislation."
"A new or even a good policy decision and a new legislative environment can be created only with access to reliable data and statistics, as well as actual practice."
"Establishing whether it is even necessary to touch the legislation is possible only by relying on precise data, which is why I consider the question posed by my fellow Members to be of key significance."
"However, because, in my opinion, the range of issues must be treated in a truly comprehensive manner, I would like to move a further step back than those who asked the question."
"I would like to ask the Commission the following questions: do we have accurate statistical data on inter-country adoption cases within the EU or involving third countries?"
"Exactly what kind of data are we collecting about this topic?"
"What methods do we use?"
"Who is collecting the data, and if it is the Member States, do they use the same methodology?"
"If an inter-country adoption takes place, whether within the EU or with the involvement of a third party, what is the process for the selection and preparation of children and parents?"
"How do we supervise the preparation process?"
"Do we have common rules for this?"
"What are the differences in Member State practices?"
"Is there an age limit as regards the child or the adoptive parent?"
"Do adoptive parents receive continuous professional support?"
"Is reliable and regular follow-up available?"
"Do we know how often adoptive parents encounter problems and what these problems are?"
"What kind of support do Member States provide in problematic cases?"
"Thank you for your attention and thank you, Commissioner, for your outstanding work."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a number of years, many families in Italy and just as many Romanian children have been suffering the consequences of Romania's block on international adoptions."
"The Hague Convention is the benchmark framework to be implemented uniformly in all countries of the European Union, and Romania needs to make an effort to adjust to it."
"If Romania believes that the block on international adoptions works to protect children - for example, from the risk that a market for the illegal trafficking of children would be created - it must also deal with this problem with the help of the European Union, by toughening up controls and introducing strict regulations."
"However, we need to make an effort to ensure that many respectable families can adopt children, who deserve a second chance for a happy childhood."
"I would therefore ask the Commission how it intends to support a possible commitment from Romania to remove the moratorium on international adoptions and, furthermore, I should like to know the Commission's position on the possibility of creating a European adoption agency, including in the light of the studies carried out."
"(PL) Mr President, adoption can, and often does, work for the good of the child, but the procedures related to adoption can also give rise to abuses, such as the trafficking of children and taking children for adoption from families which have not abandoned their children at all, but which often, because of poverty, are not able to give their children the right environment."
"The high number of children in orphanages, which we are talking about in today's debate, often does not mean children who have been abandoned, but in fact represents children of poor parents who are not coping with their difficult personal situation."
"Such families should be helped."
"State authorities could help these families for far lower sums without placing the children in an orphanage at all and without then giving them up for adoption."
"We should adopt an unequivocal principle - it should be obligatory in the European Union - never take children from their families because of poverty."
"Give help, and do not take children from their families."
"Poverty must not be the reason for depriving a child of its biological family."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, we find ourselves discussing what is a terrible contradiction for the European Union, which aims to ensure full freedom of movement for its citizens and to work for their needs."
"This contradiction reveals some people's genuine need for help and the inability of others to offer the help requested."
"The paradox of the difficulties and obstacles that hinder international adoption translates into a tragedy for thousands of children and families in the European Union."
"The numerous international conventions have shown that they can only partially deal with the problems related to adoption."
"On the one hand, this is down to the specific provisions of each convention and their exclusive nature."
"However, on the other hand, the limited efforts made thus far are a result of the intergovernmental nature of the existing decision-making structures and processes."
"The Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights today form the legal benchmarks and, naturally, the political approach is changing."
"The protection and wellbeing of children is one of the cornerstones of the rights safeguarded by the Union."
"This is the basis of today's debate and the oral question submitted, which forms the backdrop for a broader discussion that should be very dear to the heart of Parliament and should be carried out swiftly and carefully by this Parliament, and followed with the tenacity that Mrs Angelilli has shown."
"Allow me to recall Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, who said: 'All grown-ups were children once - although few of them remember it'."
"(RO) Mr President, the oral question which has provided the basis for the resolution on international adoptions places an item of paramount importance on the European Parliament's agenda."
"International adoption can only be considered as an alternative after all the measures for arranging a national adoption have been exhausted."
"International adoption also raises a series of specific issues and difficulties, largely arising from the limited interaction between a child and adoptive parents in the period prior to adoption, as well as from problems encountered by the child after adoption relating to linguistic and cultural adjustment."
"The principle of acting in the best interests of the child and not the adopter, as stipulated in the UN and Hague Conventions, must form the basis of the European Parliament's resolution, with the focus on the child's development in a family environment which ensures continuity in the child's upbringing, taking into account the child's ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic background."
"The key consideration when examining the subject of adoptions and drafting the resolution is the principle of reintegrating the child from the protection system into a biological or extended family."
"I would like to highlight a confusion which is often made between the number of children who have been separated from their parents, but are in the care of the protection system, and the number of children available for adoption."
"Children separated from their parents enjoy protection from the state for a limited period of time and are not available for adoption."
"I think that we do not need control mechanisms and that the existing principles applied internationally which are linked to them are adequate."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening, we are tackling a debate that is partly the fruit of the work of many associations across the continent and the European Union that turned to us precisely in order to deal with this delicate topic, which was initiated by Mrs Angelilli, and which we have turned into this oral question."
"From a dialectical point of view, they have presented us with a very simple problem, or so it would seem."
"There are many children in institutions across Europe and there are many families that want to adopt children."
"However, these two paths do not often seem to cross and the children remain in care and the families remain childless."
"Clearly, these children are our priority."
"They have our attention and they need us to take all the precautions that the situation requires."
"However, when these children remain in care for too long, they are often targeted by traders in prostitution and organ trafficking for these new slave traders."
"All this is happening whilst, meanwhile, many families would like to open their homes to these children."
"I am therefore very happy to have heard the Commissioner outline the measures that she intends to adopt."
"However, we must also add the possibility for greater cooperation between the Member States for collaboration in international adoptions, as well as supervision in relation to the protection of adopted children, obviously."
"We therefore ask for more streamlined procedures for the families and the children, because in a few years' time, these former children and young people will have become men and women and will ask themselves why a Europe full of potential host families left them in their condition."
"(SK) Mr President, I would like to present a slightly different view on adoption."
"Children deserve the best."
"First of all, this means that they deserve a family. Either their own family or a replacement family, with a loving mother and father."
"Neither the European Union nor national borders must stand in the way of such a family."
"Although Member States have the final say in adoption issues, it is our duty to facilitate the process."
"We must not forget, however, that efforts for the good of the child come first."
"This means efforts to help the child's parents if they get into difficulties."
"The social situation of parents must not be a reason for deciding that their children should be adopted."
"It is simple to take a child away from impoverished parents, but at the same time, it is the worst thing we can do to a child."
"This applies twice over to international adoptions."
"As one of those who signed the question we put to the Commission on international adoptions, I am delighted that many Members are addressing this topic."
"I would be even more delighted if we could bring the same energy and sense of urgency to bear in attending to the good of families and their needs in all European policies."
"(ES) Mr President, international adoption that is inspired by the principles of prevalence of the interests of the child and respect for his fundamental rights is an appropriate means of finding a family for children for whom a family cannot be found in their country of origin."
"People trafficking, sexual exploitation and work slavery are a terrible reality affecting hundreds of millions of minors."
"Let us look at some of the statistics: there are more than 145 million abandoned children in the world; in Russia alone, more than 600 000 live on the streets; since 1980, more than 2 million children have died in armed conflicts; more than 600 million children live in extreme poverty; more than 5 million die every year; more than 130 million children in developed countries grow up without access to a basic education due to their poverty, and 60% of them are girls; 7 million children worldwide are subject to sexual slavery."
"For all these reasons, we must foster mechanisms to promote an international adoption instrument inspired by protecting children, harmonising the different requirements and procedures laid down in the legislation of the Member States, in particular, applying Article 21 of the European Charter of Children's Rights and taking into consideration Article 24 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I signed the oral question tabled by Mrs Angelilli because I think that the European Union cannot but make the protection of children one of its priorities, particularly in the light of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In my opinion, adoption procedures are only the litmus test of a social issue that we are duty bound to tackle and impose some boundaries upon."
"In the best cases, the children become objects of commercial exchanges that certainly offend our dignity, but unfortunately, they are often also victims of exploitation and violence."
"Beyond the phenomenon of so-called ghost children - meaning those born illegally or abandoned and never picked up by the system - there is an undetermined number of children who can be adopted and who are matched by an equal number of couples hoping to adopt, who never cross paths due to legislative interpretation and cumbersome bureaucracy."
"The United Nations Children's Fund recently published a study containing some alarming figures, including with regard to many European countries."
"As Chair of the Committee on Petitions, I have often run up against legal conflicts between Member States which result in negative or even tragic consequences for the children alone."
"The complex procedures involved in many national systems do not always turn out to be beneficial for the child."
"The long timeframes involved are at odds with the need to have the child placed within the first year of his or her life to reduce the trauma of the upheaval and to avoid long stays in orphanages, and also because we should consider that above a certain age, there is lower market demand, unfortunately."
"In the light of these figures, I believe that the green light should be given to the long-heralded need for Europe-wide coordination of national laws which, firstly, will help simplify inter-European adoption procedures and, secondly, will guarantee that the fundamental principles of adoption are observed when children are adopted from third countries."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly congratulate Mrs Angelilli on the timeliness of this oral question."
"I am one of those that consider that we need to develop more effective child protection policies to prevent situations of poverty, abuse and child abandonment, along with alternatives to their confinement in institutions, among which adoption should play a key role."
"UNICEF recognises that there has been no reduction in the number of children in institutions, and the increase in adoptions falls far short of the growth in the number of institutionalised children, a clear implication that we need to have a good, hard look at ourselves."
"It is vital that we carry out a general evaluation of the law and of administrative and legal practice regarding the existing adoption processes in the various Member States in order to identify anything that prevents them from working properly."
"Also, as regards non-EU countries, we need to monitor the problem of irregular or illegal adoption, which mainly occurs in the poorest regions."
"Take, for example, Guinea-Bissau, where more than 50% of children are not registered."
"This clearly facilitates the development of criminal activities by child trafficking networks."
"I therefore believe that a European strategy for the protection of the children's interests in the area of international adoption procedures is necessary in order to avoid and prevent abduction and the sale and trafficking of human beings."
"Mr President, in Ireland, the motto of the International Adoption Association is that families are made in many ways."
"The debate tonight reflects the interest that there is in adoption."
"There are over 1 200 members of that Association: many have adopted and some wish to adopt."
"Our attitudes to adoption have changed utterly."
"In Ireland, we come from a past where mothers - particularly single mothers - had their babies taken from them and given away to others to be adopted."
"That is not a good history, but it is certainly one that has now conditioned how we think of adoption: the child must be at the centre of it."
"Certainly, the birth families are very important in all of this."
"Equally, we have a duty and a responsibility to give the very best possible home to all our children."
"Each Member State - and that is the level on which this should operate - needs to protect children within its own borders."
"Europe should provide a coordinating role."
"I hope that in Ireland, we will have a referendum on the rights of the child."
"We talk about it a lot, but we are not so effective in actually dealing with it."
"I am hopeful that the referendum will happen."
"The situation will certainly improve then."
"This has been a really useful debate and I thank colleagues for it."
"Mr President, the greatest gift that we can give to any child is that of a happy home."
"Most children find that in their own home with their natural parents."
"Many though, get this with their adoptive parents."
"Either is preferable to an institutional life, provided, of course, that there is no corruption or exploitation involved."
"To find the balance is very difficult, but I think that we need - while taking into consideration the Hague Convention, etc. - where there are prospective adoptive parents who are bona fide and beyond reproach, to facilitate them more in giving the gift of a happy home to a child who has not otherwise got one, and not encumbering them with lengthy, expensive, drawn-out processes."
"We need to get the balance right because, as a teacher, I came across many adopted children and the vast majority were in very good homes."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Angelilli, ladies and gentlemen, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the protection and care of children has become one of the fundamental rights that Europe is legally bound to protect."
"Even so, there are still too many cases in Europe of children being abandoned who, in the best scenario, end up in orphanages."
"This is a tragic situation which our democracies cannot tolerate."
"This is why we need to make all the efforts required to prevent this situation from becoming unmanageable, adopting a strategy to raise the level of awareness and favouring the right to adopt children at international level as much as possible."
"To make this happen, we first of all need an accurate picture of the situation in all the Member States, with constant monitoring which could also be carried out by creating a permanent observatory on children's rights."
"In addition, we need a comprehensive overview of the existing measures taken by the European Union and those that could be developed to protect children in need of adoption by European citizens as much as possible."
"Mr President, the wide range of instruments which currently govern international adoptions has led to confusion over whose role it is to safeguard the rights of children subject to international adoptions."
"The Commission needs to focus further on the competent authorities, and ensure that those regulating the adopters' and the adopted children's rights are making sure that basic minimum standards are adhered to, and that, in the longer term, the child is able to maintain a link to its birth country and its culture."
"Specifically, urgent measures must be taken to react to the abuse and trafficking of children, which, as a report in my own country today shows, is alarmingly on the rise both within and across European borders."
"Child trafficking and child laundering - the stealing of children who are subsequently sold to adoptive parents as legitimate orphans - is a phenomenon which does not receive adequate attention at an international level."
"I would call on the Commission to play a more active role in the field of international adoption, to take concrete steps to improve the convoluted and confused legislative framework which currently governs international adoption in the EU, and to protect those most vulnerable young people."
"(SK) Mr President, we are talking at this moment about international adoptions because there are children in every country who, for various reasons, cannot be placed in functioning families or in replacement families in the same country."
"It is not acceptable to have a repeat of the situation we witnessed in the recent past when a more affluent country such as Italy enjoyed greater opportunities to adopt children from the less affluent Romania."
"Surely, as a number of Members have already said this evening, poverty cannot be a sufficient reason for taking a child away from the family and allowing an international adoption."
"I would like to emphasise strongly that we must take great care in this situation to uphold not only national laws but also international laws, in order to prevent the risk of abuse, trafficking and the abduction of children."
"(RO) Mr President, I, too, would like to refer to the UN Convention, which states that international adoptions can only offer an alternative means of supporting the child when the child cannot be placed in an adoptive family or cannot be cared for in a suitable manner in his or her country of origin."
"The liberalisation of international adoption entails numerous risks."
"On the one hand, it increases the possibility of child trafficking and abuse caused as a result of financial interests and difficulties in monitoring the situation after adoption takes place."
"On the other hand, separating children from their biological parents and place of origin can have adverse psychological, social and educational repercussions."
"When we discuss adoption, our main consideration must be to safeguard the child's welfare."
"Therefore, pressure must not be exerted on EU Member States with diverse traditions and legal procedures relating to adoption to liberalise international adoption."
"Mr President, I would again like to draw your attention to the practice of illegal adoption."
"There is an organised crime network in Europe - and especially in south-eastern Europe - which deals in this."
"Hundreds of children are being illegally adopted or put up for trade."
"After everything that we have succeeded in doing here in Parliament, we should not have just one small recital on this issue in the Human Trafficking Directive."
"I call on the Commission to take special measures to prevent this horrible crime, and also to punish the perpetrators."
"We could not cope, country by country, at national level, with this very vicious practice."
"It constitutes organised crime, and I therefore insist that it should be dealt with at EU level."
"(RO) Mr President, the resolution on international adoption in the EU must clearly mention the following points: families intending to resort to international adoption must obtain the opinion of the competent national institution in their country of origin, and international adoption must be carried out only under the responsibility of the competent authorities in the two Member States, that of the family and the child."
"In addition, the monitoring of children adopted via the international adoption procedure must be carried out by the national institution with the relevant powers."
"Last but not least, the competent national authorities must provide regular reports to the original Member State of the child adopted via the international adoption procedure concerning the child's progress."
"Mr President, I just wanted to add something about kinship care, and support to kinship carers."
"Most kinship carers are grandparents and find themselves being the main caregivers for their grandchildren, normally because the parent either has a drug addiction or has died through that drug addiction."
"The issue I wanted to bring to this House's attention is the good work that Mentor UK has been doing on the rights of kinship carers."
"Some kinship carers adopt their grandchildren."
"Others do not, but are in a caring relationship with that child and provide a stable and safe home for them."
"However, the rights of kinship children are often actually less than those of children who are in proper care."
"This is something which I felt people had touched upon in this debate, but I would urge you, if you are interested in the issue of kinship carers, to look at the work of Mentor UK and the help that is given to kinship carers in different countries."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first echo the sentiments of those who expressed thanks to Ms Angelilli for initiating a very rich debate this evening."
"I have five points to make in summing up the debate."
"First, the Commission fully agrees with the views that have been expressed on the importance of protecting and promoting the rights of children in inter-country adoptions."
"This is, and will remain, the main objective of the Commission as we participate in discussions on this topic, both in the context of the Hague Convention and in our work on the rights of children in Europe."
"On this issue, I would point out that in the forthcoming communication on children's rights, we will present actions to promote the rights of the child for the period between 2011 and 2014."
"These will include actions aimed at improving the support the Commission provides to Member States in the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"As I mentioned with reference to the Green Paper, we are also taking steps that will facilitate the circulation of civil status acts as adoption decisions - in other words, the mutual recognition of national adoption decisions within the EU."
"With regard to MEPs' concerns that the issue is sensitive and should be seen in the context of national needs and national legislation, the Commission would like to underline that the Romanian law on international adoptions is the sole responsibility of the Romanian Government."
"The measure that has been taken must be seen in connection with the abusive practices in inter-country adoption in Romania in the past."
"The Commission is closely following developments in Romanian legislation, but I would like to stress again that it is Romania's sole responsibility to further develop this law."
"On monitoring, it is our strong belief that the appropriate institution is the Special Commission of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Inter-Country Adoption."
"The Commission participates in that monitoring body."
"We will take many of the points that have been made this evening into account when we think about how we participate in the work of this body."
"The Commission considers accreditation to be a matter of national authority."
"It relates to family laws that Member States have and develop, and therefore it is appropriate that it should be addressed at that level."
"Finally, I will convey to Vice-President Reding the points that have been made here this evening, including the question raised by one Member in relation to which an answer is expected."
"As the godmother of an adopted boy, I have seen how emotional and difficult the issue of adoption can be, and how many factors are involved in a decision to adopt."
"I have listened to the debate this evening not only with great interest, but also with a sense that it is a matter not just of legislation, but also of hearts and minds."
"Therefore, let us pray that hearts and minds are brought into play in a way that best protects the interests of children, both our children and children in other countries."
"I have received five motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 19 January 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - The resolution being discussed is basically stating the fundamental principles of the rights of children to be adopted and safeguards for their welfare."
"It is deficient in putting forward concrete proposals to make the adoption procedures more efficient and less bureaucratic, without compromising on the safeguards."
"There are thousands of orphaned or abandoned children who live in substandard conditions."
"There are thousands of childless couples who could give a future to these children."
"It is not enough to call on EU institutions to play an active role at the Hague conference to exert pressure to improve, streamline and facilitate international adoption procedures."
"It would be more meaningful if concrete proposals are made on how to streamline and facilitate international adoption procedures."
"It may be admirable if the issue of international adoptions is seen within the wider context of adoption itself."
"National governments need to legislate so as to give a fresh impetus to the relevant laws and enable the adoption of children who have been abandoned by their parents."
"In many legislations, the assent of the biological parents is still necessary, even if these have completely abandoned their children."
"Children are among those in our society who are most in need of protection, particularly if they are orphans, vulnerable or abused children."
"In the case of international adoptions, children who are taken away from the environment that they are used to often suffer a huge amount of damage as a result."
"Therefore, the welfare of the child must always take priority."
"That is something that the United Nations also needs to take into account."
"Last year, a campaign was launched in Mexico City on subway tickets aimed at promoting the right of homosexual couples to adopt."
"According to media reports, this campaign was supported by the United Nations, even though psychologists confirm that growing up with a father AND a mother as role models is of key importance for a child's development."
"Stable family relationships are especially important in the case of adopted children who, as such, have already not had the best start in life."
"There can be difficulties in any partnership, but, for the sake of the welfare of the children, we should not make problems a foregone conclusion right from the start."
"I am very pleased that the European Parliament is looking at the question of adoption in the Union today, because this is something which is especially dear to me."
"The particular references to children in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union make it possible for us to take up this question, and they also oblige us to do so."
"International adoption can mean the chance of a normal life and a happy family for many abandoned children who, because of their age or health, have no chance of being adopted in their own country."
"In Europe today, we are facing a situation in which in countries where abortion has been accepted and is widely available, there are not many children for adoption, while in other countries, there are many such children, and apart from the youngest of them, they have no chance of finding a family of their own."
"Furthermore, there is a growing number of couples who find it difficult to have their own children or who are affected by fertility problems which cannot be treated."
"So I am very enthusiastic about the work of the European Commission in this area."
"The Member States should come to an agreement on the question of simplifying procedures so that they will not be too complicated or protracted."
"We must not, however, forget to put in place systems for protection and monitoring, in order to prevent child trafficking."
"One-minute speeches (Rule 150)"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(CS) Mr President, it is now 19 months since Canada suddenly and unilaterally introduced visa requirements for citizens of the Czech Republic, which, as a Member of the EU, is not allowed to introduce a reciprocal visa requirement for all Canadians."
"President Barroso immediately stated that it was a Union and not a bilateral issue, but Commissioner Malmström is unfortunately not addressing it as a priority, but only passively monitoring the bilateral negotiations."
"In response to my intervention, the Council said that the Union is not discussing reciprocity, as it has not yet received any proposals from the Commissioner."
"Czech citizens are thus de facto second class citizens of the EU as far as their rights are concerned, and it is surprising that Canadians continue to travel to the Czech Republic without visas."
"I would like to point out that the tardiness of the Commission also increases the risk that the Czech Republic will delay ratification of agreements between the Union and Canada."
"It has no other option for defending the rights of its citizens, since the EU is failing to put pressure on Canada."
"I would therefore like to demand, together with you, that the Commissioner deals with Canada without delay, and also stands up for Romania and Bulgaria."
"Are a common visa policy and the principle of solidarity no longer European values?"
"Is the Commissioner aware of what is at stake today?"
"(RO) Mr President, the taking of psychotropic and psychoactive substances, which generally lies in a legislative grey area, is having much more harmful effects than the drugs which are currently known."
"These substances are frequently encountered in Europe in dream stores and are known as 'ethnobotanicals', a term invented to make drug dealing and taking seem harmless."
"Countries like Poland, Israel, Sweden, Denmark, England and Germany have already banned a considerable number of substances identified as psychotropic and psychoactive."
"The substances available on the market, although not included in the list of banned substances, are very difficult to control, making it impossible for medical staff to provide assistance as the chemical combinations used have unknown reactions."
"The only measure that we can take is to ban these stores from operating, after which we need to focus our efforts on halting the online sale of these substances."
"(EL) Mr President, the continuing crisis in the euro area has brought all of us - European institutions, Member States and political leaders - face to face with our responsibilities."
"We must take the initiative away from the markets; we must provide an integrated and convincing response to the crisis by supplementing - not replacing or overlooking - the responsibilities that the Member States have assumed to honour their obligations."
"Within this context, high-profile Europeans, political parties, the public in their demonstrations and European trade unions are arguing that Eurobonds can play a key role in overcoming the debt crisis and safeguarding the stability of the euro."
"I should therefore like to point out that the Council needs to respond immediately to the demand formulated by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 December 2010 and send a clear signal to the European Commission, so that it can study the matter in detail and submit specific proposals."
"Mr President, I rise to make a statement about the plight of hundreds of thousands of airline passengers in Europe in the 10 days before Christmas and the chaos in the arrangements for transporting them and their baggage to their intended destinations."
"The failure of our airlines and our airports to deal with a few centimetres of snow in a few Member States caused devastating delay, disruption and despair for travellers."
"I call on Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism, the Union's Transport Commissioner and transport ministers in the Council to conduct an inquiry into the disruption, to make provisions to prevent its recurrence, to ensure that those affected are properly compensated, and to study a sharing of the burden of compensation in future between the airline companies and others involved, such as airport operators."
"Unusual snowfalls and uncommonly low temperatures, as predicted in 2009 by the Potsdam Institute, arise from the melting of the Arctic ice cap."
"They will become more frequent."
"We cannot prevent them, however much we must try to limit them, but we can - and we must - be prepared for them."
"(PL) Mr President, the special commission investigating the cause of the crash of a Polish aircraft near the Russian town of Smolensk on 10 April last year has published the conclusions of its report in Moscow."
"In the disaster, the President of Poland was killed, along with 96 other passengers, including many of the most important people in the country."
"The report is absolutely scandalous."
"It contains numerous lies, and clearly shifts responsibility for the disaster onto the Polish side, completely ignoring the serious errors made on the Russian side, such as the improper way in which the flight controllers in the Smolensk control tower guided the aircraft during its descent."
"In the report, the Russian side has not taken account of a great many of Poland's comments - 20 pages of comments have simply been ignored."
"This is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs, and the European Union should look into it."
"(PT) Mr President, 2010, which was declared the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, is over."
"It was a year in which the European Union, with unprecedented cynicism and hypocrisy, implemented policies and guidelines that resulted in the significant increase in poverty and social exclusion that we can see today."
"The state budget for 2011 in Portugal, drawn up and approved under enormous pressure and applause from the European Union, will lead the country into economic recession and a complete regression on the social level, with a rise in unemployment to record levels and widespread poverty and social exclusion."
"Added to all that are the unacceptable levels of pressure and blackmail to which the country has been subjected over the past few weeks and to which we strongly object here: the increasingly bullying tones of financial capitalism and the institutions in its service to force the country and its people to submit to and accept injustice and plundering, to accept the draining of the country's resources into the pockets of the financial capitalists."
"One thing is certain: we can expect a year of much fighting if they continue on this path."
"Mr President, with regard to Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, I was informed that, on Christmas Day, a massive abuse of religious freedom took place in the Church of St. Synesios in the occupied town of Rizokarpaso."
"The so-called authorities, supported by Turkey, had stopped the Saturday service on the pretext that no application had been made to hold the mass that day, although according to the Church of Cyprus, such permission was requested at the beginning of December, as has been the case for the last 36 years."
"Mr President, I strongly encourage you to take the appropriate steps to guarantee religious freedom on the soil of a European Union Member State."
"Mr President, on Christmas Day, the Turkish Security forces in Rizokarpaso, in the occupied part of Cyprus, interrupted by force the Christmas mass being celebrated by the few remaining - elderly - Christians there, evicted the priests from the church and ordered the congregation to leave."
"The excuse was that they had been given written permission for Sunday mass, but that Christmas was on a Saturday."
"Demanding written permission for mass is a restriction of the freedom of religion in itself, let alone to interrupt a Christmas Day mass on the grounds of a petty bureaucratic excuse - all this in a Member State of the Union, by ordinance of a country aspiring to join it."
"Under the Vienna Agreement, 12 000 Greek Cypriots enclaved in the Karpass Peninsula were allowed to live there after the Turkish invasion."
"Today there are 300."
"Now you understand why."
"(SV) Mr President, I believe it would be extremely worthwhile for the EU to start an inter-faith dialogue from the highest level."
"I would like to see the EU attempt to get Turkey to host such a dialogue."
"We all know how Christians are treated throughout the world - in various different places in the Middle East, the Copts in Egypt, Christian Iraqis in Iraq and so on."
"It is my firm view that we cannot simply report on this and hear about it and watch it happening; we must do something tangible."
"The first thing we need to do as far as I can see is to establish a dialogue."
"It would be very worthwhile if Turkey, with the bridge-building spirit that I believe exists there, in spite of everything, was able to host this type of dialogue."
"This is about Jews, Christians and Muslims."
"Let us establish a broad inter-faith dialogue under the auspices of the EU."
"(FR) Mr President, in Iraq and in Egypt, the Christians say that they are truly suffering."
"Soon, ladies and gentlemen, there will no longer be any Christians on the lands that gave birth to Christianity."
"As was said a few moments ago, in Turkey, a secular Muslim country and a country which is knocking at our door, 20% of the population were Christian 100 years ago; today, the figure is less than 1%."
"The movement which we are witnessing is, in fact, a groundswell."
"The Arab and Muslim world is persecuting its Christians, condemning them, preventing them from converting, punishing them and killing them."
"We are clearly seeing Islam becoming a state religion."
"The result is there for everyone to see - Christianity is the most persecuted religion in the world."
"Yet, ladies and gentlemen, defending Christians in the Middle East increases the chances of counterbalancing the rise of Islamic extremism."
"The presence of Christians everywhere is a balancing factor."
"Therefore, we really must defend it."
"I genuinely wonder, ladies and gentlemen, where the human rights defenders have gone who are happy, as we are, that the West is secular and pluralist, and who shamefully avert their gaze before a Middle East that, little by little, is being reserved for a single religion."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian Government decided, at the close of 2010, to stop subsidising the institute for young children established in Budapest by Emmi Pikler."
"This Hungarian scientist created the centre to develop scientifically-based teaching methods for very young children."
"The effectiveness of these methods for the psychomotor development of children has been internationally recognised."
"Institutions for young children based on this model have proliferated across Europe, including in my own city in Belgium."
"It is a shame that, at the end of the European Year for Combating Poverty - in particular, child poverty - Hungary is sending out this kind of signal."
"This decision is surprising given the international influence of the Pikler Institute and the fact that the Hungarian administrative authorities have said that they want it to keep going."
"I therefore wonder, although I am not biased in any way, about the motives behind this decision by the Hungarian Government."
"Mr President, I would like to express concerns over the agreement between the EU and Morocco."
"The future of the agriculture sectors in the Euro-Mediterranean countries will be seriously affected if this agreement remains as it is now."
"We have to open our borders and reach an agreement with the European agricultural sectors, and not one behind their backs."
"The Commission has carried out studies that clearly show that the Euro-Mediterranean countries will be the most negatively affected by the EU-Morocco Agreement."
"I would not ratify this agreement without the inclusion of some clauses concerning the labour market, the social dimension and the environment in Morocco."
"If we do nothing, it is our farming activity and food chain industry that will risk losing out, especially in the Euro-Mediterranean countries."
"These are the concerns I wanted to share with you tonight."
"(FR) Mr President, like several of our fellow Members, I wanted to address the issue of the persecution of Christians throughout the world, particularly Christians in the Middle East."
"I do not need to remind you about the horrible acts that have been perpetrated recently."
"I would like to say again quite solemnly that defending Christians in the Middle East and across the world, and calling for religious freedom and diversity of beliefs, means calling for freedom, democracy and human rights, which are values at the heart of the European project, and which are also, of course, universal values - or at least, all of us here believe so."
"It is really time now to move beyond indignation, emotion and solemn condemnations; to move from words to action."
"I therefore urge the European Union authorities - the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, but also all our leaders and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs - to take specific measures and introduce a specific and concrete action plan to make respect for religious diversity and the fight against all forms of religious persecution a priority."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, until last May, a coalition of socialists and liberals had been in power in Hungary for eight years."
"Throughout those eight years, democracy continued to grow weaker, human rights violations became endemic, and the freedom of the press was increasingly curtailed."
"Neither the European socialists nor the European liberals had anything to say about this."
"Last May a sweeping majority of Hungarian citizens voted against this social-liberal government and, in a landslide election unprecedented in Europe, voted into power a Fidesz-Social Democrat government."
"At the end of last year, this government adopted a new media law that guarantees freedom of the press."
"These are the circumstances under which Hungary and the Hungarian Government currently holding the EU Presidency are being fiercely attacked."
"This double standard cannot be reconciled with European values and we must speak out against it."
"(SK) Mr President, three years ago, the Schengen area expanded to include new member countries."
"Restrictive measures are still in place, however, on the borders between old and new Member States."
"For example, on the border crossing of Rusovce - Kittsee, which is a highway crossing between Slovakia and Austria, the Austrians are imposing a tough speed limit of 30 km/h. At the same time, the crossing is still narrowed dramatically by a concrete barrier."
"It is by no means exceptional for regular speed checks to be imposed on passing vehicles at this border, as well as frequent police checks on documents and vehicle luggage."
"Schengen membership surely means the free movement of people and goods."
"A person should notice that he is crossing an EU Member State border only from a standard information board."
"The previously mentioned behaviour, which does not only apply to Austria, is a violation of the Schengen rules, and the European Commission should mount a principled response to it."
"(PL) Mr President, previous speakers have talked about discrimination against Christians."
"I, too, would like to talk about a certain form of deprecation of some countries in Europe."
"Over the past couple of weeks, at the outset of the Hungarian Presidency, a great many critical words have been said about the Hungarians, and very often these words have been unfounded and unjustified."
"Unfortunately, besides the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, other words, which were also very unfair and which were, I think, offensive to the Hungarians, have come from the mouths of politicians of this House, including from Mr Schulz."
"I think this is a symptom of a certain belief that the Member States of the European Union are divided into categories of 'better' and 'worse'."
"The better ones are those which have been here for a long time now, and the worse ones are those which have only been here since 2004."
"I think that this kind of discrimination should end, and that everyone needs to get used to the fact that the new Member States are full members of the European Union - this is necessary particularly in this Chamber."
"Therefore, I would ask that those people in this Chamber who permit themselves to indulge in this type of discrimination should be disciplined and punished."
"(HU) Mr President, along with many others, I also welcome Hungary's EU Presidency."
"It fills me with pride that this Central European Member State is the third amongst the 2004 accession states to have the opportunity to carry out this honourable and responsible mission."
"There is no doubt that Hungary has always been on the frontline in the fight for democracy."
"Who would ever question 1956, 1989 or the autumn of 2006?"
"This is why I am extremely shocked by the negative campaign launched by certain political forces against the current EU President, including under the pretence of the Hungarian media law."
"It is completely obvious that this is not a question of legislation but of an attack by political losers."
"They are the ones who are attempting to corrode the unified European spirit."
"As for the map of Hungary depicted on the cultural history carpet, I would just like to say that those who cannot face history cannot see clearly the future either."
"Just as the people of France, Germany or Poland can speak about their nations' past, so can those of Hungary."
"I consider it an irresponsible and dangerous act to discredit our presiding country, particularly at a time when the need for the closest collaboration is greater than ever."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Greece is the main gateway for illegal immigrants into the whole of Europe."
"According to Frontex, 90% of illegal immigrants who come to Europe enter via Greece."
"Greece therefore faces a massive crisis as far as this issue is concerned."
"The Greek Government recently announced its intention to build a fence along our land border with Turkey."
"One asks oneself if such a solution suffices as a strategy to help to resolve the problem."
"Of course, it does not."
"However many fences we put up, whatever efforts we make, we need a global strategy and solidarity between the European states."
"If we are to get off on the right foot, the first thing we need to do is to establish solid cooperation on these issues with Turkey, as the basic country of origin."
"We are still waiting for an EU-Turkey agreement to be signed."
"As we all know, it takes eighteen months to two years to achieve and then apply an agreement; until then, therefore, let us apply the bilateral agreement which has existed with Greece since 2002, as other countries in the south have done to resolve the problem."
"Mr President, next week, all across the world, people will be celebrating the life of Scotland's national poet, Robert Burns."
"As many of you know, a central part of a Burns supper is a haggis."
"Currently, there is a ban in the USA on importing Scottish haggis, yet one in three Americans claim Scottish ancestry and would like to try some authentic Scottish haggis."
"What action can the Commission and the Council take in their transatlantic dialogues to put Scottish haggis back, not just on the agenda, but also on the menu when it comes to American traditional Scottish Burns suppers?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 13 and 14 January, a referendum was held at the Fiat plant at Mirafiori in which both blue- and white-collar workers were asked to vote for or against the recovery plan for the plant in Turin."
"The plan is based on a new collective agreement that undermines workers' fundamental rights relating to illness and strike action, and even the midday break during eight hours' work on an assembly line."
"The referendum is illegitimate because the chief executive officer, Mr Marchionne, has threatened workers that if the agreement is rejected, the business is likely to abandon manufacturing in Italy and move elsewhere."
"This strategy of fear, of unbridled capitalism without consideration for rules or rights, was supported by the government and even by much of the Democratic Party, an opposition party that has its roots in the Italian Communist Party."
"The only unions to oppose the agreement were the Italian Federation of Metalworkers (FIOM) and the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL), and they were ousted from the union representation."
"In any case, the referendum passed with just 54% of the votes."
"As a result of this agreement, workers' rights in Italy have slipped back several decades."
"Europe should know this and bear it in mind."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to raise the question of the worrying situation in Mediterranean partner countries and the impact that this situation may have on our relations and on security and prosperity in the region."
"This afternoon, we debated the serious reversals in Tunisia."
"There is social unrest in countries in the Maghreb and Mashreq, with renewed political instability in Lebanon and the continuing stalemate in the peace process."
"We must pay serious heed to this situation, because the Mediterranean countries are partner countries, not just neighbouring countries."
"May I remind you that, since 1995, Tunisia has received direct aid of over EUR 1 billion, in addition to soft loans from the European Investment Bank, and that we have programmed large sums in direct aid up to 2013."
"I should like to make a suggestion."
"We need a serious multilateral debate, in order to take stock of our relations and consider the prospects and the procedures we need to follow, and I call on the High Representative to present an integrated neighbourhood plan, within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean, so that these crises can be addressed together with the partner countries."
"Mr President, in December, Commission President Barroso told me by letter that his meeting with President Nazarbayev last October would help advance respect for human rights in Kazakhstan."
"The same was said about granting Kazakhstan the chair of the OSCE in 2010 and holding a major OSCE summit in Astana in December."
"However, world leaders had scarcely left that summit when it was announced that a referendum was to be held in March to cancel the presidential election in 2012, thus keeping Nazarbayev in power until 2020."
"Harassment of the opposition press and of human rights defenders is being stepped up."
"Activists from the left-wing movement 'Kazakhstan 2012' are being harassed and jailed."
"I demand that the EU stop boosting the Nazarbayev dictatorship."
"The independent trade union and social movements in Kazakhstan must be fully supported so that they can lead mobilisation to end this dictatorship - just as people power in Tunisia ended the Ben Ali dictatorship - and put in place structures to bring the wealth of Kazakhstan into the democratic ownership of the majority."
"(HU) (the speaker's microphone was switched off and the beginning of the sentence is inaudible) ... extraordinary meeting of the Commission."
"The topic could not have been anything other than the Hungarian media law."
"I could not believe my ears when influential socialist and liberal fellow Members demanded that the EU launch so-called serious infringement proceedings - the most severe of available sanctions - against Hungary, the holder of the current EU Presidency."
"Neither this, nor any other type of sanction, had been imposed between 2002 and 2010 when the socialist and liberal regime in Hungary violently broke up every single protest, summarily imprisoned hundreds of people, fired bullets into people's eyes and caused severe injuries."
"If, after all this, the European Union launches infringement proceedings against the current Hungarian Government and state, it will finally open the eyes of those who have ever had any illusions concerning the European Union's attitude towards Hungary, and I believe that the Hungarian nation will demand our secession from the European Union, and there will be some who will follow our example."
"Mr President, I also want to raise the issue of respect for religious freedom for all, without discrimination, because this is a basic human right."
"That human right was violated in my country for the few Christians attending Christmas mass at the church of Agios Synesios in the occupied village of Rizokarpaso."
"The so-called police of the Turkish occupying regime entered the church and forced the priest to terminate the Christmas Day service and then forced the enclaved Greek Cypriots attending the mass to evacuate the church."
"The European Parliament must strongly condemn such actions, which reveal the ugly and oppressive face of the Turkish occupation of the northern part of Cyprus, in violation of European law and human rights and the Third Vienna agreement of 1975."
"The EU must stop Turkey and its subordinate local administration in the occupied part of Cyprus from committing further violations, and from continuing the ethnic cleansing of the remaining 300 Christian Greek Cypriots."
"Mr President, the Food Supplements Directive was adopted in 2002 but, almost nine years later, it has still not been fully implemented."
"The Commission has yet to produce a proposal to harmonise the maximum amounts of vitamins and minerals that can be included in food supplements as required by the directive."
"This failure means that companies have to produce multiple product formulations to comply with different national laws."
"This is unfair and expensive, especially as a scientific model for setting maximum amounts is available."
"The Commission itself cited this in a paper in 2006."
"It begs the question of why the proposal has not been produced?"
"Perhaps, to paraphrase Robbie Burns, whom somebody mentioned a minute ago, 'The best laid plans of mice and men and the Commission gang aft agley'."
"It needs to happen very soon, because EU legislation is intended to make it easier for companies to compete in the internal market by standardising requirements."
"The sooner it happens, the better."
"I urge the Commission to get a move on."
"(BG) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Bulgarian public has recently witnessed a series of publications about the use of special surveillance equipment to eavesdrop on people in high government positions."
"Who divulged this information, where it came from, and whether it is true remains unknown, and nobody has taken responsibility for publicising it."
"The government's clearly stated desire for reform and the fight against organised crime, its unwillingness to be influenced by the former State Security Service, and the fact that this year, Bulgaria will be holding presidential and local elections, were the trigger for this campaign, which created tension and sowed mistrust in those in power."
"The only circles who have an interest in this state of affairs are those who nurtured and benefited from the blurred distinctions between criminality and the state."
"They are now seeking to avenge their hurt interests."
"I would like to assure you that Bulgaria is governed by the rule of law, that methods of this kind are only used by the authorities within the scope of the law, and that the governing coalition will proceed along its road to reform and not allow illegitimate interests to undermine the fight against crime."
"(BG) Mr President, in recent months, there has been growing concern in Bulgaria in the escalation of the use of special surveillance methods."
"However, there is another aspect to this problem: eavesdropping is becoming an obsession among some politicians and the upper ranks of the current special services."
"There has been no improvement in the effectiveness of the fight against crime."
"The burgeoning paranoia about the use of such eavesdropping is even more unacceptable."
"Who the instigators of this bacchanalia are is not clear: whether they are figures from the security sector or their former colleagues, or underground structures whose aim is to destabilise the situation."
"The contents of recorded conversations mysteriously circulate in the media."
"The Bulgarian Prime Minister also figured in one of the recorded conversations."
"The contents were discrediting, but he claims it was manipulated."
"Beyond these unpleasant facts, and the feeling among Bulgarians is that their institutions are not working properly and that human rights are being brutally undermined."
"For these reasons, Bulgaria, as a recent member of the European Union, needs help to restructure its special services."
"This item is closed."
"European Consensus on humanitarian aid (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Striffler, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the implementation of the European consensus on humanitarian aid: the mid-term review of its Action Plan and the way forward."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the global humanitarian context has got worse; the humanitarian challenges and needs are immense, and there are now countless areas in which intervention is required."
"The European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid is a fundamental instrument which is as relevant as ever in this massively changing humanitarian context."
"By strictly applying the Consensus and its associated action plan, we can respond to humanitarian challenges."
"However, the humanitarian partners apart, too many people are still unaware of the Consensus."
"We should therefore make an effort to increase its visibility and to raise its profile among the Member States and the actors involved."
"We must ask for this Consensus to be distributed, understood and applied within the European External Action Service and by military personnel."
"In 2009, the Working Party on Humanitarian Aid and Food Aid was established within the Council."
"It has become an important forum, but its role should be strengthened in terms of coordination between Member States and the monitoring of the implementation of the Consensus, and in terms of advocating humanitarian aid in relation to the other working parties of the Political and Security Committee."
"The mid-term review of the action plan is a unique opportunity to strengthen action in areas deserving more attention, such as, firstly, the promotion of humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law, because humanitarian aid is not a crisis management instrument, and we should deplore the increasing politicisation of humanitarian aid and its consequences in terms of respect for the 'humanitarian space'."
"A second area concerns the issues of quality, coordination and consistency in the delivery of EU humanitarian aid, and a third aspect is the clarification of the use of military and civil protection capabilities in conformity with the Humanitarian Consensus and United Nations guidelines."
"A very clear distinction needs to be maintained between the remits of military and humanitarian bodies, and a dialogue between military and humanitarian bodies is necessary in order to encourage mutual understanding."
"Moreover, in my report, I invite the European Commission to present some very ambitious legislative proposals for the creation of a European protection force, and I am pleased at the recent communication by the Commission on strengthening the European Union's disaster response capabilities."
"Finally, we must strengthen the 'disaster risk reduction' dimension and the link between emergency aid, reconstruction and development."
"The Treaty of Lisbon established the European External Action Service."
"We have therefore endeavoured, in the course of negotiations, to defend the independence of DG ECHO and to prevent any attempts to use humanitarian aid for foreign policy purposes."
"Strict and transparent rules on cooperation and coordination between the European External Action Service and the Commission in the management of large-scale crises must be introduced."
"To finish, I would like to draw your attention to the proliferation of sexual violence - I am thinking in particular of the East of the Republic of the Congo, of the Kivu region - and to the importance of systematically integrating gender and reproductive health into the emergency healthcare aspect of the humanitarian response."
"(FR) Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Striffler on her report."
"However, it fails to mention actors whose involvement is based on religion, particularly Christianity."
"The text of the European Consensus does mention the Red Cross, but it ignores other actors that have the same status in international law but which are based on Christianity, such as, for example, the Order of Malta."
"This report thus provides new evidence of the disregard with which the European institutions greet the involvement of Christian actors in humanitarian intervention."
"Religions have not just the obligation, but also the competence necessary to intervene rapidly in crisis and natural disaster situations."
"I invite the rapporteur to table an oral amendment to recognise the usefulness and effectiveness of actors who base their work on the Christian faith."
"(SK) Mr President, the European Union and its Member States are major global donors of humanitarian aid."
"This is our moral obligation."
"The European consensus on humanitarian aid has become a significant milestone, a fact which is confirmed by the analysis of the action plan on the implementation of humanitarian aid."
"The report also points out specific weak points in the system, however, and other obstacles preventing the effective and rapid movement of humanitarian goods and services for the most vulnerable people in crisis areas."
"I hope that the Treaty of Lisbon, which brings a whole series of innovations in the area of EU humanitarian aid, and which is now a separate policy area, will be appropriately and promptly used to achieve tangible results in accordance with respect for human dignity, human values and adherence to human rights, as established in international law, including, for example, rapid assistance in disasters."
"(CS) Mr President, the ever increasing number and scale of humanitarian disasters in third countries, which, apart from anything else, is also a result of climate change, requires increases both in the quantity and the quality of humanitarian aid."
"I therefore fully support the measures mentioned in the report, including the transformation of the civil defence of the Member States, so that it, too, can provide effective, coordinated EU aid."
"I also consider it an urgent matter, of course, to improve the safety of humanitarian workers."
"In my opinion, the Commission should also assign resources for disseminating information, especially in Haiti, so that the inhabitants affected can understand the causes and resulting circumstances of their disaster, and help protect the safety of humanitarian workers, instead of the opposite being the case."
"Otherwise, it will be necessary - and not in the least undesirable - to employ the protection of the armed forces."
"Mr President, I should briefly like to ask some questions."
"Regarding the European Union, I know that we are wonderful for donating aid to where it is needed, but it often goes through NGOs."
"Are there any NGOs that have not been up to scratch, or that have been the subject of complaints in the countries in which they operate, or that the European Union itself might have reservations about?"
"In other words, do we just give the aid and the supplements - let us put it that way - to the NGOs annually?"
"Where is the accountability?"
"In the light of some programmes I have seen recently, I was rather concerned about allegations being made as to what some of the NGOs were doing and their lack of accountability."
"Having said that, I know that the vast majority are doing good work and are properly motivated."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the fact that we are able to discuss this problem here in this House today."
"I have two further comments or questions that always concern me when it comes to humanitarian aid."
"Firstly, it is clearly indisputable and important that we should provide assistance if people are in need, but - as the previous speaker has already said - we must always ask the question: will these funds actually be used properly and appropriately?"
"Secondly, there is something else that we must not ignore. It is right to provide humanitarian aid for people in need."
"This could be a result of a natural disaster, but it is increasingly also a result of disasters that have been caused by people themselves. This includes, in particular, political or armed conflicts."
"We need to bear in mind that, although humanitarian aid provides emergency relief, at the same time, we must also eliminate the causes, namely, the political acts of violence."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I very much welcome Mrs Striffler's report, as well as Parliament's involvement in and continued strong advocacy for effective European humanitarian action."
"The consensus was adopted in 2007."
"It provides an essential common policy framework for the EU - a common vision accompanied by an action plan."
"Both the Member States and the Commission have a shared responsibility to make sure that the consensus is well implemented."
"I want to stress that what comes very clearly out of the report is the message that humanitarian principles, international humanitarian law and protection of the humanitarian space have to be at the centre of our action on the consensus."
"Four-fifths of our humanitarian aid goes to people in need in conflict-related, man-made emergencies."
"For us to be able to reach these people, it is critical that our aid is independent and neutral and that it is perceived in this way."
"I would like to give you one example of this."
"I have just come back from Yemen where, together with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Gutierrez, we engaged on the humanitarian access issue with high-level government officials and representatives of the al-Houthi rebel movement."
"For the first time, we obtained a commitment on their part to facilitate humanitarian access and respect delivery of aid to all Yemeni people in need, in line with the humanitarian principles of neutrality and independence."
"Having spent a number of hours with men with Kalashnikovs, I would like to observe that we in Europe do bring this value of neutrality that is a bridge to people in need."
"In the Yemeni case, there are 300 000 internally displaced people and many more hundred thousands affected by six wars in six years in the north of Yemen."
"Of course, for a long-lasting impact, humanitarian aid is not the right instrument."
"It is development that can lay the foundation for lasting peace."
"We in the Commission have completed a year-long review process of the European consensus action plan, in close liaison with our Member State and humanitarian partners."
"On 8 December, the Commission adopted a Communication on this."
"The review shows that over the past three years, we have made significant contributions to strengthening the humanitarian response in terms of advocacy and humanitarian action, as well as by bringing humanitarian aid and civil protection together."
"We also concluded that there is scope for further improvement in three areas."
"Firstly, we need to promote the quality and effectiveness of aid by good assessment, a well-coordinated response and investment in disaster risk reduction and local capacity."
"At a time when needs are growing and budgets are constrained, this is critical."
"Let me just respond here to the question of accountability."
"Obviously, we need to stretch every euro to the full and deliver it with the highest possible quality and in the most effective way."
"In order to ensure that our partners - UN agencies and NGOs - are accountable, we review one-third of all partners and one-third of all projects every year."
"We have our own humanitarian aid offices in all the hotspot areas of the planet to be the ears and the eyes of our taxpayers, including in Yemen, because of increasing humanitarian needs."
"I recently cut the ribbon of our humanitarian aid office there."
"The second issue concerning which we can see room for improvement is the strengthening of the European voice."
"We are the largest donor and have to make sure that we speak very clearly with one voice."
"We must also reach out to other donors so that we play our leadership role, vis-à-vis traditional donors, but also by engaging new donors."
"Thirdly, we need to ensure coherence which means working, together with the External Action Service, with military actors to make sure that a principled humanitarian approach is safeguarded and is also promoted in Europe."
"Let me finish by once again thanking Mrs Striffler for her work on this issue and calling upon Parliament to continue the discussion on this topic."
"The world has changed."
"Unfortunately, there will be more and more natural and man-made disasters."
"Whatever action we take will determine not only the lives of the people affected, but also the moral standing and the capacity of the EU to lead in the world."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 18 January 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Humanitarian aid is an expression of universal human solidarity and is our moral obligation."
"Today, we are seeing a systematic growth in the need for humanitarian aid because of the growing number of natural disasters being brought to our attention."
"This is due in part to climate change, but is also due to the development of technology which enables us to realise that a catastrophe has occurred and to communicate the fact of its occurrence."
"Important criteria for the provision of humanitarian aid should be speed, responsibility and administrative costs which are as low as possible."
"The development of transport is a factor which facilitates the delivery of aid. This means that we can reach the victims faster and give aid to a greater number of people."
"This is why getting businesses involved is so important."
"I am thinking of corporations and concerns, but also of small enterprises, and not only those operating in the field of transport and logistics."
"We need to build networks of entities which work together in a particular geographical area, in order to be effective in delivering aid and to improve the system of rapid reaction to impending crises."
"On the basis of inter-sectoral partnerships between businesses, organisations and institutions, it would be possible to set up bases, special units and offices with funds, storage space, volunteers, food, essential materials and equipment and means of transport."
"Cooperation of this kind can bring measurable benefits in the face of human tragedy, particularly when it is necessary to react quickly and not to first have to start by collecting money."
"Agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Sârbu, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security."
"Mr President, it is an honour for me to present my report to you, which deals with the strategic importance of agriculture in ensuring the European Union's food security."
"Agriculture is a neglected topic in the discussions about the European Union's strategy and future."
"This report will show that Europe has not achieved food security, that farmers and whole rural areas are in danger of disappearing, and that new challenges, such as climate change, are likely to destabilise already dwindling food stocks, not only in Europe, but also worldwide."
"Against a background where food production needs to increase by a minimum of 70% by 2050 in order to meet the world population's food demands, food security must be the topic at the heart of the debates conducted at both global and European level."
"The European Union must respond robustly to these challenges and this report is our attempt to propose today a number of specific courses of action."
"First of all, we need a strong common agricultural policy aimed at guaranteeing food security for as many EU citizens as possible and also at helping ensure global food security in the context of limited resources and the impact from climate change."
"We cannot talk about food security if we do not tackle two crucial issues, specifically: market and price volatility and dwindling global food stocks."
"On the subject of price volatility, I have called on the Commission, as part of the new CAP, to enhance the role of market intervention instruments and adopt more consistent measures for restricting speculation on agricultural markets."
"Global food stocks are much more restricted nowadays than in the past."
"According to estimates, they can cover the world's food requirements for just a month and a half."
"This is why I thought that the creation of a global food stock system would be beneficial, comprising both emergency stocks to reduce hunger and stocks to be used to regulate prices on agricultural markets, which comes under the international aegis and is supported by the expertise of existing institutions such as the UN or FAO."
"I believe that the European Union must initiate this action, which is why I have asked the Commission to take on this role."
"Another important issue touched on in this report is the situation of young farmers."
"If we are reflecting on the future of European agriculture, we must focus more attention on young farmers."
"Just 7% of farmers across Europe are under the age of 35. This is why I have asked the Commission for measures to be provided to encourage them."
"On the other hand, I have stressed the need to preserve European agriculture's diversity."
"In this regard, I mentioned that traditional agricultural practices, family farming, small-scale farms and organic farming can make a valuable contribution to food security."
"I also called for the development of EU-level programmes to support these forms of agriculture."
"However, we must not forget that poverty and hunger persist in the European Union and that millions of Europeans have requested food aid from the EU this winter."
"Consequently, in the current economic crisis, it is of paramount importance to use EU funding to maintain the EU's 'Food Aid for the Most Deprived Persons' programme."
"Finally, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and my other colleagues from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their good cooperation and the contributions they made to the drafting of this report, as well as the Secretariat of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I hope that tomorrow, we will adopt together a report which meets European citizens' expectations."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Sârbu, our rapporteur, for the excellent work she has done on this report and for her cooperation with all the shadows."
"This follows work which I carried out in the previous mandate on the role of the common agricultural policy and global food security."
"I regret that we are debating this report just before midnight."
"Perhaps it will be at a minute to midnight that Europe and the world wake up to the realities of how insecure we are when it comes to food production."
"This report is extremely welcome in our overall debate on this issue and in the context of our debate on reform of the common agricultural policy."
"I had some concerns, but I think they are reflected in the final text."
"The idea that one form of production system is better than another - that organic, small, local is better - is not a good argument."
"We need all production systems to contribute to our food security."
"We do need to address market volatility and speculation and I do not think we have all the answers yet."
"The single key problem with agriculture is low incomes for farmers."
"Young farmers will not work for nothing, and we have to address the low income problem if we want security of food supply."
"(SK) Mr President, due to constant population growth, we are obliged to adopt a more intensive approach to the issue of food security, and access to an adequate, healthy and nutritious diet."
"In order to ensure food security, it is essential to increase transparency and fairness in the actual food chain, so that we can secure a fair return for farmers, with profits and price controls, and a viable agricultural sector."
"In my opinion, it is extremely important to apply a resolute policy on rural development, by means of which we can maintain the viability of rural Europe and boost the competitiveness of agriculture, support innovation and, ultimately, employment as well."
"Agriculture is enormously important, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and it is therefore necessary to adopt stimulus measures to support agriculture in rural areas, attract more young people into agriculture, and help to reduce regional differences and secure sustainable development."
"(PT) Mr President, I would like to offer my sincerest congratulations to my colleague, Mrs Sârbu, on the excellent job done on the report."
"I strongly recommend that the Commission take it into consideration, particularly in those aspects in which the complex dimension of agricultural issues - which extend well beyond the narrow boundaries of agriculture itself - requires the involvement of other areas, such as competition on the internal market and financial regulation, and merits attention on stages outside the EU, such as the G20 or the World Trade Organisation (WTO)."
"The crucial determining issues for agriculture, for farmers, and for supplying sufficient good quality food to the people of Europe and the rest of the world, can only be tackled in reality if they are considered from all angles."
"The ambitious objectives of common agricultural policy reform can only be achieved if the reforms extend beyond the narrow boundaries of agriculture and if the objectives are also taken into account in the action required in other policy areas and in other global bodies."
"This report makes this patently clear and I take my hat off to it for doing so."
"(PL) Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mrs Sârbu for an excellent report, which I consider to be one of the most important in this parliamentary term."
"There are increasing numbers of people in the world, while the amount of arable land available is falling."
"Food is becoming, to an ever greater degree, a strategic product."
"While crude oil can be replaced by solar or nuclear energy, there is nothing which can replace the food our planet produces."
"In the European Union, we sometimes behave as if we were continually struggling with the problem of overproduction of food."
"The entire agricultural policy of the European Union in recent years has been based on ways of limiting and reducing agricultural production."
"We can already see on the horizon, today, that the time is coming when there will be a shortage of food."
"It is very good that this signal, in the form of the Sârbu report, has come from Parliament, saying that the situation has changed and that the European Union's agricultural policy has to change, too."
"We must respect agriculture - it is the guarantee of our food security."
"(DE) Mr President, it is the case in politics as it is in daily life: we do not fully appreciate what we have."
"Thus, it also clearly seems to be the case that we in the European Union have an excess of food, and there is, of course, always plenty to buy."
"If we compensate for animal feed exports, we have in the European Union a self-sufficiency rate of 88%."
"That means that, in the European Union, we, too, must endeavour to ensure that we maintain this self-sufficiency rate in terms of agricultural products and foodstuffs."
"I am therefore very grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Sârbu, for bringing this problem into the spotlight once again."
"In the European Union, we also need a common agricultural policy that can supply our citizens with sufficient food."
"In view of the increasing global population, the effects of climate change and increasing energy prices, it is clear that farmers in Europe will not be able to manage this alone in future."
"For this, we also need strategic coordination on a global scale."
"(HU) Mr President, security of food supply in the EU will be one of the most serious challenges facing security policy in the coming decades."
"Herein lies the key asset of the Sârbu Report, which highlights the fact that in one or two decades, food and fresh water will be strategic products just as oil and natural gas are today."
"The timing of the report is particularly fortuitous because discussions are currently under way about the future of the common agricultural policy, the post-2014 budget is being planned, and many are keen on curtailing the budget of the common agricultural policy."
"It is very important that this common agricultural policy has adequate resources in the future, and to guarantee that it does, the finance ministers and decision makers must be convinced that the agricultural economy in the European Union produces not only food but also public goods, including public environmental goods, which we would not be able to guarantee or produce without agriculture."
"(HU) Mr President, speaking of the food security issue, I am bothered by the fact that the report is treating EU countries as a single integrated unit."
"The situation in new Member States is entirely different from that in older ones."
"For instance, let me ask one question with regard to Hungary: how is it possible that we are talking about childhood starvation in a country with exceptional agricultural resources?"
"Children and adults alike are starving in the centre of the European Union."
"My other question: how is it possible that our agriculture has taken such a dysfunctional turn that we are producing raw agricultural products on vast areas on an industrial scale, primarily in some - forgive me for the expression - colonial way, only to have them processed abroad, where the profits are made, and then returned to Hungary, where they are sold at high prices?"
"Something is fundamentally wrong here."
"(GA) Mr President, like other speakers I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Sârbu, for her good work on this subject."
"In four minutes, Mrs Sârbu covered a multitude of issues."
"I am not going to go over all the things she mentioned, but I would like to reiterate two points."
"First, there is a need for a well-funded CAP."
"I hope this Parliament will play a key role in ensuring that the CAP is not demeaned or diminished in any way."
"Second, we need to ensure that young people are encouraged to go into farming as a livelihood."
"Furthermore, we have a policy of encouraging the growth of energy crops on good agricultural land."
"In view of the fact that we may be facing a food shortage worldwide, with a population increasing at a rate of 80 million per year, should we reassess that policy?"
"Are we robbing Peter to pay Paul, or perhaps robbing Paul and Peter and finishing up with nothing?"
"That is the question I would like to ask."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear from the report that things in agriculture cannot continue as they are, either."
"We, or rather, large enterprises, cannot continue to transport agricultural products from one end of the world to another."
"Of course, we can carry on without any compelling logic. apples, peppers, tomatoes and meat products are transported into Europe, including into Hungary - but mostly not from Spain or from the Netherlands, but from China and from Brazil."
"We could certainly continue on this path, but the products must be loaded onto transportation equipment such as ships, on which they travel for weeks or months."
"These products must be kept fresh with various preservatives that are toxic when consumed in large quantities."
"Now, people buy these products in large commercial chains and then wonder where all these diseases, cancers and tumours come from."
"It is, of course, obvious that they are caused by food colourings and artificial additives."
"I must add that instead of supporting multinational corporations, we must support smallholders so that they can be Europe's lifesavers in a developing food crisis."
"(PT) Mr President, the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security that this report speaks of is inseparable from the recognition and promotion of the concept of food sovereignty."
"The greater the food dependency and food insecurity of a country, the more difficult it is to guarantee a sufficient supply of food to its population, in terms of both quantity and quality."
"Food sovereignty is the best insurance against food product price volatility, an issue that has dramatically re-emerged on the order of business."
"This volatility has its origins fundamentally in the financial speculation carried out on food products, an area on which the speculators, investment funds, hedge funds, pension funds and large banking institutions have focused so much of their attention that the other speculative bubbles have either dried up or burst."
"The only way to stop this speculation is to do away with the instruments that make it viable, namely, certain financial products such as over-the-counter derivatives."
"Sadly, the measures that the European Union has adopted in this area are far from being capable of putting the brakes on this sinister wave of speculation and its inhumane consequences - as is acknowledged in a recent United Nations report authored by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food."
"Mr President, we are discussing the poorest of the poor - the European Roma - and, together with the new Hungarian Presidency, we are all addressing the European Roma strategy."
"Among inter-sectoral issues that concern the poorest of the poor, agriculture is very rarely addressed, notably because no land is owned by the poorest of the poor in Europe."
"So we are talking not just about food security but about having food on the table."
"As one of my colleagues has already said, this is an essential question for the EU today."
"I believe that the agricultural sector - and the Commission's work on these documents - has to be in line with all the EU micro-regional development projects which are concerned with fighting poverty and securing food on the table for future generations."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission very much welcomes this timely report, as food prices are rising sharply, mainly due to erratic weather conditions and natural disasters, but also to increases in energy prices that impact on the cost of food."
"Therefore, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Sârbu, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their efforts."
"Food security is fundamental for the almost one billion people around the world that still suffer from hunger, but it is also important for vulnerable populations across Europe."
"For them, the common agricultural policy makes a real difference."
"The - sometimes criticised - CAP has managed to provide EU citizens with food at affordable prices and has ensured food security in Europe."
"This must continue."
"Food security is identified as a central issue in the communication on the common agricultural policy towards 2020 that was adopted on 18 November by the Commission."
"The report that Mrs Sârbu has put in front of us underlines the issue of excessive price volatility, which is closely linked to food security because of the impact it has both on farmers and on consumers."
"The Commission fully agrees that there is a need to tackle excessive price volatility."
"We must collectively look for better regulation, supervision and transparency to address market issues, and this requires not only better financial regulations but also substantially improved transparency on the market."
"The report recommends the creation of a global food system."
"Not an easy subject."
"We have had experiences in the past of commodity boards."
"They have proved not to be successful and therefore, this topic undoubtedly requires more detailed debate."
"It also requires analysis of the experience we have gained, for example, from the EUR 1 billion Food Facility adopted by the Commission in 2008, and also from the work that the Commission undertakes closely with the FAO and the World Food Programme to ensure that bumper stocks are pre-positioned in order to soften the blow of rising food prices."
"All these efforts can be developed when the G20 looks closely into the food stocks issue, and you can be assured that the European Commission will be an active participant in the related deliberations in the coming weeks."
"The report has made a call, echoed by many of you here this evening, for a strong agricultural and rural development policy in Europe, capable of ensuring food security for all, with the support of research and innovation to face the challenges of producing more with the fewer resources we have and will have."
"The Commission fully agrees with this."
"There is no more relevant instrument to fulfil these objectives than a strong common agricultural policy able to guarantee the economic and environmental competitiveness of agriculture and - as some of you said - able to bring young people into the agricultural sector of Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 18 January 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Food security is a political priority at both European and world level."
"The globalisation of the food chain means that new challenges - and sometimes risks to health and consumer interests - are constantly emerging."
"One of the main challenges that the European Union will have to face up to is developing agricultural and food reforms in order to satisfy the needs of the global population."
"According to recent figures, the world's population is steadily increasing, and it is thought that it will increase by around 40% by 2050, creating an increase in demand for food which is expected to double current requirements."
"To tackle the rising growth in world demand for agricultural products and foodstuffs, the Member States and the Union will need to ensure the security of food supply."
"To attain this objective, the EU will have to guarantee the security of food products bearing in mind their specific characteristics and, at the same time, ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market."
"Lastly, I should like to ask the Commission to look at all possible measures to improve training for young people at work and to create job opportunities for graduates in the field of food security, with the principal objective of contributing to employment in the agriculture sector."
"It is quite right to emphasise the importance of food security for the inhabitants of the EU, as it is their basic human right."
"The EU must therefore strive to ensure that healthy and nutritious foods are financially and physically accessible to all EU citizens, enabling them to lead an active and healthy life."
"We must strictly monitor compliance with the highest standards for food and agricultural production, for the safety and quality of foods, and also for their environmental sustainability."
"Nevertheless, in these circumstances, it is also necessary to point out the strict need for similar quality and safety standards in relation to foods imported from third countries, in order to protect the competitiveness of European farmers."
"I would also like to support the measures, which will motivate farmers to improve energy efficiency, as energy costs are a key factor in the profitability of farming activities."
"In my opinion, the most important aspect of the whole report is the emphatic appeal to the Commission to secure, in the public interest and in cooperation with Member States, public access to information on the results of food security monitoring, particularly through the rapid communication of this information between Member States."
"We simply cannot allow another failure like the selling of meat containing traces of dioxin, as is now happening in Germany, when other Member States were given insufficient and late information as to the situation that arose."
"in writing. - As we begin to consider what the final make-up will be of the CAP post-2013, the themes of food security, food shortages and sustainability are coming ever more to the fore."
"This is something that almost everyone in this House, and everyone who will be involved in drawing up the bill, will recognise."
"The biofuel boom several years ago, coupled with the global food crisis in 2009, has shown us how scarce a resource food is beginning to become."
"As such, our vision must be narrowed: the sustainability of food and the needs of those who do not have automatic access to food must be put first; farming practices and innovations should be geared towards more food, and the correct crops; and, as we draft the new CAP bill, we should finally ensure that the new CAP will work towards a carbon-free Europe, and one which does not exacerbate the current carbon problem."
"We consider security of food supply to be one of the basic human rights."
"In today's world, there are 900 million people suffering from constant hunger due to poverty."
"The world's population is set to exceed 9 billion by 2050, and global food production will have to increase by up to 70%."
"Agriculture must, on the one hand, boost output, and, on the other, cope with high energy costs, an ever diminishing area of non-polluted land and the consequences of climate change."
"We must address the instability and fluctuating prices caused by speculation on the commodity markets and declining food stocks."
"The future security of supply of basic foods requires a strong common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"The CAP must improve food security by boosting productivity and supporting both environmentally sustainable food production and traditional agriculture, small farmers, organic farms, and the local and regional distribution of foods."
"These agricultural models contribute to food security, as they employ methods and procedures proven for generations in individual regions of the EU."
"Agriculture is the most strategic EU policy, the success of which will help to ensure the survival of Europe's population in a time of food crisis."
"In order for the CAP to be capable of combating the effects of climate change, maintaining food prices at an acceptable level and increasing the supply of healthy foods, it is essential for its budget to be preserved at least at the existing level."
"in writing. - (LV) European agriculture is one of the Union's strategically most important sectors, as it provides more than 500 million people with their food supply."
"So that European agricultural policy may carry out its most important task, namely, to provide Europe's population with healthy and good quality food at reasonable prices, while ensuring an adequate income for farmers, it must be competitive in the global market and there must be a guarantee of fair competition in Europe's internal market."
"Hence, what we must achieve with CAP reform is a level playing field for all Europe's farmers."
"EU Member States have not encountered food security problems."
"Nevertheless, such risks will exist in the future, and we have to react accordingly, before that occurs."
"We must take into account that farmers are already having to work for minimal incomes or even at a loss, and this has an adverse effect on their ability to maintain production."
"It is also a fact that natural disasters affect food prices in the shops and hence, how available food is to people."
"We must acknowledge the strategic importance of agriculture in the European Union and do all we can to ensure that in the future, the people of Europe will not have to experience food shortages as a result of the failure of EU politicians and governments to have spotted the risks in time and to avert them."
"The recognition of agriculture as a strategically important sector for food security is an important step towards avoiding food security issues in the future."
"The own-initiative report recognises the fact that agriculture is of strategic importance in the context of global food security."
"A glance into the future shows how urgent the need for action is."
"By 2050, experts estimate that global demand for food will double."
"Agriculture must be in a position to be able to meet the enormous needs of the growing population for safe and adequate food."
"At the same time, the obstacles resulting from the limitation of natural resources, high energy prices and climate change need to be dealt with."
"I supported the report, which clearly demonstrates that food security is a central concern in the European Union, too, and requires coordination of the individual policy areas."
"Only if the areas of agricultural policy, development policy, trade policy, financial policy and energy policy, as well as research, work together can improvements be achieved."
"Securing the incomes of farmers and an adequate supply of good quality food must therefore be key goals of the common agricultural policy."
"The greatly fluctuating market prices in the agricultural sector are the result of crop failures, speculation and a concentration in trade, and these are significant uncertainty factors."
"Interventions and stockpiling are the crisis mechanisms that will put a stop to market abuse and speculative transactions."
"It is important that these market intervention mechanisms play a central role in the future common agricultural policy."
"Another important point is the recommendation for the development of a global system of food stocks and emergency reserves."
"Europe needs a common agricultural policy which will guarantee the development, and not the stagnation, of European agriculture."
"Agricultural policy must respond to European and global challenges, particularly when we take into account the fact that, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, food production has to increase by at least 70% to meet the needs of a world population which, by 2050, is set to exceed 9 billion."
"It can be seen, then, that the common agricultural policy needs to increase food security by increasing efficiency, while at the same time promoting an environmentally sustainable food policy."
"I would like to point out that regulations in this area should be transparent."
"I appreciate initiatives which recommend the promotion of agricultural diversity and the use of traditional and ecological agriculture."
"In addition, it is important to ensure that young farmers have access to land and loans in order to achieve the objectives of the CAP, such as innovation, modernisation, improving competitiveness and, above all, modern agriculture."
"The link between the European common agricultural policy (CAP) and global food security is an important theme that must be taken into account during the process of drafting the CAP post-2013."
"Indeed, the priorities of the CAP must be viewed against the backdrop not only of the aspirations of our modern-day society, but also of the constraints that will be imposed on us throughout the world in the future."
"According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, food production must increase by at least 70% if it is to meet the growing needs of the world's population."
"Europe must take account of world food security and must increase its production with a view to limiting imports."
"In addition, I support the proposal to review our financial legislation in order to combat price volatility, which is caused mainly by speculation."
"To be effective, however, this review must be carried out simultaneously at international level."
"I am delighted that one of the priorities of the French Presidency of the G20 in this area is to combat food and commodity price volatility."
"The increase in global demand for food, resulting from the planet's growing population, obviously has an impact on natural food resources and entails new food security regulations and precautions."
"The EU's priority task is to guarantee Member States the right to food security and to support developing countries in achieving a sufficient food security level."
"I think that it is important to promote the production and sale of local traditional foods."
"Numerous benefits can be derived from regional food products: lower transport costs and a lower risk of food perishing."
"There are many regions with significant agricultural potential which has remained untapped due to social or economic imbalances, against the background of an increasingly ageing rural population or of industrialisation."
"Indeed, large areas of farmland are not used efficiently."
"Regional authorities can play a key role in food security by supporting the agricultural capacity of the regions which have this potential."
"The EU is one of the global leaders in the field of research and innovation, including in the agricultural sector."
"A steady rise in the urban population's majority poses a new challenge: how much of a priority is the development of urban agriculture with a view to guaranteeing food security, using various models such as vertical urban agriculture?"
"I support the approach suggested by the resolution adopted today in this Chamber: food safety is a basic human right and it is achieved when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to suitable, safe and nutritious food."
"In the European Union, around 80 million people still live below the poverty line today, and many of them are helped through food aid programmes."
"A proper diet is necessarily a key factor in our health, and there are still too many doubts being raised about genetically modified organisms by part of the scientific community."
"For this reason, I am against the text's openness to GMOs, particularly the part that provides for extending the approval process for importing genetically modified foods from third countries into the European Union."
"For the sake of consistency, I do not believe that we can forbid our farmers from using a technique that we then tolerate in the production of imports."
"However, I do support the measures to encourage young farmers, who currently represent just 7% of the total, with installation premiums, subsidised interest rates on loans and other incentives which have been implemented by Member States through their rural development budgets, safe in the knowledge that European agricultural production can maintain its current high levels of quality and safety."
"I welcome the report on recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security."
"However, I also wish to express my dismay that Parliament decided to allocate so little time to debating it."
"This topic is particularly current at the present moment when we have realised how the food crisis can affect states' stability."
"One of the causes of the uprising in Tunisia has been the increase in food prices."
"Algeria, India and Bangladesh are also states where rising food prices have caused serious tensions."
"The increasing cultivation of biofuel crops, financial speculation, producers switching very rapidly to more profitable crops and, last but not least, the change in the eating habits of citizens in many states, are also new topics closely related to the subject of today's report."
"I wish to make one final comment."
"In an index produced by a Japanese bank indicating vulnerability to food price rises, four of the forty most vulnerable countries are Member States of the European Union, with another state soon to become an EU member, and three states are the EU's immediate neighbours."
"This is an interesting index which must give us food for thought."
"If we regard agriculture as a strategic area, then an essential precondition for ensuring the security of food supplies is for the European Union to be self-sufficient, at least in the production of basic foods and animal fodders."
"EU dependence on imports of agricultural products causes food price rises, and undermines the EU's direct producers in the marketing chain."
"According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), demand for food and animal fodder could rise by 70% by 2050."
"It will therefore be necessary to use all available forms of agriculture, and to provide significant support for financial investment into scientific research in this area."
"The efficient use of traditional agricultural varieties that are characteristic to certain regions also requires greater support and public interest."
"For example, assessment of the environmental impact of food production and transport distances is easily understood by the consumer."
"Current wastage levels of up to 50% in the overall production chain, and the disproportionate growth in freight transport, are not factors compatible with ensuring the security of food supply."
"We cannot pretend to ensure food security and protect the environment while at the same time tolerating a dependence on products grown on another continent and imported over thousands of kilometres."
"Such practices create an enormous environmental footprint and, at the same time, oblige developing countries to import almost all necessary foods, making them dependent, ruining their economies, impoverishing their inhabitants and destroying their environment."
"Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"Opening of the sitting"
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (announcement of motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"EC-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement - Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EC and Serbia (debate)"
"The first item on the agenda is the joint debate on the EC-Serbia Agreement"
"EC-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"Recommendation by Jelko Kacin, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Recommendation on the draft Council and Commission decision on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part [15619/1/2007 - C7-0341/2010 - 2007/0255(NLE)]"
"Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EC and Serbia."
"Council and Commission statements"
"Madam President, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Serbia was signed in April 2008, and the transitional, interim trade agreement with Serbia has been successfully implemented since February 2010."
"The ratification process began in September 2008 when the Serbian Parliament first ratified this agreement."
"The agreement provides a political, legal and economic framework for cooperation between the European Union and Serbia, and Serbia was unable to continue along the path of European integration without the ratification process getting under way."
"In 2009, there were no reports of Serbia on the European Parliament's agenda because the ratification process in the Member States stalled following Serbia's failure to cooperate fully with the Hague-based International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)."
"To date, eleven Member States have ratified this agreement, which is why, today, I call on the remaining Member States to do the same as soon as possible."
"If, today, we ratify the agreement in this higher assembly, we will be sending a strong and visible message of support for Serbia's European efforts."
"That alone, however, will not ensure a successful completion of the ratification process."
"The resolution on Serbia, on which we will be voting tomorrow, carries precisely this message of support."
"We need to support Serbia along its long and difficult path to membership of the European Union."
"As a country which has long been isolated and which has remained outside the modern tide of European politics and economy, Serbia is facing many challenges."
"In the past two years, we have witnessed the political scene in Serbia becoming more pro-European."
"Serbian leaders will provide us with the best evidence of their sincere commitment to European values and way of life if they successfully resolve problems and implement all the reforms that are necessary."
"We have already seen some positive developments."
"We have sincerely welcomed Serbia's willingness to compromise and the adoption by the UN General Assembly of a joint resolution on Kosovo in September 2010."
"On 1 January 2011, Serbia abolished compulsory military service, and generations of young Serbian citizens have been given an additional opportunity to learn, study and develop."
"Civilian supervision of the armed forces has also been strengthened."
"On the other hand, Serbia's advancement towards the EU has very much been hampered by the fact that two individuals indicted for war crimes by the ICTY remain at large."
"Ratko Mladić has been on the run for more than 15 years since the genocide in Srebrenica, that greatest of crimes perpetrated on European soil since World War II."
"We welcome the statement of the Serbian Government that they consider the finalisation of their cooperation with the Hague Tribunal to be a priority."
"However, we call on the Serbian authorities, as the main ICTY prosecutor has said, to reduce convincingly the gap between the political will they have shown and concrete results."
"The time has come for Serbia to close this painful chapter and to make a new step towards reconciliation in the region."
"Serbia will not be able to secure candidate status until it demonstrates that it is fully cooperating with the Hague Tribunal, as stated in the Council conclusions of 25 October 2010."
"The most compelling evidence of this would be the arrests and extradition of those who have been indicted."
"Serbia's efforts to date to bring this about have not produced results and they remain inadequate."
"Significant shifts in regional relations in the Western Balkans, evidenced most of all by the relationship between Serbia and Croatia, have been achieved."
"We welcome the stance of the Serbian President, whose new approach has given a powerful impetus to a lasting reconciliation in the region."
"Despite that, there are still further challenges."
"Belgrade must demonstrate a constructive relationship in the upcoming dialogue with Priština and, regardless of the issue of Kosovo's status, the relationship between Belgrade and Priština must become a partnership, so that the whole region is more easily able to progress towards Europe."
"This also holds true for Serbia's relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Belgrade needs to support the reforms that will enable Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a country with its own institutions, to negotiate on its membership of the European Union."
"At the moment, that is still not the case."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, it is a great privilege and honour for me to return to the European Parliament in my new capacity as the representative of the Hungarian rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union."
"I hope, honourable Members, that you will consider me a former Member of this House, and as a guarantee that the Hungarian Presidency will be a Parliament-friendly Presidency."
"I look forward to working with you all during the forthcoming five-and-a-half months of this Presidency, with great expectations. I shall now use my mother tongue."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and honour for me to take part in this debate after which Parliament will vote on the approval of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement signed with the Republic of Serbia."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the rapporteur of the European Parliament, Mr Jelko Kacin, who drafted an excellent report on the subject, and to warmly welcome the resolution on Serbia's European integration process."
"Similarly to other countries in the region, the prospect of European membership has benefited Serbia as well, and the country has made considerable progress in this direction over recent years."
"In this context, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is an important step forward for Serbia on the road to the European Union."
"The agreement strengthens the already close ties between the European Union and Serbia, and creates a contractual relationship between the two parties."
"The agreement establishes a new framework for political dialogue."
"It creates a free trade area and strengthens bilateral economic relations, through which it is intended to bring major economic benefits to Serbia."
"The agreement encourages the reform processes which will contribute to the growth of the Serbian economy and help Serbia develop a fully functioning market economy."
"Furthermore, the agreement lays the foundations for increased cooperation in numerous areas to evolve between the European Union and Serbia in the future, last but not least, in the fight against organised crime and illegal cross-border trade, as well as with regard to improving current environmental protection regulations."
"The Council started the ratification process for the agreement on 14 June 2010."
"To date, eleven Member States, including, of course, Hungary, have endorsed the agreement through their parliaments."
"We are very confident that all the Member States will ratify it within a short period of time."
"The Council would welcome the Stabilisation and Association Agreement coming into force by the end of 2011, but by early 2012 at the latest."
"This would mean that Serbia would enter into an ambitious contractual relationship with the European Union at precisely the time when it starts making more intensive preparations for accession."
"Your votes will do even more to give prominence to and further this process, due to the unanimous support that was expressed by all political forces at the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on 1 December."
"Serbia expressed its commitment to the European Union by its request for accession submitted in December 2009."
"In October last year, the Council asked the Commission to submit its opinion. This can be expected in the second half of 2011."
"We are all aware that the European integration process has numerous advantages for Serbia."
"At the same time, Serbia still needs to make major reforms. These include further endeavours in the fields of public administration and the rule of law, justice reform, the fight against corruption and organised crime, and cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"As the report submitted by Mr Kacin also states, the integration process advances on the basis of the progress made in this area."
"I welcome the fact that many results have already been achieved."
"At the same time, I should like to take this opportunity to point out that last year, Serbia took historic steps towards peace with its neighbours in the region."
"I also welcome Serbia's close cooperation with the European Union in the summer of 2010 and the resultant UN resolution that opened the way to dialogue between Belgrade and Priština."
"The Council fully supports High Representative Ashton in the work she has done in this area."
"This is a major challenge, but the possibility of creating a dialogue offers both Kosovo and Serbia the chance of coming closer to the European Union."
"Lastly, allow me to share a concluding thought with you."
"I am convinced that the European Union must maintain the credibility of the enlargement process."
"The means of doing this are in our hands."
"I believe that if the accession negotiations with Croatia can be concluded successfully during the Hungarian Presidency, this will give a very positive sign to Serbia as well that the process is alive, and that the Balkan countries have a place in the family of the nations of the European Union."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 2011 will be an important year for Serbia, which will bring both challenges and opportunities."
"I welcome the opportunity which this new agreement gives Serbia so that we may build together a joint future in a peaceful Europe."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, it is a great pleasure and honour for me to address the European Parliament today for the vote of consent to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Republic of Serbia."
"I would also like to express my warm gratitude to the rapporteur for Serbia, Jelko Kacin, for his report on the European integration process of Serbia."
"The Stabilisation and Association Agreement is a major step forward for Serbia on its path towards the European Union."
"The fundamental objective of this agreement is to pave the way for further European integration and reforms and to prepare Serbia for European Union membership."
"This important milestone will serve as an encouragement for Serbia, as it has renewed its efforts to promote reconciliation in the region."
"The Stabilisation and Association Agreement sets up a comprehensive institutional framework through the SAA Council and SAA Committee, a renewed framework for political dialogue, and a network of subcommittees extensively covering most European Union policy areas."
"Naturally, it also establishes a specific body between this House and the Serbian Parliament, the Joint Parliamentary Committee."
"From an economic standpoint, the SAA foresees the gradual establishment of a free trade zone and the gradual integration of Serbia into the European Union's internal market, thus bringing economic benefits for both the European Union and Serbia."
"As was the case in central Europe in the 1990s, the agreement will boost investment, in particular, for indirect investments."
"It will make a key contribution to the growth of the Serbian economy and help Serbia move towards a functioning market economy."
"The benefits of this agreement for the European Union are equally significant."
"Serbia's market has now been opened up to European Union exporters."
"Previously relatively high tariffs will be totally dismantled within a couple of years, with the exception of a few very sensitive agricultural products."
"Furthermore, by gradually integrating Serbia into the internal market, conditions for investors will become more stable and predictable."
"Rules on competition and State aid are aligned to those of the European Union."
"Protection of intellectual property rights is also gradually being brought up to European Union standards."
"The sizeable Serbian public procurement market is also being progressively opened up to European bidders."
"Forging closer ties with Serbia entails a number of other advantages for the European Union in particular, as it will facilitate cooperation in the areas of justice, freedom and security, the environment, transport and customs, to mention just a few. It therefore helps make the European Union's policy in south-east Europe more credible and effective."
"Finally, it is particularly noteworthy that Serbia brought forward the implementation of the interim agreement."
"It officially entered into force in February 2010, but Serbia decided to apply it shortly after it was signed in April 2008."
"Serbia has thereby demonstrated a commitment to its economic integration with the European Union and has so far established a positive track record."
"Since 14 June 2010, when the Council decided to launch the ratification process for the agreement, nine Member States have notified ratification and two more have secured the approval of their parliaments."
"Today's vote by the European Parliament should therefore provide additional impetus for this process thanks to the unanimous support from across the political groups."
"I hope that ratification by the other Member States will follow soon."
"Let me conclude by focusing on the motion for a resolution on the European integration process of Serbia as a well-prepared contribution to today's political debate."
"I am therefore grateful to the rapporteur, Jelko Kacin."
"The resolution sends Serbia both a message of support for enhancing EU-Serbia relations, and a message of expectation in relation to the key challenges on Serbia's path to European Union membership."
"This is particularly timely in the context of the preparations of the opinion on Serbia's membership application."
"I was in Belgrade last November to hand over a detailed questionnaire to the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister for European integration."
"The Serbian authorities are currently working hard on their replies, which we expect by the end of the month."
"I am encouraged by the Serbian Government's adoption on 30 December of an action plan as a follow-up to the Commission's progress report."
"The Commission will thoroughly analyse the replies to the questionnaires and the steps taken by the Serbian authorities in the coming months to complete its assessment with a view to issuing the opinion in the second half of 2011."
"As my Hungarian colleague said, 2011 is an important year for Serbia: a year of demanding challenges as well as a year of opportunities."
"The path has been set and the objectives are well known, yet it is up to Serbia to walk down that path, fulfil the required criteria, and, once ready, engage in the negotiation process with the European Union."
"I am convinced that, with our joint support, Serbia will continue to make the right European choices and move ahead in its integration efforts."
"This will deliver a positive message for the whole region at a time when we need to reaffirm its European perspective in order to consolidate peace and foster economic prosperity in the Western Balkans."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, in my view, the report on Serbia is excellent."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Jelko Kacin."
"It seems to me that Serbia has finally made up its mind that it genuinely wants a European future for itself."
"The majority of the political elite believes that this is the most favourable option."
"This determination has to be seen in the light of the turbulence of the last two decades."
"Serbia experienced the end of communism, the collapse of Yugoslavia, the wars that ensued, the rule of Slobodan Milošević, the bombing of 1999, burgeoning mafias and criminality, violence, refugees - a depressing and traumatic history."
"The decision to opt for Europe, therefore, is a considerable achievement and signals that Serbia has become a factor of stability in the region."
"Two major political problems remain: the arrest and transfer of Ratko Mladić to The Hague, and coming to terms with the independence of Kosovo."
"Both these point towards psychological barriers."
"Mladić has his protectors, and the loss of Kosovo is painful for a sizeable section of Serbian society; any loss of territory is painful."
"To these may be added several other areas that need attention, notably, the upgrading of public administration and of the administration of justice, the establishment of market conditions and full openness towards Serbia's past, including opening up the archives."
"The auguries for Serbia's road towards Europe are reasonably good."
"There is a clear commitment in this direction."
"The tasks faced by the elite and by society are recognised and the technical preparations are going ahead."
"If all goes well, Serbia should receive the opinion this autumn and candidate status after that."
"The road to Europe will not be easy, but Europe as a whole benefits from a stable, democratic Serbia."
"Welcome"
"Before we move on down the list of speakers, I would just like to take the opportunity to bid welcome to a guest who is following our debate today, namely, Serbia's Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Božidar Đelić."
"A very warm welcome to you, Mr Đelić. It is nice to have you with us."
"EC-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement - Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EC and Serbia (continuation of debate)"
"The next item on the agenda is the continuation of the joint debate on the EC-Serbia Agreement."
"Madam President, I, too, should like to congratulate Mr Kacin on the balanced and detailed text which he has presented."
"The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament wholeheartedly supports the accession prospects of Serbia, a country which has made tremendous progress over recent years and which forms the cornerstone for consolidating peace and stability in the Western Balkans."
"Parliament's approval today of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is therefore an historic moment and we welcome it."
"In the resolution by the European Parliament, we also welcome the accession request filed by this country, but emphasise that other steps still need to be taken."
"It must be clear that the development of regional cooperation is still the Union's top priority in the Western Balkans."
"This being so, cooperation between Serbia and the International Criminal Court is an absolute international obligation and must proceed apace, not because Europe wants it, but because the dispensation of justice requires reconciliation with the past and allows relations to be improved between all the peoples of the former Yugoslavia."
"However, we must not forget that the Serbian people were victims of this war."
"Serbia is now the country with the highest number of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe; people who need care and housing and to be integrated into the labour market."
"The Union must provide practical support for all efforts in this direction, especially in light of the credit crisis."
"We therefore welcome the recent commitment by the Presidents of Serbia and Croatia to find joint solutions to the refugee problem."
"The decision to enter into dialogue with the authorities in Kosovo is especially important to stability in the area."
"We support the dialogue, which needs to start as soon as possible, for the benefit of everyone living in Kosovo, and we hope that it will contribute towards the common European future of the peoples in the region."
"To close, I should like to congratulate the Vice-President of the Serbian Government, Mr Đelić, on his statement yesterday, to the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, that Serbia is seeking an historic compromise on Kosovo."
"This compromise really is necessary and we must all help to achieve it."
"Madam President, as a liberal, I must stress that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is a group which has always supported the enlargement process because we believe in a Europe comprising all its members, namely, a powerful, united Europe."
"As a Romanian, I cannot but welcome this European path being pursued by Serbia, while also emphasising that Serbia is a European country and its journey towards Europe will not be completed without difficulties arising from a troubled past."
"However, Serbia must look forward and try to forget the past, because reconciliation with the past must not stand in the way of a future destiny in Europe."
"I wish to stress that it is vital for the Copenhagen criteria to be implemented properly, robustly and scrupulously for the whole region, which means Serbia as well, because they alone guarantee respect for European values, the rule of law and viable democracies."
"I believe that these last two years since the historic decision was made to embark on the European path prove that both the government in Belgrade and the Serbian people are motivated and determined."
"They wholeheartedly believe in this European project because what else can be more important than European decisions adopted by a government which has not been forced to make these decisions by legal requirements or requirements stipulated by the rules of this political game."
"It is also crucial that Serbia stabilises its economy."
"Indeed, the signs we are seeing at the moment in the Serbian economy are excellent."
"It is paramount that it stabilises its democracy."
"However, a great deal of attention must be focused on multiculturalism in the Balkans, which has been a sensitive issue."
"The problem of minorities in this region must not be one which will create conflict."
"I believe that a model promoting assistance and support for minorities and cultural reconciliation is an absolute must."
"Madam President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is a staunch supporter of Serbia' s accession to the EU."
"We are, therefore, pleased with the current government's unequivocally pro-European course."
"However, in my opinion, neither side is exactly going to win any awards for the way in which it has been dealing with the accession process."
"The EU is simply letting itself be trifled with."
"In order to support Serbia' s pro-European policy, it was granted a visa waiver before it had fully complied with the criteria."
"Serbia received the Avis in October, in exchange for taking a moderate position on Kosovo."
"The EU is sending out a message that it is political games, not adherence to the criteria, which will determine the accession process."
"We should not have to reward Serbia for behaving like a mature European democracy."
"In fact, we should be able to expect Serbia to take on a responsible role as a regional leader with regard to Kosovo and Bosnia as a matter of course, without having to reward it in the same way that one gives a small child a sweet for being good."
"One thing which we should at least do is stop caving in every time that it comes to the hunt for Mladić and Hadžić."
"We are talking here about the perpetrators of horrific war crimes and genocide."
"They should not be allowed to get away with murder."
"Serbia can, and must, do a lot more to arrest them."
"We cannot allow full cooperation with the ICTY to become a trifle which may be overlooked in the interests of diplomacy."
"The verdict on this must rest with those who are in a position to judge whether Serbia is cooperating fully, and that is prosecutor Brammertz."
"For that reason, I ask you to vote in favour of our amendment."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, Serbia's progress towards EU membership is gathering pace, and rightly so, as evidenced by the excellent Kacin report."
"When I was in Serbia last October, I was impressed with the commitment and effort of Serbia's dynamic, western-orientated democratic government."
"Serbia certainly has much work still to be done, relating to judicial reform and the fight against organised crime."
"We in the ECR also hope that Ratko Mladić will be caught and sent to The Hague, though it is by no means certain that he is on Serbian territory."
"However, it is vital that Serbia's progress is reciprocated and rewarded by the EU and its Member States, for example, now by ratifying the SSA, not least because some of Serbia's neighbours, such as Croatia, are far more advanced on the road to EU accession."
"Serbia's relationship with Kosovo is problematic but not insoluble."
"I personally believe that an equitable full and final settlement based on partition and the 'land for peace' principles we see in the Middle East would be the best way forward."
"In my view, the EU should properly evaluate this option during the forthcoming dialogue brokered by the High Representative."
"To dismiss it out of hand would be dangerously short-sighted, and would only perpetuate Kosovo's state of limbo in terms of international recognition at EU, NATO and UN level."
"Madam President, the greatest figure in Serbian history, Saint Sava, said that the Serbs are a people both of the East and of the West."
"From this arises the problem that they do not trust the people of the West, because they regard themselves as people of the East, and they do not trust the people of the East, because they regard themselves as people of the West."
"In fact, Serbia is a bridge between the east and west of Europe, a key country for European unity, and, ultimately, even the novel by the great Serbian writer, Dobrica Ćosić, 'A Time of Death', shows that Serbia is of key importance where the unity or break-up of Europe are at stake."
"I believe it is time for us to realise the fundamental importance of Serbia for European unity."
"It is the key Balkan economy, and there will be no European unity without the Balkans."
"I would like to emphasise that we have common tasks that can be addressed relatively quickly, such as the problems of refugees in Serbia (Serbia has some 750 000 refugees on its territory), environmental problems (some of which go back to the 1990s) and the operation of shipping lanes on the Danube (we have a working inter-group in the European Parliament dedicated to the Danube), and we should also aim to assist Serbia in a bold reform of the judiciary and in the fight against organised crime."
"Madam President, I believe that Mr Kacin's report strikes a perfect balance, for which I congratulate him."
"Serbia's progress in terms of the reforms needed is reflected in this report in a realistic manner."
"Just yesterday, the Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia gave a satisfactory presentation of developments to the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Nonetheless, one important outstanding issue is cooperation with the International Criminal Court, including handing over the final fugitives to The Hague, this being a fundamental prerequisite to Serbia's progress towards accession."
"Freedom of the press is one of the most important problems that the Serbian Government needs to resolve; there should be no political pressure or other influences that obstruct the independence of Serbian journalists."
"Another problem besetting Serbia is the large number of refugees and internally displaced persons facing housing problems and poverty, while unemployment is close to 19%."
"I think that we should help Serbia and we must not forget that this country recently came out of a war."
"(NL) Madam President, we should not focus just on arresting and trying the war criminal Mladić."
"Serbia has enormous problems with organised crime."
"A number of speakers have already mentioned this and we must not underestimate those problems."
"Certainly, progress has been made, but not enough to achieve an acceptable standard, not by a long shot."
"Another thing, of course, is that Serbia is a poor country, like all those candidate countries."
"These are poor countries and their accession will be very costly for European citizens."
"Serbia is even more corrupt than Romania and Bulgaria."
"Romania and Bulgaria should never have been allowed to join the Union."
"This will lead to a great many problems in terms of corruption and Serbia is even more corrupt."
"I view that as a particularly persistent problem and one that cannot be resolved just like that."
"I therefore call on you not to underestimate it."
"Moreover, Serbia's potential accession, just like the visa waiver, will lead to even more emigration into Western Europe, emigration that will be of no benefit to us."
"Madam President, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the European integration of Serbia are important for both Serbia and the European Union."
"I should like to make two remarks."
"In order to negotiate the agreement properly and to properly manage the integration process, the European Union should start by identifying and recognising its own interests."
"Europe has an unsolved Albanian problem, a lack of geopolitical coherence on its southern flank, and a black hole of organised crime and corruption in its Balkan area."
"This means that at the centre of the Union, there is a need for an enlarged functional and cohesive market and for better transportation corridors in that area."
"None of these problems can be solved without the contribution of Serbia."
"Secondly, we have to avoid treating Serbia as a second-class European country and lecturing it on every occasion."
"Serbia has indeed committed many sins, but the Euro-Atlantic contribution to the sins committed was also significant."
"2011 is indeed a year of challenging opportunities for both Serbia and the European Union."
"We will not be able to rise to those opportunities unless we leave aside all narcissism and treat Serbia as a peer."
"Only a dignified Serbia can be a reliable partner for a historic reconciliation in the Balkans and a historic reunification within the European Union."
"Mr Kacin's report makes a remarkable contribution in that direction."
"Madam President, I join those who have praised and welcomed the report by my colleague, Jelko Kacin, and I thoroughly agree with his remarks that Serbia's future lies in the European Union and that Serbia will become an important player in guaranteeing security and stability in the Western Balkans region."
"I have supported the aim of EU membership for the Western Balkan countries for the last decade, including when I was the Vice-Chair of the Balkans Delegation."
"I worked closely with our rapporteur in championing visa-free travel and I was delighted when that was secured for Serbia, among others, a year ago."
"I think this is a really vital contribution to person-to-person contacts and to raising horizons and, ultimately, to guaranteeing security in its wider sense."
"Some of the challenges that are faced by Serbia have already been mentioned."
"I would like to add something on the challenge of judicial reform."
"The Commission's progress report last autumn sounded a note of concern about reappointment procedures being carried out in a non-transparent way, jeopardising the principle of independence of the judiciary and creating a high risk of political influence."
"That is clearly a key issue in terms of the Rule of Law."
"In relation to cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, in The Hague, Mr Kacin told the Foreign Affairs Committee last night that Serbia is doing absolutely everything in its power to locate and apprehend the remaining two indicted individuals and transfer them to The Hague, but Serge Brammertz, the Chief Prosecutor, in his speech to the UN Security Council in September, said that Serbia needed to bridge the gap between its stated commitment to the arrests and the effectiveness of its operations on the ground."
"We are not seeing results."
"Serbia needs to adopt a more proactive approach to arresting the fugitives, so I am afraid that there is a gap between rhetoric and reality, and that gap absolutely must be bridged."
"(DE) Madam President, we, too, advocate the accession of the Western Balkans to the European Union and, of course, also that of Serbia."
"Each country is discrete, of course, but the region is interconnected and the action of each country in the region has a crucial impact on the success of the process itself."
"In this context, I would like to point out, once again, that, for us, Serbia's accession process cannot progress any further without a definite all clear from the International Criminal Court and, as my fellow Member just said, more proactive and, above all, more effective cooperation with the Court on the ground."
"There have also been positive developments. One such development was the adoption of the Gender Equality Act, which we were very pleased about."
"What we want to see now is for its implementation to take place really quickly and we are calling on the Commission to make money available to support this process."
"If this region wants to grow together, we also need more public transport options in and through the region again. In this regard too, I call on the Commission to provide more support and funding in this area through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), as we are convinced that what is needed is contact between people and not just between leaders."
"This is very much fostered if it becomes easier for the people of the region to be mobile."
"Mobility is also a question that I would like to just mention quickly before I finish, specifically with regard to the vehicle licence plates that Belgrade continues to issue for seven regions in the north of Kosovo."
"We call on Belgrade to finally desist from issuing these licence plates for Kosovo."
"(PL) Madam President, Serbia is a European country."
"Serbia is part of European history."
"Serbia is a part of European culture."
"Serbia is not just a part of Europe's geography."
"Serbia, therefore, must be part of the political map of Europe, so let us not search for pretexts to prolong Serbia's path to the European Union."
"I have the impression that the EU has sometimes brushed that country off and there has been an inequality between the treatment of certain countries in the Balkans and Serbia."
"We must end this inequality once and for all."
"Let us not look for pretexts - and I stress this once again - to prolong Serbia's path to the European Union."
"The Serbian nation has done enough to be given a place among the nations of Europe as soon as possible."
"(NL) Madam President, at the moment, the economic crisis in Serbia and in the Western Balkans is coming to a head."
"This precarious situation carries with it the danger of a renewed upsurge in populist and nationalist sentiments."
"Commissioner Füle, is it not time that we established a development fund for the Western Balkans along the lines of the post-war Marshall Plan?"
"Commissioner, I have a second question for you."
"I was yesterday informed by an insider of a potential new hotbed in Serbia."
"This concerns the activities of radical Islamic forces in Sandžak."
"One name that has been circulating in this respect is that of the regional mufti, Mr Zukorlić."
"What specific information does the European Commission have about this matter and what countermeasures is the Commission considering?"
"(BG) Madam President, tens of thousands of Bulgarians live in the east of Serbia, in the areas around Bosilegrad and Caribrod."
"They are an ethnic minority which remained in Serbia after the end of the First World War."
"It would not be too far from the truth to say that they are among the poorest people in Europe."
"Not only has the Serbian Government failed to do anything about this - such as investments, to get the economy of the region going a little, but in November last year, with no explanation and in violation of its international undertakings, it stopped a group of Bulgarian citizens bringing aid to the children of the region who were coming to learn in Bulgaria."
"I would remind the representatives of the Serbian Government that free movement of people and open borders are a fundamental value of the European Union."
"And until you learn about it and apply it, there is no place for you here."
"(DE) Madam President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Kacin for what he has put forward."
"His report makes a clear case for a 'yes' vote."
"I think that, for all the issues where we continue to criticise Serbia, for all the imperatives for internal reform processes, all the necessity of cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), for the issues relating to the fight against corruption, which is particularly far-reaching in Serbia in particular, with mafia mob activities taking place and influencing economic life, the struggle in respect of all of this needs to be fought over the years and this is a condition for Serbia to continue on a positive pro-European course towards membership of the European Union, as they were firmly promised at Thessaloniki, and we need to be true to that promise."
"I would also like to say, however, that it is necessary to cooperate with Serbia."
"You only have to look into the history of the region to know that there can only be lasting peaceful development if Serbia is on board and that we therefore must see Serbia not only as an applicant for future membership of the European Union but also as an essential strategic partner in the sensible development of the entire region and that, for this reason, we should be a source of encouragement and that we should not treat Serbia less well than states that are Member States of the European Union or that are a long way down the road to accession, for whatever historical reasons, be they short or long-term."
"Given the courage with which President Tadić has fought for a European course and how embattled he is in Serbia, it is imperative that we support these political forces and encourage them so that they are able to show their population that the path to Europe, rather than a nationalistic path, is the right path for the people, too."
"For this reason, I would like to invite everyone, and the Member States, in particular, to move forward quickly with the ratification process and, in this way, send a signal that the steps that Serbia is taking towards Europe must be supported so that we can achieve security in the region in the long run."
"(DE) Madam President, I was in Croatia a few days ago and never has so much been spoken about Serbia there as in recent days, and specifically in a very positive sense because of exactly what Mr Brok said - the brave moves that Mr Tadić has made together with President Josipović - and I am also aware that Deputy Prime Minister Đelić is heavily involved in this regard - are significant steps towards Europe."
"These are elements of a regional collaboration, but a regional collaboration with a great political as well as humanitarian significance."
"It is therefore very important - and in this regard I fully back what Mr Brok and other Members have said - that we encourage Serbia to continue to take such steps."
"Clearly, this also applies to relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"We all know how important it is that Serbia positively engages - and the same applies to Croatia - in order for that country to hold together and also to carry out the appropriate reforms."
"In this regard, Serbia really is very courageous here and it is absolutely crucial to regional collaboration."
"One critical element that I nevertheless wish to raise is collaboration with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)."
"I had, of course, invited Mr Brammertz to attend the working group of the Committee on Foreign Affairs that I chair."
"We are not completely satisfied in this area - more can be done."
"Our promptings in this regard have not really been satisfied."
"I would therefore ask everyone to put pressure on for this to happen."
"As Mrs Koppa has already said, this is not just a question for Europe."
"Serbia must also work on these issues for Serbia itself."
"Just as there has been this apology in Vukovar, which will undoubtedly go down in the history of the country, the fight against those who have committed major crimes must also continue."
"(SV) Madam President, we cannot fail to notice that Serbia has made a huge amount of progress recently."
"Let me give you a few examples: the successful conclusion of the visa liberalisation process, the regional cooperation in the areas of both traffic and energy, a political will to contribute to the reconciliation process in the region and a new political leadership, which was most apparent in President Tadić's visit to Srebrenica and Vukovar."
"All of these things demonstrate not only the good leadership of particular individuals and Serbia's huge desire to move closer to EU Membership, but also the decision on the part of the Serbs to choose precisely this sort of leadership."
"We are therefore pleased that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Serbia is now in place and that we are sending clear signals to Serbia to show that we can see the results of their efforts and that Serbia has a place in the EU family."
"There are clearly many challenges remaining: the fight against organised crime, continued legal reforms and finding a solution to the minorities issues."
"Most of these problems are not unique to Serbia, however, but are also shared by the other Balkan countries."
"However, one issue that is rather unique and that needs to be mentioned in this context is the cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague."
"The political will exists in the Serbian Government."
"There is also an awareness of the fact that it is necessary to cooperate with the Tribunal."
"Let us now hope that Ratko Mladić will soon be back in The Hague."
"(ES) Madam President, I have one minute to stress how important it is that we complete the makeup of the European Union with Serbia's membership, which I hope can be confirmed this year on the basis of the significant progress the country has made."
"That progress has been acknowledged by the Council in its decision to move forward with the accession process and by Parliament in the report by Mr Kacin, whom I congratulate."
"In this one minute, I also have to point out that the different positions on Kosovo within the European Union have encouraged Serbia to make a clear commitment to Europe, which is essential for consolidating peace and democracy in the Balkans and for achieving a constructive approach to regional integration, as demonstrated by the High-Level Meeting in Sarajevo, held on 2 June under the Spanish Presidency."
"I hope that Serbia has the EU's full support in undertaking the reforms that it needs in terms of justice, combating corruption and intra-regional dialogue."
"Madam President, I am glad to see that Serbia has shown strong determination and made substantial progress in the integration process."
"Concluding the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) and implementing it are the next important steps on this road."
"The Serbian Government should be commended for the actions which have been taken to get to this stage."
"I am sure that the SAA will bring concrete economic and trade benefits for the country in areas such as environment, energy, transport and many others."
"Thirteen countries have so far ratified this agreement."
"I hope that its ratification by the European Parliament will encourage the rest to conclude the process soon."
"However, there are still challenges ahead for both Serbia and the EU."
"Serbia needs to commit to full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in bringing the remaining war criminals to justice."
"There is also an urgent need for progress in the fight against corruption and organised crime, and for further reforms in the sectors of justice and public administration."
"Equally, the Serbian Parliament needs to abandon the practices of blank mandates and the arbitrary allocation of parliamentary seats."
"Finally, the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo will, I hope, be put on the right track and will guarantee ordinary people better prospects for the future."
"The European Parliament has always been a strong supporter of the integration of the Western Balkans."
"Serbia is a crucial part of that with this commitment ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(NL) Madam President, this is an important moment for stability in the Balkans."
"Serbia has clearly demonstrated that it has made a choice to work towards a European future, but it will have to work hard to achieve that."
"There are a number of stumbling blocks on the road to possible EU membership."
"On top of that, the last two ICTY suspects, Goran Hadžić and Ratko Mladić, have still not been arrested."
"Unfortunately, as is apparent in the Chief Prosecutor Brammertz's report, Serbia has failed to convince the international community that it is putting every effort into searching for these criminals."
"In Brammertz's opinion, rather than doing its utmost to arrest the suspects, the Serbian Government has, in fact, done no more than the bare minimum that is required of it."
"What we need is a clear and united message from the Serbian Government."
"Similarly, it is important that the European Commission be prepared to exert much more pressure."
"It is also important that the rights of women and homosexuals remain high on Serbia's agenda."
"I expect Serbia to pull out all the stops to allow an open process."
"(HU) Madam President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, first, congratulations are due to both the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur for reaching suitable compromises in this text and for producing a good report."
"Last year, Serbia took major steps towards integration in many respects, which the report takes account of as well, and thus I would like to mention only a few points."
"One of these is the question of visa-free travel, which the Serb authorities ought to take very seriously and, in the future, they ought to do their utmost to advise citizens not to abuse this opportunity, as otherwise, the access to European prospects on the part of young people in the future would be impaired, because this visa-free travel - which we have always supported - is precisely about the young generations joining and closing the gap with Europe, and this must not be gambled with. At the same time, Serbia must make immediate progress in cooperating with the international tribunal and must produce results in negotiations with Kosovo."
"However, what I should like to emphasise is the issue of minority rights listed in the Copenhagen criteria."
"I am pleased that the report has devoted attention to these matters in good time because Serbia must continue its activity in this area: the laws on the status of Vojvodina and on national councils must be put into practice in a manner that enables them to exert their effect in reality."
"The European Union, however, must learn from the accessions of 2004 and 2007 that these ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) Madam President, the decision made by the Council to initiate the procedure for ratifying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement will encourage Serbia to continue its reforms in order to comply with the Copenhagen criteria."
"The entry into force of this agreement will open up trade between the EU and Serbia and will offer real prospects for accession."
"Significant progress has been made so far, especially in cooperation with EULEX, in the areas of reforming the judicial system and fighting corruption."
"At the same time, I believe that the refusal to recognise Kosovo's independence must not stand in the way of Serbia's Euroatlantic aspirations."
"Above all, the Serbian Government has shown its readiness to engage in fresh dialogue with Kosovo under the aegis of the EU."
"I would also like to mention the key role played by Serbia in safeguarding peace in the Balkans."
"In this respect, I think that it is of paramount importance to continue the open-door policy towards all the countries in the Western Balkans."
"Romania has supported unreservedly the expansion of this region towards the EU and NATO, with a particular mention for Serbia."
"I will end by stressing that this country's efforts and aspirations must be recognised by European states and encouraged at the same time."
"It is our duty to support our partners in the Balkans in continuing along the Euroatlantic path which they have already chosen."
"(BG) Madam President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Kacin, on the fine work he has done on this report."
"The future of Serbia and the Western Balkans is in the European Union."
"I am convinced that the historical errors and injustices that befell the Balkans in the last century can only be overcome through European integration."
"Our common aim is to change the present borders from lines of separation to lines of unification."
"It should not matter on which side of a border citizens live, regardless of their ethnicity: whether they are in Niš or in Kalotina, in Caribrod or in Sofia, in Priština or in Leskovac, European integration is the only way to stability, security and prosperity, for Serbian citizens as well as their neighbours."
"Dr Kacin's report includes aspects of what has been achieved in Serbia, and what remains to be done."
"Serbia has our support on its road to integration, and will continue to have it."
"However, those of us from Eastern Europe can give our Serbian friends some useful advice to prevent them from repeating our mistakes."
"One such piece of advice would be to open the files of the repressive communist system in Yugoslavia."
"In Bulgaria, we have bitter experience of what delays in opening the files entails."
"The former secret services are closely linked to corruption and organised crime in the region."
"I congratulate Serbia in its attempts to limit the influence of communist structures in its government."
"A democratic country's future should not be controlled by its totalitarian past."
"We in Eastern Europe are clearly aware of manipulation by the former communists, who do everything they can to present their activities as being in defence of the national interest."
"Do not be fooled."
"The only thing they are interested in are their own interests."
"Whoever controls the past also controls the future."
"Opening the files of the communist secret services will be a clear sign to Europe that Serbia wants to break with a regime that cut it off from Europe for decades."
"The citizens of the former Yugoslavia have the right to know their most recent history."
"I wish Serbia success on its way to European integration, in which it has our support."
"We look forward to seeing it in the European democratic family."
"(EL) Madam President, I wish to start by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent work and for the text which he presented on Serbia."
"The signature of the EU-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement is a crucially important development for both Serbia and the European Union."
"Now, the next stage, the next important step, is to acquire the status of candidate country."
"I believe that we should decide on this next December."
"Let us not forget that 2011 is a pre-election year for Serbia, with parliamentary and local elections due to take place in March 2012."
"Those of us who had an opportunity to listen to Deputy Prime Minister Đelić in the Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday witnessed Serbia's dedication and determination to make every effort to satisfy European criteria and preconditions."
"We also witnessed the positive and constructive position of Serbia and the Serbian Government on fundamental dialogue with Priština."
"We must encourage Serbia."
"(LT) Madam President, given the Council's conclusions on the progress made by Serbia in the area of reforms, we should congratulate this country, but unfortunately, some matters give us concern."
"As Serbia takes steps towards the European Union, a huge effort must be made in certain areas, in particular, the improvement of the business environment in Serbia."
"The experience of Lithuanian investors raises reasonable questions over the business environment and the protection of investments in Serbia."
"The Serbian Government accused Lithuanian companies, which had invested EUR 34 million, of default and, in violation of the agreement between Serbia and Lithuania providing for investment promotion and mutual protection, terminated the privatisation contract."
"Serbia must find means of ensuring transparency and a predictable environment for business, and deal with bureaucratic restrictions, legal uncertainty and similar issues."
"It goes without saying that we support Serbia's goals of integration into the European Union and hope that Serbia will deal with problem issues."
"(HU) Madam President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner Füle, we are not just ending a process, but I hope that we will also be able to start accession negotiations this year given that Serbia has achieved a great deal in recent times."
"I would like to mention the fact that Chief Prosecutor Brammertz himself regards cooperation with the international tribunal in the Hague as irreproachable."
"For a long time, this was a sensitive issue."
"The same applies to NATO partnership and what I consider to be particularly important in the case of the Western Balkans is that Serbia has a commendable minorities policy which could be exemplary for many EU Member States, as the wide-ranging cultural autonomy that is manifest in the genuine operation of the councils of various national minorities guarantees the continued existence of the minorities."
"Furthermore, progress on the issue of Kosovo, which is an emotionally highly complicated and complex question, is extremely important, but Serbia is taking a very good path ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SL) Madam President, the report of my colleague, Mr Kacin, is realistic and encouraging in equal measure."
"Serbia's full integration into the European Union is in the interest of European stability and security."
"Its integration will also mean eliminating, or making an important step towards eliminating, the grey zone in South-Eastern Europe."
"I support Serbia and its strategic objectives, of which Vice President Đelić has informed us."
"The keys are in Serbia's hands and Serbia must meet the conditions."
"This might also be an opportunity to get the message across to the Serbian public that General Mladić should be a source of shame, not pride, for the Serbian nation."
"I would like to emphasise that I welcome all the steps taken by the Serbian Government and the Serbian public towards building a good neighbourhood."
"At the same time, I need to point out that the border is one of the key issues when it comes to neighbourly relations."
"(DE) Madam President, I, too, would like to voice my backing to the accession of Serbia to the European Union and to the idea that the Serbian people have a future in a common Europe, just as the Western Balkans as a whole has."
"Personally, I will also give the green light to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, although I feel I must point out, at the same time, that Serbia's cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is still not what it should be."
"I, too, hope that there will be a majority in this plenary for our amendment and that Mr Brammertz's words will continue to apply in the future."
"I would like to thank Mr Kacin for his report and for his, in places, very positive reporting on the progress that there has been in Serbia and, at the same time, on those elements where problems still persist."
"I will turn now to relations with the Republic of Kosovo."
"As rapporteur for this Parliament for Kosovo, I am making an appeal to the Serbian administration."
"I followed very closely what Deputy Prime Minister Đelić had to say yesterday, when he stated that the willingness to enter into this historic agreement is there but that it must also be clearly stated that the dialogue between the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Kosovo ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) Madam President, I would like to begin by expressing my support for the conclusion of an association agreement with Serbia."
"Serbia was, and continues to be, an influential Balkan country."
"The citizens of this country, however, have, for many long years, been paying for the mistakes of their political leaders, who got the country into a difficult political situation through their risky decisions."
"If we want to stabilise the political situation in the Balkans on a long-term basis, however, we must have open and correct relations with all countries in the region."
"Serbia must therefore be an equally serious partner for us as the other stable countries of the region, in order for us, in open dialogue and through good cooperation, to help the inhabitants of the country integrate as soon as possible and as well as possible into the community of free, democratic European countries."
"(HU) Madam President, as a Hungarian, the Hungarian Presidency is a great pleasure for me and I wish the Council every success, yet this speech about Serbia's EU accession gave me a slight feeling of sadness and a sense that something is lacking."
"This was due to the absence of any mention of the extraordinarily crude violation of human rights committed against our fellow Hungarians in Vojvodina, and I would like to ask whether the Hungarian Presidency or the Commission is aware of the reports of human rights organisations and the reports of observers, firstly in the case of the young men of Temerin."
"The case of the young men of Temerin shows a flagrant violation of human rights perpetrated by imposing an excessively severe sentence of a total of 61 years in prison on five young men for a pub fight, which they must serve in third world conditions, tortured and subject to inhumane, cruel treatment."
"This is compounded by the fact that at the same time, the most brutal crimes committed against Hungarians are not investigated."
"Do you know ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Madam President, contrary to the view of those advocates of the EU who wear rose-tinted glasses, accession to the Union alone is not enough to resolve all conflicts just like that."
"Especially when it comes to the applicant state of Turkey, it can be seen that the EU operates a double standard."
"Serbia, after all, is ready to engage in talks with Kosovo even though the EU's attitude is manifestly inconsistent: in Bosnia, multiple ethnic groups are to be forced into a multicultural State while in Kosovo, it is deemed legitimate for a single ethnic group to hive itself off from a State."
"Not only has Serbia expressed its willingness to talk to Kosovo, but it has also apologised for the genocide at Srebrenica."
"Yet, despite this, Belgrade continues to be accused of failing to adequately cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague."
"The violations of human rights in Turkey, however, where simply discussing the Armenian genocide is enough to merit punishment, are apparently something that can be overlooked."
"The accusation against Kosovar Prime Minister Thaçi of trading in human organs also demonstrates that war crimes cannot be viewed in a one-sided way."
"These accusations must be fully resolved."
"For accession to the EU, it is very important that Serbia and Kosovo first resolve their disputes."
"Madam President, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia represents another important step in the process of integration towards the EU undertaken by Serbia."
"We are talking about a country whose progress in recent years has already been impressive, and I think that further political and economic integration on the basis of the SAA will give the final boost that Serbia needs on its path towards the EU."
"In view of the important role that Serbia plays in the Western Balkans, the SAA will have a positive influence not only on the EU and on Serbia, but also on the region as a whole by enhancing its security, stability and development, as well as setting solid foundations for the enlargement process in the Western Balkans."
"I hope that, after it has received the green light from the European Parliament, the SAA process can be concluded as soon as possible."
"I would therefore ask the Member States to ensure that the ratification process takes place as smoothly and rapidly as possible."
"(PL) Madam President, cooperation with our European neighbours is an essential element of EU policy."
"Serbia, in a similar way to all countries on the Balkan Peninsula, is a very specific case."
"Due to the break up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s and the wars that were waged there, these countries are wrestling with economic and political problems to this day."
"The European Union's role is to support these countries and help them."
"History has taught us that the political situation in the region affects the whole continent and that we all feel its consequences for a long time."
"To a certain degree, Europe bears partial responsibility for the events that have taken place."
"For this reason, we have an increased moral obligation towards those countries, and the agreements we are talking about today - cooperation in all areas and measures to make things easier for the citizens of those countries - are essential, not least to ensure that this history is not repeated."
"(SL) Madam President, today has again proved that a democratic and European Serbia has many allies in the European Union."
"It is a fact that only a democratic and pro-European Serbia has the chance to make up for a 20-year delay in the development of democracy, economy and the quality of life of its citizens."
"Serbia's democratic government and President Tadić deserve our support."
"Serbia is key to stability in the Balkans."
"A modern, European Serbia has a major responsibility here."
"It has the responsibility, first of all, to ensure a stable, European, peaceful and better future for its neighbour, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and secondly, to strike an historic compromise with the neighbouring Albanian nation."
"Both of these objectives are the aims of the current Serbian Government, so let us work together with it and support its objectives."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner Füle said that everything was in Serbia's hands as to whether they make the right choices."
"This is undoubtedly the case, but at the same time, we have to be aware, and we know this as new Member States, that this process should be strengthened."
"Serbia made the right choice by signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"It committed itself to undertaking a range of undoubtedly difficult reforms."
"As the European Parliament, we must strengthen these reforms, because it is not only the government but, above all else, society that must make this proper European choice."
"When I was observing the constitutional referendum, I said to the Serbs, I said to my European colleagues, 'look at Belgrade and these people, the Serbs - they are Europeans, and we should help them on the road to reform'."
"I believe that everything that is happening in the process to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, as well as the European Parliament's resolution, can help Serbia to a great extent on that road."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for this rich debate, which has shown the House's constructive support of the process of the European Union integration of Serbia."
"The support provided by Parliament to the ratification process of the SAA is an important signal for Serbia, and will contribute to intensifying its efforts on the path towards the European Union."
"Let me address briefly some questions which were raised during the debate."
"To Mr Belder firstly, on the Sandžak, I would rather talk about a politicisation of the issue of Muslim representation than a surge of radical Islamism."
"In that context, we look forward to the next elections to the Bosniak National Council in April this year, which should be peaceful and inclusive and will help foster dialogue and avoid radicalisation."
"On the question of the Development Fund, we are in close dialogue with Serbia and other countries in the Western Balkan region concerning how to make the best use of the IPA and how to make it even more effective."
"Reflection is ongoing regarding the support for technological development."
"Concerning the question by Mrs Morvai, let me say that we pay particular attention to human rights and also to the protection of minority rights."
"I will write to her addressing one concrete case she referred to in her intervention."
"I am personally very encouraged by Serbia's serious and constructive approach to the current stage of the enlargement process."
"Where we talked yesterday about concerns, we are talking today about Serbia being on the right track in addressing, for example, the important issue of judicial reform."
"This is a good basis for Serbia to fully use the integration potential that the year 2011 offers."
"Madam President, Mr Đelić, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for this excellent debate."
"Excellent observations have been made on an excellent report, and the fact that the majority of the issues raised here have been included in the report demonstrated the excellence of the report to me, so I believe this was an excellent basis for discussion."
"You have all confirmed that this is not about a completed process but rather about a beginning."
"After this beginning, I believe that all the issues which you, too, have raised in the debate will be discussed."
"Substantial progress has been made, and this is why we have reached the point we are at in the process, and there is still much to do."
"You yourselves have raised a great many issues, such as deepening democracy, refugees, developing a business environment, problems related to visa-free travel or the situation of minorities."
"We have heard that there has been a major step forward in minorities policy in Serbia, as Mr Tabajdi also pointed out, yet, at the same time, the Copenhagen criteria are in force, and the Commission has drawn attention to this."
"This is an important pointer for us, and we will watch this closely in every movement and every assessment we make."
"It has also been said that the situation is fragile."
"I fully agree with this, and this is the reason why it is particularly important that we encourage Serbia to carry on along this path."
"Mr Brok and Mr Swoboda pointed this out as well."
"I believe that the most essential thing, as Mrs Nicolai also mentioned, is that this is a decision made by Serbia of its own will; that Serbia is committed to the European Union and EU membership, and we will help this process by all possible means."
"I regard the fact that they have chosen this path of their own volition as a guarantee that Serbia will take all the necessary measures."
"I am very confident, Madam President, that after this well-rounded debate, Parliament will assent to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"Madam President, today's rich debate is the best illustration of the lively interest in, and support for, Serbia here in the European Parliament and in other European institutions."
"Amongst all the challenges it inherited from the wars of the 1990s, Serbia is now, primarily, in the process of laying down the foundations for the rule of law."
"Judicial reform, which began in 2009, remains in many ways incomplete, but that requires systematic rectification."
"The rule of law is the key Copenhagen criterion."
"Serbia needs to ensure the independence, competence and efficiency of its judicial authorities in order to ensure legal certainty and economic development."
"We welcome Belgrade's recent efforts to understanding these challenges."
"Restitution, that is, the return of confiscated property and the protection of private property, is one element of this."
"I look forward to the arrival of the speaker of Serbia's National Assembly, who will visit the European Parliament as early as this month."
"We need to strengthen the role and responsibility of the Serbian Parliament and all its members."
"We also need to be better at attracting the Serbian opposition, which must assume more responsibility for the success of Serbia's integration process."
"The submission of the Serbian Government's replies to the European Commission's questionnaire, which Prime Minister Cvetković will hand over to Commissioner Füle this month, will be an historic step for the Serbian state and for all its citizens."
"I believe that this step will be highly significant and successful, which is why I also wish the Hungarian Presidency every success in promoting pro-European forces in Serbia."
"I know that the Serbian Government's European Integration Office, headed by Milica Delević, is doing an excellent job and, therefore, cooperation will not be difficult."
"In addition, the presence here today of Mr Božo Đelić, the Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Science, is proof of the lively interest on the part of the Serbian Government in our work and in Serbia's future in the European Union."
"To conclude, I would like to leave you with one thought."
"Less than three years ago, Serbia was on the verge of self-imposed isolation."
"Today, that danger has passed and Serbia is firmly on the road towards the European Union."
"At what pace it will progress depends solely on Serbia itself."
"With this resolution, we are encouraging Serbia along its historic path, and we are sending out a clear message to Serbia that we appreciate its successes and recognise all the challenges it is facing."
"The joint debate is closed."
"A motion for a resolution to close this debate has been tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"The vote to that effect will take place tomorrow at 12:30."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I welcome and support all steps leading towards the rapid integration of Serbia into the EU, since a majority of Serbs want this integration."
"At the same time, however, I would like to say that most of the shortcomings for which the Serbs are censured in the draft resolution of the European Parliament can be seen to stem from the former years of destructive engagement by some EU Member States in the Balkans, and the direct aggression of NATO against Serbia."
"We should facilitate Serbia's entry into the EU, as membership is not a reward for this country, but a chance for the EU to contribute towards solving many of the problems it actually caused, directly or indirectly."
"I would like to draw urgent attention to the need for a very prudent and balanced approach regarding ethnic minorities in Serbia."
"The European Parliament draft resolution acknowledges the 'further aspirations of the Albanian minority' in Serbia, and speaks of respecting its 'right to provincial autonomy'."
"If the problems of minorities are to be 'solved' through the creation of collective legislation providing them with special rights, it will be a 'solution' with disastrous consequences for the state involved, and that applies not only to Serbia."
"The only way to secure minority rights is to consistently promote and defend individual human rights."
"Hungary ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Serbia on 16 November 2010."
"Hungary, at the time preparing for its term of office in the EU Presidency, did not learn from its historic mistake, when it could have made Romania's accession conditional upon regional autonomy for the indigenous Hungarian minorities of Transylvania."
"The consequences of this missed opportunity are still being felt to this day: Hungarian cemeteries are being desecrated; a silent genocide of Hungarians is taking place in Transylvania."
"Through the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Serbia, the European Union and the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs must enforce the protection of minorities."
"There is great pressure on the European Union to show candidate countries, by concluding and accelerating association agreements, that EU accession is an attainable goal."
"While Jobbik supports, for example, the accession of Croatia as a country satisfying the criteria, it firmly opposes further, hasty steps made towards Serbia."
"A far greater degree of autonomy for the indigenous Hungarian minority living in Serbia, including full regional and cultural autonomy, must be laid down as a condition for the continuation of the accession process."
"We must also not dismiss the idea of allowing the people of Vojvodina to express their will with regard to their regional status through a referendum, thereby alleviating to some extent the indelible injuries inflicted on Hungarians at Trianon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10:25 and resumed at 10:30)"
"Review of the Belgian Presidency of the Council (debate)"
"Colleagues, allow me to welcome Prime Minister Yves Leterme."
"Half a year ago, we had the presentation of the Belgian Presidency."
"Now we have the presentation of the achievements of the Belgian Presidency: legislation, the European External Action Service, financial supervision, the Citizens' Initiative, the budget - we will discuss all these points."
"Welcome, too, to President Barroso, who is present with us, and to all of you."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements: Review of the Belgian Presidency of the Council."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, though this may appear somewhat incongruous here, in the plenary hall of the European Parliament, I would nonetheless like to start my speech with a quote from a great North American thinker, Ralph Waldo Emerson, who said, and I quote:"
"'Do not go where the path may lead."
"Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail'."
"(FR) In other words: 'Do not go where the path may lead."
"Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail'."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is exactly what we have done, with you all, these last six months."
"Belgium, my country, was called upon to assume the rotating Presidency of the European Union after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is true that we were not venturing into totally unknown territory but, even so, it was necessary to establish the criteria for the new functioning of the European Union under the new Treaty, with the new institutions with which the European Union has equipped itself."
"Therefore, true to the Belgian tradition, the tradition of my country, we did our utmost to enable the institutions to function optimally to create the right precedents."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I feel able to say to you that the European Union, as it was structured under the Treaty of Lisbon, functions today and functions well."
"The Union has equipped itself with a new instrument for the supervision of the financial sector, which should hopefully prevent the re-emergence of crises like the one we are still struggling to extricate ourselves from."
"Economic governance has advanced."
"Agreement has been reached on the 2011 budget and, most importantly, in total, in those six months, almost forty agreements of a legislative nature were concluded between Parliament and the Council."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our determination to respect both the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon was a choice for the future of the Union, an investment in ever closer European cooperation."
"To achieve this, during this Presidency, we followed two major guidelines."
"First, we did not want to push ourselves forward."
"Instead, we incorporated our programme, the Belgian programme with its five priorities, into the European agenda, into the programme of the Commission, into the momentum generated by the Heads of State or Government at the level of the European Council, into the programme of the troika with our Spanish and Hungarian colleagues."
"(NL) Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, as well as not wanting to impose a Belgian agenda, we opted for what I would call an inclusive Presidency."
"We effectively tried to cooperate as closely as possible with all the European institutions, respecting the letter and spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon and playing a role that was actually no more than that of facilitator."
"We cooperated with all parties, obviously with Parliament and the Commission, but also with the new permanent President of the Council, the High Representative and, of course, with Member States, but I believe I can say that, throughout all of our tenure, we paid particular attention to working constructively, and with an open mind, with Parliament, whose powers have been significantly strengthened under the new rules."
"Some modesty would be fitting today, of course, but I have to say that, together with you, we ensured that this method was successful."
"Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, today, more than ever, the Union represents an interplay between institutions and Member States."
"I think that this method has worked and that it can continue to work, because it was and is focused on results and not on image building."
"This applies to our Presidency, but it also, in fact, applies to the European Parliament, although you must be the judge of that."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here, I would nevertheless like to express my appreciation and gratitude for your cooperation, on behalf of the Belgian Government and on behalf of my colleagues who have held the rotating Presidency."
"I believe I can say that most of the agreements we reached were ultimately adopted with a very broad majority."
"This is a testament to the quality of your debates and - and this should reassure European citizens - the priority you have placed on what is good for Europe, placing it far above national interests."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, those six months are over."
"Of course, we cannot dwell on the past."
"Over the coming months and years, we will actually have more to do than ever, because our Union, our society, is facing exceptionally great challenges."
"I would now like to mention them in brief."
"The first challenge, obviously, lies in the continuity of what we have started over the past six months, namely, economic governance."
"Since those six months began, we have worked together to take the measures necessary to avert a crisis in the euro area."
"However, countering the symptoms that have been in evidence so far is not enough."
"The threats which a number of the countries in the euro area have been facing have shown that a monetary union cannot, in fact, work on its own without an economic union, without greater economic convergence."
"We must therefore press on with determination along the road of greater economic cohesion, more cohesion in the fiscal, economic and social policies of Member States."
"Economic governance also requires rigorous monitoring of the budgetary and structural policies of the Union's Member States."
"We need to make full use of the European Semester which was established with that purpose in mind."
"A return to budgetary discipline should not just be a non-binding target; it must be verifiable and, if necessary, enforceable at a European level."
"This is obviously not about discipline for its own sake; sound public finances are an absolute necessity if we are to establish sustainable growth again, a credible growth that creates jobs for our citizens."
"Those jobs are, of course, essential for the maintenance of our very specifically European social model, which goes hand in hand with political and economic freedom, social solidarity and ecological responsibility."
"(DE) The Union must use the new instruments that it is introducing in order to monitor the financial markets efficiently."
"These instruments are supposed to be ready for use by the end of this year."
"That is an absolute must in order to prevent any new derailments of the markets."
"Economic convergence, monitoring of the national budgetary and structural policy options, new instruments for financial market monitoring - all of this may give the impression that the apparatus of the Union is on the way to becoming pretty heavy-going and complicated."
"Of course, it is also to be expected that closer monitoring of the national political decisions of the Member States will not proceed without discussions and sources of friction."
"Yet that should not put us off, as it forms part of the essence of European integration."
"The second field in which we must do this - in which we must keep up the momentum - is that of the Union's role in the world."
"We have made progress in that field."
"Thanks to our concerted preparation and unified representation, we have indeed increased our weight in the G20."
"In the last months, the Union has started to build its own diplomatic representation all over the world."
"These moves are good but they have to be consolidated."
"The European Union, it is true, speaks with one voice on most problems in the world, but words are not enough."
"The Union must indeed develop more clout, it must be able to act in a decisive manner and to become a real pole of influence and power in this multipolar world."
"Thirdly, we have to address the financial perspective of the Union."
"It is true that this is not a time when governments can contemplate hefty increases in their contributions to the Union budget, but neither can we avoid a debate on the long-term financial perspective."
"Promises have been made to this Parliament that there will be consultation on the philosophy of the Union's future financing and on ways and means."
"The Union cannot live hand-to-mouth: it has to have this long-term perspective."
"Last but not least, I want to say that we will be able to deliver on these challenges only if, more than ever, we believe in ourselves."
"I would like to quote the French thinker and writer, André Frossard, on this challenge for the coming years."
"I will first quote in French, and then translate:"
"(FR) 'Europe quite rightly wants to equip herself with a common policy and currency but, most of all, she needs a soul'."
"Europe quite rightly wants to equip herself with a common policy and currency but, most of all, she needs a soul'."
"We do indeed need a soul, colleagues."
"We need to have faith in ourselves and in what we have accomplished, and not to excuse ourselves for who and what we are."
"We need to remember that, before being a market, before being a currency, before being a set of institutions, the Union - our Union - was a vision, a belief, a dream."
"It was a dream of peace on this continent, which has been torn by so many wars."
"I have heard that it has become a little bit passé to speak of peace to generations in Europe who have never known war."
"I can only say: 'Look around you'."
"Watch all the refugees, for instance, who come to us fleeing war, fleeing armed conflicts, fleeing tyranny."
"Those refugees certainly do not look down on the achievement that it is to have spread peace and security across almost the entire continent."
"And those refugees - those people - aspire, like so many people elsewhere in the world, to the rights and freedoms which too many of our citizens take so easily for granted."
"As much as the Union is about peace, it is also about liberty, about democracy, about fundamental civil rights and about the rule of law, for our citizens as well as for our immigrants."
"We believe in the right of each person to human dignity, which means people's right to live on their feet and not on their knees, and the right to think and speak and worship freely."
"In a much quoted statement, Jean Monnet said that nothing gets done without people, but that nothing lasts without institutions."
"This is just as true today as when he said it but, on the other hand, it is also true that institutions will wither if they are not carried by people with strong convictions."
"We must remember that we will carry our citizens with us only if we give them a vision: if we give them a dream."
"To conclude, I wish Hungary all possible success now that it has taken over the baton of the Presidency."
"I am sure it will hold high the torch of the European dream of peace, the European dream of freedom, and the aim of an ever stronger Union."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr Leterme, ladies and gentlemen, with efficiency and focus, with pragmatism and Community spirit, the Union made important advances during the Belgian Presidency, which deserve our admiration and our recognition."
"On behalf of the European Commission, I would like to offer my heartfelt congratulations to the Prime Minister, Mr Leterme, his entire government team, the administration, and all the Belgians who gave their very best to ensure the success of this Presidency."
"It was a fine and great Presidency at a delicate and challenging time for the future of the European Union."
"Rarely had the challenges been so important and the difficulties so crucial to overcome."
"Throughout those long months of sound and fury - if you will forgive the expression - the Belgian Presidency held firm to the course of European politics."
"Its action was always embedded in the fundamental sense of the existence of the European Union, the solidarity of everyone in the general European interest."
"Its action also enabled us to chart the best way forward to achieve our primary objectives: stability and the relaunch of job-creating growth."
"They were months during which Europe was still living to the frenetic rhythm of developments in the financial crisis and in sovereign debt."
"All eyes were on the future of the euro area and on our determination to defend it."
"When we say that we will do everything possible to defend the stability of the euro area as a whole, these must not be empty words."
"It is nothing more and nothing less than the expression of our firm political will to defend our common destiny."
"The future of the euro area and the future of the European Union are two sides of the same coin."
"We want this future to be stable and prosperous for ourselves and for future generations."
"That has always been, and remains, the meaning of European integration and of the Community spirit."
"The fundamental reforms to which we have committed ourselves show that we are fully aware of the challenge facing the European Union."
"We must adapt to the new political, economic and strategic realities of a rapidly changing globalised world."
"We must achieve this adaptation while reaffirming our values, defending our interests and enhancing our credibility and influence on the international scene."
"The basic decisions we have taken on strengthening European economic governance and tackling our macro-economic imbalances are at the heart of this progress."
"They are not an option but an imperative."
"I hope that, during this six-month period, the European Parliament and the Council will adopt the proposals on economic governance."
"Fundamentally, the question is not who among the different political stakeholders in Europe emerges a winner or a loser, but whether each of us is prepared to cooperate in full respect of our mutual prerogatives."
"In essence, the question is whether the European Union as a whole emerges a winner or a loser."
"The answer is clear: if we do not strengthen our economic governance, we will all be losers, both in the euro area and throughout the European Union."
"If we do not strengthen our economic governance, we will lose the battle for stability, growth and employment in Europe."
"If we do not strengthen our economic governance, the strong links of today may become the weak links of tomorrow."
"And if we do not strengthen our economic governance, we will lose our credibility on the international scene."
"While issues of governance and macro-economic imbalance are also global issues and are discussed, notably at the G20, how could we remain credible and influential with our international partners if we were not even capable of resolving them at EU level?"
"I say this weighing all my words carefully: essentially, it is an existential question for the European Union."
"We act and we assert ourselves as a Union, or we fail to act and allow ourselves to be marginalised."
"What is really at issue is our collective destiny."
"We are, fortunately, moving towards self-assertion."
"I would therefore like to congratulate the Belgian Presidency most sincerely."
"The agreement obtained at the ECOFIN Council on 17 September resulted in the establishment of new cycles of economic governance, known as the European Semester."
"The first step was taken last week with the presentation of the annual growth review prepared by the European Commission, in which we make very clear that the three priorities we need to focus our efforts on are reinforcing macro-economic stability - in particular, through rigorous fiscal consolidation - structural reform and job-creating growth."
"We also achieved notable successes in financial supervision, in particular, by adopting a new European architecture of financial supervision, which came into existence on 1 January 2011 with the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board and of three new financial supervisory authorities covering the markets, the banks and insurance, respectively."
"In those six months, we were also able to obtain agreements on the management of speculative funds and other alternative investment funds as well as on the rating agencies."
"For our citizens, austerity measures are not a vague concept but the harsh reality of their daily lives."
"There are, across Europe, many worries and concerns, but there are also, across Europe, high expectations that the reforms, postponed for far too long, will finally be completed, that the European dimension will be an integral part of the solution, and that Europe will defend its projects, its values and its interests in the world."
"It is therefore important to spread the word as widely as possible about what the Union is doing to restore growth that is sustainable and able to create jobs and to build a European society that is fairer and more environmentally friendly."
"I would also like to point to some other achievements, in particular, with regard to foreign policy and external relations."
"One such achievement is the free trade agreement signed with South Korea on 6 October, which is, quite simply, the most ambitious commercial agreement ever concluded by the European Union, and which must remain a benchmark for our future bilateral commercial agreements."
"Contrary to the expectations of some pessimists, Cancún also managed to show some progress towards multilateralism in the fight against climate change."
"Cancún also demonstrated the importance of cooperation between the Presidency and the Commission to enable Europe to speak with a coherent and audible voice on the international scene."
"As regards practical results, I should also like to commend the agreement finally reached during the Belgian Presidency in the field of transport on the Eurovignette dossier."
"This is very important for our citizens."
"I would also like to pay tribute to the Belgian Presidency for the exemplary way in which it enabled the major innovations of the Treaty of Lisbon to be respected and implemented."
"It used all its negotiating skills to brilliant effect during a difficult discussion on the 2011 budget of the European Union under the new budgetary rules of the Treaty."
"It was an illustration of the European spirit and of its culture of compromise at its finest."
"The Commission is proud of the contribution it made to this outcome."
"Tomorrow, in fulfilment of my commitments to Parliament, I will have an initial meeting with the President of the European Parliament, Mr Buzek, and Prime Minister Orbán, who holds the rotating Presidency of the Council, to discuss the next steps to be taken in budgetary matters."
"2010 was an often difficult and, at times, extremely demanding year."
"Ultimately, however, it was very productive."
"It was under the Presidency of two countries, Belgium, but also Spain, that European integration was able to move decisively forward."
"I see in it the strength of our Union and the proper functioning of our institutions."
"It is now up to the third country in the troika, Hungary, to maintain this momentum."
"The important decisions that we have taken over the past year are proof that all of us, Parliament, Council, Commission, Member States, know what we have to do to ensure a stable and prosperous future for Europe."
"If we know what we have to do, we have to do it now."
"We have said that we have the will to do it; we must now show that we are indeed capable of honouring our political commitments without diluting them, without weakening and without allowing ourselves to be fooled by tentative signs of recovery."
"We need to consolidate our actions, to show that they are not a reaction to the pressure of the crisis in the markets, but rather the strong reaffirmation of our will to live together in this Union for peace, solidarity and freedom."
"Mr President, the Belgian Presidency has rightly received praise from all quarters."
"You and your colleagues, Mr Prime Minister, can lay claim to a remarkable series of achievements."
"Rather than commenting on the specific achievements, I would particularly emphasise the gold standard that you have set for the Presidency."
"After all, the Belgian Presidency of the Council was the first to have held office entirely within the new institutional framework of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"That in itself was a challenge."
"The Treaty has radically changed the institutional framework, as I have already stated in my report on the previous term."
"Thus, the European Council and the Council have now clearly become two separate institutions, each with its own Presidency."
"One other thing which is new is that the Treaty uses exactly the same wording to describe the mandate of the Council as it does to describe that of Parliament."
"One cannot shake off the impression that some members of the Council have had some difficulty in adapting to the new relationship between Parliament and the Council."
"That was obvious during the budget debate."
"However, this cannot be said of the Belgian Presidency."
"In consultation with the Commission and Parliament, it has mainly invested its efforts in the realisation of the European Legislative Agenda."
"European priorities were always paramount in this."
"That also partly explains the success of the Belgian Presidency."
"In the past, presidencies have too often tried to assert their national priorities over European agencies."
"This is not the case here and, therefore, Europe has made real progress during this Presidency."
"The difficult budget debate during the Belgian Presidency also set the course for one of the most difficult challenges facing the Union in years to come, namely, the establishment of the new financial framework."
"Belgium received a pledge from the previous presidencies that Parliament would be involved in the debate on this multiannual financial framework."
"For its part, the Commission undertook to formulate, in the framework of its proposal for the multiannual plan, proposals for the Union's own resources, and it is essential that that is done."
"Parliament will therefore ensure that both the Commission and any forthcoming Presidencies adhere to these commitments."
"Mr President, Prime Minister Leterme, members of the Presidency-in-Office, Mr Barroso, this week, we have the opportunity to compare two Presidencies: the one just completed and the one just begun."
"When it comes to the Belgian Presidency, I have to say that it delivered excellent work - many thanks for that, therefore."
"It did this despite difficult conditions - the political situation at home is not exactly easy, of course, the Treaty of Lisbon is new and even the relationship with the European Council is not all that easy."
"The Belgian Presidency had a clear focus on Europe, however."
"It wanted to take Europe forwards."
"With the Hungarian Presidency, in contrast - up to now, at any rate - we have seen a Presidency that pays more attention to its domestic affairs, in other words, to holding on to power at home, specifically in connection with a very controversial media law that we will also be discussing at a later date."
"I hope that Mr Orbán will take a very close look at how the Belgian Presidency went, and perhaps follows its lead somewhat."
"Mr Leterme, you spoke of economic governance."
"In this regard, I can but fully endorse what Mr Barroso had to say."
"All there is is an either/or situation."
"Either there is another crisis-provoking development in Europe - and not only in the euro area - or there is an attempt to create efficient economic governance based on cooperation between all the Member States, but also based on strong action taken by the Commission."
"You know, Mr Barroso, that you have our full backing in this regard."
"You achieved much in this area, Mr Leterme, but we need to go further now, and we need to take the next steps."
"You said that this is primarily about tax, fiscal and social cooperation."
"That takes me to the second item where this Belgian Presidency very much excelled, namely, the social dimension."
"I think we all have an interest - though perhaps with differing emphases - in this social dimension being developed accordingly."
"Social Europe does not mean that every last thing is done in Europe's socio-political sphere; rather, it means, for example, the things that you talked about and achieved in relation to fighting poverty."
"It is scandalous to see that poverty is actually rising in Europe to some degree."
"The same applies to what you said about the increasingly disparate distribution of incomes."
"In your Presidency, you made clear that this is not only a social issue; it is also an economic one."
"More poverty and more social inequality also translate to a loss of competitiveness."
"That has been proven economically, financially and empirically."
"The things that you said are very important."
"Also important are the things that you said about the Europe of the citizens."
"You delivered a tangible contribution, along with Mr Šefčovič and Members of this House, in bringing about the European citizens' initiative."
"This will be a major step forwards if it is also used appropriately by pro-European forces to bring Europe closer to the citizens."
"Naturally, we wish Belgium all the best for the future, too."
"It is not without importance how the actors on the political stage behave."
"I hope that all the political forces in Belgium attempt to find a real consensus."
"It is difficult to tell people in a crisis-hit region that they should just reach a consensus, that they should just work together on important issues, when this is not possible in Belgium - one of the heartlands of the European Union."
"In this connection, I wish you all the best."
"In many ways, you represented an exemplary Presidency."
"I hope that other, subsequent Presidencies follow your example."
"(Applause)"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Swoboda how he dares to criticise the Hungarian Presidency when it is just starting."
"He does not even know anything about it."
"Why does he not instead criticise his comrades in the Socialist Group who were shooting at their own people on the 50th anniversary of the 1956 revolution and who arbitrarily imprisoned hundreds of people?"
"He should ask them and criticise them."
"Mr President, I am familiar with this kind of argument, which states that if you criticise a government, you criticise its people."
"It was like this in former times in my own country too."
"Let us be clear."
"We did not start the debate."
"It was the Hungarian Government with this - as I said here - contested law."
"It is a law greatly disputed by many Hungarian citizens who suffered under Communism and during the Nazi regime."
"They are afraid that their liberty of expression is in danger."
"That is the thing that should be addressed."
"Mr President, I propose that we debate the Hungarian Presidency tomorrow."
"We should keep matters separate, or else Prime Minister Leterme will have to comment on the new media law in Hungary, and I do not believe that that is his responsibility."
"The role of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, is to pass and monitor legislation, which therefore means being critical when things go wrong, when things are in a bad state, but also giving praise when things actually turn out well."
"We could say that the Belgian Presidency has been good, very good, and that it has been a success thanks to the efforts of many people: the Belgian Government, but also many diplomats, the Permanent Representative, the Deputy Permanent Representative and all those who have worked every day to make it a success."
"It was a success which no one foresaw, because, Mr Prime Minister, all of us were constantly confronted with the following question from our constituents: how can a caretaker government make for a successful Presidency?"
"In my view, it was the first time that we had ever had a real European government, because it was a government which concerned itself only with European affairs and European issues, and which was not distracted by the affairs of its members' own nations."
"This is almost an invitation to other governments to be caretaker governments when they take over the Presidency of the European Union, so that they can concentrate on Europe for six months instead of occasionally squeezing it in between other issues."
"I think that the Belgian Presidency was successful mainly for one reason (look at the financial supervision, the hedge funds, the rating agencies): because this Presidency understood that, under the new Treaty, we need to be working towards 'more Europe' and because it pushed for 'more Europe' in the Council."
"That cannot be said of all presidencies."
"Jean-Luc Dehaene is right when he says that there are, indeed, a number of Member States that still do not understand that the ground rules have changed."
"The ground rules have changed and the Belgian Presidency is the first to have grasped that that is the case."
"If we have ended up with an arrangement for European supervision whereby the objectives of the European Parliament have finally been attained, then that is because the Belgian Presidency told our colleagues in the Council: 'That will not work, it has to be a European solution', unlike the solution developed by the finance ministers in December 2009."
"I would say the same about the European patent."
"Now, that was a major breakthrough, Mr President."
"I would call on you and all other members to give the green light for that patent to the European Parliament very soon, so that, after more than 20 years, the European patent can finally become a reality."
"Mr President, as others have said before me, it is obviously true that, to date, Belgian political engineers have been better outside their borders than at home."
"In any case, I welcome this and I congratulate you."
"The Belgian team did a good job and this is a very good thing."
"Moreover, I am of the opinion that the opposition you encountered in the different Councils in fact resembles the opposition we encounter in the Belgian debate: solidarity, transfers, all these issues relating to withdrawal or contribution are things that we are very familiar with in Belgium and that you encountered in the Council."
"Furthermore, Mr Barroso, since you expressed your admiration and your acknowledgement, perhaps, at some time in the future, the European Union could give Belgium a nudge in the right direction or a bit of a helping hand."
"Since Belgium helped the European Union, perhaps the European Union could help Belgium to unblock its federal stalemate."
"As for the rest, to come back to a few specific issues, Prime Minister, notably the issue of the budget, one has greater responsibility on leaving the Presidency than on entering it."
"Therefore, as regards the budget, my opinion is that we doubtless lacked boldness by not embracing the proposal for a convention we could have made on the financial resources, but the issue of own resources will be a central issue in the months ahead and I am very much counting on Belgium - which will recover, if you like, its freedom of speech, since it no longer represents all the Member States but speaks for itself - to take this matter forward."
"The second important issue is the European constituency."
"It is something that will come before the Council at some time in the future."
"I know that, in Belgium, there are some who do not want a federal constituency, but I think that it is necessary, and perhaps it is precisely because they do not want it in Belgium that Belgium wants it at European level."
"A European constituency would be extremely useful in guaranteeing what you call the 'soul' of the European Union, i.e. the fact that, there, European citizens can, quite simply, consider themselves citizens who can vote for more than national representatives."
"I think it is a very important issue."
"And the third issue, which has already been mentioned, is the Citizens' Initiative."
"Here too, I am very much counting on Belgium to speed up the implementation process."
"It is an important instrument alongside all the economic governance reforms and I hope that Belgium may also contribute to moving the process forward more quickly and more strongly."
"Mr President, over the past six months, Belgium has proved itself to be a worthy holder of the Presidency."
"You would not think that the incumbent Belgian Government was resigning."
"When I look at the dossiers that I am qualified to assess, the balance is positive."
"An agreement on the regulation of risk capital, a regulation on the supervision of financial markets and a budget for 2011."
"I am very familiar with both Belgium and Europe."
"European politics is, as it were, an extension of Belgian politics, with a greater purpose."
"It involves the search for compromises through conversations and long lunches and, if necessary, a bit of gentle cajoling in the interests of achieving a result."
"There are some who therefore say that Belgium is Europe in miniature."
"That is exactly where the danger for Europe now lies, because the Belgian system is itself no longer able to keep functioning on compromises."
"There is not even a successor to Mr Leterme in the pipeline."
"If Belgium is the future of Europe, then we must ask ourselves: why is the Belgian system coming to an end?"
"The explanation for this, in my view, is that Belgium has created a transfer economy which is no longer affordable."
"In the name of solidarity, we created a cash flow from Flanders to Wallonia and Brussels, but, Mr Barroso, if solidarity is all one way, then people become alienated from one another and that is what we are now witnessing in Belgium."
"At the moment, we in Europe are busy planting a transfer economy."
"You have been doing this and, as a result, the euro has already been misused."
"Now we are faced with a call for eurobonds."
"Mr Verhofstadt calls for that on a daily basis."
"Look also at the Euro Emergency Fund, which is beginning to resemble a Ponzi scheme."
"First, it was temporary, then it was permanent, and now we have to keep pumping more and more money into it."
"One of the casualties of this will be competitiveness, as foreign investments in Europe will decline."
"Those who want to see the Europe of tomorrow should look at the Belgium of today!"
"Then we might imagine Germany in the role of Flanders, saying: 'We no longer want to keep paying for everybody else'."
"Some of you will laugh at this, but that danger is closer than you think."
"Let this be a wake-up call for all of us."
"Mr Leterme, I have always had a great deal of respect for you."
"I wish you every success in whatever it is that you go on to do, but I fear that Belgium will retain you in your current post for a while yet."
"Mr President, Mr Leterme, while I fully acknowledge that you assumed the Presidency of the European Union in the very difficult context of the crisis, you nonetheless intimated that you would make social issues one of your priorities and announced a statute to protect public services."
"You did nothing about this."
"Not only was there no initiative to protect services of general interest, but today, under the strengthened Stability Pact, we are entering a worrying spiral where, in order to reduce the debt of Member States, the vultures of the financial markets and of their rating agencies are driving Member States to sell off their public goods, which are, however, an asset for justice and equality."
"As for social issues, all the vigilance of Parliament was required to ward off the increase in working time for lorry drivers or the so-called 'single permit' project, expanded version, of the Bolkestein Directive."
"We were in the European Year for Combating Poverty."
"There is not one single poor person fewer in the European Union; there are more and more!"
"And it has to be recognised that the anti-crisis measures are ineffective because they dissipate social rights."
"The strategy adopted continuously entails reassuring the creditors of Member States that are heavily indebted because of a reduction in taxation on capital and a decline in growth due to a fall in purchasing power and austerity - a word that I heard mentioned for the first time by Mr Barroso."
"And, to that end, you now want to check the budgets of the Member States a priori in the place of national parliaments."
"You surreptitiously initiated a review of the European treaties, which you told us yesterday were inviolable."
"Yet you continuously refused to initiate a debate on the setting up of a social and environmental development fund financed by a tax on capital movements and the upward harmonisation of taxation on capital, on the creation of money by the European Central Bank for the repurchase of the debt of Member States, and on the development of public services that are crucial for justice and social progress."
"At the start of your Presidency, you said, Prime Minister, that you wanted a sober Presidency, and this was very much to your credit."
"However, during your Presidency, it has to be recognised that the financial markets and the large shareholders have been satisfied."
"The people themselves are increasingly living in poverty."
"Mr President, I should like to start by wishing everyone, especially the Commission, the Bureau and all the members, a Happy New Year, in a year that looks set to be a very difficult year."
"I should like, in passing, to comment in response to the gauntlet thrown down by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, who said that we shall need, through global economic governance, to help him prove what Europe is."
"It is a single economic, cultural and perhaps also political force."
"That is why we must all support the Commission, so that Europe continues to be a major force."
"As far as the Belgian Presidency is concerned, it is generally admitted that it was a very successful Presidency."
"I should like to add two points to what has already been said, which were not mentioned here and which underline the success of the Belgian Presidency."
"First of all, Belgium functioned in a completely European way; in other words, it followed the Commission's and the European Parliament's agenda."
"The presidencies usually add national issues."
"Belgium set a good example, demonstrating that we are Europe and we follow the agenda set by the Commission."
"It had no ambition to add its own agenda."
"The second commendable point of the Belgian Presidency was the model it applied; the model of trialogue and tripartite cooperation between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission."
"My congratulations to my fellow Members."
"(NL) Mr President, Mr Leterme, you have received a considerable number of compliments on how the Belgian Presidency has conducted itself, and that is understandable."
"The European Commission and Parliament are relieved that the Belgian Presidency is over and that no major accidents have happened."
"Indeed, an artificial country with no government, a country which is not even capable of governing itself, is hardly the obvious candidate for taking over the Presidency of the EU."
"One could, of course, say that you and the ministers have had plenty of time to deal with the Presidency, given that you were only running a caretaker government."
"One could say that you have benefited from diplomats who have done their job well and that the importance of the rotating Presidency has decreased since the Treaty of Lisbon."
"All that might be true, but I think that your best decision was to heed the advice of Vlaams Belang and, in particular, to adopt a low profile."
"You could have made the same mistakes as the previous Belgian Presidency in 2001."
"Just consider the failed 'praline summit' in Brussels, the build-up of diplomatic blunders and what has become known as the Laeken Declaration which ultimately led to the debacle of the European Constitution."
"Of course, it is not the case that the Belgian Presidency has achieved a clear round: first, there was the incident where the socialist Minister for Pensions, Daerden, chaired the Council of Ministers in a state of inebriation - Commissioner Andor's face speaks volumes; the Flemish taxpayer and net payers are no longer able to laugh at this, in the knowledge that this character is now responsible for their pensions."
"Furthermore, there were the desperate attempts by the Foreign Minister, Mr Vanackere, to open a new chapter in Turkey's accession negotiations, at any cost and against the will of the people, when Turkey should not even be being considered for negotiation."
"(ES) Mr President, I am not going to emphasise what has already been said."
"The Belgian Presidency has been excellent."
"I would like to mention two highlights: financial supervision and the European Semester."
"Regarding these highlights, I would like to say what has been done and, most importantly, what needs to be done."
"In terms of financial supervision, in the space of 48 hours, the Minister, Mr Reynders, managed to get a dossier that was in deadlock moving, and we were able to give the Council and the Commission what the Commission had asked of us: European authorities that could begin operating on 1 January 2011: strong, authentically European authorities with clout."
"What happened next is not very reassuring."
"We still do not have presidents for the authorities; we have an extraordinarily small budget and I am told that the rewards for those who are going to hold positions in these authorities are not brilliant."
"They are, of course, much less brilliant than the bonuses received by bankers in London."
"There are two matters that still need to be dealt with: the regulation of the systemic bodies, and contributions and taxes on banking."
"In the regulation of systemic bodies, we want the European authority to be responsible for supervision, through the national authorities, which, in this case, would act as agents and would be subject to the instructions of the European authority."
"The alternative would not make sense."
"In terms of taxation, the most recent offering from Commissioner Šemeta sets out all the possible taxes for banks."
"Parliament has already adopted two contributions: the contribution to the coordinated guarantee funds and the contribution to the banking stability funds."
"This is a fact, and next we will be able to discuss the tax on banking or taxes on banking transactions, because, I stress, the rest is a fact."
"In terms of the European Semester, the only thing that we want is to coordinate with everything: with Eurobonds, with project bonds, with the mechanism, etc. ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(NL) Mr President, I risk repetition."
"To be honest with you, this has been a somewhat uneventful debate, but also one that we can take pride in, and so I happily join my fellow Members' chorus of praise for the Belgian Presidency."
"Yves, your team, your ministers, and also your political and diplomatic corps have done a fantastic job."
"I was able to experience this first-hand."
"I have had the joy and pleasure of participating in two trialogues on the environment and - no, you must not let this go to your head, though this time you will receive a little praise - here I wish to compliment you on the intelligent way in which you have discharged the Presidency."
"However, I have a major and a minor 'but' to add to those words of praise."
"My first 'but' has to do with social policy; in my opinion, we have made progress on a number of social dossiers."
"Nevertheless, we have to be honest and say - and I am not laying this at the Belgian Presidency's door, but at that of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion - that European interest in these issues is not great."
"We have not made any real progress in legislative matters, when it comes to the European minimum income, for instance, and thus there is still a lot of work to be done."
"My second 'but' has to do with the role which the Belgian Presidency has played in the post-Lisbon period."
"I have received congratulations from Messrs Verhofstadt and Dehaene, two former prime ministers who are exceptionally knowledgeable about institutional matters."
"There is, however, a downside to that role, especially the Belgian Presidency's lack of political leadership on some really critical dossiers."
"There was some sitting back and doing nothing and Mr Van Rompuy ought to have taken the lead on this matter."
"I am referring to the debate on economic governance and to the debate on the debt crisis in the European Union."
"Other Heads of Government - not to mention Prime Minister Merkel and President Sarkozy - did take on these issues."
"This, in my view, led to limited results at the last Council, because of the debt crisis, amongst other reasons."
"In the past, the Belgian Presidency did assume political leadership and I would hope that the next government will indeed assume that leadership of the European Union."
"Mr President, we make laws together but, too often, we do not know how those laws get applied by Member States."
"You have taken the lead in making clear that this Parliament supports the Commission in wanting to see correlation tables included in all future legislation."
"The Belgian Presidency has been very helpful in tabling a paper to the Council, in which it promotes the use of correlation tables, emphasising that they help clarity and transparency and will make the application of EU law quicker and more effective."
"I think that a period of reflection on the matter has been initiated."
"Prime Minister, I wonder if, in your concluding remarks, you could tell us what sort of response you have had to that paper and whether the Belgian Government, in its role as part of the troika and within the Council, will continue to press for the inclusion of correlation tables."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have one minute to applaud the Belgian Presidency."
"The balance may generally be positive, but I suppose I would pat everybody equally on the back."
"In my view, thankfully, Commissioners Potočnik and Hedegaard had a strong presence, in terms of content, at the major biodiversity conference in Nagoya on biodiversity and the climate change conference in Cancún."
"It has been said - and it has sometimes been intended as a joke - that the Belgian Presidency did well because they had heaps of time and were able to focus all their energy on the Presidency."
"For example, Mr Verhofstadt said that it was the first time that Europe had had a full-time government."
"I would agree with that."
"However, we cannot ignore the fact that there were a lot of people standing behind those teams, that they had a diplomatic service behind them which was well-prepared, well-informed and who used their incredible talent for negotiation to ensure that this was a successful Presidency."
"Mr Leterme, tomorrow, the Golden Shoe prize will be awarded in Belgium."
"If I were to present the Golden Shoe to the Belgian Presidency, to the best actor in the Belgian Presidency, then it would, without any doubt, go to the Belgian diplomatic staff, to the people who are seated behind you and who have ensured that you, your team and the regional government have indeed done a cracking job."
"(PL) Mr President, it goes without saying that I would like to add to the words of congratulation and the compliments regarding what happened during the Belgian Presidency."
"However, as I listen to this debate, two rather important questions arise."
"Is it really the case that during the Belgian Presidency, everyone in Europe forgot about national interests and focused only on those interests determined by institutions in Brussels and supported by the Belgian Government?"
"This certainly was not the case."
"We have been watching events in Europe over the last six months and it can be seen clearly that just because a Presidency does not make reference to national interests, it does not mean they do not exist."
"And a second thing, which is, perhaps, the most fundamental and the greatest doubt in this whole debate: it would not be a good thing if we contrasted what we are calling here European objectives with what we are calling national ones."
"After all, the national goals that we are talking about are ideas that come from specific countries."
"This is a specific contribution without which Europe would be far worse off."
"We cannot impose a standard in which these goals, which are formulated in specific Member States but for Europe, are not treated as an asset but as a problem."
"Mr President, may I ask the Prime Minister for his attention, please."
"I am here, on your left, Mr Prime Minister."
"I need to have a frank conversation with you."
"I have a text in Portuguese but I am going to improvise in English because that was the language you used in what, for me, was the most important part of your speech, when you said: 'look at refugees."
"Look at the refugees if you think that war and peace is not important for Europe'."
"You were addressing the new generations."
"I have to admit that my heart jumped when you said that, because I am the European Parliament rapporteur for refugees."
"During your Presidency, you could have done more than look at refugees."
"You could have done something to help; it was not difficult."
"The Council could have finished the codecision procedure which Parliament started on resettlement of refugees."
"In our part of the codecision, we increased the money that we give to Member States to resettle refugees; we established categories of priorities for people who have been raped, who have been tortured and who have diseases, and who are waiting in camps to be resettled."
"The Council has not completed the codecision."
"It seems that it was because of Article 290 and delegated acts - something which is in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"You say: 'look at refugees'."
"But I challenge you to do what we did, go to the al-Hol camp in Syria."
"Then tell refugees to look at Article 290, look at delegated acts."
"They will say: 'what are you talking about?"
"My kids are not going to school; I do not have a passport; we are stuck in a refugee camp; why are you talking about a minor institutional problem when you could have done something to help our problem?'"
"This will tarnish the Belgian Presidency. I am sorry to say this;"
"I say it in sadness."
"(NL) Mr President, I would like to join in the tributes which my fellow Members have been paying here to the Belgian Presidency and to you, Mr Prime Minister, because, at a time when the way in which your country's cabinet was formed was causing deep consternation for many businesses, you truly managed to draw on the European spirit to make this Presidency fully functional."
"In my view, you are selling yourself short by calling yourself a 'facilitator', for you have been the driving force and have managed to overcome differences, including those which you have had with this Parliament, in a creative and committed fashion."
"Thanks to you, we now have robust European supervision, a directive regulating alternative investment funds and also the Eurovignette, another difficult bargaining chip which has ended with a clear Council conclusion."
"However, from the European spirit which infused your speech here in Parliament, I can see that you are also looking ahead."
"I would like to emphasise one point in your speech, in particular."
"You rightly say that economic governance should not result in a situation where we are merely treating the symptoms without doing anything about the risk which is still out there because, while a robust Stability and Growth Pact might well become a reality, it is only one mainstay of that economic governance."
"What we want for our citizens is for us to be able to come out the other end of this economic crisis altogether and again be in a position to create jobs for our citizens and young people and, in order to do that, we need robust European macro-economic supervision and a very strong European 2020 strategy."
"Will the European Semester really make that happen?"
"Will Member States commit themselves to fleshing out economic governance in this area as well?"
"As Parliament, we should take full advantage of our colegislative role in the governance package, the legislative package, in order to make that a reality."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Leterme, when you presented the programme of the Belgian Presidency last July, I said to you, in welcoming you and in jest, that you would perhaps still be there in January to present the outcome to us."
"I have to say that I had hoped I would be wrong and, without wishing to offend you, Prime Minster, like all Belgians, I would have liked to have before me today the Head of Government duly elected at the ballot box on 13 June."
"However, you were the one who had to take on this Presidency, and I congratulate you and all the ministers of the present government."
"Now, let us leave aside the internal political situation to focus on the outcome of the Belgian Presidency."
"I, too, would like to quote a famous American, who was not a philosopher but a tennis player. Arthur Ashe said, 'One important key to success is self-confidence."
"An important key to self-confidence is preparation'."
"And it has to be recognised, without doubt, that the Belgian Presidency drew inspiration from this."
"In respect of the issues I am dealing with here alone, I have seen a great deal of progress: closer cooperation in divorce matters; the European protection order for the victims of violence; future enhanced cooperation for patents, and the agreement on the Late Payment Directive and on the labelling of foodstuffs are all successes that the Belgian Presidency can take pride in."
"The same is true of the common agricultural policy (CAP) after 2013."
"Though there is as yet no agreement, the principle of a strong CAP with two pillars and the principle of simplification have already been accepted."
"What agriculture is most in need of in the future, however, is regulation that manages to contain the volatility of the markets within certain limits."
"Yet there is still no agreement on this and I have grave concerns in respect of future presidencies, notably Hungary and Poland, since regulation does not seem to be one of their priorities."
"Apart from good preparation, the full involvement of ministers, the effectiveness of diplomats and of Belgian officers, the secret of the Presidency, which you have emphasised, was not to impose its own agenda but to commit itself to current priority issues, at European level, and to make every effort to move them forward, thanks to the pragmatism and the culture of compromise that characterise us."
"I hope that future presidencies will learn from this example."
"(DA) Mr President, I would also like to thank the Belgian Presidency for its contribution, particularly in the two areas that I am most familiar with: the budget and transport."
"The fact that the budget negotiations broke down in the first round was not down to the Presidency and, of course, we did find a solution in respect of the 2011 budget."
"Let us hope, therefore, that the question of flexibility and the financing of the ITER fusion energy project will also fall into place soon."
"In the area of transport, the Belgian Presidency found a solution to the difficult issue of the Eurovignette."
"I would particularly like to thank the Belgian Presidency for supporting something that I have been working on for many years, namely, the creation of a network of safe rest areas in Europe so that lorry drivers, who literally hold Europe together and create the internal market, have good and safe conditions in which to work."
"I would like the governments of all the other countries to be inspired by the Belgian Government's positive view of this matter so that we can at last get something to happen in practice."
"(PL) Mr President, Belgium, which is one of the six founding states of the European Union, has recently ended its six-month Presidency."
"Despite domestic political difficulties connected with not being able to form a government, the Belgians are officially being praised for their effectiveness and success in achieving almost all the priorities they had earlier set themselves."
"For this reason, I would like to join in congratulating them because, in such a short period of time and as part of the priorities set out, they faced up to the economic crisis in Europe, protected Europe's environment, built an open and secure European Union, built a coherent social model in the European Union and provided the foundations for a common EU foreign policy."
"It is rare in history that such a small country, in such a short time, has done so much for the benefit of Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, Prime Minister Leterme, when, six months ago, the Members of this House had so many questions about the Belgian Presidency and when we had read the programme, many Members were still full of doubt."
"Today, as we offer our thanks to you, but also to the permanent representation, for your outstanding work and preparation, our pleasure is therefore that much greater."
"Obviously, your success was not an easy one."
"The domestic political problems in Belgium have already been mentioned, and Mr Verhofstadt also had to observe that there is not necessarily efficiency at the national level in Belgium or at the European level."
"Perhaps that is the key to success tomorrow, too - in other words, that the politicians who are competent here need to achieve the necessary recognition in Belgium, too."
"Your success was not easy, as the external conditions, too, were not the best."
"This was not least because - and I can say this, speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) in relation to transport - you also did not choose the easiest subjects to deal with."
"It has been mentioned, and for us it was more than satisfying, that the issue of the Eurovignette, amongst other subjects, was resolved. This issue is not just about a principle."
"In my view, it is about new funding sources and safe, clean but also efficient mobility at the European level."
"This is about seeing whether we will be able, tomorrow, to more vigorously readjust this area - mobility - at European level."
"As someone who lives in a border area, clearly I am also pleased about the implementation of the road safety provisions."
"For us, and in every border region, it is unacceptable that it is the licence plate that determines whether or not a serious offence is punished."
"You have grabbed this awkward subject by the horns and taken a first step."
"The passenger rights for bus transport represent an important step with the effect that Europe has now given its citizens passenger rights across all the various forms of transport."
"During the volcano crisis, we observed how important it is for businesses, but also for passengers, that a European framework of this kind should be in place."
"I hope that we can continue in this way."
"Finally, I wish just one thing for you and for Belgium, and that is that we finally get to see the proficiency at Federal level in Belgium that you have shown at European level following the sound thinking that whoever has to make demands - as you did - must also demonstrate solutions."
"(ES) Mr President, Mr Leterme, on behalf of those in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament responsible for employment and social affairs, I would like to join my fellow Members in congratulating the Belgian Presidency on the last six months."
"How is it possible that I can join in those congratulations, despite the fact that you scarcely mentioned the social dimension and that there is not a great deal of social stocktaking in the Belgian Presidency?"
"Quite simply, Mr Leterme, because I have had the privilege of working with your ministers, Mrs Onkelinx and Mrs Milquet, and I am aware of the efforts made by them and their teams to make progress with a social agenda in such difficult circumstances and in a Council that is so insensitive to the social Europe as the one that we unfortunately currently have."
"Despite this, they have worked valiantly, responsibly and with a highly pro-European spirit to ensure that Parliament is heard and that Europeans are heard at this very serious time when Europe's future is at stake."
"I therefore also join in congratulating you, Mr Leterme, and I hope that in future, when the challenges come, what you have said will be true: that Europe will find its soul."
"That soul needs to be a political and social soul, not just an economic one."
"I would like to mention a few matters that have not been resolved during your Presidency, on which I hope that you will pass on your pro-European, humanist spirit to the Hungarian Presidency, because a lot is at stake for the future of Europe."
"I am referring to the matters relating to Europe's immigration policy, the single permit, the two directives on temporary workers and transfers within a company."
"President-in-Office of the Council, please tell your colleagues to take a long-term view."
"There cannot be unequal treatment of workers who come to Europe."
"There needs to be equal treatment, otherwise we will open up a gap that will have incalculable consequences for the future of the Union."
"It cannot be that these workers arrive in Europe under unequal conditions with regard to working here, because we will be destroying Europe."
"I hope that in the next six months, the Hungarian Presidency will listen to you and you will be able to regain freedom of speech in the Council, and that the Council will focus on Europe's soul, which can only be a humanist soul and a soul of progress."
"(IT) Mr President, Mr Leterme, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that I am pleased to have had a Presidency that has proved able to manage the European agenda in a pragmatic and effective way, albeit at a difficult time."
"From the adoption at first reading of the recast of the directive on combating late payment in public administration, which is fundamental to the future of the system of undertakings, to the adoption of the financial supervision package, the Belgian Presidency has proved to be both practical and dynamic."
"I could cite other examples, but I prefer to draw conclusions about what can be learnt from a Presidency that has concluded its term of office in a positive way."
"Firstly, one has to have a realistic work programme; secondly, one has to be able to negotiate dynamically and reach compromises; and, lastly, one has to fully involve the European institutions, starting with Parliament, and take an approach to outstanding issues that is free from constraints and national interests."
"I hope that this Presidency will serve as an example to the others that follow it."
"For now though, I offer it my most sincere congratulations."
"(FR) Mr President, Prime Minister, we worked very well with your ministers, Joëlle Milquet and Laurette Onkelinx, so that the voice of the European Parliament could be heard when the employment guidelines were adopted by the Council, where our positions were taken into account, but also on the issue of public services, with the role that these services play at the heart of the European social model being reaffirmed during your Presidency."
"I hope that the impetus given to the interinstitutional dialogue can continue both in the work of the Commission and in the work of the new Presidency."
"There is also another aspect that we worked on extensively together, which is how to ensure that the economic governance to which you referred can stand on its own two feet, because, if it treats the issue of employment as a balance, it is leading us into disaster."
"And it worries me to see the way in which the Commission, in the European Semester package, deals with this matter by proposing to Member States that they reduce salaries willy-nilly or increase, virtually blindly, the retirement age and lower the level of pensions."
"This is not the spirit in which economic governance can ensure the success of the European question, which is what our employees and our citizens are expecting."
"(DA) Mr President, I would like to say that the Belgian Presidency has been a wonderful and unrivalled example of how the EU works."
"Despite the fact that the country has not had a government, the Presidency is nevertheless receiving praise from all sides of this Chamber."
"It is perhaps a depiction of how the EU actually works best - without elected representatives and, in fact, without any people at all."
"In any case, it was during the Belgian Presidency that the greatest deception so far, the greatest betrayal of European citizens since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, became a reality, namely, the introduction of the now permanent crisis mechanism."
"When we had to convince the European people to put the Treaty of Lisbon in place, which entailed the transfer of an unprecedented amount of power to foreigners in Brussels, we were promised that one thing at least could not happen: we would never be responsible for each other's debts."
"It was during the Belgian Presidency that this one promise was broken."
"Now we have, with effect from 2013, an established act to the effect that we are to be responsible for one another's debts for ever more."
"That is the legacy of the Belgian Presidency, and it is regrettable."
"(NL) Mr President, Mr Leterme, Mrs Győri, both you and your diplomatic service have proved that we can be successful, even in very difficult economic conditions, and that we can tackle those conditions in a way that makes Europe stronger."
"That is very important."
"Obviously, this kind of thing requires that we make compromises, difficult compromises."
"That will always leave us subject to criticism but I think that, in this situation, the golden rule that 'the perfect is the enemy of the good', applies more than ever."
"This kind of compromise is always justifiable if it enables you to make progress and if it benefits the prosperity and wellbeing of our citizens."
"Mr Leterme, as I only have one minute, I will comment only briefly on the next Belgian Presidency, which will possibly hold office in 2025 or thereabouts."
"You will probably be 65 then and I will be a year older than that."
"I assume that Europe will still be a strong player on the world stage at that point but, for that to happen, we really have to keep up the momentum of the past six months."
"In any case, I wish you every success, both here and in Brussels."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Belgian colleagues, congratulations!"
"I doff my cap to you!"
"As a Hungarian, I will be very happy if the Hungarian Presidency is as successful."
"(HU) Now I should like to continue in Hungarian."
"During the Belgian Presidency, the deepening of the crisis of the euro area was successfully prevented."
"The Irish rescue package was put together at record speed."
"A system of new economic policy coordination was prepared, and the adoption of six pieces of legislation of economic governance now awaits the Hungarian Presidency."
"Financial supervision was set up, and the European External Action Service was started as well as the Citizens' Initiative."
"I can only express my fullest admiration with regard to the progress of the practical transposition of the Treaty of Lisbon, although there are countless open issues still ahead of us."
"(FR) Once again, congratulations to my Belgian colleagues."
"I hope we will have just as much success during the Hungarian Presidency."
"(RO) Mr President, while there were fears that developments in Belgian domestic politics might affect the performance of the rotating Presidency, I am pleased that Belgium proved the predictions wrong by handling the European dossiers in a pragmatic and efficient manner."
"Indeed, the flagship dossiers of the Belgian Presidency provided a series of European issues par excellence: the launch of the European External Action Service, economic growth and fiscal consolidation, the adoption of the regulation on the European Citizens' Initiative and the launch of the Europe 2020 strategy's implementation."
"As far as Romania's interests are concerned, the Belgian Presidency adopted a fair and balanced approach."
"In two sensitive dossiers for Romania, the Belgian Presidency chose the options which best reflected the position argued by Romania: the discussion of the Roma issue from the social inclusion aspect and the management of the procedure for referring to the European Parliament the draft decision on the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area."
"(SK) Mr President, I would like to begin by emphasising that Belgium assumed the rotating Presidency in a situation that was difficult not only on the internal political scene, but also, of course, on a global scale."
"I cannot therefore ascribe all of the failures of the Union to Belgium."
"On the contrary, I would like to say that Belgium made an excellent job of handling the trialogue between the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"With Belgium at the helm, progress was made in the important area of banking sector supervision and regulation - at least in part."
"In October, negotiations were completed on the regulation of hedge funds, share firms and rating agencies."
"I could imagine some even more ambitious measures in this area, but I think that Belgium succeeded in coordinating at least the things that were possible, and to achieve at least some progress."
"The area of international relations was also exceptionally important."
"The Union formulated its diplomatic service, and here, too, Belgium showed herself to be a skilful mediator."
"I would like to end by congratulating Belgium and expressing my thanks for her Presidency, and also expressing the certain hope that Hungary will follow the example of your Presidency."
"Mr President, could I raise a wider issue here?"
"At Christmas, John Bruton, a former leader of Ireland and one-time President of the Council, said that the part-time nature of the European Council is really not fit for purpose, given the extent of the crisis that Europe faces."
"He suggested that the time given to these big issues is little more than the times when leaders are on a flight to Brussels."
"He says that we are facing a financial crisis - a crisis of the welfare state in an ageing society, a crisis of globalisation of nation states and, potentially, even a crisis of the efficacy of European democracy."
"He says that leaders need to sit together until they have reached a full mutual understanding of all that needs to be done: the whole job and not just bits of it."
"Only something on that scale will give markets durable confidence."
"I would ask people to discuss this, because perhaps he is right."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, your speech, Mr Leterme, contained some important quotations; it is a shame that, in reality, you will be remembered mainly as the Prime Minister of a country that, 219 days after holding elections, was unable to form a government."
"You see, I had a bad opinion of you - although it has undoubtedly changed over time - because, on the day of your inauguration, I asked you, in your specific role as President-in-Office, what action would be taken in response to the acts committed against the Catholic Church in your country, in response to the searches that were declared null and void, which I considered to be very serious and which were subsequently condemned by the judiciary itself."
"You did not answer me."
"I did not like that, because I believe that a President should represent everyone."
"If asked a question, a President should try to answer it somehow and should make a brave decision: to say 'I am in favour' or 'I am against', and to explain why."
"You did not do that."
"Today, I can say that you and your Presidency have done a good job."
"Perhaps if you had been slightly more on our 'level' from the start, we might have had a better relationship."
"(DE) Mr President, Belgium definitely took over the Presidency of the Council in a very difficult transitional phase, as, for one thing, the economic crisis had not yet been overcome, whilst, at the same time, the Treaty of Lisbon, of course, had not yet been completely implemented, while its limited fitness for purpose also became apparent."
"In the whole debate about the euro rescue package, however, there is a significant aspect that must not be forgotten, namely, that both the rescue package for the euro area countries and the loans for Greece violate the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Both measures thus lack the necessary legal basis."
"That means that this is a clear case of the EU exceeding its competence, which ultimately makes a proper amendment procedure for the Treaty indispensable."
"After further rescue package candidates - like Ireland and Portugal - Spain, too, is a problem child for the euro area."
"On the other side of the coin, net contributors such as Germany and Austria are, by and by, becoming the cash cows of the European Union."
"Obviously, things cannot continue in this way."
"Belgium was not really able to master either of these two - admittedly difficult - challenges, namely, overcoming the economic crisis and implementing the Treaty of Lisbon."
"(PL) Mr President, many good opinions have been expressed about the Belgian Presidency, in particular, about its effectiveness in negotiations and its calm in a difficult period of crisis, the G20 summit, the Cancún conference and the budget debate."
"The financial markets' return to stability and also economic stability were dominant issues, but it should be said that national egoism went wild, in particular, as regards the budget."
"The Belgians' effectiveness in negotiations should be congratulated, but this was, after all, Belgium's twelfth Presidency."
"Prime Minister Leterme said that the Presidency's programme was the Council's and the Commission's programme, without the ambition to give it any kind of national priority."
"We do, however, have to allow future presidencies to decide their own priorities."
"It seems to me that this is the essence and spirit of integration, about which Prime Minister Leterme was speaking."
"What worries me is the crisis in adopting the 2011 budget and, in particular, the background to this and the forecast that in the future, the new financial perspective will not be negotiated easily."
"(ES) Mr President, there is at least one area that is important for Europe and for the region to which I belong - Euskadi, the Basque Country - in which you have done absolutely nothing."
"The Treaty of Lisbon gives Parliament powers relating to fisheries."
"The Council blocked several plans for anchovy fisheries."
"At the beginning of your Presidency, I personally expressed the view that I was prepared to continue with the negotiations in order to get important plans moving again, and you have made no effort to do this."
"I cannot, therefore, congratulate you, because basically, the Council does not recognise the powers that the Treaty of Lisbon gives this House."
"I believe you have wasted an opportunity to solve a problem that has been dragging on since the Spanish Presidency."
"You have not made a single move; I hope, therefore, that the next Presidency will be capable of doing so."
"I would also have thanked you for paying a little attention to my speech."
"(PT) Mr President, I, too, should like to congratulate the Belgian Government on the success of its Presidency, despite the difficult conditions under which it took place, which have also been mentioned here."
"Furthermore, in the area that I followed most closely, I should like to congratulate Mrs Milquet, and to thank her for her commitment and determination in preparing the report on the Maternity Leave Directive, despite the Council's lack of agreement with her."
"We hope that the Hungarian Presidency will attach the proper importance to this matter."
"Mr Leterme reminded us of the dream that guided the founders of the European project in addition to the single market, and Mr Barroso highlighted the importance of European spirit."
"I think that these are good points in the current context, in which we need greater unity and solidarity in order to face the challenges before us."
"(PL) Mr President, the Belgian Presidency, the last two presidencies to be precise, came at the time when the Treaty of Lisbon was being implemented and a new order was being shaped in the EU."
"Both these presidencies limited their national approach in order to deepen cooperation and coordination in the EU."
"This good path serves to strengthen a community rather than a government approach."
"On the other hand, we should be careful in limiting the role of national presidencies in creating their priorities."
"A specific balance has to function here."
"An undoubted achievement of the Belgian Presidency is the strengthening of economic governance."
"Agencies which supervise financial institutions have begun their work."
"Much has been done towards budget discipline being more rigorously observed."
"Activities aimed at structural reform have been made the main instrument of development."
"Furthermore, the impasse over approval of the 2011 EU budget has finally been overcome."
"We would simply like to say thank you."
"Mr President, I must say that it is very encouraging to hear so many Members from all sides of the House praising the Belgian Presidency, and rightly so."
"I feared the opposite."
"I think one of the reasons the Belgian Presidency is a success is because they took the realities of the Lisbon Treaty into account."
"Nowadays, there must be a seamless transfer from one Presidency to another."
"It is like a relay race: the more effective the transfer is - and the more low-profile it is - the better, probably."
"The Belgians did that exceptionally well and have given an example to other countries of how to do so in future."
"I would particularly like to thank them for their work in relation to the budget and the banking authorities and other authorities established."
"If they are as successful as we hope they will be, then the Belgian Presidency will actually grow in stature in the years ahead as we look back on these very important decisions."
"(FR) Mr President, I concur with the practically unanimous messages expressed this morning."
"Prime Minister, the Belgian Presidency was a good Presidency, because it moved the European project on in a difficult national context, which, nevertheless, did not prevent it from addressing the challenges facing Europe."
"I have in mind the adoption of the 2011 budget, certain aspects of which leave a bitter taste in our mouths."
"However, you avoided a detrimental institutional confrontation."
"As regards the social dimension, from the very outset, the Belgian Presidency was confronted with the over cautiousness of some in the Council."
"I am thinking in particular of the idea of a framework directive on minimum income."
"Despite this context, Belgium can be credited with some real progress thanks to the fighting spirit of your ministers and of our ministers: the report of the EPSCO Council before each European Council to act as a necessary counterweight to the ECOFIN Council; the conclusions on social services of general interest; pensions, notably the conference on pensions in Liège, which highlighted the necessary joint consideration of the adequacy and sustainability of pensions, which I feel bound to stress, and the EPSCO declaration on the Year for Combating Poverty."
"Congratulations once again."
"Hopefully, this progress will continue with the new presidencies."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I would ask you to carry out a survey of who is being allowed in on Catch-the-Eye and who is not."
"It seems to me that there is not a fair distribution from one part-session to another."
"I would ask you to do this because some of us, who have other duties, cannot sit in the House day in and day out, whereas other people have the opportunity to do so."
"I think there has to be a fair opportunity for Members to intervene in debate."
"I do apologise for delaying the House, but I would ask that you carry out that survey."
"Mr Mitchell, I do not want to say any more other than that I have a list and you can check the list."
"Almost 20 people on the list have the possibility to speak."
"If you wish, you can come to my office, I can show you the list and we can explain it."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, a great deal of positive evaluation and praise has been expressed in the House this morning."
"On behalf of the Commission, I would like to say that it is very well deserved."
"With its European spirit, the Belgian Presidency clearly demonstrated impressive efficiency and a very cooperative approach."
"When the Belgian Presidency took up an issue, we all knew that it would pursue the European goal - and only the European goal - and that it would do so in a spirit of loyal cooperation among the institutions."
"The Belgian Presidency's very good cooperation with the European Parliament and very close contacts with the Commission resulted in what is clearly a very impressive list of achievements."
"Today, we can say that the Lisbon Treaty is now fully operational."
"We have managed to give our citizens a new voice through the European Citizens' Initiative, and we managed to reach an agreement on more transparent and effective rules for comitology."
"I worked on both of those issues with the Secretary of State, Olivier Chastel, and I must say that I was always impressed by his cooperative spirit and high level of professionalism."
"A calm and constructive approach was needed for the conclusion of the debate on the 2011 Budget, and for the beginning of the new economic governance in Europe."
"Even in complex, protracted discussions on issues such as divorce, financial supervision and even patents, the Belgian Presidency managed to achieve clear progress."
"It is very clear now that we need to carry forward the positive spirit and efficiency of the Belgian Presidency."
"Clearly, the economy, recovering from the crisis and fiscal consolidation remain top priorities for us all."
"We received good news last week with the successful sale of Portuguese, Spanish and Italian bonds, and we saw reductions in the spreads for Belgium and other countries."
"But it is also very clear that we need to press ahead with structural reforms and that we have to work even harder."
"If we do not want to have a jobless recovery, we need to look at how we can reform our labour market rules and how we can remove the obstacles to higher employment in Europe."
"At the same time, we need to protect the vulnerable in our society and reduce poverty."
"This is the only way we can develop our social market economy in Europe."
"A lot will depend on how we start the European Semester and to what extent we will collectively be able to be ambitious in our national reform programmes, in our consolidation efforts, and in implementing the EU 2020 strategy."
"The Belgian Presidency made a major contribution to the launch of this new process of economic governance and we now have to continue the excellent work it started."
"Prime Minister, Secretary of State, I should like to thank you very much for your excellent work."
"I would also like to thank all your diplomats very much for creating a positive atmosphere in which the next Presidency can continue the work you started so successfully six months ago."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these are my last words on behalf of the Belgian Presidency, so I will be brief."
"I am delighted to see so many people here, but I know that has to do with other items on your agenda."
"(NL) Ladies and gentlemen, I, of course, wish to thank all those of you who provided very constructive feedback, which will prove invaluable in your and our work in the future."
"Let me, first and foremost, say, with regard to the European Parliament's very positive evaluation of our Presidency, that I try to stick to the principle of being serene in the face of negative feedback and of being very modest in the face of positive feedback, even if it proves to be exaggerated."
"By way of conclusion, I would like to highlight three elements."
"First of all - and this obviously goes beyond the remit of our Belgian Presidency - I think it is really important that we institute best practice as regards the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Every nation state which takes on the six-month rotating Presidency of the European Union should keep Europe particularly high on its agenda."
"Secondly, the purpose of managing the rotating Presidency is, perhaps not just acting as facilitator, but also as a driving force, as one of you said, so that our institutions can do their work."
"We all fought hard for the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It would be absurd, of course, if we managed the rotating Presidency in such a way that it failed to do justice to the letter and spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Moreover, I think that that is the only way in which the rotating Presidency will make sense in the future and any future Treaty amendments or new agreements will survive."
"Thirdly: not everything is perfect and several members have rightly pointed to some gaps."
"I would like to reiterate, in particular, that Europe ought to be more ambitious when it comes to social policy."
"(FR) What has been said is indeed correct."
"At the level of social policy, the Union must be more ambitious in the future, but I nonetheless believe that Belgium played its part."
"The Belgian Presidency strengthened the role of employment policies in the Europe 2020 strategy, it ensured that these policies would have a place in the new economic governance of Europe, and I believe that it also created the foundations for the social dimension of the Europe 2020 strategy, not only the fight against poverty, but also social cohesion."
"In response to some of the speeches, it seems to me that we have nevertheless put the issue of services of general interest on the European agenda."
"However, it is true that we need to do more and to move forward, especially at legislative level."
"As I said earlier, our Presidency is not perfect and I think that, as Mr Tavares rightly pointed out, we can do more than we are doing today at the level of refugee policy."
"(NL) By way of conclusion, I will make two final remarks, as there are other items remaining on the agenda."
"I would emphatically like to address the Belgian members of the European Parliament in general, but several of them in particular, especially two of my predecessors."
"On behalf of the Belgian Government, I would like to say that we consider the efforts we put in during the Belgian Presidency as a kind of salute to your work here."
"We have done all that we could, ladies and gentlemen, to apply the Treaty of Lisbon correctly, which is also a kind of salute to the initiatives developed since the eleventh Presidency, which oversaw the emergence of the Treaty of Laeken, and later, under important rapporteurships, with a view to implementing the spirit of Laeken in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It has rightly been pointed out that a rotating Presidency primarily relies on the commitment and achievement of a great many people around the politicians who have to take responsibility and stand in the firing line."
"I am talking about the advisers, the diplomats, about a great many people who are ultimately the ones doing the most important work."
"I would like to let Mr Staes know that, while the Golden Shoe Prize, which will be awarded in Belgium tomorrow, has always gone to people like Lukaku and Boussoufa, if it was the Belgian Presidency which was being honoured, the Golden Shoe would easily go to its diplomatic service, some of whose staff are seated here behind me."
"Finally, let me address a few words to Mr Tabajdi, and I will try to use my best Hungarian:"
"Prime Minister, thanks to you, over the last half year, we have developed new ways of cooperating at different levels between the two chambers of legislation of the European Union: between Council and the European Parliament."
"Your Presidency was a great success."
"All the best to your country and all the best to you personally."
"(Applause)"
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"31 December 2010 saw the end of a rather dull Presidency, which some people have described as lacklustre and weak."
"That was all we could have expected from a Belgian Government that has not actually existed for eight months."
"Belgian politics has not managed to set out a political plan for its own country, which is the victim of an unprecedented institutional crisis."
"I do not see how it could possibly have led such a complex entity as the European Union - itself very fragile and rickety today - with foresight and vision for the future."
"The Belgian Presidency was supposed to put Europe on the road to recovery from the economic and financial crisis."
"Yet, once again, we find ourselves tackling the speculation that threatens the very existence of the single currency, even today."
"It was the Belgian Presidency that was behind the major acceleration in the further enlargement of the EU's borders."
"As we have seen in recent years, the accession of economically weak countries has complicated the work of the European institutions and weakened the whole of Europe, which is now less capable than it was previously of shouldering the domestic problems of any new Member States."
"Belgium occupied the Presidency of the European Union for the last six months and hardly anyone there seems to have noticed."
"The country was mainly preoccupied - and what is more, unsuccessfully so - with forming a new government, while the quarrelling between the Flemings and the Walloons has rendered the country unable to make political decisions."
"It was therefore little wonder that the EU political establishment had an easy ride in its desire to push forward centralisation within the European Union."
"The euro crisis was used as a pretext to forge plans for European economic governance."
"Meanwhile, the so-called 'permanent rescue package' for the euro is nothing other than an assault on the net contributors, who will have to dig even deeper into their pockets in future."
"Belgium should actually be regarded as a cautionary example of what can happen if peoples with differing economic performances are corseted up together."
"Belgium, where the differences between the Flemings and the Walloons are evidently irreconcilable, and where the Federal apparatus represents a redistribution mechanism from the Flemings to the Walloons, shows what may befall the European Union and the euro area if they continue to follow the existing misguided path."
"In summing up the Belgian Presidency, we should, first of all, appreciate its highly active role in designing the European financial stability system."
"All of those who observed that process know that it is a difficult operation and was carried out under time pressure."
"For this reason, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to all of those who contributed to bringing the project to fruition."
"In this regard, the Belgian Presidency has left behind for the Hungarian Presidency a job well done."
"It should also be stressed that the Belgians have marked out the path for future presidencies in the context of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I would like to express the hope that future presidencies, including the Polish one, will try to set their own, clear priorities to a greater extent, while still placing them, however, within our common, European objectives."
"This method of working allows the policies of European institutions to be planned and carried out to a greater extent."
"I would like to start by congratulating the Belgian Presidency, which demonstrated outstanding abilities while leading the European Council for the last six months."
"The Belgian team can be considered all the more successful in view of the circumstances in which the country took over the Presidency."
"Firstly, this was the first Presidency which had operated on the basis of the rules introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, and secondly, the EU and its individual Member States were in an extremely difficult financial position."
"In addition, Belgium had to deal with domestic problems during its Presidency."
"In spite of it being such a difficult and demanding time, the Presidency showed how effective it could be, displaying true European style in the implementation of all measures."
"It left its domestic problems and issues to one side and concentrated on following a course of action that corresponded to the proposals of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council, and on supporting these institutions."
"The Presidency took on the role of a mediator."
"With regard to the priorities achieved by the Presidency, measures focused on combating the economic crisis deserve recognition;"
"I am thinking here, above all, of work on the next multiannual financial framework."
"The Eurovignette is a further significant achievement of the Belgian Presidency."
"Finally, I would like to say that the Belgian Presidency can serve as a good lesson for the next countries taking over the Presidency of the European Council."
"I would like to wish both the Hungarian Presidency and the Polish Presidency, which will begin in the second half of 2011, the same success."
"I would like to express my thanks to the Belgian Presidency."
"Its work, which has just come to an end, can serve as a model for the countries which will lead the work of the European Council in future."
"This is a subject particularly close to my heart in view of Poland's upcoming Presidency, which I hope will follow all the trails blazed so successfully under the Belgian Presidency."
"It is not often the case that the country holding the Presidency puts Community measures before domestic interests."
"In my opinion, the key success of the Presidency we are discussing was its consistent implementation of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, in particular, at the level of the European Council, which became a full institution with a permanent President, and at the level of the Foreign Affairs Council, which is currently headed by the High Representative."
"Combating the economic crisis also proved to be a matter of no little significance, and the systematic monitoring and moderation of the financial sector will make it possible, over time, to restore its tarnished reputation."
"This is particularly important at a time when there is so much pressure to extend the euro area."
"To sum up, I sincerely hope that the path mapped out during the Belgian Presidency will serve as a quality standard for the countries taking over future presidencies."
"May the good of the Community always be our priority. Thank you."

"(PL) Mr President, the building industry constitutes a very important branch of the economy of every country."
"Such an essential part of the market cannot be overlooked when striving for economic growth and an improvement in living standards."
"Everyone is aware of the importance of a correctly built or modernised structure for security and comfort."
"At the same time, we are all striving to reduce the costs of building homes, industrial and public buildings."
"The report aims to remove market barriers, enable the effective sale of building materials and ensure competitive prices in the sector."
"The benefits of this initiative will be felt throughout Europe."
"I lend my full support, too, to the author's proposals regarding increasing employee safety in the industry."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the Stihler report, it is clear what an important role the construction sector plays in Europe."
"We simply had to tackle the problems faced by 12 million citizens directly employed in this sector."
"The Stihler report is a valuable tool for bringing down the national administrative and technical barriers that prevent the marketing of construction products within the European Union and for continuing to build a single market in this sector."
"I support the recognition given to small and medium-sized enterprises in the construction sector, just as I support the particular attention paid to the need to recycle construction products, which is an issue of the utmost importance in the fight against climate change."
"However, I would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to the issue of the health and safety of workers employed in the construction sector."
"The guidelines that the rapporteur has included on this matter are useful, but they need to be expanded upon."
"It is our duty to discuss and develop these proposals further in the immediate future, thereby ensuring that workers employed in the construction sector receive a high level of protection."
"The tragedy of work-related deaths is an issue that concerns the whole of Europe."
"I hope that, through our work, we will be able to put a stop to them."
"(FI) Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mrs Stihler for this excellent report."
"It is very important to focus attention on the harmonisation of the marketing of construction products, because in the future, we will need better and higher quality construction."
"We need to remember that, although this is a highly competitive industry, what is most important is not the competition in itself, but the end result."
"It is important that the buildings which are constructed in Europe are safe for their users and that they are also safe for the builders and other employees during the construction process."
"It is very important that we also have harmonisation in the area of the marketing of construction products, and, as a result, are able to exchange best practices."
"It is true that in many countries in Europe at present, they still use materials which are not healthy for residents."
"For example, we have a huge problem with mildew in many Member States of the European Union, and that is why it is important to use best practices and innovations to try to make the marketing of construction products one that relates to products that are healthy and satisfactory as far as their users are concerned."
"I therefore want to thank Mrs Stihler for this excellent report."
"Europe needs good construction products and a system of marketing that takes account of the safety regulations specifically."
"Mr President, last week, the French Prime Minister came to London and said that we needed to join in the project of assisting the euro."
"Let us leave aside for a moment the question of whether we should again be dragged into somebody else's problem; let us focus instead on the main logical flaw here."
"He says 'European integration is not working, so let us have more European integration!'"
"I am sure that you can spot the problem in his reasoning here."
"'My dinghy keeps capsizing, so I would like to be put in charge of an ocean liner'."
"'My go-kart has crashed, so please put me at the wheel of an articulated lorry'."
"It seems that whatever the problem is, the answer is always closer European integration."
"The EU is a solution in search of a problem, but surely the day is coming when we can no longer impose ourselves both on the markets and on public opinion."
"The spell is breaking and the shamanistic incantations are losing their force."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid, when you consider that its contribution represents more than 40% of all international humanitarian assistance."
"The Union's humanitarian policy is the practical expression of its commitment to supporting people in third countries in need of assistance when they are at their most vulnerable."
"The European Consensus on humanitarian aid, signed on 18 December by the Presidents of the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament and the Commission, represents a significant step forward."
"I must point out here that the commitments derived from the Consensus apply both to the Member States and to the European Commission."
"In recent years, we have seen non-humanitarian bodies increasingly involved in the response to humanitarian crises."
"It is essential that political bodies and military or humanitarian organisations active in the same working environment should learn more about one another and engage in dialogue, while having regard to - and not compromising - their respective roles and remits."
"Obviously, when civil protection resources are used, it must be in accordance with the international guidelines as set out in the European Consensus."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the report adopted today - for which I thank and congratulate the rapporteur Mrs Striffler - is a text that will make for more effective and consistent humanitarian aid."
"The European Parliament is today inviting the Union to cooperate more closely in order to reach a consensus aimed at strengthening our collective response to humanitarian crises and, in particular, at strongly upholding full compliance with international humanitarian law."
"We must ensure, therefore, that humanitarian aid and humanitarian aid workers have better access to populations in need, and as there are more of these populations these days, we must succeed in doing even more than we have done so far, through the Commission or through bilateral programmes."
"While the needs are huge, the distribution of aid is becoming increasingly difficult and also risky and dangerous due to the increasingly complex international framework."
"In view of these requirements, therefore, this agreement promotes a European consensus in which it is affirmed that EU aid is based unequivocally on the humanitarian principles of neutrality, independence and impartiality and must be provided quickly and effectively to crisis victims on the basis of identified need."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dramatic increase in the number and severity of natural disasters, together with the rising incidence of complex crises, mean that we are faced with worsening violations of international humanitarian law and a shrinking 'humanitarian space'."
"The recent tragedies in Haiti and Pakistan demonstrate once again that the tools available to the EU for responding to natural disasters need to be improved."
"I agree with the general approach of the report and, in particular, with the statement that the European Union must promote humanitarian principles unstintingly."
"The external action of the European Union is provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon; it should reflect the Union's political weight and influence as the main international donor."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Striffler's report because I agree that it is essential for us to work on strengthening implementation of the European Consensus and the associated action plan, as well as worldwide coordination and burden sharing, taking into account the regional responsibilities of the countries who have the capacity to be major contributors of humanitarian aid."
"Mr President, I had great pleasure in voting for this particular report, because the report confirms that food security is a basic human right."
"The agricultural sector must meet a growing population's need for safe and sufficient food despite the obstacles of limited natural resources, high energy prices and climate change."
"According to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation, food production must increase by at least 70% to meet the growing demands of a world population which is expected to exceed 9 billion by the year 2050."
"Furthermore, around 900 million people worldwide are chronically hungry due to extreme poverty, while up to 2 billion people lack genuine long-term food security due to varying degrees of poverty."
"In Europe, 16% of citizens still live below the poverty line."
"Basically, what I am saying is this: we need to tackle this issue head-on."
"It is essential that the financing of the new common agricultural policy after 2013 recognises this, and the very least we need is that the budget should be maintained at least at its current level."
"(DA) Mr President, Parliament has today chosen to formally recognise agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security."
"This is something that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have recognised for many years."
"Likewise, we also recognise the fact that agriculture is a strategic sector when it comes to food quality, public health and sustainable, economic growth."
"However, this does not justify school fruit and milk programmes."
"Nor does it justify more market-supported milk subsidy programmes."
"We would like to point out that we voted against these proposals and we regret the fact that they were voted through."
"However, this must not destroy the overall picture, which is the fact that we must provide good conditions for agriculture."
"Butter mountains, wine lakes and school programmes are not the way forward, however."
"Farmers' income will not be secured by intervention and distortion of the market."
"Instead, we must invest in research and give farmers the opportunity to use new technologies for alternative forms of income."
"Overall, we consider the report to be good, and therefore we voted in favour of it as a whole."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, food security is a basic human right, and it is achieved only when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient food."
"The new EU common agricultural policy must reflect these new requirements: it therefore needs to respond clearly and unequivocally to food security and other challenges, most notably climate change, the economic crisis and keeping territorial balance within the EU."
"We need to promote not only the competitiveness of our products, but also traditional agriculture, small-scale farming, organic farming and local distribution."
"These models of agriculture have always made, and continue to make, a valid contribution to food security because they often represent the most effective way of utilising land in diverse geographical regions of the EU through the use of methods which have been specifically developed in distinct regions over long periods of time."
"(PL) Mr President, our role as Members of the European Parliament is to act to improve the lives of EU citizens."
"Ensuring them access to safe food of the highest quality should be a top priority."
"Food shortages and high prices are usually accompanied by social unrest and we cannot allow this situation to occur on our continent."
"Taking into account growing population numbers, climate change and natural disasters, global food security is under threat."
"Many people are already starving, and in order to find a remedy, a sensible and just common agricultural policy is required as well as financial support for the sector."
"Agriculture should be given a special status which will allow special action to be taken and appropriate instruments to be applied in the event that food crises occur."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, food security and a guaranteed supply of food for populations continue to be the main challenges for agriculture, not only in Europe but also worldwide."
"I am very satisfied with the contents of this report, in particular, because food security is recognised as a fundamental human right."
"Food security as an objective will be achieved only if two important issues - market and price volatility and dwindling food stocks - are given serious consideration."
"Europe has to be able to intervene with common and effective measures to guarantee food supply and prevent the serious asymmetries that still exist in relation to safety standards between EU and non-EU products."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to say that I was very pleased by the report on recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security as this puts the significance of the rural economy back at the centre of things."
"The first conclusion, for me, is that we also continue to need a strong European common agricultural policy."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur."
"There was one point where I did not vote with the report, however, and this concerned the creation of a European food aid programme within the European Union."
"I believe that providing aid on the ground, in other words, aid to ensure that no one in the European Union should suffer from hunger, must remain the responsibility of the Member States, quite simply because such problems should be solved where they occur, namely, in the Member States."
"Mr President, this report highlights the need for food security for the citizens whom we represent."
"It also emphasises the important public goods which farmers produce, often with little or no recognition."
"However, I feel that there is going to be a problem."
"I have recently heard major speeches which indicate that the common agricultural policy should actually shift to being an environmental policy."
"This I think will ultimately lead us to mistakenly believe that we can do without European farmers, and maybe just import food from outside of the EU."
"This should not be the case."
"Our farmers should be supported to produce food in a way which is not harmful to the environment, and as for importing food, world markets are simply too volatile - both in terms of price and in terms of consistency of supply."
"There are a number of things that we must do."
"We must have a strong budget for the common agricultural policy."
"We must encourage young farmers into the industry to secure a future for it."
"We must have more research and innovation to make production methods more efficient, and we must have less red tape - and certainly no green tape to tie up our farmers."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent weeks, the various parliamentary committees that are dealing with the issue of the common agricultural policy have been looking into the matter of the post-2013 reform."
"Clearly, food security is one of the fundamental elements of agriculture."
"This consideration must therefore be viewed in the light of the report being put to the vote today, in which food security is defined as a fundamental right that must accordingly be safeguarded in every possible way."
"Such attention is required, Mr President, whenever there is an emergency, such as that linked to the dioxin scandal that we are witnessing at the moment, with the discovery that dioxin is being used in animal feed, but also, and above all, to ensure that we have a common production process that respects the production sector as a whole, that respects the quality of farmers' work, the environment and marketing, and hence, that respects consumers."
"This report forms part of a set of measures that this House has developed to promote agriculture, and I can therefore say that I am satisfied."
"(HU) Mr President, nowadays, the world's food production is facing different challenges to an increasing extent."
"One such challenge is climate change, which unfortunately may cause unpredictable food shortages, and thus endanger the satisfaction of the growing demand of the world's population, estimated to reach more than 9 billion by 2050."
"The common agricultural policy must react unequivocally to challenges posed by food safety, climate change and economic crisis."
"Not only competitiveness, but also traditional agriculture, small-scale and organic farming, and local values must be encouraged."
"As a result of climate changes, there are more and more natural disasters, which will have the effect of reducing the possibility of using large areas of agricultural land, thus jeopardising food safety."
"To achieve the above objectives, and in the interest of rational food prices and a fair income for agricultural producers, the CAP budget must be maintained at least at its current level."
"For this reason, it is important to handle agriculture as a strategic sector from the point of view of food safety."
"This is why I, too, supported this report."
"(FI) Mr President, first, I want to say that it is excellent that the European Parliament recognises agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security."
"It is very important for us to ensure that the food that we produce in the European Union is, above all, safe and free from impurities."
"I am rather worried that we tend to pay more attention to quantity than quality."
"The insistence on efficiency has somehow overlooked these health requirements."
"When we talk about food security, it is very important to ensure that the food which is made available to European consumers is safe, good quality and nutritious."
"It is also crucially important to ensure that the various Member States of the European Union preserve their own agricultural practices."
"When we face natural disasters, it is important that we have a farming economy that is selfsufficient."
"In this way, we can use the principle of the sourcing of local food to respond to the issues that may arise when disaster strikes."
"I wish to stress, above all, the importance of these principles, which derive from considerations of health and are important."
"I hope that we will see more of this trend in local food."
"It is important all over Europe to ensure that agriculture is absolutely viable and that every Member State of the European Union is able to practise farming."
"It is vital and a strong basis for the future, which we need specifically in the food sector."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having voted firmly in favour of this important report, I would like to emphasise, in particular, paragraph 35 of the well-structured opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety which, in considering that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has a major role to play in the assessment of all risks associated with the food chain as part of a set of measures designed to protect the health and wellbeing of the public, hopes that all Member States will set up corresponding national bodies to collaborate with the EFSA."
"As the recent serious events in Germany demonstrate, national food safety bodies need to be set up today by all the Member States."
"It is surprising that the Italian Government, after establishing the Agency, has changed its mind for budgetary reasons."
"In my view, food safety should not fall by the wayside because of budgetary constraints."
"Written explanations of vote"
"Since, according to the Consultative Working Party of Parliament's legal services, the Council and the Commission, the proposal in question contains a codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance, I agree with their adoption at first reading."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this report and the European Commission's proposal, because I believe that it is very important to simplify and clarify Community law so as to make it clearer and more accessible to all citizens."
"This aim cannot be achieved so long as numerous provisions that have been amended several times, often quite substantially, remain scattered, and considerable research work, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules."
"The codification of legislation is particularly important in the field of business, which, in order to ensure the smooth and continuous free movement of people, goods and services, is regulated by a significant amount of Community legislation."
"The consolidation of legislation regulating mergers of public limited liability companies is a welcome step towards improving Community legislation."
"There are very many companies in Europe; they come in very many different forms and are subject to very many rules."
"However, since 1978, European legislation has been in place to regulate mergers of public limited liability companies from the same Member State."
"It is important to regulate these mergers because they may significantly affect the interests of the employees, shareholders and creditors of those companies. They may be adversely affected, for example, if the merger is subsequently cancelled."
"On this European matter as on others, we need clarity and legal certainty."
"This is what we are trying to achieve with the codification of this directive."
"I voted for this resolution because I believe that confidence is an incredible driving force for growth."
"I voted for this report as, in the proposal for codifying the Third Council Directive 78/855/EEC of 9 October 1978 concerning mergers of public limited liability companies, the Commission has taken into consideration the editorial or formal amendments proposed by the Consultative Working Party of the legal services, which have proved to be justified."
"For example, the Consultative Working Party suggests that it is particularly important that shareholders in the merging companies are informed in an appropriate manner and as impartially as possible, and that their rights are adequately protected."
"However, there is no need for an analysis of the draft terms of merger to be carried out by an independent expert."
"Furthermore, the administrative or management bodies of each of the companies involved inform the general meeting of their respective companies and the administrative or management bodies of the other companies involved of any material change which has occurred between the date of preparation of the draft terms of merger and the date of the general meetings which are to decide on the draft terms of merger."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Maštálka because the proposal in question has been carefully weighed up by the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which jointly deemed it to be a codification, which is to say, it is merely a streamlined version of the existing text."
"Just yesterday, a study was presented in Italy which showed that, at the moment, the businesses that have best withstood the crisis have been those that have managed to bolster their assets."
"In particular, the study, carried out by a respected Italian university on behalf of the country's most active business association, claims that mergers were the main means of consolidation."
"It is not by chance that major financial operations, including mergers, go hand in hand with restructuring and the search for efficiencies in all economic sectors."
"Within the single market, it is therefore incumbent upon the European institutions to lay down rules that can provide guarantees for all those involved and enable more virtuous businesses to compete better, free from legal uncertainties, red tape and obligations caused by simple misunderstandings."
"A modern, liberal and efficient economy - as I believe ours must be - needs a specific law on mergers but only if, like the directive proposed today, it is streamlined and non-interfering, and protects the freedoms and rights of the people who could be hurt by these operations."
"In this sitting, following an amended proposal by Parliament and the Council, Parliament has analysed a draft legislative resolution on mergers of public limited liability companies (codified version), having adopted the proposal tabled by the Commission."
"Given that the proposal is simply aimed at the 'straightforward codification' of the legislative texts without any change in their substance, along with the improvement of working methods, and bearing in mind that it incorporates the forms suggested and substantiated by the Consultative Working Party of the legal services, I am voting in favour of this proposal as I recognise that it will translate into a significant improvement in the functioning of public limited liability companies, particularly by modernising and streamlining them."
"I voted in favour of this report because, according to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance and therefore, in the interests of clarity and rationality, the existing texts should be codified."
"in writing. - I voted for this report because, according to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance."
"Carrying out codification in order to maintain clarity after a certain number of amendments certainly makes things easier."
"In general, however, we need to consider whether such a multitude of rules and regulations is necessary at all."
"In some areas, it is excessive and consumers are scarcely credited with common sense any more, while in other areas, the prescriptions include the likes of name changes for foodstuffs."
"In order to protect the interests of shareholders and third parties, coordinating the laws of the Member States covering mergers of public limited liability companies is a suitable way to ensure the observance of information rights."
"I find myself unable to vote in favour of some of the amendments and I therefore voted against the report as a whole."
"I voted in favour of this report, given that it is confined exclusively to codifying existing texts on mergers of public limited liability companies."
"On 21 September 2010, the Consultative Working Party, made up of the respective legal services of Parliament, the Council and the Commission, having examined the proposal for codifying the Third Council Directive 78/855/EEC of 9 October 1978 based on Article 54(3)(g) of the Treaty concerning mergers of public limited liability companies, concluded without dissent that the proposal is effectively a straightforward codification of existing texts, without any change in their substance."
"During my assessment of the draft legislative resolution on mergers of public limited liability companies, I considered the following legislative acts: the Commission proposal to the European Parliament and the Council; the common position established at first reading on 17 June 2008;"
"Based on this, I decided to follow Parliament's position at first reading, as it is in line with the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, above all, in view of the fact that it is merely a codification of the existing texts, without any substantive amendments."
"According to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the amended proposal on the directive concerning mergers of public limited liability companies is restricted to a codification of existing texts without entailing any change in their substance."
"I therefore voted for this report."
"in writing. - Having sought legal advice, the services stated that, having regard to the interinstitutional agreement of 20 December 1994 on an accelerated working method for official codification of legislative texts and, in particular, to point 4 thereof, the Consultative Working Party consisting of the respective legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission met on 21 September 2010 for the purpose of examining, among others, the proposal submitted by the Commission."
"At that meeting, an examination of the amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying the Third Council Directive 78/855/EEC of 9 October 1978 based on Article 54(3)(g) of the Treaty concerning mergers of public limited liability companies resulted in the Consultative Working Party's concluding, without dissent, that the proposal is a straightforward codification of existing texts, without any change in their substance."
"With this in mind, we decided to support the proposal."
"I agree with the signing of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, to take account of the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and of Romania to the European Union on 1 January 2007."
"I voted for the report like my fellow Members did."
"Apart from the formal aspect, it is important from the perspective of united Europe's global role in different regions, not only its economic, but also its political role."
"They have ensured that the Mediterranean region has been and still is a region of strategic interest."
"I welcome the adoption of this resolution."
"I support the conclusion of a protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, to take account of the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and of Romania to the European Union."
"The text of the legislative resolution on which we have voted underwent the simplified procedure provided for under Rule 46 of the Rules of Procedure."
"I believe that this is justified given the non-contradictory nature of its subject matter."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Agreement between the European Communities and Jordan must include Bulgaria and Romania, so the proposed protocol has reason to be valid and to merit the unanimous support of the European Parliament."
"The Euro-Mediterranean agreement establishes an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, and the protocol is to update the agreement, taking account of the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and of Romania to the European Union, which has been provisionally applied since 1 January 2007."
"In this legislative resolution, the Council is submitting to Parliament a request for consent to the protocol."
"Since I do not have any objections to such approval, I voted in favour."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which is a simple piece of housekeeping updating the existing agreement to take into account the accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"The proposal has no impact on the EU budget and is uncontroversial."
"This protocol merely brings the Euro-Mediterranean agreement establishing an association between the EU and Jordan into line with what has, in reality, been applied since 1 January 2007."
"It is sheer deception."
"The hurry to implement the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area by 2015 justifies all the failures to comply with democratic principles."
"These blind methods have just demonstrated their limitations in Tunisia."
"I will be voting against this text."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the draft Council decision on conclusion of a protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, to take account of the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and of Romania to the European Union since all the prerequisites had been met and since what was at hand was primarily a formal act."
"This recommendation on the draft Council decision concerning the conclusion of a protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, to take account of the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and of Romania to the European Union, deserves my vote."
"Indeed, it is vital to strive for a robust, consistent and effective Neighbourhood Policy."
"Since the Council, in accordance with the terms legally stipulated in the treaties, has submitted a request for consent to this protocol to Parliament, there is nothing standing in the way of its adoption."
"Euro-Mediterranean agreements are gaining ever increasing significance in Europe's association activities."
"In this case, therefore, I intend to give my backing to the draft European Parliament legislative resolution on conclusion of a protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, to take account of the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and of Romania to the European Union, which Parliament has already approved so that the protocol could be concluded."
"My backing is also supported by a series of acts, namely, the draft Council decision, the draft protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, to take account of the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and of Romania to the European Union, the request for consent submitted by the Council in accordance with Article 217 and Article 218(6), second subparagraph, point (a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Rules 81, 90(8) and 46(1) of Parliament's Rules of Procedure, and the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"In the light of all this, I support the cooperative approach being taken by the EU."
"I voted in favour of the conclusion of this protocol, which is fully justified in view of the need to include the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania as contracting parties in the Euro-Mediterranean agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, which was concluded in Brussels on 24 November 1997 and entered into force on 1 May 2002."
"in writing. - Having regard to the draft Council decision (06903/2010), having regard to the draft protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, to take account of the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and of Romania to the European Union (09373/2008), having regard to the request for consent submitted by the Council in accordance with Article 217 and Article 218(6), second subparagraph, point (a), of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (C7-0384/2010), having regard to Rules 81, 90(8) and 46(1) of its Rules of Procedure, having regard to the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Verts/ALE Group agreed that Parliament should give its consent to the conclusion of the protocol."
"This is a recommendation on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union on certain aspects of air services."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union on certain aspects of air services."
"At present, the Community has exclusive competence with respect to various aspects of external aviation."
"Consequently, the Council has authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries in order to replace certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with Community agreements."
"The Commission has negotiated an Agreement with the West African Economic and Monetary Union that avoids discrimination between EU air carriers, allows the taxation of aircraft fuel for operations within the territory of the European Union, and brings into line with EU competition law provisions in bilateral agreements which are clearly anti-competitive, namely, obligatory commercial agreements between airlines."
"The transfer of Member States' competences to the European Union is the justification for replacing bilateral air services agreements with new ones to which the Union is party."
"The resolution voted on is about specific issues of this nature and aims to harmonise the international law instruments currently in force, as well as to adapt them to the additional requirements arising from EU law."
"The subject in question is highly technical, involving the replacing of agreements that were previously in force with others, without involving anything contentious or any significant changes in ideology."
"The fact that the vote in committee was unanimously in favour confirms this interpretation."
"All that was needed in plenary, therefore, was to ratify a consensual decision."
"I voted in favour."
"The report tabled by Mr Koch proposes the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union on certain aspects of air services."
"The spirit of the European Union in the treaties is to standardise procedures throughout the EU."
"Therefore, as the Court of Justice of the European Communities has ruled, it makes no sense for there to be bilateral agreements on air services between EU Member States and the Member States of the West African Economic and Monetary Union."
"I therefore welcome the adoption of this agreement, which will strengthen the bonds of territorial cohesion within Europe and bring about compliance with EU competition law."
"In the context of the situation currently being faced by civil aviation, we believe that this draft agreement raises serious doubts about its scope and potential consequences."
"Until now, in this area which is strategic in terms of safeguarding national interests for a number of reasons, the Member States made sovereign decisions about how agreements - which have a clear impact on airlines - should be organised and what their scope should be."
"Nevertheless, the intention is that, from now on, the market will be king here too."
"In particular, we cannot underestimate the contribution that the supposed creation of a level playing field for the various European companies could make towards facilitating the monopolistic concentration of the sector - which is already under way - and the reduction of the Member States' capacity to defend their flag-carrying airlines."
"The ubiquitous and sacrosanct 'free competition' is defended at all costs and is once again the pillar by which this initiative is supported."
"The consequences for this sector are not substantially different from those for others: it is the monopolistic concentration that always ends up being imposed in these cases."
"For these reasons, we did not vote for this report."
"I voted in favour of this report because the Community has exclusive competence with respect to various aspects of external aviation which were traditionally governed by bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries, and consequently, Community agreements must replace certain provisions in the existing 47 bilateral air services agreements concluded between EU Member States and Member States of the West African Economic and Monetary Union."
"To avoid discrimination between EU air carriers, the traditional designation clauses, referring to air carriers of the Member State party to the bilateral agreement, are replaced by a EU designation clause, referring to all EU carriers."
"Although traditional bilateral agreements tend to exempt aircraft fuel in general from taxation, Council Directive 2003/96/EC restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity permits such taxation for operations within the territory of the European Union."
"Furthermore, provisions in bilateral agreements which are clearly anti-competitive (obligatory commercial agreements between airlines) are brought into line with EU competition law."
"African countries situated in particularly difficult geographic and climatic regions require special treatment."
"However, the people living there do not need only food and water; they also need education, and they want to work with dignity and move around."
"The agreement between the European Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which replaces certain provisions of earlier agreements, facilitates significantly, and makes more just in market terms, air transport procedures between the parties of the agreement."
"It prevents unfair, monopolistic practices and eases travel for ordinary citizens."
"There are also new opportunities for tourists from throughout the world and the associated development of this branch of the economy in Africa."
"I voted for the recommendation on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union on certain aspects of air services."
"The agreement, which was negotiated by the Commission, aims to replace certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements concluded between EU Member States and Member States of the West African Economic and Monetary Union."
"Amongst the most important changes relating to the agreement we voted on today, I feel the need to mention the provisions included to avoid discrimination between European Union air carriers."
"Indeed, for this very purpose, the traditional designation clauses, referring to air carriers of the Member State party to the bilateral agreement, are replaced by an EU designation clause, referring to all EU carriers."
"in writing. - I voted to give consent to this agreement. The agreement is one of the horizontal air service agreements whose aim is to bring existing bilateral air service agreements in line with EU law."
"This is as a result of the 2003 ECJ decision that gave the Community exclusive competence in regard to various aspects of external aviation which had traditionally been governed by bilateral air service agreements."
"Just as with other horizontal air agreements, this agreement provides for an EU designation clause permitting all EU carriers to benefit from the right of establishment, deals with safety issues and the taxation of aviation fuel and resolves potential conflicts with EU competition rules."
"Not content with underhandedly expediting the division of African regional integration as elsewhere in the world, the European Union is now even imposing its neoliberal diktat in the African sky."
"The incentives set up by the Commission do nothing to hide this."
"This agreement 'does not aim to increase the total volume of air traffic'?"
"But the total absence of checks on such an increase in traffic is certain!"
"This agreement 'shall not prevent a Member State from imposing taxes, levies, duties, fees or charges on fuel'?"
"However, ecological efficiency is reduced to zero by the restrictions imposed on it!"
"In fact, where Member States used to decide how to organise their access agreements with companies themselves, now only the market will decide."
"The existence of 47 bilateral agreements between EU Member States and the Member States of the West African Economic and Monetary Union is clearly insufficient to cover the various aspects of air services."
"This agreement is therefore to be welcomed, as it will replace certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with Community agreements."
"It is worth highlighting the references in this agreement to the avoidance of discrimination between EU air carriers and the taxation of aircraft fuel, in line with the directive on the taxation of energy products and electricity."
"It is also worth emphasising that the provisions set out in the agreements comply with EU competition law."
"This agreement aims to replace certain provisions in the existing 47 bilateral air services agreements concluded between EU Member States and Member States of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)."
"It is, in fact, appropriate to harmonise the different provisions of the existing agreements by means of a horizontal Community agreement."
"It will re-establish legal certainty for bilateral air services agreements concluded between Member States of the WAEMU and EU Member States and it will also make it possible for EU Member States that have not signed a bilateral agreement with a Member State of the WAEMU not to be adversely affected."
"It will prevent discrimination between carriers as regards designation or the taxation of aviation fuel."
"The anti-competitive provisions of bilateral agreements are brought into line with EU competition law."
"The agreement will strengthen EU-Africa aviation relations and will foster cooperation in the aviation area between the EU and WAEMU on a number of important aspects, such as aviation safety and security."
"In order to create a uniform basis for flights to countries outside the EU and, subsequently, to be able to guarantee legal certainty, all bilateral agreements must be reviewed."
"With the Council's authorisation, the Commission negotiated an agreement with the West African Economic and Monetary Union that replaces the existing 47 bilateral air services agreements concluded between EU Member States and Member States of the West African Economic and Monetary Union."
"I am voting in favour of the report because a generally applicable agreement makes perfect sense in this context."
"This agreement simply replaces the 47 bilateral agreements with the various Member States and, as a result, the EU gains more foreign policy powers."
"Therefore, I have voted against this report."
"This report refers to a draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union on certain aspects of air services."
"Given that the EU currently has exclusive competence in this area, the Council has authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries in order to replace the traditional bilateral agreements on air services between the Member States and third countries."
"The draft agreement was examined by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which issued a favourable opinion."
"From this, I would like to highlight, among other points, the establishment of a Community designation clause in order to avoid discrimination between EU air carriers and allow the taxation of aircraft fuel for operations within the territory of the European Union."
"I would like to emphasise these two points in the favourable opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, as these caused me to vote in favour of this report."
"The European Union has exclusive competence with respect to external aviation which was traditionally governed by bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries."
"In June 2003, the Commission opened negotiations with third countries in order to replace certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with EU agreements."
"They include an agreement that replaces the 47 existing bilateral air services agreements concluded between EU Member States and the West African Economic and Monetary Union."
"The main aspects of the agreement are: the designation clause, which replaces the bilateral agreement and avoids discrimination between European Union air carriers; taxation of aviation fuel in general on EU territory; and Article 6, which brings commercial agreements between airlines in line with EU competition law."
"The agreement negotiated by the Commission was provisionally applied on 30 November 2009."
"With the weight of the rulings of the Court of Justice on the Community's exclusive competence behind me, I must say that I am very much in favour of the renegotiation of these agreements, both because they go against the increasing importance of European sovereignty and because this draft decision is in line with EU competition and budget law."
"I voted in favour of the conclusion of this agreement which, under the exclusive competence granted to the EU regarding various aspects of external aviation, is aimed at replacing certain provisions in the 47 existing bilateral agreements on air services between the EU Member States and the Member States of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, in order to make them compatible with EU law."
"in writing. - As the Court of Justice of the European Communities has ruled, the Community has exclusive competence with respect to various aspects of external aviation which were traditionally governed by bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries."
"Consequently, the Council authorised the Commission in June 2003 to open negotiations with third countries in order to replace certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with Community agreements."
"Thus, the Commission has negotiated an agreement with the West African Economic and Monetary Union that replaces certain provisions in the existing 47 bilateral air services agreements concluded between EU Member States and Member States of the West African Economic and Monetary Union."
"Parliament is entitled to give its consent to the conclusion of this agreement in accordance with Rule 81 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Parliament shall take a decision by means of a single vote, and no amendments to the agreement itself may be tabled."
"On the basis of the above, the rapporteur suggested that the Committee on Transport and Tourism, first, and then Parliament as a whole, should give a favourable opinion on the conclusion of this agreement."
"The Verts/ALE Group did so."
"The exclusive competence in certain aspects of external aviation, established by the 2003 open skies judgment, enables the European Commission to negotiate agreements with third countries in order to adapt the European aviation market to EU rules and, at the same time, make it competitive and transparent."
"I welcome the adoption of this agreement with the Member States of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, as I consider it essential for the European Union to table a policy of consistency in the external aviation sector, gradually reducing the various provisions of the current bilateral agreements on air services between both parties."
"From the agreement, I would stress the clause on non-discrimination between EU air carriers, the clause on the taxation of aviation fuel pursuant to the directive on the taxation of energy products and electricity, and the fact that it brings the provisions of bilateral agreements in line with EU competition law and under regulatory control."
"These measures will enable the opening up of markets and, consequently, the creation of investment opportunities for both parties."
"These agreements will have to be understood as a means of strengthening strategic cooperation between both organisations."
"I agree that there is a need to take measures relating to the construction sector, as this sector is quite important to the European economy: with 10% of gross domestic product, it represents almost 65 000 small and medium-sized enterprises with fewer than 250 employees."
"This proposal aims, firstly, to ensure a high level of safety for construction products and, secondly, to improve health and safety conditions for the sector's workers."
"Currently, trade on the internal market is being harmed by national technical rules that govern the free circulation of goods and services within the construction sector, which therefore necessitates the revision of Directive 89/106/EEC on construction products."
"Given the new market surveillance circumstances, including the new legislative framework, the proposal for a regulation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products could be an important landmark on the way towards the updating, simplification and replacing of the directive."
"I agreed with this document, because due to the scale of the marketing of construction products in the EU and obstacles to trade in the construction sector, it is important to take immediate action."
"Bearing in mind that the construction sector is one of Europe's biggest industries, accounting for 10% of GDP and employing directly 12 million EU citizens, proper regulation is essential."
"I believe that this proposal for a regulation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products will facilitate the updating, simplification and replacement of the Construction Products Directive in light of changed circumstances concerning, for instance, market surveillance, including the new legislative framework."
"Although working conditions in the construction sector have improved in recent decades, the European Union must give itself the means to carry on setting the trend for high quality in this area."
"It is on this basis that I voted for this regulation laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products."
"In order to ensure a high level of health and safety protection for workers and other construction product users, the new legislation on the marketing of construction products must include labelling of hazardous substances."
"This regulation updates and replaces the current rules so as to cut red tape and increase transparency, in particular, through new simplified performance assessment procedures for small businesses."
"I voted in favour of this document."
"The construction sector is one of Europe's biggest industries, accounting for 10% of GDP and 50.5% of gross fixed capital."
"The sector employs directly 12 million EU citizens and an additional 26 million jobs in other sectors are dependent on it."
"The economic downturn has hit the EU construction industry hard with companies across the EU going bankrupt and workers losing their livelihoods."
"In the EU, there are still barriers to trade in the construction sector, because Member States still use national technical rules to prevent the free movement of goods and services in the construction sector."
"The review of the Construction Products Directive in this context is a much needed boost which should help the sector by removing barriers to trade for manufacturers and thereby helping companies stay in business and workers remain in employment."
"While breaking down administrative barriers, it is essential to ensure the independence and transparency of technical assessment bodies, and therefore I support the proposal to set standards on transparency and ensure the representation of all stakeholders in the technical committees of European Standardisation bodies in order to avoid conflicts of interest."
"As I also emphasised in my speech yesterday, I voted in favour of this report."
"We need to make progress in our actions to harmonise the global construction market."
"I am referring to matters relating not only to workers' safety and their migration, but also to the safety of the construction materials in relation to our health."
"With regard to the future Product Contact Points for Construction, I would very much like them to provide impartial information, be up and running as soon as possible in Member States, and receive financial support so that they can be beneficial to citizens and the relevant companies."
"I hope that the new regulation will make its impact as quickly as possible and that we, as ordinary people, will notice that we have made progress and that the construction industry as a whole is no longer one of the most dangerous sectors of activity."
"The labelling of, and providing of information on, hazardous substances contained in products of all kinds, whether they be chemical or construction products, is one of the achievements of the European Union."
"Ever since the REACH Regulation came into force, the EU has demonstrated the added value that it brings with regard to the safety and transparency of hazardous substances."
"Once again, in Strasbourg, we have adopted a regulation that harmonises the conditions for the marketing of construction products and ensured that the 'declaration of performance' of each product includes information on hazardous substances."
"Health and safety are priorities, and we should welcome the fact that European standards allow for this high level of transparency and safety."
"Nevertheless, while our internal market is now protected, can the same be said about the globalised market we are in?"
"We must now use our influence with our partners outside the EU, who may not necessarily have the same level of standards."
"The need for action on the marketing of construction products in the EU is vitally important, given the scale of this sector."
"The construction sector is one of Europe's biggest industries, accounting for 10% of GDP and 50.5% of gross fixed capital."
"This sector employs 12 million EU citizens directly with another 26 million workers dependent on it."
"The economic downturn has hit the EU construction industry hard with a number of companies in the EU going bankrupt and many workers losing their livelihoods."
"This is also true in Romania where, after a boom in the construction market, it is now facing a desperate shortfall in orders."
"According to the experts, there will be no upturn in the construction market in 2011."
"In fact, they even reckon that it might fall to its lowest level compared with the last decade."
"In this climate, any measure which can be taken to support the construction sector is a welcome boost."
"The review of the Construction Products Directive in this context should help the sector by removing the trade barriers facing manufacturers and would, in turn, help companies stay in business and workers remain in employment."
"In terms of GDP creation, construction represents 10% of the economic output of the European Union."
"The construction market continues to face a whole range of obstacles preventing the full development of a unified market."
"The aim of the submitted regulation is to amend the existing directive and thereby to simplify the conditions for marketing construction products."
"It mainly involves market supervision and a common framework for the marketing of construction products."
"The aim of the amendment to the directive is, in a period of economic downturn, to assist the construction sector in eliminating commercial obstacles, thereby preserving jobs and sustaining a great many construction firms that would otherwise not survive the economic downturn."
"The Council, in its position in the first reading, removed the amendment proposals of Parliament, which aimed at establishing a duty to declare the hazardous materials contained in construction products (for example, asbestos)."
"I consider this very dangerous, and I therefore support the submitted report, as it again proposes an obligation on construction firms to declare the hazardous materials contained in construction products."
"We must protect the health of our citizens."
"Last but not least, I would like to applaud the effort to ensure that Member States secure the independence of representatives on the Standing Committee on Construction, which assesses and verifies the properties of construction products."
"Among other things, the report also includes amendment proposals for increasing health and safety protection, not only for construction workers, but also for actual users of buildings."
"For the reasons mentioned above, as well as for other reasons, I have decided to support the report."
"I voted in favour of this proposal for a regulation as it lays down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and is intended to update, simplify and replace the Construction Products Directive in the light of changed circumstances, especially as regards market surveillance, including the new legislative framework."
"Given the size of the construction sector, it is imperative that measures be taken regarding the marketing of construction products in the EU."
"I support recognition of the need for high standards of health and safety for workers in this sector."
"This proposal will remove barriers to trading for manufacturers and also help companies to remain in business and contribute to workers keeping their jobs."
"The regulation on harmonising the marketing of construction products marks a step forward towards improving the operation of the internal market in this area and the free movement of construction products."
"One important point to make at the same time is that the regulation's implementation will help keep to a minimum the occurrence of unintended non-conformities of construction products with their declaration of performance, which will minimise material losses."
"Preventing the risk of non-conformity is a necessity so as to avoid placing on the market products intended for sale which do not fulfil the requirements of this regulation, thereby guaranteeing that construction products perform properly and that the basic requirements applicable to construction works are met."
"The draft recommendation on the setting out of harmonised conditions for marketing construction products requires the highest possible level of protection, both for workers and for persons using buildings."
"I agree with the position of the rapporteur that the power to monitor possible hazardous substances in construction products is vitally necessary, and I support the amendment proposal concerning the need for information on hazardous substances to be declared on construction products."
"I cannot understand the position of the Council, which completely removed this from the original proposal."
"In order to increase awareness of new and existing construction products, so-called contact points should be established, which must be impartial, in other words, independent in financial and personnel terms of bodies connected with the process of obtaining CE marks."
"The Council has proposed too many exceptions from the requirement to carry a CE mark, and it is essential to revise and limit this as far as possible, otherwise the entire CE marking system will become meaningless."
"I support the proposed regulation in its amended form, and I will vote for its adoption."
"I voted for this report because it advocates the need to remove barriers affecting trade in the construction industry."
"The current economic recession has severely harmed this sector."
"The proposed regulation, which will replace the directive currently in force, will help to reverse this situation."
"Removing barriers to trading for manufacturers will, firstly, help companies to remain in business and, secondly, contribute to workers keeping their jobs."
"According to the data in the report, and I quote: the 'construction sector is one of Europe's biggest industries accounting for 10% of [gross domestic product] and 50.5% of gross fixed capital."
"The sector employs directly 12 million EU citizens with 26 million workers dependent on the sector."
"In addition, approximately 92% of manufacturers of construction materials amounting to 65 000 enterprises are [small and medium-sized enterprises] with fewer than 250 employees'."
"These figures give the true scale of the importance of the construction sector to the European economy."
"That is exactly why common rules are needed that govern the sector and enable the internal market to function properly."
"This proposal for a regulation is intended to harmonise the marketing of construction products, updating and simplifying the current directive while taking account of the new legislative framework (Regulation No 765/2008/EC and Decision 768/2008/EC)."
"It focuses on various aspects, such as the declaration of performance and CE marking, the transportation of hazardous substances, national contact points for obtaining information on construction products, the independence and transparency of all the bodies involved in this area, the recycling of construction products, greater emphasis on health and safety issues, the improvement of e-communication and the introduction of new information technology methods."
"I voted in favour of this regulation which will certainly increase safety in the transportation of these products, protect health and enhance the safety conditions of all the workers in the sector."
"It will also contribute to the abandonment, however gradual, of practices that are damaging to the environment."
"Although the second reading of this report and the final agreement with the Council include some positive aspects, we must not forget it focuses on the principle of consolidating the single market."
"In this context, this is a case of adopting a regulation that aims to establish harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products."
"That is, it establishes the rules that the Member States must observe in order for their products to come onto the market in the European Union."
"I believe that we can all agree on certain aspects, specifically regarding the defending of health and safety, including for workers, but also in relation to using a product during its life cycle, especially in the case of dangerous substances."
"However, we cannot agree on decisions that could end up putting at risk the production of these products in countries with more-fragile economies or by small and medium-sized enterprises that find it difficult to adapt, unless there is some sort of advance support, if only to defend the interests of European economic groups which, in fact, aim to dominate the market."
"The move towards the liberalisation of building products in the construction sector represents one of the requests for greater sensitivity received from small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Considering the overall importance of the construction sector in all Member States, I think that further liberalisation is a necessary step forward."
"In particular, I applaud the elimination of several bureaucratic constraints and the necessary traceability of products containing substances potentially harmful to humans."
"For this reason, I have decided to support Mrs Stihler's recommendation."
"The functioning of the internal market is still limited by numerous barriers."
"For this reason, I am very pleased to accept the adoption of the resolution on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products."
"The resolution should lead to an easier flow of construction goods between Member States."
"In addition, the resolution introduces important rules that make it easier for companies to do business."
"Firstly, it requires Member States to create product contact points where companies will be able to obtain information about construction products."
"Information about regulations will also be available that will help even the smallest company meet the new requirements for preparing user properties and regarding CE labels."
"Nonetheless, we should not forget that the resolution contains a range of new requirements regarding the placing of CE labels and preparing user property declarations, which will also have to contain information about dangerous substances contained in construction products."
"I hope that both the European Commission and Member States will make every effort for information about the new regulations to reach manufacturers as soon as possible, so that they can start to prepare and adjust to the resolution's new provisions as soon as possible."
"I agreed with this proposal, because the construction sector is one of Europe's biggest industries, accounting for 10% of GDP, and the sector employs directly 12 million EU citizens, with 26 million workers dependent on it."
"Furthermore, approximately 92% of companies manufacturing construction materials are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"As SMEs are the backbone of our economy, this proposal must recognise their role and needs."
"The review of the Construction Products Directive (89/106/EEC) is a much needed boost which should help the sector by removing barriers to trade for manufacturers, thereby helping companies stay in business and workers remain in employment."
"The proposal for a regulation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products (COM(2008)311) is intended to update, simplify and replace the Construction Products Directive in light of changed circumstances."
"I am pleased that attention has been drawn to and particular concern is shown for hazardous substances in these products, and the ability to trace hazardous substances back to products is vitally important."
"If we knew where asbestos lay in buildings, workers involved in the construction of buildings and residents alike would not have had to suffer from conditions such as mesotheliaoma."
"The retabling of the amendments (Amendments 7, 17, 49) on hazardous substances is important for future health and safety and transparency."
"It is high time the Construction Products Directive was reformed and replaced with a more workable regulation that would enable us actually to ensure the free movement of construction products in the internal market."
"The Commission is right in its initiative to facilitate the practical implementation of the existing directive and make that implementation process more efficient."
"Construction products clearly differ from other products whose movement within the internal market is controlled by directives."
"Whereas the safety requirements for a product are generally standardised across directives, construction products are intermediate products, intended for building projects, and, thanks to this special feature, the aims of the directive on construction products will be achieved by successfully determining harmonised approaches to ensuring that the declaration of performance for a product is precise and reliable."
"In this respect, the new regulation will mean a major improvement."
"It is also important to take into account the different circumstances prevailing around Europe in order to ensure the survival of microenterprises operating locally."
"Member States naturally set differing requirements for construction works, owing to climatic conditions."
"It is nevertheless important to focus attention on pointless test requirements and eliminate them, so that we can reduce the administrative burden."
"I believe that this regulation will improve both the functioning of the internal market and the standardisation process for construction products in Europe."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of the regulation."
"I support this new approach, since the aim of the legal adjustment is not to define product safety, but to create a transparent environment in which reliable information will be provided on the properties of products."
"I also applaud the fact that the European Parliament has decided to prefer electronic documents, specifically in relation to declarations on the properties of marketed products."
"I have doubts over the legislative method of Amendment proposal No 45, however, which relates to Article 17."
"While I support the proposed principle of fair and balanced representation for the various participants in the process for creating harmonised standards, I take the view that this issue should be resolved comprehensively within the revision of the European standardisation system, and not piecemeal in individual legal acts."
"In my opinion, the approach that has been selected will lead to laws that lack clarity."
"I supported Mrs Stihler's report with a view to the adoption of a regulation laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products, because I believe the construction sector to be very important for the European economy."
"In this context, achieving a high level of harmonisation in the rules on construction products is a goal that Europe must force itself to achieve as soon as possible."
"At a time like the present, when we need to stimulate economic growth, we cannot neglect the strategic role of this sector."
"The aim of the proposal is to ensure precise and reliable information on the performance of construction products, so as to be able to rely on safe buildings, built with materials that have no negative effects on human health."
"In addition, I consider the steps taken on safety at work to be essential in order to protect the millions of European citizens employed in this sector, guaranteeing them a suitable level of protection."
"in writing. - I wish to congratulate my Scottish colleague, Catherine Stihler, on her good work on this very technical subject."
"I voted for the report, which should ensure more transparency for bodies that create standards in the construction industry, places an emphasis on recycling and gives SMEs an easier route to the single market with simplified procedures."
"The fact that the civil construction sector accounts for a large part of the European Union's gross domestic product (GDP), according to the rapporteur, representing approximately 10% of GDP and 50.5% of gross fixed capital, justifies the harmonised conditions which have been adopted here."
"The recent economic recession has brought serious problems to this industry, with business redundancies and workers losing their jobs."
"Hence, any measure that can be taken to help this sector is extremely important."
"The review of Construction Products Directive 89/106/EEC in this context is a much needed boost which should help the sector, specifically by removing barriers to trade for manufacturers, on the one hand, and by helping companies stay in business and workers remain in employment, on the other."
"The construction industry is, in fact, one of the biggest economic factors throughout Europe."
"However, the crisis has hit this sector hard."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises, which often serve as distributors, have suffered particularly badly and many have even gone out of business."
"In order to secure the survival of companies and thus jobs, barriers to trade should be eliminated."
"This can create fairer conditions that would benefit everyone involved."
"For that reason, I voted against the motions tabled by the committee responsible at second reading."
"The construction sector is a fundamental European sector both in terms of employment and in terms of the development of our small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It is therefore imperative to support a regulation that lays down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products, guaranteeing the safety of materials used and the health of workers."
"Cases of physical injury and damage to health continue to be recorded, not least for those citizens who come into daily contact with hazardous substances, such as asbestos, used in the construction of urban buildings."
"I am therefore in favour of Mrs Stihler's report, which was adopted today at second reading, because it stresses the importance, in a globalised world, of introducing common rules on the marking of substances and products used, so as to guarantee safety and reliability and, at the same time, to reduce costs for producers, with particular reference to SMEs."
"The harmonisation measures in the report are too extensive."
"The construction sector is a sensitive area: it is crucial for the development of infrastructure and thus, also for the individual Member States as business locations."
"Labour, social and environmental standards are often important for protecting people and the environment in this sector."
"Each Member State should, to a large extent, make its own decisions in this regard."
"Therefore, I have voted against this report."
"The proposal for a regulation of Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products is aimed at ensuring the free movement of construction products on the internal market."
"I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation precisely because guaranteeing clear and reliable information through the use of CE marking on marketed construction products represents another step forward towards a free, competitive market that is capable of protecting small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Since construction products are the intermediate goods of a finished structure, the harmonisation of new European rules guarantees the safety and quality of the structure, puts all construction companies on a level playing field, improves controls on materials already on the market, and finally results in greater transparency in the construction products trade."
"I voted for this report because I believe that it is necessary to reduce the barriers that are preventing greater fluidity of trade in the construction industry."
"The construction industry has been particularly affected by the current economic situation, and the proposed regulation is intended to promote the free, effective and transparent movement of goods and services to the construction industry."
"The removal of obstacles to cross-border activity and the elimination of national administrative and technical barriers have a crucial role in the construction industry."
"In fact, in the construction industry, the Member States are hiding behind national technical standards in order to block the free circulation of goods and services."
"Given that the construction sector represents 10% of gross domestic product in the EU and is currently experiencing a period of severe recession, all measures that can be taken to help boost construction are welcome and will have my vote."
"Indeed, these measures will allow companies to stay in business and workers remain in employment."
"Across the EU, there are still too many barriers to trade in the construction sector, resulting in the Member States' justification of the technical rules put in place to limit the free movement of goods and services."
"This fast expanding sector generates 10% of GDP and 50.5% of gross fixed capital."
"It provides jobs for 12 million EU citizens and 92% of it is made up of small and medium-sized enterprises - the backbone of our economy."
"Therefore, I think it is necessary to bring in measures to harmonise the market in these products, as well as to guarantee a high level of health and safety for workers in the sector."
"In view of the recession - which caused major problems in the sector, including company failures - we need liberalisation measures that will ensure the economic survival of businesses and preserve jobs."
"This proposal for a regulation is intended to update, simplify and replace the Construction Products Directive in light of changed circumstances concerning, for example, market surveillance."
"It also aims to provide greater protection in terms of CE marking, hazardous substances, national product contact points, independence and transparency, health and safety, and e-communication."
"The need for action on the marketing of construction products in the EU is vitally important, given the scale of this sector."
"According to the European Committee for Standardisation, the construction sector is one of Europe's biggest industries, accounting for 10% of GDP and 50.5% of gross fixed capital."
"This sector employs 12 million EU citizens directly, with another 26 million workers dependent on it."
"In addition, approximately 92% of manufacturers of construction materials, amounting to 65 000 enterprises, are SMEs with fewer than 250 employees As SMEs are the backbone of our economy, this proposal calls for recognition of their role and needs, as well as for a high level of health and safety for those working in this sector."
"I voted for this report as the proposal helps boost the industry's competitiveness by simplifying current legislation, increasing transparency and reducing the administrative burden which businesses have to bear, as well as to support Romania's interest in introducing the compulsory assessment of performance of products covered by harmonised standards, the issuing of the declaration of performance, and affixing of the CE marking."
"Given the importance of the construction sector within the European economy, it is vital to remove the technical barriers to trade in the field of construction products in order to enhance their free movement within the internal market."
"It is therefore important to support the establishment of harmonised technical specifications which, given the necessary emphasis on health and safety issues, also allow the single market to be consolidated."
"Today, we voted in plenary on the recommendation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products."
"Given the sector's importance, it is essential to develop measures on the marketing of construction products within the EU."
"According to the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), the construction sector is one of Europe's biggest industries accounting for 10% of GDP and 50.5% of gross fixed capital."
"This proposal for a regulation lays down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products, through the introduction of common rules on marking, aimed at strengthening the guarantees relating to product safety and reliability and, at the same time, at reducing costs for producers, with particular reference to SMEs."
"in writing. - This regulation comes before the Parliament for second reading in view of its final adoption."
"Parliament's first reading took place during the previous parliamentary term."
"The Council adopted its position in 2010 and subsequently, there were intense informal trialogue negotiations under the Belgian Presidency in order to reach a compromise solution."
"This regulation is very technical but is politically highly relevant for the Greens because its main purpose is to harmonise requirements regarding the marketing of construction products."
"The Verts/ALE Group's major concerns have been to make sure, inter alia, that (i) procedures should be transparent (in particular, the standardisation bodies should not be monopolised by representatives of the major industries, and the concerns of SMEs or other stakeholders should be taken into account); (ii) construction requirements and procedures should be able to boost innovative and more ecological patterns; (iii) special procedures for 'micro-enterprises' should not allow the industry to circumvent the requirements or procedures."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that there are still too many 'barriers' to trade in the construction sector in Europe."
"The review of this directive should help to eliminate trade barriers, thereby protecting jobs in construction companies, which are still affected by the global economic crisis."
"There are plans to introduce specific new measures to verify that construction products are being recycled and to promote their reuse as a way of meeting the EU's climate change targets."
"New safeguards are also needed to protect the health and safety of employees in this sector, in which a high number of work-related deaths are, unfortunately, still recorded."
"Lastly, the request to gradually replace hard copies of documents with computerised versions is intended to make the construction product market even more harmonised."
"Despite the fact that the introduction to the regulation contains some unacceptable general statements, in particular, regarding the completely free movement of services in the construction sector - which we cannot support because there will be a risk of unfair competition until labour costs have been harmonised between the various Member States - we shall vote in favour."
"We shall do so because the regulation deals exclusively with the legislation on the marketing of products for the construction sector, which, in this period of economic recession, has had very serious repercussions with the closure of many businesses and the loss of jobs."
"The proposal provides for the harmonisation and labelling of products containing hazardous substances, and also simplifies, updates and supersedes current rules so as to eliminate certain regulatory obstacles for the benefit of workers and of small and medium-sized enterprises alike."
"in writing. - I am extremely pleased that the construction report, for which I was rapporteur, was supported and voted into legislation by my colleagues."
"The report will result in hazardous substances being listed on the labelling of construction products and further studies to follow on the subject from the Commission."
"There are also provisions to make it easier for SMEs to place their products on the internal market."
"The need for greater transparency in approving products with the 'CE' marking has been addressed and I look forward to the measures being introduced in July 2013."
"I voted for the proposal for a regulation laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC."
"The construction sector is a large industrial sector in Europe, employing 12 million EU citizens directly, with another 26 million workers dependent on it."
"The economic downturn has hit the EU construction industry hard, with many workers losing their jobs."
"This led to a drop of up to 14.2% in the sector's activity between 2008 and 2009."
"The review of the Construction Products Directive (89/106/EEC) in this context offers a measure of support for the construction sector by removing the trade barriers facing manufacturers, thereby helping companies to stay in business and workers to remain in employment."
"Construction works, both as a whole and in their separate parts, must be fit for their intended use, taking into account, in particular, the health and safety of those involved throughout the life cycle of the works."
"Construction works must also be energy efficient, using as little energy as possible during their life cycle and, therefore, at the lowest cost to users."
"I believe that the construction sector broadly reflects the economic situation."
"In the second quarter of 2010, the Lithuanian construction sector shrank by up to 42.9%, one of the steepest declines in Europe."
"Since then, the situation has improved slightly, but let us be under no illusions - the Lithuanian construction sector is taking a long time to recover."
"Therefore, it is rather premature to talk of a steady recovery."
"There is still room for improvement."
"For instance, my country's construction sector would recover more quickly if the take-up of EU aid was improved."
"The construction sector is one of the biggest branches of Lithuanian and European industry."
"The sector employs 12 million EU citizens directly, with 26 million workers dependent on the sector."
"The construction sector is very important for Lithuania because it creates a lot of jobs, strengthens internal demand and brings money into the budget."
"This sector is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises, the cornerstone of our economy."
"Approximately 92% of companies manufacturing construction materials are SMEs with fewer than 250 employees."
"I also agree with the rapporteur's proposal to use e-communication and IT methods to improve the single market in construction products."
"This is important as we look to the future."
"in writing. - The construction industry represents various vital issues in the European Union, ranging from its significant contribution to the economy to the safety of EU citizens in their homes and places of work."
"My vote in favour of the Construction Products Regulation reflects the need for a modernised, safe and transparent directive on construction products."
"The proposal calls for improvements to health and safety procedures across the sector and clear declarations of hazardous substances."
"Furthermore, the provision of a 'CE' mark of confidence on products will give those conducting their own projects the confidence that the materials they are using are safe."
"The European economy is based heavily on the construction sector, which accounts for 10% of EU GDP and directly employs 12 million EU citizens."
"Most of those employed find themselves in SMEs, which form a vital part of the European economy."
"However, construction remains one of the most dangerous areas of work."
"I thus support this regulation to improve the safety of European citizens in their places of work and at home, whether they be carrying out projects independently or professionally."
"I voted for this report, which seeks to make EU humanitarian aid more effective."
"The European Consensus on humanitarian aid is major step forward."
"Nevertheless, the review of its action plan must be more coherent, using objectives that are more measurable and indicators that are more reliable."
"That is the only way that we will manage to deliver aid more effectively."
"Given the increasing number and severity of natural disasters caused by climate change, I agree with the position put forward that it is important, not just to provide one-off aid, but also to provide support for communities' own disaster-preparedness capabilities: the Hyogo action plan needs to be strengthened."
"Efforts also need to be concentrated on human rights issues arising from internal conflicts and complex crises, improving the capacities of the bodies involved to access populations; this will only be possible by making a clear distinction between military, political and humanitarian roles."
"I also agree with the effective application of a European rapid-intervention capability."
"I voted in favour of this document, because it is crucial for more effective provision of humanitarian aid."
"The European Consensus on humanitarian aid is the first common document on humanitarian aid policy to have been produced since the adoption of the 1996 regulation."
"It is a fundamentally important tool, particularly against the background of profound change in humanitarian affairs, such as the abundance of natural disasters and armed conflicts, resulting in the displacement of huge numbers of people, etc. I hope that the European Consensus on humanitarian aid will be an important step towards achieving the most effective EU actions in the field of humanitarian aid and will contribute to the promotion of humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law, coordination and consistency in the delivery of EU humanitarian aid, clarification on the use of military and civil protection resources and capabilities, disaster risk reduction and reinforcement of the link between emergency aid, rehabilitation and development."
"This report commits the European Union to close cooperation revolving around a shared vision on humanitarian aid."
"I think that the severity of natural disasters is also down to the human actions at the root of climate change."
"I also encourage Member States to get involved in implementing this European Consensus on humanitarian aid."
"I support the actions promoted in this area: the promotion of humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law; improvements in terms of quality of the coordination and consistency in the delivery of EU humanitarian aid; clarification on the use of military and civil protection resources and capabilities in accordance with the Humanitarian Consensus and UN guidelines; disaster risk reduction and reinforcement of the link between emergency aid, rehabilitation and development."
"Consequently, I voted in favour of this report."
"The European Union is a global player."
"It is with this strong belief that the authors of the Treaty of Lisbon strengthened Europe's ambitions on the world stage."
"The humanitarian dimension has an important place in this major project."
"The Union is already the world's largest donor, providing 40% of all contributions."
"This joint declaration 'is based on common principles and approaches and designed to encourage concerted and coordinated action within the EU and with other actors and thus improve the collective response to humanitarian crises'."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, which recalls that humanitarian aid must be provided in an appropriate and effective manner; stresses the importance of good coordination; emphasises the secondary nature of assistance provided by military and civil protection capabilities and the vital importance of reducing risks caused by natural disasters; and, lastly, calls on the Union to strengthen the link between emergency aid, reconstruction and development."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The European Union is the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid, providing more than 40% of all official international humanitarian assistance."
"There has been a significant increase across the globe in the number and severity of natural disasters caused, particularly, by the impact of climate change."
"The humanitarian context has changed profoundly in recent years, hence, the need to improve the EU's disaster response capability."
"I believe that the European Union must invest greater efforts in disaster risk reduction and provide support - in addition to one-off aid - for local communities' disaster-preparedness capabilities."
"It is worrying that violations of international humanitarian law are increasingly common and the situation in the field is deteriorating."
"I agree that the European Union must take action to improve the coordination of humanitarian aid and stop any kind of abuse of this aid."
"There were many humanitarian crises in 2010: Haiti, Pakistan, and I could go on."
"The tragedies that certain populations, often the most disadvantaged ones, experience throughout the world require swift and effective action by international organisations but also by the European Union, which is a major player in the fields of development assistance and crisis management."
"Hence, today, Tuesday 18 January, we have adopted Mrs Striffler's report in order to call for increased funding for humanitarian aid."
"We should also create a European rapid reaction force for all these crises."
"The European Commission is receptive to this idea, and it ought to present a proposal with a view to optimising the existing civil protection system."
"Clearly, we will have to use the resources that are already available in the Member States but, at the same time, we also need to coordinate ourselves in a much more effective and much more practical manner."
"Slow responses, duplicated aid and inconsistency on the ground are just some of the things that we need to eliminate."
"There is great scope for improvement, and the resolution adopted by this House is intended to provide an initial response along these lines."
"I voted in favour of Parliament's report on implementation of the European Consensus on humanitarian aid: the mid-term review of its action plan and the way forward."
"The European Consensus on humanitarian aid commits the Union to close cooperation around a shared vision of humanitarian aid."
"The Consensus aims to improve the European Union's effectiveness, to defend and promote the basic humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, and to advocate the observance of international humanitarian law."
"When the mid-term review was carried out, it was observed that there is a lack of specific information about actions undertaken or yet to be taken, and that apart from representatives involved in humanitarian work, few people have any awareness of the Consensus."
"A major effort is therefore required to raise the profile of the Consensus and make the Member States, other institutions and military bodies more familiar with it."
"The humanitarian context has changed profoundly in recent years, making it all the more important that the European Consensus on humanitarian aid be applied rigorously and energetically."
"I would like to stress the need to invest greater efforts in disaster risk reduction and to provide support - in addition to one-off aid - for communities' own disaster-preparedness capabilities."
"In addition, more efforts ought to be focused on incorporating gender and protection against sexual violence, which is increasingly being used as a weapon of war, into humanitarian responses."
"The European Union is the biggest donor in the world, contributing 40% of the global aid provided."
"More than 100 million people in 70 plus countries received aid amounting to nearly EUR 1 billion from the European Union in 2009."
"Unfortunately, however, we very often advocate making donations to states which choose later on to accept direct foreign investments from China."
"Donations and investments perhaps ought to be at least coordinated instead of us bemoaning the fact that China has become the second biggest economy in the world."
"The humanitarian context has changed profoundly in recent years, making it all the more relevant that the Humanitarian Consensus be applied rigorously and robustly."
"In this changing context, the first factor to mention is the significant increase in the number and severity of natural disasters caused mainly by climate change."
"This implies a need also to provide, in addition to one-off aid, support for communities' own disaster-preparedness capabilities."
"Political undertakings to this effect have been made - in the form of the EU strategy and the Hyogo action plan - but they are still fraught with problems in terms of their implementation."
"in writing. - UKIP believes that the best reaction to a humanitarian disaster is for independent nation states to coordinate their aid efforts voluntarily, and not to have them set centrally by the undemocratic EU."
"We note the debacle of the EU's slow and small efforts in Haiti, and thus we feel that the EU cannot be trusted in future humanitarian crises."
"I voted in favour of this report because the European Union is the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid, contributing more than 40% of all official international humanitarian assistance."
"In 2009, it granted humanitarian aid to approximately 115 million people in more than 70 countries, to a total of EUR 950 million."
"Through its humanitarian policy, the European Union has demonstrated its commitment to supporting people in situations of extreme vulnerability in third countries."
"I agree with the mid-term review of the humanitarian consensus as I believe that it is vital to make an effort to increase its visibility among Member States, the other institutions and military players."
"I would urge the Commission to redouble its efforts in reducing disaster risk, and to pay attention to the ever increasing violations of international humanitarian law and to the most vulnerable groups, such as women, children and people who have been forcibly displaced."
"It is also important to encourage dialogue between the political, military or humanitarian bodies active in the same working environment, along with the creation of a European rapid reaction capacity, namely, a European civil protection force."
"I voted against the report on humanitarian aid for two reasons."
"Initially, because it insists on linking civil protection and humanitarian aid with the European External Action Service and its foreign policy, whereas, obviously, intervention criteria should be clearly humanitarian and humanitarian alone."
"Also, because I do not believe that linking civil and military capabilities in order to deal with humanitarian crisis situations is a move in the right direction."
"Obviously, particular knowledge and the use of special equipment, which has always been owned and used by the military, are needed in certain circumstances."
"Therefore, in order to preserve and safeguard the purely civil character of humanitarian missions, civil protection could be financed so that it has such specific equipment and, of course, so that civil protection workers can be trained, rather than keeping up all this military spending."
"It is the only way to provide real and effective help in humanitarian crises without facing the dangers of a military presence."
"While carrying out the mid-term review of the European Consensus on humanitarian aid, I cannot fail to point out that it is regrettable that public awareness of it has not been at the desired level and that the Member States have played little part in implementing it."
"However, instead of finding fault, we must promote and set out the path that we should be following as regards humanitarian aid."
"The humanitarian situation has changed a fair amount in recent years, with natural disasters, more displaced persons, the multiplication of various internal conflicts, food crises, etc. More than ever, there is an urgent need for a balanced and effective global reaction that is based on specific needs, is results-oriented, and is guided by the principle that saving means of subsistence is saving lives, whilst considering the involved areas' need for self-development and self-sufficiency."
"To achieve this, it is crucial for the Consensus to promote these humanitarian values, and for various players to optimise resources."
"Once again, I would argue that there is an urgent need to create a European Civil Protection Force following the Barnier report of May 2006."
"I would congratulate my colleague, Mrs Striffler, on the positive content of the proposals she has tabled, and I would reiterate my position that the Consensus is an essential instrument, with every relevance to the current situation."
"The Humanitarian Consensus is a key instrument which especially shows its worth in the current humanitarian context of profound change."
"We have witnessed the significant increase in the number and severity of natural disasters caused mainly by the impact of climate change, the increasing incidence of complex crises, especially internal conflicts, as well as the changing nature of conflicts, many of which entail the displacement of huge numbers of people."
"Violations of international humanitarian law are increasingly common."
"One particularly shocking aspect of such violations is the increasing use of sexual violence as a weapon of war."
"I support the rapporteur's position and I think that strong measures are required to increase protection against acts of sexual violence in humanitarian circumstances."
"I concur with the position of the report's author, indicating that the recent humanitarian disasters in Haiti and Pakistan have demonstrated once again the need to improve the EU's disaster-response capability in terms of effectiveness, speed of response, coordination and visibility."
"I also support the creation of a European rapid response capability (European civil protection force)."
"The European Consensus on humanitarian aid reached on 18 December 2007 by Parliament, the Council and the Commission represented an important step forward in terms of the definition, scope and spectrum of European humanitarian aid."
"We are proceeding with this report, the conclusions of which I strongly support, to its mid-term review, as envisaged in the Action Plan of May 2008."
"At this juncture, I would like to congratulate Mrs Striffler on the excellent work that she has done."
"As regards the ideas expressed in the report, I would like to highlight the emphasis on 'genuine and continuous... participation... of beneficiaries in the management of aid'."
"I have been advocating this principle, which should lead the EU to focus its action increasingly on civil society and local authorities."
"This will reduce the focus on EU-Member State relations, which should continue to play a role, but not in an exclusive relationship, as it has often manifested itself up until now."
"I would also like to highlight the need to submit proposals aimed at 'the establishment of a European civil protection force, based on optimising the existing Community Civil Protection Mechanism and pooling existing national resources,' which would mean an increase in the marginal cost for synergies achieved, through the capacity that has already been established in the Member States."
"Humanitarian aid now has a larger and more important role than in the past."
"Differing rates of development and growing inequality in opportunity and resource distribution in geographical, social and generational terms, increasing climate change (for which humans are partly to blame) and the associated increase in natural disasters, increased environmental pollution, imbalanced anthropic pressure concentrated in large urban areas, and uneven population growth in some areas of the planet, have led to a rising number of humanitarian disasters in which aid takes on an essential role in restoring basic living conditions and human dignity."
"In view of this, if humanitarian aid is needed to assist people hit by disasters, then in turn, any interventions as a result of EU foreign policy - which is still to be defined - cannot be apportioned according to each Member State's areas of interest and influence, but should take on a European dimension."
"in writing. - I support this report on implementation of the European consensus on humanitarian aid."
"The EU's humanitarian policy is the practical expression of its commitment to supporting people in need of assistance when they are at their most vulnerable."
"The European Union is the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid."
"Its contribution represents more than 40% of all official international humanitarian assistance."
"In 2009, we provided a total of EUR 950 million to approximately 115 million people in more than 70 countries."
"The European Consensus on humanitarian aid, signed on 18 December 2007, underscores the will of the EU to cooperate closely in this field in order to be as effective as possible, to defend and promote the basic humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, and actively to advocate the observance of international humanitarian law."
"There are many challenges ahead."
"The recent humanitarian disasters in Haiti and Pakistan demonstrated once again that the EU's disaster-response capability needs to be greatly enhanced."
"Disaster risk reduction needs to be fully integrated into policies for development aid and humanitarian aid."
"We also need clarification on the use of military and civil protection resources and capabilities in accordance with the consensus and the UN guidelines."
"The recent humanitarian disasters in Haiti and Pakistan demonstrated once again the need to improve the EU's disaster response capability in terms of effectiveness, coordination and visibility."
"That is why I voted in favour of this report, which advocates the establishment of a European rapid reaction capability (European civil protection force) - a concept launched by Commissioner Barnier following the tsunami in Asia and repeatedly urged since then by the European Parliament."
"This capability should constitute an optimisation of the tools already available, which would become more effective and visible, the aim being to enable, through closer cooperation, the immediate mobilisation of all necessary resources."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the action plan of the European Consensus needs to be reviewed."
"The humanitarian situation has changed significantly in recent years, not least with the significantly increasing number and severity of natural disasters, which are also caused by the impact of climate change."
"It is essential to fully integrate disaster risk reduction into policies for development aid and humanitarian aid, making it all the more important that the Humanitarian Consensus be applied rigorously and energetically."
"It is clear that disaster situations and humanitarian emergencies are multiplying throughout the world today."
"The European Union has been taking on an important role in combating these scourges, and I hope that it will continue to do so and even that it will strengthen this role, in as far as is possible."
"However, it is not enough to give a hungry person a fish: they must be taught to fish."
"I think that helping to provide less well-off countries with human and material resources capable of facing up to future crises is almost as important as confronting emergencies that occur."
"The European Consensus on humanitarian aid merits my support, and I hope that the compromise between the European institutions will translate into making increasingly better use of the resources available to the Union, whilst always prioritising giving to those who have least and suffer most, and total neutrality in terms of political or ideological agendas."
"In recent years, the world has witnessed a significant rise in disasters, in terms of both the geographic area affected and the number of victims."
"Although it is a matter of great importance, it does not fall within the scope of this discussion to address the impact of climate change on these disasters."
"The signing of the European Consensus on humanitarian aid by the Council of the European Union, Parliament and the Commission on 18 December 2007 represented a significant step forward in terms of humanitarian aid, especially as an action plan was envisaged for five years, providing for a mid-term review."
"That is the objective of this report."
"The whole world knows and recognises the key role of the EU in humanitarian aid."
"Parliament has tackled this issue at several sittings, particularly through our speeches."
"Indeed, recent events in Brazil, Haiti, Pakistan, Madeira and other places cause us to ponder the effectiveness of support for civil protection and humanitarian aid."
"As was demonstrated in this report, in spite of the limited information available, there are positive developments at a European level, as evidenced by the creation of the Council's Working Party on Humanitarian Aid and Food Aid."
"However, much remains to be done."
"The EU's so-called 'humanitarian aid' plays a not insignificant role in what is increasingly defined as its foreign policy."
"It frequently makes use of genuine needs for aid and cooperation to which it is important to respond, particularly emergencies, whilst a great variety of objectives are being pursued in practice."
"The actions taken and the methods used, which include military intervention and occupation, seek to reproduce and deepen forms of political and economic domination, and to attempt to control the markets and natural resources of developing countries."
"Against the current backdrop of the deepening crisis of capitalism, these intentions also never fail to include the containing of peoples' struggles for greater justice and social progress, taking on diverse expressions and forms all over the world."
"Disguised by supposed 'humanitarian' interests, a number of non-governmental organisations, logistics companies and others are beneficiaries of and accomplices to these policies, promoting their own interests and those of their backers; these interests may be public or private, and may include political, financial or religious motivations, amongst others."
"In principle, we are in favour of specific expressions of solidarity with the victims of any type of disaster or conflict."
"However, these must be based on the interests of these peoples, on respect for international law, and on the independence and sovereignty of these countries."
"I believe that we must improve the tools available to the European Union for responding to the kind of disasters that Haiti has endured, with the earthquake just a year ago followed by the more recent cholera epidemic."
"My group and I believe that we must promote increased funding for humanitarian aid so as to allow for more interventions, in particular, to help the most vulnerable people."
"In doing so, we must ensure that we make a clear distinction between the remits of military and humanitarian bodies, since military resources should be used as little as possible and as a last resort."
"in writing. - The EU as a bloc is the world's largest contributor of humanitarian aid."
"Nevertheless, recent catastrophes have highlighted certain shortcomings in the EU's ability to act in a speedy, efficient and coordinated manner."
"The Striffler reports underlines some of these concerns and it is to be hoped that positive action results from today's vote."
"I agreed with this report because this report is not only a formal exercise but also an opportunity to reflect on humanitarian aid today."
"The humanitarian context has changed profoundly in recent years."
"In this changing context, the first factor to highlight is the significant increase in the number and severity of natural disasters caused, particularly, by the impact of climate change."
"This implies a need to invest greater efforts in disaster risk reduction and to provide support - in addition to one-off aid - for communities' own disaster-preparedness capabilities."
"Further factors are the increasing incidence of complex crises, especially internal conflicts, and the changing nature of conflicts, many of which entail the displacement of huge numbers of people (refugees and internally displaced persons), as well as increased violence against civilians."
"Violations of international humanitarian law are increasingly common and the situation in the field is deteriorating."
"One particularly shocking aspect of such violations is the increasing use of sexual violence as a weapon of war."
"Major efforts ought to be focused on incorporating protection against sexual violence into humanitarian responses."
"Therefore, more specific attention should be directed at the most vulnerable groups of people, including women, children and people who have been forcibly displaced (whether internally or as refugees)."
"The recent humanitarian disasters in Haiti and Pakistan demonstrated once again the need to improve the EU's disaster-response capability in terms of effectiveness, coordination and visibility."
"A year on from the earthquake in Haiti, we can see that the steps we are taking, or the way in which we are helping, are not perfect."
"For this reason, the European consensus that arose to facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid must not be squandered."
"The EU, as one of the richest and most developed regions in the world, has a moral duty to help the weak and those in need."
"In particular, we must maintain solidarity with the victims of natural disasters and catastrophes who are not prepared for what happens to them."
"We should, therefore, take action to strengthen cooperation between Member States in this area and facilitate the sharing of best practices."
"We should do everything so that the aid system is efficient and effective and not one cent is wasted."
"Cooperation is, therefore, necessary with other international, non-governmental bodies and organisations that also provide aid, in order to make this more effective."
"I voted in favour of the Striffler report because there is still a great need to emphasise the importance and, hence, the sensitivity of this issue."
"Parliament's aim, with its vote, was to stress the need for the European Union's objective to become one of upholding the human rights of neutrality, impartiality and independence."
"As far as solidarity is concerned, we are never fully prepared or equipped with excellent plans."
"We must increasingly urge all the European players, including the Commission and the individual Member States, to encourage the promotion of universal respect for human rights."
"For my part, I shall continue to support this modus vivendi, including within the Committee on Budgets, of which I am a member, and to support any measures designed to increase the financial assistance given to those activities that are more specifically aimed at safeguarding these important rights, so that the European Union continues its efforts to assist and support the sections of the population that need it most."
"A dramatic rise has been seen recently in the number and severity of natural disasters, whether man-made or not, along with an increase in the adverse impact caused by violations of international humanitarian law and poor governance."
"As is well known, the European Union is the world's number one donor of humanitarian aid, contributing approximately 40% of official international humanitarian assistance."
"This is borne out by the 115 million recipients of aid from approximately 70 countries who have benefited from a total contribution of nearly EUR 1 billion."
"I voted for this consensus as I think that the EU demonstrates in action through its humanitarian policy its commitment to people who are truly in need of aid."
"In this respect, we need sufficient human and material resources and we must support improved coordination between the institutions and organisations involved in this process."
