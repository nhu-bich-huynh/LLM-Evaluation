"In connection with the Sterckx report - although of course everything it contains is very attractive - I must say, as a representative of a new Member State, that this will cost us a great deal, especially if we have to do this in the first ten years before the introduction of free movement of persons and the introduction of the euro."
"This is very, very difficult."
"I do not wish to oppose what is written in this report: as a goal it is very good, but in terms of timing, things do not fit together completely, and I would like it very much if such a degree of obligation were brought in only after the introduction of the euro and of the free movement of persons."
"Actually, with liberalisation, quality will also improve, so that there will probably not be such serious problems in the future, but once again I repeat: we need to synchronise."
"(SK) Mr President, I congratulate you on your new role."
"In order to improve the competitiveness of railways vis-Ã -vis road transport and to place railways on an equal footing in terms of competing for business, it is necessary to complete the harmonisation of the conditions governing railway and road transport operations."
"In the energy sector we are unbundling transmission systems from energy suppliers; in the railway transport sector as well, it is necessary to complete the reform of those state-owned railway companies that still have carriers and infrastructure operators in one and the same organisation."
"The fact that road transport is flourishing, even in those countries where rail transport would be more appropriate from an environmental standpoint, is due to inadequate harmonisation, external factors, faulty interoperability and flawed transformation, as well as the poor quality of rail transport."
"The second key factor is market liberalisation."
"When opening up rail networks for passenger transport, however, it will be necessary to give the economies of the new Member States enough time to prepare themselves for this step."
"(PT) Thank you very much, Mr President, I also wish to congratulate you on your election and wish you all the best in your new post."
"The liberalisation of rail transport is something that needs to be brought about, but progress has been painstaking."
"We must therefore keep up the effort to move ever closer to a European rail services market, which will help us implement the important objectives of the common transport policy."
"In this regard, I should like to congratulate our rapporteurs on their outstanding work."
"Although, for many, trains still have an image of romanticism and adventure derived partly from the famous Orient Express, the fact is that they are a safe, environmentally friendly means of transport that is adept at moving large quantities of goods quickly and at conveying large numbers of people comfortably and equally quickly."
"The dream of rail services from the Atlantic to the Baltic and Black Seas remains a distant one, as we continue to come up against major obstacles to effective freedom of movement in the rail sector."
"The problem remains of discrepancies between, for example, gauges inside and outside the Iberian Peninsula, as do those of the management of internal and international traffic and of ticketing, which are not easy matters to resolve."
"We face enormous difficulties and, without the will of the Member States, we will not be able to overcome them."
"Congestion in Central Europe and the accessibility of Europe's outlying regions are intimately linked."
"If we want to see the economic growth of our countries, joint measures are required whereby development in one area ties in with progress in another."
"The funding approved for the Trans-European Networks does not fill us with overwhelming enthusiasm. We must therefore derive some satisfaction from the progress for which we shall hopefully vote tomorrow."
"In its diversity, Parliament is doing its best, but the Council must respond positively to this impetus for progress and for the liberalisation of rail transport."
"How can this be achieved?"
"It can be achieved by acknowledging that the deadlines for opening up the networks are reasonable and by not imposing unfair economic restrictions on this process; by accepting compromise solutions for existing concessions and for public service obligations; by agreeing to the rules on the certification of onboard staff in the interests of the security of people and property; and lastly by ensuring universal protection for the rights of all passengers."
"Along with quality of service, this is the best way of attracting people to this means of transport, thereby ensuring its development and continued employment for those working in the sector."
"(DE) Mr President, today we are discussing three essential steps that will help to breathe new life into Europe's railways and bring about a considerable improvement in passenger rights."
"I would like to focus on just one aspect of the overall package that fits in perfectly with the start of the European Year of Equal Opportunities."
"It is good that, in the regulation on rail passengers' rights and obligations, we are sending a signal and thus making our contribution to equal opportunities."
"It obviously makes no sense to enact a regulation that is only relevant to international passengers."
"In my view, all passengers should have equal rights."
"At the forefront is the right of all citizens to transport, but passengers can only assert their rights if they know what they are, which is why information is a necessity."
"I would call for all people with limited mobility, regardless of whether it is due to disability, age or another factor, to have equal opportunities to travel by rail."
"It is quite clear that we need to work continuously to improve barrier-free accessibility. It is also clear, though, that is not possible to adapt all vehicles and all buildings straight away to meet the needs of these people."
"Once the regulation enters into force, station operators and railway companies will have to pay particular attention to ensuring that people with limited mobility can get information regarding the accessibility of railway services, the conditions for accessing trains and the facilities on the trains."
"To ensure that, in particular, passengers with sensory impairments are provided with information regarding delays as efficiently as possible, we would call for information announcements to be made using both acoustic and visual systems."
"In future, people with restricted mobility will be able to buy tickets on the train without paying a supplement, and, if a person cannot access the services provided in the train due to their restricted mobility, they will be able to be accompanied by another person who will travel for free."
"A social Europe is on its way!"
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to congratulate you most warmly."
"You ran a very good race."
"11 October 2006 was a very dark day for the French railways and for the Luxembourg railways."
"On a twin-track section of line, temporarily being used as a single track as a result of works, a collision between two trains killed six people and seriously wounded two."
"A passenger train from Luxembourg collided with a freight train in French territory."
"The accident, which, according to the enquiry, was due to a human signalling error on the Luxembourg side, was particularly tragic, since the signalman, having become aware of the error, triggered via the station to train radio an initial piercing alarm, which did not reach the driver of the passenger train."
"He then wanted to switch off the current on the line, but it was not possible due to the difference in power supply between the two countries."
"Furthermore, the Luxembourg train had already entered the French network and was therefore out of his reach."
"Commissioner, this example illustrates the danger of a lack of coordination between rail networks, whether they be privatised or still under the public service system."
"The responsibility falls as much to the signalman as to the two companies and the authorities of the two Member States, and also to the lack of a sustained will to make rail networks interoperable."
"The citizens will not find it acceptable that, by crossing the border by train, they are risking their lives as a result of inadequate systems."
"For Luxembourg, international traffic represents 70% of its turnover."
"Our situation is therefore a special one, and even more efforts are required in order to achieve interoperability of networks."
"This is a key priority."
"If our Parliament's Committee on Transport's approach leads to investments in the railways, then that is the right path to take."
"Mr President, first of all, like all of the Members who have congratulated you warmly, I too would like to say what a pleasure it is to take part in this sitting over which you are presiding."
"I would like to thank all of the Members."
"We have had more than forty speeches, and I have seen that there is great interest in the future of Europe's railways."
"I thank you, because the Commission and myself see this as an absolute priority."
"I would like to make a few brief comments, Mr President."
"First of all, I would like to point out that the Commission is not opposed in principle to the opening up to competition of domestic services, but that it believes that a decision within the context of the third rail package would be premature."
"The Commission will continue to examine the issue and if it feels that the circumstances are right, it will be able to exercise its right of initiative in the field."
"I would add that we also have the possibility of introducing competition elements, particularly by means of the text on the regulation of public service obligations, which itself is based on contractualisation, transparency and a degree of opening up to competition, while respecting subsidiarity."
"I believe that the Commission's position has been clearly expressed in what I have said."
"On the second point, I note that there is unanimity on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains, and what Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges has just said to us demonstrates the absolute need for technical interoperability, but also for human interoperability."
"Crew members responsible for rail safety, including drivers and all staff participating in the operation of the train, must receive training in accordance with their responsibilities."
"I entirely agree with Mr Savary on this point."
"Finally, the third proposal, which appears in Mr Sterckx's report, has the merit of covering domestic services, while providing for a system of temporary exemption."
"That seems to me to be a very good basis for future negotiations."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to say, to Mr Grosch in particular, that we have not forgotten the fourth element of this rail package, which is the quality of freight."
"The Commission has not forgotten this issue, which is important in terms of revitalising rail freight in Europe."
"It has regular contacts with the associations representing freight customers, and I shall produce a report on the development of the quality of freight in Europe before the end of the year, as was indicated at first reading."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those are the comments I wished to make at the end of this debate, a debate that has genuinely demonstrated Parliament's interest in promoting the railways, both for passengers and for freight."
"I hope that everybody, in their soul and conscience, will vote in a way that will allow us to move forward."
"I would add that I am prepared to be fully involved in the delicate and difficult task of mediating between Parliament and the Council with a view to concluding this third rail package."
"(FR) I am delighted that rail passengers are finally going to have rights, particularly in relation to compensation, information and facilities for persons with reduced mobility."
"With regard to Mr Jarzembowski's report, while the liberalisation of international passenger transport is a good thing, which increases the efficiency of that mode of transport, I do not agree with the rapporteur's views on the opening up to competition of national traffic."
"If this Parliament votes for total liberalisation of rail traffic tomorrow, I would like to be certain that you have taken account of two fundamental points."
"First of all, the issue of standardisation."
"We adopted an amendment to that effect in committee."
"It should allow loss-making railway lines to continue to be funded if they meet public service objectives."
"Secondly, if Parliament decides to open up national rail traffic to competition, I feel that it is important to ensure that, during the transitional period in which only international traffic is opened up, we prevent the veiled opening up of national passenger transport through the practice of cabotage."
"The transitional period is necessary in order to allow rail companies to adapt."
"(EL) The 'third package of measures' on rail transport in the ÎU paves the way for full liberalisation, in other words for the railways to be handed over to the monopolies, in order to safeguard and increase the profits of euro-unifying capital."
"The EU measures to date in this sector also have sent ticket prices rocketing, resulted in thousands of redundancies, exacerbated the workers' slavery, struck at their wage and social rights and caused the number of accidents to spiral, despite the insulting government subsidies in the Member States."
"The liberalisation of rail services also and the terms and conditions for certifying the qualifications of workers laid down by the ÎU signal the intensification of their exploitation, greater intensification of labour and more risks to passenger safety."
"The hypocritical pronouncements about institutionalising passenger rights simply 'cloak' the painful consequences of liberalisation for railway workers and passengers."
"The basic conclusion is that, within this framework of the exploitative system which operates on the basis of profit for capital, this social requirement cannot be satisfied by the monopolies, which is why radical change is needed."
"The Greek Communist Party voices its categorical opposition to the anti-grassroots policy of the ÎU and has voted against the third package of measures to liberalise rail transport."
"Amendment of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation by Mr Ribeiro e Castro on behalf of the Committee on Development on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion of the Agreement amending the Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000 (6987/2006 - C6-0124/2006 -."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, firstly, I wish to congratulate you on your election."
"Ladies and gentlemen, almost 800 million people are now covered by the Cotonou Agreement, which, following on from the LomÃ© establishing agreement, has guided relations between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries since 2000."
"I sincerely hope that these relations will be increasingly close and mutually beneficial."
"The assent contained in my report, which I call on the Chamber to support, concerns the first five-yearly revision of the agreement, pursuant to Article 95 thereof."
"Despite the fact that the amendments put forward are deliberately limited - after all, the stability of agreements of this type and size should be maintained - they are generally to be welcomed."
"They are aimed at improving the effectiveness of compliance with the LomÃ©/Cotonou acquis, which is based primarily on equality between the parties and on respect for human rights, democracy, the rule of law and good governance."
"After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, we were able to include references to human rights and subsequently, in 2000, to provide for a stronger political dimension to our relations and to give priority to fighting poverty and improving our economic and financial partnership."
"The 2005 revision, on the other hand, strengthened the aspect of political dialogue, which became more systematic, structured and formalised, with a view to helping prevent and resolve crises."
"Other aspects that should be brought into the body of the agreement include combating terrorism, given its pressing, topical nature, and reference to the Millennium Goals, which bind the EU-ACP joint commitment to reducing poverty and improving levels of education and health, without which there cannot be genuine development."
"Other issues that form part of this revision are decentralised local authorities, prevention of mercenary activities, promotion of traditional knowledge, prevention of HIV-AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and encouragement of student and youth exchanges, all of which demonstrates the signatories' greater awareness of the specific problems and aspirations of the people of ACP countries."
"I must also highlight, and welcome, the fact that, for the first time, express reference is made to national parliaments as aid recipients."
"The development of parliamentary capacity is key to ensuring good governance and to ensuring that there is full public debate on the development policy choices and priorities of each of the recipient countries."
"Many of the countries to which the Union sends substantial aid as part of the Cotonou framework integrate these funds into their budgets."
"Nevertheless, there have been many complaints that the funds sent have not always made an effective contribution, in terms of what is necessary and desirable, to promoting and firmly establishing these values."
"There have also been frequent criticisms that the countries concerned often distribute European funds in a way that is discriminatory and arbitrary and that public administration is not always objective and impartial."
"This type of situation flies in the face of the core principles that underpin the award of EU funds. The Community institutions must therefore bring in tighter conditions as regards involving all of the political forces and the civil society of the recipient countries in discussing and defining the priorities for using the aid awarded."
"As I proposed at the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which adopted this suggestion in November 2005 at the Edinburgh summit, this process of inculcating a sense of responsibility and of raising awareness at national level could take the form of an annual parliamentary debate in each national parliament of the recipient countries specifically focusing on external aid."
"This should take place ideally some time before each country's annual debate on the national budget and would have the benefit of strengthening democratic institutions and of encouraging the people to exercise their rights as citizens."
"Thus, as part of the agreement and the main body set up by the agreement, a spirit conducive to the crucial involvement of parliaments in programming and monitoring cooperation and in assessing the impact of such cooperation in the countries concerned would be created."
"It is our duty to persevere with, promote and support this effort."
"Notwithstanding the amendments, the most important of which I have highlighted, the Cape Verde Foreign Minster, speaking on behalf of the ACP countries, felt that the simplification of the administrative procedures applicable to access to the European Development Fund could have gone much further."
"I share this concern and feel it is right to echo it here and ask the Council and the Commission to take it into account in future revisions."
"To conclude, I invite the Members of this House to give their assent and urge Parliament, the Council and the Commission to do all they can to maintain and, where possible, to increase targeted, responsible aid to the ACP countries in the future."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ribeiro e Castro and the Committee on Development for their positive assessment of the amendment of the Cotonou agreement, which is the cornerstone of the partnership between the ACP countries and the European Union."
"This amendment will enable us to enhance our partnership and to extend it to security issues such as the fight against terrorism, the prevention of mercenary activities and the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"Thanks to that agreement, there will be a more systematic, more institutional, dialogue on issues involving human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"That dialogue will take place before the launch of the consultation procedure, known as the Rule 96 procedure, except in cases of particular urgency."
"I would like to stress the increased role of national parliaments and of the joint parliamentary assembly within this context."
"Furthermore, the revised agreement maintains a volume of aid identical to that provided for in the ninth European Development Fund with the addition of inflation, the impact of European Union GDP growth and the accession of ten new Member States in 2004."
"As you know, that decision in principle was translated, at the meeting of the ACP-EU Council of Ministers in Port-Moresby in June 2006, into a commitment of around EUR 22 billion."
"That is the total sum of the 10th European Development fund for geographical cooperation with the ACP countries for the six-year period from 2008 to 2013."
"On an annual basis, that represents a nominal increase of 35% compared to the 9th European Development Fund."
"Finally, since no money provided for in the 9th European Development Fund can be committed after 31 December 2007, it is essential that the review of the Cotonou Agreement, and of what is known as the internal agreement of the 10th European Development Fund, is ratified by all of the Member States before the end of 2007."
"Otherwise, the operations of the 10th European Development Fund will be unable to begin on 1 January 2008."
"I am convinced, and I am speaking on behalf of my colleague Louis Michel, that the assent of the European Parliament will send a strong signal to the Member States and will speed up the internal ratification procedures."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, I would like you to know first of all that I am very happy to see you holding this Presidency."
"It is rare to see women in that position."
"The review of the Cotonou Agreement was a significant challenge."
"We would like to give it real political content by refocusing it on the Millennium objectives and the eradication of poverty."
"It should be acknowledged, however, that this revision does not entirely live up to its ambitions."
"Our group has had the opportunity to express its disagreement on several occasions on two points in particular."
"The first relates to the integration of two commitments into the fundamental values of the agreement: one relating to terrorism, the other to weapons of mass destruction."
"We are not opposed to them as such, but we feel that the principles of democracy and respect for human rights must remain the main benchmarks of this agreement."
"My second point relates to the financial dimension."
"The tenth EDF, which has been the subject of tough negotiations, could not be integrated into the revised agreement."
"Nevertheless, we are not now proposing that the assent be refused, firstly because progress has been made on many points, such as enhancement of political dialogue, the reference to national parliaments as beneficiaries of aid and support for the International Criminal Court from signatories of the agreement."
"Secondly, because our ACP partners themselves have accepted the revised agreement and are eager to implement its financial chapter, for which I believe we have obtained a more or less acceptable sum."
"It is therefore pointless to look back."
"From now on we have a new battle to wage."
"We must be certain that every euro genuinely contributes to achieving the development objectives and therefore ensure that the programming of the tenth EDF is better."
"For example, by setting political objectives that would consist in allocating 20% of the sums to basic education or health in the ACP countries, or by attaching more importance than we currently do to the gender dimension in our development policy."
"That is the work facing us over the coming weeks, ladies and gentlemen."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the new provision for building parliamentary capacity in ACP countries is particularly welcome."
"In recent years the European Union has committed increasing resources to election observation missions in ACP countries, but those of us who have acted as observers are acutely aware that a well-conducted election is only the very first step in the process of establishing good governance."
"Too many newly-elected parliaments have struggled in the absence of a trained civil service, or any opportunity to look at best practice in areas such as budget control, so the specific reference to enhancing parliamentary capacity is very important."
"However, the fact that MEPs' involvement in the Cotonou Agreement is limited to the assent procedure is frustrating, especially as we take on new areas of scrutiny under the Development Cooperation Instrument."
"It would be helpful for us to have at least some input into the formulation of ACP countries' strategy papers, which are the key instrument for the development of the Millennium Development Goals, now specifically referred to in the partnership agreement."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing the revision of a complex agreement, the Cotonou Agreement, which contains 100 articles, 6 parts, 5 annexes and 5 protocols."
"This revised agreement contains the whole catalogue of today's politics, with human rights, democracy, terrorism, arms, the International Criminal Court."
"All the ACP countries need now is REACH, since they risk being victims of the regulation on chemical products, with losses of income and 315 000 jobs under threat."
"Metals, alcohol, oils, ammonia, which are exported from 24 major ACP countries, will be hit by REACH, representing a potential loss of income of EUR 6 billion for those countries."
"That takes us to the real truth about Europe's relations with the ACP countries over the last thirty years."
"From the YaoundÃ© agreement of 1963 up to the Cotonou Agreement of 2000, revised in 2005, and the LomÃ© I, II, III and IV agreements from 1975 onwards, it appears that Europe has been audacious, particularly with the Stabex mechanism, which has protected cocoa, tea, coffee and groundnuts."
"This demonstrates the spirit of the compensatory inequalities of the CNUCED."
"Europe has also been generous by means of financial aid from the EDF."
"Mr Barrot pointed out that there is an allocation of around EUR 25 billion for the 79 ACP countries in the 9th EDF."
"The reality is different, however."
"According to the figures, the ACP countries' share in the Union market has dropped from 6.7% in 1976 to 3% in 1998, and while the GDP of a European increased by an average of 2.3% per year, that of an African from an ACP country, if I dare say it, increased by just 0.6%."
"In terms of actions too, Europe has forgotten about the ACP countries, just as it has forgotten about the Mediterranean."
"Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Europe has been interested in the East, but no longer in the South."
"And what is worse, with the WTO, Europe has swallowed up the ACP countries in the world market, as we have seen in the case of sugar and bananas."
"The multinational banana producer Chiquita has been given preference over Cameroon, which produces bananas, and the Ivory Coast."
"Ultra-liberal Europe has chosen to make a customs gift of around EUR 2 billion to the multinationals Chiquita, Del Monte and others, rather than to the ACP countries, which have to face the same competition conditions as these multinationals."
"Cotonou, with its talk of democracy and dialogue, is all very well, but when people have AIDS, human rights are not going to cure them."
"In other words, rather than being revised, the Cotonou Agreement should be re-worked so as to be audacious in two respects."
"Firstly, technical audacity through a new customs technology: rather than seeking, within the World Trade Organisation, to reduce, and eventually abolish, customs duties, we must establish a deduction of customs duties in the form of a customs credit deductible on all purchases in the economy of the importing country."
"This customs credit would be reimbursable, that is to say, it would be higher than the sum of the customs duty paid, for example by the ACP country."
"With new customs duties that are flexible, reimbursable and negotiable on the world stock market, Europe-ACP relations would be consistent with the necessary free trade and the equally necessary protection of the ACP countries."
"Secondly, we should show political audacity in a reworked Cotonou Agreement."
"With globalisation, the challenge of the 21st century consists in organising the common aspects of planetary co-ownership - that is to say, water, food, basic medicines and vaccines and education - all with a resource other than the classic State contribution of the EDF, a fiscal resource such as VAT based on the turnover of telecommunications services provided by space satellites."
"In this case, we would no longer provide improved assistance in the name of co-development, but we would gradually move towards global land management."
"That would restore the spirit of LomÃ©, and we would finally begin to build the world, which is the challenge of the 21st century."
"(NL) Madam President, I am delighted that this week in Strasbourg, we are able to vote on the first five-yearly review of the Cotonou Agreement since we concluded it in 2000 for a 20-year period."
"This agreement covers 78 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean and involves no fewer than some 750 million people."
"It is a partnership agreement about aid and trade and sets an example others should follow with regard to sustainable relations between the EU and development partners."
"Europe as a soft power in conflict prevention, good governance, the fight against corruption - these things mean that, together with the EU Member States, we can make the difference as far as the Millennium Objectives are concerned."
"From 1 January 2008, nearly EUR 24 billion, half of the total EU's development budget, will be available for a six-year period."
"This is why it would be useful for Parliament to monitor spending in respect of the European Development Fund, but unfortunately, Commissioner, this EDF budget is not incorporated in the EU's own, which is something you in the Commission and we in this House would both have wanted."
"In order to add meaning to the European Parliament's role, you, together with the Council - which is unfortunately absent today - will need to make specific agreements with us, as we did for the Development Cooperation Instrument, the DCI, which I would urge you to take as a model for the national policy documents of the ACP countries, in other words for more or less the whole of our Africa policy."
"This means that Parliament will be informed in good time, enabling it to make a meaningful contribution to the national policy documents."
"This will also translate into a clear and transparent process and an open dialogue between the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"Moreover, this will improve Parliament's input and scope for monitoring the programme, as well as implementing and assessing national policy documents."
"This will also mean that the people's representation is not far removed from us, or from them, the parliaments in those countries or society."
"Ownership is all very well, but this does not just involve the Finance Minister in a country like this; it also involves the parliament, the government and society."
"If we go down this road, then, we are faced with the weighty opinions of the parties involved, even before the policy has been signed and voted on."
"We want to move away from a situation where we all talk about the Millennium Objectives at the same time as Africa is actually moving further away from them, as is evident from the fact that we only appear to be filling in the cracks in the roads, however useful this may be."
"We want the Millennium Objectives to take centre stage in the ACP countries too."
"I would urge you to give this House democratic clout in respect of the EDF which amounts to half of the EU development budget."
"This will stand both the Commission and the Council in good stead."
"Pledge your support to democracy in Europe."
"Which steps do the Commission and Council intend to take in order to achieve this?"
"Thank you very much, Madam President, and congratulations."
"It is very good to see you in the Chair."
"As others have said, we are very proud of the fact that the Cotonou Partnership Agreement represents binding contractual agreements with 78 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries."
"It is, therefore, a very special relationship indeed."
"Commissioner, we regret the fact that the great flurry of activity that we saw in 2005 on development and funding for development did not, in fact, include a substantial increase in the contribution of Member States of the European Union to the European Development Fund for the ACP."
"The reality is that the 10th EDF represents only 0.28 % of Member States' GDP."
"That contradicts what you said in terms of how you saw the results of those negotiations."
"I agree with you on the pace of ratification; that remains of enormous concern."
"Only four Member States of the European Union and five of the ACP have currently ratified this part of the Agreement, and I think that is of some concern."
"I have some questions for you."
"I know you are not the Commissioner for Development, but perhaps if it is not possible for you answer them, you will pass them on."
"In Barbados, Commissioner Michel promised to submit the country strategy papers to ACP countries' parliaments for their scrutiny."
"I want to know whether progress has been made on this commitment, and whether we can have some description from the Commission on where we stand on that."
"Further to that, I would like to ask you whether you are prepared to enter into structural dialogue with the European Parliament on the country strategy papers for ACP countries."
"My colleague, Mr van den Berg, has said that we want the same status for the ACP as we have for the DCI country strategy papers."
"Furthermore, I want to know how the Commission responds to questions that, I think, we in the Parliament have to ask, for instance on budget support to a country like Haiti, which has been recognised by Transparency International as the most corrupt country in the world."
"How is it that the Commission is now proposing to give budget support to Haiti?"
"The same question applies to Equatorial Guinea."
"On our committee, we find it very difficult to understand those decisions."
"With regard to Togo, we see that the Commission is now prepared to normalise relations."
"We want to know where we stand on the 22 commitments: are they being fulfilled by Togo."
"At the Vienna JPA, the Commission promised to send details to us on the progress with Togo and we have, as yet, as I understand it from our secretariat, received absolutely no information on that."
"Finally, Commissioner, will you undertake to work more closely with the European Parliament on these issues in order to make sure that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly's views are taken into account?"
"I urge the Commission to answer the serious questions of this kind that we are addressing to you this evening."
"(FR) Madam President, please allow me to stress the curious aspect of this parliamentary consultation procedure."
"Our institution has been invited to give its assent to the conclusion of the revised Cotonou treaty, which was signed back in June 2005."
"By issuing our opinion today, we can only therefore approve something that has already been concluded."
"Nevertheless, the decision-making process with the ACP countries would benefit from being enriched by the participation of the European Parliament."
"Indeed, during the negotiations on the development cooperation instrument (DCI), we demonstrated our very significant added value and our capacity to defend interests other than those of the Commission and the Council."
"Having said that, I believe that the revised Cotonou Agreement represents considerable progress, particularly with regard to the role of local sectors in development policy: for the first time, their role has been clarified, and they are explicitly recognised as full partners in the political dialogue."
"We have just obtained the same recognition for the DCI."
"The great development challenges are faced at local level."
"The time has come to decentralise our development policy."
"Access to water, healthcare and education are social services provided locally by bodies that are close to their citizens."
"If European Union funds remain blocked at central government level, there will be no effective aid to benefit populations directly."
"That is one of the reasons why I welcome the adoption of the revised Cotonou Agreement."
"We must now remain vigilant in order to ensure that it is implemented."
"(PT) I too should like to congratulate you, Madam President."
"I also wish to congratulate Mr Ribeiro e Castro on his report and on the positive developments evidenced by this revision."
"I wish to highlight the support for the International Criminal Court and reference to the Millennium Development Goals, without which there could not be a development strategy."
"Furthermore, I should like to highlight the importance of the new cooperation clause on combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, an area in which the EU must do more in terms of close collaboration and technical assistance. We must also do more on the proliferation of small arms, which are the biggest killers in our partner countries."
"I must also admit to feeling a degree of frustration as regards EU-ACP relations in seeing our counterparts from some ACP countries in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly convey the official positions of their governments uncritically."
"We must clearly do more to strengthen national parliaments and their capacity to scrutinise the national budgets, and their budgets for cooperation and for fighting corruption."
"For its part, the EU must stop overlooking, and start using, the clauses laid down in this agreement aimed at urging signatory governments to put an end to serious violations of human rights and of the most fundamental principles of democracy and good governance."
"I join those MEPs who called on the Commission to involve Parliament in scrutinising cooperation policy with ACP countries."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, though it has come late, I am delighted that the European Parliament is being consulted on this subject."
"This evening's debate gives us an opportunity to express our satisfaction once again with the progress introduced by the revision of the agreement, particularly in terms of the improvements between partners, as a result of their policies on protecting human rights and promoting democracy."
"This consultation is also an opportunity to recall our concerns at the time when the text was being signed."
"I am thinking in particular of the article that makes the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction a fundamental aspect of the ACP-EU partnership."
"Having said that, I would like to stress, or recall, that the priority objective of the cooperation between the two regions was the fight against poverty and the fight for development."
"Since 2005, new concerns have arisen."
"They involve the future of our commercial relations with the ACP countries."
"How can we state, as in the case of the revised Cotonou Agreement, that the Millennium development objectives must underpin ACP-EU cooperation, without worrying about the consequences of future economic partnership agreements for the well-being of the populations of these countries, without carrying out an impact study prior to the launch of the negotiations?"
"How can we emphasise the importance of supporting regional integration organisations created by the ACP countries, while not respecting existing groupings in the negotiations and also knowing that, in the negotiations as they are currently conducted, we cannot take account of the interests of countries of different sizes and different levels of development?"
"The revision of the Cotonou Agreement has above all made it possible to highlight the importance of political dialogue amongst partners."
"It is on this basis that the European Union and the ACP countries must from now on work towards eliminating misunderstandings, make progressive and constructive progress in the negotiations and reach agreements that are fully in favour of the development of the ACP countries."
"Madam President, I would like to say to all of the honourable Members who have spoken that I shall communicate their remarks as accurately as possible to my colleague Louis Michel, who will pursue the dialogue on the whole of this development policy in the way you wish."
"I shall tell him that Parliament takes great interest in the evolution of this policy, which he manages with great conviction, as you know."
"Many of you have stressed the importance of this partnership."
"I would like to return to the financial envelope."
"It is true that EUR 23.7 billion of that sum should be allocated as operational credits for the ACP countries."
"This sum can be compared to the EUR 22.7 billion proposed by the Luxembourg Presidency."
"This sum will be integrated by means of an increased effort on the part of the European Investment Bank in its support for the ACP countries through own resources."
"It is still a substantial sum."
"On an annual basis, it represents an increase of 35% compared to the 9th European Development Fund."
"Furthermore, support for the ACP countries must be seen within the wider context of the Community's external actions and, in general terms, the ACP countries will also benefit from thematic budget lines and funds reserved for the ACP countries that are signatories to the sugar protocol, in the sum of EUR 1.2 billion."
"These funds, which are payable from the Community's general budget, will increase the proportion of the Community's development cooperation earmarked for the ACP countries, as compared with previous financial perspectives."
"I believe that I have thereby highlighted the progress that some of you have mentioned, while accepting that this policy will be subject to many further developments, since it is true that it is now part of the European Union's duty and purpose."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of sitting"
"(The sitting was suspended at 23.25 p.m.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 10 a.m.)"
"I declare the session open."
"I am very pleased to have been elected: this is my first time as President of this House."
"I regard it as absolutely crucial and highly symbolic that I am opening this session with a debate on gender parity and equality."
"It must be said that our Parliament has made some significant progress, and I hope that it continues to do so."
"Documents received: see Minutes"
"Equality between men and women in the committees' work (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Anna ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on gender mainstreaming in the work of the committees."
"rapporteur. - (SK) Over the past few years, the issues of women's dignity and their mission have taken on a new dimension."
"This is particularly evident within the framework of the European Union's horizontal policies that have been shaped by the Lisbon Strategy, such as those addressing the demographic challenge and the work-life balance, as well as those combating violence against women."
"Recognising the differences between women and men, on the one hand, and nurturing complementarities between them, on the other, may contribute significantly towards enhancing democracy and parliamentarianism, to the benefit of EU citizens."
"Freedom means more than just the freedom to compete, as the Chancellor, my favourite politician, pointed out yesterday."
"Women have a special value in a broad and distinctive context inspired mainly by the protection of human rights."
"On the one hand, this is due to the value of women as human beings with a right to inviolable respect for their basic dignity."
"On the other hand, this is due to their femininity, irrespective of the cultural context or their spiritual, mental or physical characteristics, such as age, health, education, employment or marital status."
"The report on gender mainstreaming within the work of the European Parliament's committees is the fruit of cooperation in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality during the first half of the present term."
"The report was unanimously approved in the committee, for which I am extremely grateful."
"In parliamentary committees we do not often enjoy such shared triumphs or the benefits of such a well-targeted approach."
"At present, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is the most important instrument for supporting the efforts that still need to be undertaken in other committees to ensure genuine equality between women and men."
"My committee has come up with the first methodological model that can be applied to assess performance in all parliamentary committees."
"The model is described in the Explanatory Statement."
"The data from the questionnaires completed by the committees which responded to our survey were carefully processed by the secretariat of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"If all committees had responded, the evaluation would have been far more comprehensive."
"All committees should heed our recommendations."
"Following debates in the Committee on Women's Rights, a number of amendments were adopted which reinforce the content of the report."
"I would like, however, to dwell on the three amendments pertaining to paragraphs 8, 21 and 22."
"In my opinion, these amendments would undermine the powers vested with the Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality, and are not entirely consistent with the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure."
"I particularly value the fact that the drafting of the report has fuelled a pluralistic parliamentary debate, highlighting the importance of the underlying problem."
"I would like to thank all of my fellow MEPs, both women and men, who have been actively involved in this exercise and have helped me to prepare the report."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Madam President, the report of the chairwoman, Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, urges us toward an ever greater fulfilment of the most fundamental European issue, our common goal of equality between men and women, here within the walls of the European Parliament, with regard to the division of responsibilities and tasks within the existing parliamentary committees."
"The question and the way the question is posed is far from unambiguous even within the walls of Parliament, as previous cycles and indeed the most recent one indicate; this is perhaps why the problem has not yet been resolved, even though in recent times the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has made great efforts to assess the situation and to bring about change."
"Integrating the principle of gender equality into the everyday life of society, communicating it to all people, the struggle against established stereotypes, the ever more fruitful use of women's capacities and knowledge, and our true equality of opportunity remain very distant goals in Europe."
"This situation comes in for very sharp criticism by the rapporteur in the European Parliament."
"In my experience, scepticism here in Parliament with regard to the question of gender equality is in many cases the consequence of the fact that equality of opportunity is still erroneously regarded by most people as a struggle in which one group - in this case men - surrender power and privileges in the interests of another group - in this case women."
"The European Parliament is an institution that sets an example, and it can maintain and strengthen this status only if in the course of our daily parliamentary work we fully represent, in our professional committees as well, those principles and directives which we are struggling to realise on a European level, and which we set down as standards for the Member States."
"We would like to see women in as many committee positions as possible."
"The European political parties must strive to promote the participation of women in public life, to put more women forward for election, and here in Parliament they should encourage and create fairer and more equal representation."
"The European Parliament must set an example."
"In each policy area, from planning through evaluation, and for all practical questions before Parliament, we must keep the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women at the centre of our attention."
"The struggle over committee positions and the Year of Equal Opportunities for All, in my view, provide an excellent framework right now for this purpose."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Madam President, excuse my being late, but I had to speak somewhere else."
"I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur for this very important report, and I want to say how necessary it is for us to take this issue seriously."
"We have just witnessed our election of 14 deputy chairmen here in Parliament, only three of whom are women."
"We are in the process of electing chairmen and deputy chairmen for all of Parliament's committees, and I think that we should have a policy on gentleman streaming where our own political appointments are concerned."
"Thank you very much for the work done on the report."
"I hope that it will be followed up."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to wish you luck and success in your new and important position."
"This year is a year of equal opportunities in the European Union, and thus it is a year for us all: men and women."
"Today we are discussing gender mainstreaming in the context of the work of our own commissions."
"And I would like to draw attention to the fact that this is the first document in the political work of the parliamentary commissions to be devoted to the concrete assessment of gender mainstreaming."
"Here I would like to thank rapporteur Mrs Anna ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ for her expert work."
"In a few months we will be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome."
"Pursuant to Article 2 of the Treaty Establishing the European Economic Community, equality between men and women is a fundamental principle of community law - I emphasise that this fundamental principle, and thus also its advancement, is the indisputable task of the community."
"The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms has been signed by all Member States of the European Union."
"I ask you: why do we not implement it?"
"Why do we not have a functioning supervisory mechanism and effective measures to carry out and guarantee what has been decided upon?"
"These decisions were made half a century ago."
"Parliament still passes new documents on the same topic every year, in which it emphasises, undertakes and requires."
"In the document under discussion, however, we must recognise today, in the year 2007, that women are underrepresented in our own parliamentary administration in the bodies that make political decisions."
"Finally, I would ask that all of us who have been elected to the highest level of European politics should be decisive and put an end to the wasting of already poor human resources and potential."
"In our actions, let us accept women as equals to men, whether in the making of political decisions or on pay day."
"Equal rights must become the law not only on paper, but also in everyday life."
"This will also be the key to the successful implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"You have congratulated me, and I congratulate those few men present in the House for this debate on gender equality because I believe that their presence is crucial when it comes to opposing the discrimination that still exists."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I truly wish you all the very best for your first day as President."
"However, there is still a great deal left to do where women's rights are concerned; we have a long history of parliamentary work behind us, and it is precisely for that reason that we recognise how increasingly important it is to ensure that gender-related aspects are genuinely integrated into the work of the committees, and integrated in an effective and operational manner."
"If we look at the reality of the situation, there are many problems to be resolved, and the figures are quite clear: it is still exceedingly difficult for women to enter and participate in political and institutional life, and that is without mentioning the endless unresolved problems they have in actually reconciling their working lives with their family lives."
"That is precisely why, if we are to attempt to do away with the inequalities, we need to intervene openly in every action and policy carried out by the Union."
"Furthermore, the rapporteur - whom I thank for her excellent work - has done well to highlight the fact that there is still not a suitable culture encouraging women to participate in political life."
"I should like to give an example: in Italy there is no law on the so-called pink quotas, and, personally, I am not convinced that quotas are necessarily the best system."
"However, in Italy, parties that have freely decided to include more women on their lists of candidates, such as the party to which I belong, have actually seen an increase in the number of female politicians represented in parliament, and this is a positive development - it is an example of good practice that should be exported, nay, imposed at Community level."
"To conclude, I expect all the Community institutions and, in particular, the German Presidency, to put women back in the spotlight and to launch a genuine European family pact."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Madam President, I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, for the excellent work she has done."
"I would also like to congratulate the President on her election."
"It is excellent that the European Parliament has made it compulsory for the committees to implement gender mainstreaming."
"This is a process that is bound to take a long time, and it is important that the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is heading the project."
"I know that there are also those in Parliament that are doubtful about all this, and I feel that in most cases it is those very people who need to be educated in the matter of equality."
"When I was made responsible for this issue in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I asked the Committee on Women's Rights to specify those tasks that had to be accomplished in gender mainstreaming, and the committee produced the questionnaire in a form that was instructive and very welcome."
"I drafted a preliminary proposal for the Committee on the Environment based on this questionnaire."
"There are still no decisions on it, but I will be proposing in my committee, for example, that every year the Committee on Women's Rights should produce statistics on the gender distribution among coordinators and rapporteurs and in the secretariat."
"I will also propose that a pilot project should be set up to establish mainstreaming in particular and to identify areas where especially close cooperation should be engaged in with the Committee on Women's Rights."
"In my view, the Committee on Women's Rights could produce for the plenary sessions more concrete draft resolutions than these on what the committees should be doing."
"I believe that this issue should be taken forward in the most effective way possible, so that plenary can both make binding decisions and recommendations on what should be done on the committee."
"Finally, I would like to say that the political groups should also be paying heed to gender equality."
"It is the political groups that will have the main role in deciding how equality is to be implemented when they elect their chairs and fill the posts of chair and deputy chair of committees in negotiations between groups."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Thank you, Madam President."
"Please accept my most sincere congratulations on your new appointment as Vice-President."
"I am very pleased indeed."
"The current report rightly states that there is still an imbalance between women and men in all areas of society."
"The evaluation of the ways in which the committees have so far complied with Parliament's decision that the gender equality perspective should always permeate our work shows, unsurprisingly, that there is still an incredible amount to be done before we can say that the equality perspective really has been integrated into our work."
"This is not news."
"There are many of us who, in the general run of our daily work, experience the inequality between men and women and the unequal conditions that apply to us."
"That is not something peculiar to the European Parliament."
"We are forced to observe that, whether we are talking about parliamentary work or about the way in which society operates in general, economic and political power is in practice still the province of the one gender, that is to say of men."
"Despite all our talk about the importance of gender equality, it is clearly easier to talk about it than to implement it in practical terms."
"We need a variety of instruments in order to tackle issues of gender equality and take steps to bring such equality about."
"Such instruments include education and knowledge."
"If we are to change things, we need to clarify the power structures."
"We are therefore looking forward to the work of the Institute for Gender Equality. Among the tools with which it will be able to provide us are more widely shared knowledge, together with statistics broken down according to gender."
"Another important tool when it comes to gender equality is education. It is important for us to allow officials to continue with their further training on the integration of the gender equality perspective."
"What is just as important, however, is that Members of the European Parliament too should receive training in equality."
"It is not true to say that, as elected politicians, we automatically have a sufficient knowledge of gender equality and the integration of the gender equality perspective."
"This is, however, a situation that we can do something about."
"We can vote in favour of the proposal in the report that gender equality training should be arranged for all MEPs before the next term of office."
"I urge you to vote for this in the report."
"Thank you."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, the previous speaker has just made reference, regretfully, apparently, to lots of jobs in politics going to the stronger people - the men."
"She obviously never met Mrs Thatcher!"
"Why cannot these reports be written in plain language?"
"The term 'gender mainstreaming' occurs throughout the report; what is that?"
"Is it some kind of political correctness?"
"Paragraph 16, which is all about filling vacancies in EU institutions, says that gender mainstreaming is 'to be taken into account'."
"Does that mean specific jobs for men and specific jobs for women?"
"Paragraph 1 calls for 'gender equality [...] which does not set women against men'."
"Does that mean men and women cannot apply for the same job in case it sets the one against the other?"
"Recital A states that some committees 'never take an interest' in gender mainstreaming."
"Goodness, what do we do about that?"
"But, wait a bit, there are some facts and figures to go with the jargon."
"Recital F refers to the 'continuous increase in the percentage of female Members of the European Parliament, from 17.5 % in 1979 to 30.33 % in 2004'."
"But, then, recital G notes that, in EU administration, 'women are under-represented in positions of responsibility' where political decisions are taken."
"Clearly, we are leading to reverse discrimination."
"Any kind of discrimination is not only thoroughly bad, but surely goes against all that the EU stands for."
"Inevitably, you then move on to quotas, but the report also calls for the dignity of women."
"In Britain, other political parties have women-only candidate lists."
"What kind of dignity is that?"
"Our party does not do it."
"In the situation under consideration here, what happens if not enough women apply to satisfy the quota?"
"Do you leave the post unfilled?"
"I suppose, now, some people will think they have got some kind of raving chauvinist on their hands - not so."
"I am a teacher, I taught for 39 years and I did so happily with many women."
"I worked for women in teaching, very happily - no problem."
"I respected them all."
"I simply believe that women should have no bar to going for qualifications and should apply for posts on a totally equal basis."
"Anything else, like this report, is demeaning to women, and any self-respecting woman should find this report offensive."
"I ask Members to dismiss it with their vote."
"(SK) In 1993, the UN General Assembly in Vienna stated for the first time the principle that human rights include the rights of women, and that the protection of those rights was a priority objective."
"The Beijing Platform for Action later recognised gender equality as a major objective and identified 12 critical areas of concern."
"Let me mention but a few of them: women and poverty; education; women and health; violence against women; armed conflicts; women and the mass media; the participation of women in decision-making processes and in political and social structures."
"Notwithstanding the multitude of institutions active in the enforcement of these instruments, including the UN, Council of Europe, OSCE and the European Union, one can conclude that today gender equality is only implemented de jure, not de facto."
"We often seek an excuse in the percentages of women in various organisations."
"What we fail to observe, however, is that those percentages primarily reflect a presence at the lower or lowest levels of an institution."
"The higher up we climb the management ladder, the fewer women we find there."
"I believe that the tried-and-tested principle applies in this case also: if we want to bring about change, let us begin with ourselves."
"This is perhaps why the report drawn up by my fellow MEP, Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, is so important."
"In the European Parliament we can also say that, percentage-wise, the representation of women has improved in comparison with the past."
"We should realise, however, that women typically fill lower positions, be it in the European Parliament or the secretariats."
"Moreover, I daresay that within the secretariats we have implemented the gender equality principle fully, as women enjoy a majority there."
"But is it the case that in the European Parliament the old prejudices still prevail, according to which women make good wives, mothers, mistresses, secretaries, cooks or even cleaning ladies, but not senior executives ?"
"It is regrettable that the only speech made so far by a male Member of this House has been of the sort we have all witnessed before."
"(SK) Madam President, I too would like to congratulate you on your election to this position."
"Thefact that you are presiding over this very debate may well be indicative."
"I would like to express my admiration for the rapporteur for the clarity she brings to her description in the report of how equal opportunities are being implemented in this Parliament."
"She does not claim that there is nothing left to be done in this Parliament regarding the promotion of equal opportunities."
"On the contrary, she says clearly that gender mainstreaming has been well formulated and reflected in resolutions passed by Parliament, as well as directives adopted by the European Community, and it has also been institutionalised in the working groups and committees."
"In terms of substance, however, interest in the topic has been confined to committees pledging to train their secretariats in gender mainstreaming."
"It seems that some of my fellow Members are also in need of such training."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, in this Parliament, we often tend to underestimate the implications of the problem that remain to be resolved."
"The ageing of Europe will be an impossible problem to solve unless we revise our approach to gender mainstreaming."
"There can be no doubt that overhauling and modernising pension schemes will not in itself suffice."
"At present the underlying problems appear to exist on two levels at the same time."
"Firstly, the philosophical approach taken by political elites leads to indirect discrimination as a result of the application of the so-called civic principle, which clearly results in discrimination and a lack of equal opportunities."
"Secondly, there are absolutely no practical initiatives aimed at reconciling the demands of work with those of family life, which creates dramatic differences in the opportunities that are available to men and women as a result of existing stereotypes which are difficult to overcome."
"In view of the seriousness of the challenge that Europe is facing due to demographic changes, I strongly believe that the European Parliament should be working much more closely with national parliaments on matters of gender mainstreaming."
"In my opinion, the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All offers an appropriate framework for that."
"(DE) Madam President, I, too, am glad to see you in the Chair today, and warmly congratulate you on your election."
"So far, this debate has been conducted in the absence of the Commission and the Council, and that was only right and proper."
"Its subject is the practical implementation of gender mainstreaming in the committees, and, more specifically, the first interim report following on from the report I produced and which was adopted in 2003."
"This report highlights very well how we should implement gender mainstreaming in this House, and, while it was right that we should concern ourselves with this, I do now rather fear that we have missed an opportunity, since we are all talking about everything under the sun except what we can do in this Parliament of ours."
"What has become of its Paragraph 1, with its action plan for a policy of gender mainstreaming, that is to say, equality in every evaluation and analysis and the new development of concepts for the equality of women and men in Parliament?"
"There is still a very great deal left to be done, and no actual plan of action."
"And what of the second, with its priorities for equality issues and a high-level working party?"
"This working party has done its job very well, and the right procedure was followed, in that reports were produced by all the committees."
"As we have heard from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, some of the Vice-Chairmen of committees have done very good work, but what they did was sometimes exposed to ridicule."
"What has become of our demand for women in decision-making positions within Parliament?"
"No definite action has been taken to make that happen."
"The groups and the national delegations treated this demand with varying degrees of seriousness, but no proper strategy has been forthcoming."
"What, then, of the analysis of the Budget procedure?"
"Here, too, no definite action has been taken, although the policy of gender budgeting was meant to have been given tangible form."
"What progress has been made towards achieving an effective press and information strategy - something else that we called for in 2003 - which is another area where there are still considerable deficits?"
"Now that we are to conduct a proper analysis and evaluation, I very much hope that we will be helped, in the analysis of the committees, by the European Institute for Gender Equality, which we have recently voted to set up."
"It is to be regretted, though, that the report has far from enough to say about the state of affairs in the groups, the delegations and the substance of policies, and so I should like to see us taking a more ambitious approach and managing, by 2009 - when elections are due - to achieve real agreements that make gender mainstreaming possible and put women in positions of leadership."
"Grateful though I am for the work that has been done, we must still make very considerable effort to get anywhere near achieving the goal that we set ourselves in the 2003 report."
"(LT) Gender equality in the EU is one of the most important democratic values, enabling freedom of self-expression and interpersonal relations on the basis of full equality."
"However, this value has not yet been fully implemented: women are discriminated against in recruitment for jobs, and they are paid significantly lower wages than men for the same work."
"The issues of gender equality and an integrated outlook on gender equality are widespread and topical, both at the member country level and at the European Union level."
"I congratulate the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on having initiated this study and having prepared a report about an integrated outlook on gender equality in the work of the European Parliament's committees."
"The committees were assessed on the basis of a completed questionnaire, which reflected each committee's outlook and activities in forming gender equality strategy, implementing an integrated outlook on gender, and implementing gender consultation and cooperation activity."
"In the Development Cooperation Committee, where I am responsible for gender integration issues, there were no particular discussions."
"The committee works more on gender expertise and consultation issues with NGOs and developing countries."
"It is my understanding that the gender integration issue mostly encounters difficulties in the committee because of the d'Hondt system used in the European Parliament."
"When this system is applied, even when 30% of parliamentarians are women, the women of the smaller parties realistically have very little chance of preparing a report or an opinion."
"This also deprives women of the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities and to express their viewpoints on issues vital to their nations, the European Union and the world."
"Even though the system itself is supposed to give small parties the opportunity to present legislative documents, in reality this is hard to put into practice."
"When monitoring the implementation of an integrated outlook on gender equality, this issue should be looked at in a broader context - the context of the European Parliament's work rules, which need to be improved."
"(PL) Madam President, nature determined that there should be two types of human being, the male and the female, though they are both of equal value and importance."
"Whether we like it or not, every culture fashioned mainly by religion, be it Islamic, Jewish or Christian culture, understands the relationship between men and women in its own particular way."
"These relationships are constantly evolving and improving as time goes by."
"The existence of a Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament and the report before the House today mark a high point in that process of evolution."
"This evolution must not, however, be allowed to become a revolution."
"We must not attempt to impose an artificial male-female relationship by force."
"It is obviously important to ensure that men and women can enjoy the same opportunities for development, but it is not appropriate to impose artificial quotas of any kind."
"I have in mind, for example, quotas for involvement in public life."
"I believe the training and awareness-raising referred to in the report will prove helpful, but the introduction of quotas would amount to discrimination against better candidates in favour of worse ones, and could prove detrimental to the cause of women in the future."
"There is nothing finer than the diversity of nature and culture we see all around us, and no greater source of inspiration for humankind."
"I believe that the differences between men and women are the fount of life."
"(DE) Madam President, I warmly congratulate you on your election."
"I wish to express my support for this report, which I do not believe contains anything that goes against this House's Rules of Procedure, and my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, for the very good cooperation over the last two and a half years."
"I was a member of the previous Bureau with responsibility for equality issues, and we joined in the Bureau's high-level working party with Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mrs Lulling and Mrs GrÃ¶ner, as well as with Mr Friedrich and Mr Daul, in promoting gender mainstreaming in the work of our committees."
"I should like to express my appreciation to you all, and it goes without saying that I would like also to thank the administration staff, in particular those in the department of DG Personnel responsible for equality of opportunity."
"I am certain that the newly-elected Bureau will continue the work of the working party without interruption and with the same committed attitude, and it can do its work on a sound basis, for the former Bureau recently adopted, unanimously, my report on the development of equality of opportunity between 2002 and 2006, which formulated ambitious objectives to be achieved by 2009, including a marked increase in the proportion of women in leadership positions in this House, in particular in middle and top management."
"We will be taking further steps to better enable our staff to balance work and family life, and will be more careful in future to use gender-neutral language in the conduct of this House's business."
"It was the Bureau that first took action on gender budgeting, which is to be a task for all of us in this House in 2008."
"I hope we will be able to arrange the necessary training and retraining for all Members."
"(PL) Madam President, I too would like to congratulate you as you take up such an important role."
"Equality for women can never be guaranteed by legal provisions alone."
"It stands to reason that discrimination against women on the grounds of their gender must not be condoned in any circumstances."
"It cannot be allowed in the work of the committees or in any other context."
"Left-wing and liberal groupings tend to focus unduly on the fine detail of such matters."
"It must be borne in mind that respect for women is not achieved through legal provisions. It comes about solely as a result of family upbringing."
"I belong to The League of Polish Families, and we are certainly aware of the problem of discrimination against women."
"At the level of national legislation, we are putting forward a range of legal provisions to benefit women and mothers."
"We support and promote the role of women in politics and society."
"Women have an important role to play in this House too."
"We also support the effort to eliminate all cases of violation of women's dignity and freedom."
"The debate on gender equality is an important one, but it cannot be allowed to lead to an ideological conflict in which men and women pit themselves against each other instead of working together, resulting in the emergence of a new kind of dogma."
"There is a fundamental question that arises from time to time."
"Is all this really about equality, equal rights and human dignity, or is it in fact about creating a new ideology?"
"Is that what we are about in this House too?"
"In my view and in the view of the League of Polish Families, special legal provisions are needed."
"Such provisions should, however, be designed not only to ensure equal treatment for men and women, but also to protect the latter."
"(SK) Madam President, I would like to congratulate you on your election to this position, as well as on the fact that the first debate over which you are presiding happens to be about women."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, for her well-balanced report, and at the same time I would like to thank her for the excellent work she has been doing as chairman of the Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"I agree that it is imperative for women to be represented in the executive bodies of the European Parliament which take political decisions."
"I also welcome the efforts to incorporate gender mainstreaming into the practical work of all of the committees of the European Parliament."
"It is important to encourage interest in the topic on the part of the committees, and to ensure that they pay adequate attention to gender mainstreaming."
"Gender mainstreaming is not a strategy to be implemented in one fell swoop; it is like a thread which should be woven through the entire political process in order to incorporate a gender equality aspect into all community policies on all levels."
"The gender equality requirement should express itself in a practical approach that does not pit men and women against each other."
"More emphasis on the importance of men's engagement in gender mainstreaming will add to the significance of issues previously considered to be the exclusive domain of women."
"The political groups in the European Parliament could play a very important role in the process by promoting women's participation in public life, for example, by encouraging women to stand as candidates in elections for the European Parliament and national parliaments."
"I strongly believe that in 2007, which is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the European Parliament should provide an example through its own organisational structures of how gender equality is part and parcel of the political routine pursued here for the benefit of society, based on non-discrimination, tolerance, equality and solidarity."
"I trust that the Member States will subscribe to this appeal and will echo it through the implementation of gender mainstreaming policies."
"(HU) It is natural, is it not, that procreation, childrearing, caring for the sick and the elderly, keeping the family together, as well as health care, education and social services are unimaginable without the participation of women?"
"This is true in almost every area of life."
"How, then, can we take decisions on any question or pass any law or regulation without taking into account their distinctive points of view?"
"It is an important goal for the policy of gender equality in the long term to be incorporated into all policy areas and to be present at all levels."
"Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡'s report is the first one to address an integrated approach to equal opportunity - many thanks for this."
"Although the committees pay greater attention in their work to the perspectives of gender equality, yet to this day not a single body has laid down among the fundamental principles of its work the demands of equal opportunity."
"The strategic basis is lacking: more women, but without more significant positions?"
"In our parliamentary committees we need to take more seriously the need to fulfil the demands of equal opportunity for men and women, and for this to happen we need to ensure adequate training and information."
"This must not be allowed to set men against women; we must strive, instead, to make sure everyone recognises that the expression of women's viewpoints is in the interests of men as well."
"Madam President, I am very proud that we now have the first female first-Vice-President."
"I wish to congratulate you, as we now have some women in the main body of the European Parliament."
"I welcome this report on gender mainstreaming in the committees."
"Is it unique?"
"It is unique of its kind."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur in particular for her excellent work."
"It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament uses its influential position in the Community to support and promote gender equality through healthy self-examination of its own methods of working."
"The right to non-discrimination is protected by several European treaties, in particular the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Nevertheless, we need to continue developing the legal instruments in order to protect everyone - man or woman - from discrimination based on gender."
"Coming from a country, Finland, with a long history of working for equal opportunities for men and women, I was very pleased with the findings of the report by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"It showed that most of the committees, at least, attach some importance to gender mainstreaming."
"However, I would underline that we still have a long way to go."
"I support the ideas put forward by Ms JÃ¡rÃ³ka, for example that all committees should have female members."
"Even though the number of women in the European Parliament continues to increase, inequality continues to exist when it comes to the really important positions in the political bodies, such as committee chairs, etc. I therefore urge each and every committee to put gender mainstreaming into practice in its own work, since this is one way of enabling women to take part fully in the decision-making processes of the EU."
"Finally, I should like to emphasise the need for specific data broken down by gender. After all, that is the only way really to evaluate how we are doing and what still needs to be done."
"Such gender-based statistics are very important for our future work."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating you on your election, and also Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ on the work she has done on her report, which unfortunately once again points out that also in the public institutions there continues to be inequalities between men and women in positions of responsibility."
"If our objective is to achieve full equality in society, we must offer an example of our own political commitment in the European institutions, and in the European Parliament in particular."
"An integrated approach to gender equality in our work and more women in positions of responsibility are therefore two issues that should be taken very seriously by all of the bodies in our Parliament."
"This report has the merit of being a document by our institution that takes one further step in this direction, but it should be followed up on, setting clear objectives to be achieved, the methods for achieving them, the people responsible for working towards achieving them, and carrying out periodic assessments that enable us to identify, on the one hand, any achievements, and on the other, the reasons why they may not have been achieved."
"Only through constant and rigorous work by everybody in this institution will we be able create true equality between men and women."
"(EL) Madam President, I congratulate you and all your male and female colleagues on your new office."
"According to the fundamental principle of Community law on equality set out in Article 2 of the Treaty and the ambition to wipe out inequalities between men and women on the basis of the principle of an integrated approach to equality laid down in Article 3(2), the European Parliament made a political commitment in its resolution to acquire an institutional framework for this purpose."
"The momentum was created back in 2005 by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equality and with the work carried out by the High-Level Group on Gender Equality."
"Under the inspired guidance of President ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, and with substantial contributions from the representatives of all 21 parliamentary committees in charge of equality issues and their secretariats, today, in the Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the first document of the EP embodying its political commitment to self-criticism as regards the application of an integrated approach has been submitted for approval."
"The findings were made using an unprecedented method for the European Parliament, an inventive method which was developed in order to map the current situation."
"It is positive that, even though several committees laid down their priorities without a strategy on our issue, they are in favour of incorporating equality issues."
"The report stipulates how mainstreaming will be achieved, in accordance with the plan which we are voting today to instruct the Committee on Women's Rights to prepare by the end of this parliamentary session."
"Of course, we shall all need to go to crammer school before then, both employees and parliamentarians, so that we can develop suitable evaluation mechanisms to take account of the peculiarities of each parliamentary committee and ensure that policies are complementary and consistent and combine Members' responsibilities and interests."
"Consolidating control of the integrated approach twice per legislative term will provide an opportunity for qualitative and quantitative appraisal."
"It is a question of justice and I welcome the fact that the Commissioner responsible for justice is with us."
"We must not criticise the failure to promote women to decision-taking positions; we must criticise the fact that worthy women are prevented from competing with worthy men."
"We are calling, Commissioner, for rights to be restored and for a meritocracy to be set up in which men and women are equal."
"(PL) Madam President, the European Parliament represents European society, which is made up of 492 million individuals and 27 countries."
"The House does not accurately reflect the social structure of the society it represents, however, as the percentage of female MEPs is barely 30%."
"This is far too low."
"Only 13% of Polish MEPs are women, and there is not a single female MEP representing Malta and Cyprus."
"The situation regarding administrative positions of responsibility in the European Parliament's political decision-making bodies is equally unsatisfactory."
"Most of the committees are favourably inclined towards gender equality issues, but in practice they fail to take them into account when setting their political priorities."
"Against this background, it is worth highlighting the significance of the creation of a High-Level Group on Gender Equality."
"This group is also charged with working beyond the European Parliament and encouraging Member States to implement gender equality policies effectively."
"Political parties and groups have a vital role to play in enabling women to participate fully in political life."
"Certain groups and parties have already successfully applied a quota system to lists of candidates for public office."
"The remainder should follow their example, so as to ensure that gender equality will actually become a reality across the Union in the future and not remain merely wishful thinking."
"In conclusion, I should like to congratulate Mrs ZÃ¡borska on a very well prepared document."
"I would also like to congratulate you, Madam President, on the occasion of your assuming your important role. As a woman, I am delighted to see you in office."
"(SL) A society where both sexes enjoy equality, develops more successfully than one controlled by the members of one sex."
"However, as a result of natural dispositions, certain occupations remain that are better and more easily done by men and others by women."
"However, we have known for a long time that men and women can prove themselves equally capable of performing leading jobs or carrying out political duties."
"So why is it then necessary to adopt a report on gender equality when we live in the European Union, the most democratic society in the world and which has set itself the highest standards of democracy?"
"It has been confirmed through my own experience that this work is more than necessary, even in the European Union."
"In various documents we are imposing new duties on our citizens, but when it comes to the allocation of prestigious political positions in our Parliament, there is a ruthless struggle going on."
"Gender equality and the equality of small and large States can easily be achieved with the d'Hondt method."
"I am happy to be a member of the PPE-DE Group, but I am not happy with the allocation of seats."
"If a woman finds the courage to put herself forward for a leading position, she has to withdraw her candidature if another female candidate puts herself forward for the same position, so that at least one woman can get herself elected amongst the crowds of men."
"We should not put forward female candidates just because they are women but because we have among us many capable women who have already and on many occasions proved their merit in practice."
"I do not wish to lay all the blame on men."
"We women, too, must become more ambitious and not merely be the performers of the tasks entrusted to us."
"Before we impose legal obligations and recommendations on our citizens, let us examine how we are fulfilling them ourselves."
"(SV) Madam President, I wish to thank the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, together with Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, for an excellent initiative and an excellent report."
"Following this debate, I have to observe, however, that the men who participated put forward some antediluvian views."
"It really is very sad indeed."
"A lot has already been said in this debate, and I want to spend the time I have on a number of issues of principle."
"Parliament will never obtain integrated committees, half of whose committee draftsmen or chairmen are women, until half the Members of the European Parliament are women."
"I speak from experience."
"In Sweden, it was only when, in 1994, we had a situation in which half of our politicians and Members of the Swedish Parliament were women that we were able to implement major reforms."
"Many women in the European Parliament's committees have problems combining parliamentary and family responsibilities."
"As long as Parliament does not offer parents any opportunity of remaining at home, using parents' insurance, and of obtaining benefits and people to replace them at work, we shall have a gender equality problem."
"One of the strengths of the report is that it both discusses and proposes measures affecting officials and ourselves as MEPs, but I should like to see more targets and more measures affecting employees in the next report."
"I should also like to see a debate on how and when we women are to comprise half the number of MEPs."
"I should like to thank everyone for their congratulations."
"I regard it as highly symbolic that the first debate over which I have presided is on the report on equal opportunities."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Law applicable to non-contractual obligations (""ROME II"") (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Council common position (9751/7/2006 - C6-0317/2006 - for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (""ROME II"") (Rapporteur: Diana Wallis)."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, Commissioner, ROME II has been a long journey for us all and, whilst we might have hoped that this was the end, it seems likely that we are just at another staging post."
"Let me start by saying that we appreciate that the common position took on board some of our ideas from the first reading."
"Commissioner, I also want to emphasise the importance that we attach to this regulation, providing, as it will, the ground plan, or roadmap, which will provide clarity and certainty for the basis of civil law claims across Europe."
"We need this, and we, here in Parliament, want to get it done, but it has to be done in the right way."
"This has to fit the aspirations and needs of those we represent."
"This is not just some theoretical academic exercise; we are making political choices about balancing the rights and expectations of parties before civil courts."
"I am sorry that we have not reached an agreement at this stage."
"I still believe that it could have been possible, with more engagement and assistance."
"Perhaps it is because both the other institutions are not used to Parliament having codecision in this particular area - I am sorry, but you will have to get used to it!"
"I also want to thank all my colleagues in the political groups in the Committee on Legal Affairs, who have stuck together with me on this long journey and supported a common view, which, subject to sufficient presence in this Chamber today, will be clearly shown in our vote."
"Now let me detail the points that still separate us."
"We have always made it clear that we prefer a general rule, with as few exceptions as possible."
"If we must have exceptions, they must be clearly defined."
"Thus, we have accepted the position on product liability."
"However, problems still remain in respect of unfair competition and the environment."
"With unfair competition, we also face a simultaneous proposal from Commissioner Kroes."
"The two proposals must work together; currently they do not."
"We have tried to present a more acceptable formulation, which, sadly, I think is unlikely to succeed here at today's vote, and I would therefore urge colleagues to support the deletion, to allow us to return to this at conciliation and do the work properly."
"It is the same with the environment."
"I know and deeply respect the fact that many would like a separate rule, but it should not be a rule just for the sake of a headline."
"It should be a rule that is clear in terms of what facts it applies to."
"Given that we already have several possible formulations, the safest course, again, I would urge, is the general rule."
"This would also allow us to delete the separate rule today and return to the definition at conciliation."
"Now I come to the two big issues for this Parliament."
"The first is defamation."
"Please understand that we know only too well how difficult an issue this is."
"However, we managed to get a huge majority at first reading across this House, and you will likely see a similar pattern repeated here today."
"That the Commission decided to exclude this issue before we could consider it again was disappointing, to say the least."
"That it did so on the basis of a clear two-year review clause, which has now been abandoned, is unacceptable."
"We know the issues surrounding this area of media and communication will only increase and continue to haunt us."
"Maybe we cannot deal with it now, but we will soon be looking at Brussels I again, and it is imperative that jurisdiction and applicable law remain in step. So, would we deprive ourselves of the opportunity to look at this again?"
"Exclusion may truly be the only answer, but this Parliament wants to try a little bit more to see if we cannot resolve this."
"I turn to the issue that my colleagues have been most tenacious in their support for (and I am very grateful for that): damages in road-traffic accidents."
"Commissioner, we have the support of insurers, the support of legal practitioners, the support of victims, the support of those we represent, but somehow we cannot transmit these concerns to the Commission or to the Council."
"Even last week, I was confronted by a very senior justice ministry official who thought that what we were trying to do was the equivalent of applying German law to determine liability in respect of a road-traffic accident which had happened in the UK, where, of course, we drive on the 'wrong' side of the road."
"Do you really think we are that stupid?"
"I wish people would have the courtesy to read and understand what we are suggesting: merely the accepted principle of restitutio in integrum - to put victims back in the position they were in before the incident."
"There should be nothing so fearful in this."
"Indeed, the illogical approach would be for a judge in the victim's country to be able to deal with the case by virtue of the Motor Insurance Directives and Brussels I, and then have to apply a foreign, outside law in respect of damages."
"This, indeed, would be illogical - and that is the situation we are currently in."
"Please look at what we are saying and appreciate that, given the even the greater mobility of our citizens on Europe's roads, this matter needs attention, sooner rather than later, and a four-year general review clause just will not do."
"My last hope is that our debates will have brought the subject of private international law out of the dusty cupboards in justice ministries and expert committees into the glare of public, political, transparent debate."
"Therefore, all we ask is that you bear with us a little longer so that, together, the institutions of Europe can get this right."
"Mr President, I should first like to thank Mrs Wallis for her report."
"As you know, we have been discussing this proposal for three and a half years, and I feel that, following the improvements made by Parliament and the Council at the two reading stages, this project has now reached maturity, if I may put it that way."
"Firstly, it would appear that those working in the economic and legal fields are very much looking forward to this regulation that is essential for legal certainty, and secondly, it would appear that this text is of vital importance for the construction of the European area of justice and for the smooth running of the European internal market."
"This is why your vote, ladies and gentlemen, represents a crucial step for the future of this issue."
"The best solution would, to my mind, be to proceed without the conciliation procedure, although were this procedure to prove inevitable, the Commission would deem it essential for all the conditions to be in place after your vote for it to adopt a satisfactory text."
"I remain confident that a favourable solution can be found with Parliament's support."
"Like you, Mrs Wallis, I regret the absence of special rules on defamation in the Council common position."
"We reluctantly accepted the removal of that rule."
"Why?"
"Because it has not been possible to reach a compromise on a text."
"I should like to point out that over ten different options were on Council's table in April 2006, not one of which has any chance of success, either now or, probably, in the future."
"You will also know that the revision clause has no chance of success."
"I firmly believe that to accept a provision that cannot obtain even the slightest consensus between the institutions, as several members of the Committee on Legal Affairs have stated, would be to reopen a can of worms."
"Another important point is that the number of international lawsuits in this area is very limited."
"Perhaps you know that even associations representing the press ultimately accepted this exclusion in a message sent to me a few days ago."
"You touched on other key issues, for example the removal of other special rules on competition and the environment."
"To be frank, I find it difficult to accept the removal of the special rules in these areas."
"Special rules are not always appropriate for every situation, but when it comes to competition, the special rule is, in my view, vitally important, because it clarifies the general rule for locating the market concerned."
"I therefore welcome the fact that the rapporteur from a major political group will now advocate retaining special rules of this kind and will support this drafting proposal."
"As regards the environment, the special rule is aimed at preventing environmental dumping, and, in the current political climate, the Commission is the guarantor of a very high level of environmental protection."
"I believe that Rome II can contribute to this."
"As for the Council, you will be aware that most Member States that have codified private international law have special rules for these two issues, and the Council advocates not only retaining these two special rules but, like the Commission, its has in fact added further recitals."
"We are of the same opinion: special rules must reinforce legal certainty."
"As regards traffic accidents, I share Parliament's concern to improve the situation of traffic accident victims."
"This, at least, is one of the objectives contained in its proposal."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs today proposed a new rule whereby the judge must ensure that compensation is provided for all prejudice sustained."
"This is a very interesting idea, but I believe that that comes under harmonising the Member States' material civil law and is no longer a matter of private international law."
"Rome II is not, in my view, the right framework for such harmonisation, but I can confirm that I want to find a solution to the problem posed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and by Parliament, albeit in a different context of substantial harmonisation."
"As regards the issue of whether the general rule can lead to satisfactory solutions in this area or whether a new special rule is required, I remain open to the idea of studying this problem in detail, as provided for in Amendment 26 of the Implementation Report."
"This quickly leads us on to the issue of implementing foreign law."
"This is covered by Amendments 12 and 21, and is a vital component of the Hague Programme."
"Let me reiterate that Rome II is not the right framework for such rules, which should apply to the entire commercial and civil field."
"More generally, I am happy to commit to carrying out a detailed study of measures aimed at facilitating the implementation of foreign law."
"The same indeed applies to the directive on the country of origin principle."
"The Services Directive already preserves the application of the Rome II and Rome I instruments."
"Accordingly, I do not feel that the rule proposed in Amendment 24 is necessary, not because this principle does not need to be clarified, but because there is already a guarantee."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I, too, wish to thank Mrs Wallis for having made some important points."
"We have, this past week, heard much about the 'citizens' Europe'."
"When one looks at the title of this document, one is inclined to assume that many members of the public would, at the sight of it, 'switch off' on the grounds that they regard the law on non-contractual obligations as difficult, but it is the European issue par excellence, something to which most European motorists have given thought at least once, and along these lines: 'I am from country A, am travelling through country B and meet with an accident involving a driver from country C, who may well have a person from country D travelling with him'."
"Situations such as that are a regular occurrence, and we are, by means of this dossier, doing more work on a citizens' Europe. The need to regulate such matters is made even more pressing as people become more and more mobile and borders less and less important."
"There are still improvements to be made on this front."
"It follows that the 'citizens' Europe' is at stake."
"We have, today, already made reference to other aspects of the law that certainly come up less frequently than road accidents, namely liability for criminal acts, unfair competition and the complicated things to consider with reference to the environment."
"My group will seek to keep this House's options as regards this third reading and conciliation procedure as open as possible."
"We believe that there is still a lot of scope for making the regulations more suitable to their task. I want to underline what Mrs Wallis has already said."
"What this House is being asked to help decide on here is a new reality, one aspect of which will be that we will, once the outcome of the third reading is known, have to pay very close attention to those things that might well not have been legally approved, but did, at second reading in this House, gain the approval of a majority, and consider whether these things - which matter to this House - might perhaps be taken on board after all."
"We have every right to await with tense anticipation what will emerge from the third reading."
"We will try to get the options for a citizens' Europe kept as open as possible."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, we are dealing with a rather complex text that has been subject to a series of amendments in the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and with regard to which the committee is drawing up our position on the points of view expressed by the Council."
"I believe that the rapporteur has done a good job, but the positions in the Committee on Legal Affairs were adopted by one group, with a majority in that committee but not in plenary, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is therefore expressing its disagreement with several of the amendments approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"I am referring in particular to the removal of the reference to 'special rules', for example those relating to television without borders, e-commerce and other things."
"I am also referring to the issue of environmental damage."
"Environmental damage is now such an important issue that we cannot possibly have legislation that does not take account of that special aspect."
"There is another aspect: the issue of unfair competition."
"Unfair competition also warrants some kind of detailed regulation."
"A statement of a general nature is not sufficient, since it affects many aspects of the internal market."
"In summary, we agree with the majority of the amendments presented by the rapporteur, but we disagree with several of the amendments approved within the Committee on Legal Affairs, which reflect a majority that I would describe as circumstantial, and which is probably not going to be reflected in this Chamber."
"In any event, I have the feeling that we are going to have to examine this issue in detail in conciliation, depending on the result of the votes held here."
"Given that different political groups have presented different amendments to several of the amendments approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs, until we have the results of the vote tomorrow, it is going to be rather difficult to know what Parliament's final text will be."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ET) Mr President, Mrs Wallis, Commissioner."
"While the draft legislation was in progress, my supporters and I planned to submit a motion to amend the Rome II report."
"Unfortunately this was not successful."
"For that reason I would like to present the content of the motion to you now."
"Pursuant to the regulation's general rule, the law of the country in which the damage arises is to be applied in the case of non-contractual obligations."
"Article 9, however, contains an exception, and requires the automatic application of the laws of the country in which the industrial action takes place."
"I would recommend that Article 9 be removed from the draft legislation."
"The exception in Article 9 does not give equal consideration to all parties in employment relations, and may place small and medium-sized companies providing services abroad in a very unfavourable situation."
"Due to possible industrial action, companies cannot fulfil their contractual obligations, and are forced to return their employees, compensate the damages that have arisen and pay a contractual penalty, and thus the anticipated revenue is not obtained."
"Thus the damages arising from the industrial action arise in the country in which the company is located, and not in the country in which the industrial action takes place."
"In my opinion, an analysis of the effects of the introduction of Article 9 into Community legislation should have been performed before the article was introduced."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 'Rome II' is an abstract title cloaking issues that have a very direct, and very considerable, impact on the public, and it was for that reason that the arguments in committee on the various issues were so hard-hitting."
"I propose to highlight three of them."
"The first is the issue of the impact on the environment of damage from across borders."
"Where the protection of the environment is concerned, the fatal tendency generally manifests itself that people try to ignore the problems of their neighbours, even when they themselves, by means of irresponsible action, are the cause of them."
"We cannot but note with regret that it is turning out over and over again that people do not care and that installations emitting pollutants are being built very close to borders."
"We have tried to come up with rules enabling victims of such environmental problems to enjoy the maximum protection possible and preventing the sort of environmental dumping to which the Commissioner referred."
"It is regrettable that both the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have decided not to agree to this, thereby opening the way to a retrograde step that I think would be fatal."
"I look to the Council and the Commission to help us find a better way."
"We have managed, where protection against defamation in the press is concerned, to come up with a compromise that I see as protecting and supporting press freedom, one of the European Union's fundamental values, which we must treat with respect and which must be central to what we do, and which is best protected if the legal consequences can be discussed in the country in which the newspaper or medium is based."
"I regard road accidents as particularly important, in that anyone can, potentially, be affected by them; on this point we have arrived at a compromise, and I hope that it will be accepted in the course of negotiations with other bodies."
"The public can expect us to take account of their day-to-day needs and to prioritise the interests of the victims; that is what the people of Europe expect of us."
"(PL) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur."
"She has worked hard to ensure that this difficult and technical report reflects Parliament's amendments after first reading as accurately as possible."
"This is most important, especially as regards the article on defamation, which is of particular interest to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I appreciate the political difficulties that make it exceptionally difficult to reach agreement in the Council on the issue of the article concerning defamation."
"We would do well to remember, however, that Parliament's stance on this matter at first reading was very clear."
"In my view, the solution proposed at first reading really was the best attempt at a compromise reconciling the interests of injured parties and publishers."
"The Commission, in its amended opinion, and the Council, in its common position, rejected the idea of including in this regulation provisions concerning legislation to be applied in cases of defamation."
"As stated in its opinion at first reading, however, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs believes that this issue should not be excluded."
"The stance adopted by Parliament at first reading is a sensible one and it is in line with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice."
"Turning briefly to the remaining issues, it should be borne in mind that conflict-of-law rules tend to be governed by a logic of their own, and linking it with legislation concerning the common market may create problems through lack of consistency."
"Nonetheless, the exclusions concerning unfair competition and environmental protection which result in these areas being covered by special provisions actually introduce unnecessary complications into European private law and run counter to the general effort to deregulate and simplify our legislation."
"In conclusion, I should like to state that our Community now has an opportunity to lay the foundations of a common system of civil law."
"Work on the Rome I and Rome III Regulations is under way."
"I trust we have almost completed the work on Rome II as well."
"Work on common reference frameworks is progressing too."
"I hope all these projects will make a positive contribution to the smooth running of the internal market within our great European venture."
"(PL) Mr President, I should like to begin by warmly congratulating Mrs Wallis, the rapporteur, and thanking her for her work on such a key issue for the future of European integration."
"This represents an important step forward towards the development of a common area of freedom, security and justice for Europe."
"As we consider the draft regulation before us today, we should pay particular attention to the need for consistency between provisions in force and subsequent regulations."
"It is important to ensure that the latter do not impose additional burdens and do not therefore hinder the efficient operation of the internal market."
"On the contrary, they should stimulate its development."
"Mr Medina Ortega has already referred to several specific issues, including those relating to environmental protection and competition."
"I should like to state the importance of ensuring that issues pertaining to applicable law are considered appropriately, both by the parties and by the court, thus guaranteeing legal certainty."
"Standardisation of provisions is called for in certain cases. These include issues relating to defamation, violation of the right to privacy and personal rights, and establishing the amount of damages in cases of bodily injury."
"We should support Parliament's position at first reading with a view to ensuring that the regulation covers situations in which a manifestly closer connection may be considered to exist with the country which is the principal place of publication or dissemination of information, for instance information constituting defamation of character."
"This can be achieved by a single provision applicable to all publications including those on the Internet."
"The position concerning the application of national victim law to determine damages in the case of accidents causing bodily injury should also be supported."
"Such an approach will make the free movement of people within the internal market more attractive."
"It will also avoid placing an unfair burden on the social security and assistance schemes of the country of habitual residence of an accident victim."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Wallis for her pertinent work on this dossier and for her excellent cooperation as the ALDE Group's coordinator in the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"Together with the Rome II Regulation, the EU is establishing a coherent legal framework with regard to relationships between international private laws and other Community instruments."
"This regulation should promote rather than hamper the proper functioning of the internal market, in particular the free movement of goods and services."
"I was very unhappy to hear that the negotiations with the Council have been unsuccessful so far, but I am absolutely certain that Mrs Wallis will continue to raise the points of both our committee and Parliament."
"I should like to raise two issues in particular."
"Firstly, the violation of privacy and rights related to the personality, including defamation, should be excluded completely from the scope of Rome II."
"In the absence of rules protecting editorial independence, exclusion would be the only viable solution that would not undermine press freedom."
"It is regrettable that the Council did not give its support for this amendment at first reading."
"The second issue is an important question of principle - as was the previous issue - notably regarding Article 9 of the proposal regarding industrial action and applicable law that raises specific difficulties for the European maritime and shipping industry."
"The Swedish Government proposed this article in the spring of 2006, with reference to the European Court of Justice judgment in Case C-18/02."
"This case concerns questions regarding jurisdiction and choice of law when a ship flying the flag of one Member State is being boycotted in another Member State."
"Ships moving around are typically serving harbours of different countries."
"If industrial action against ships were to be governed by the laws of the different harbours served during a voyage, the rules that would apply would vary all the time, i.e. different rules would form the basis of legality of industrial action taken against a ship."
"This would both be impractical and create great uncertainty."
"It is generally the case that all internal relations on a ship are governed by the law of the flag state."
"Therefore, let us not give these powers to the labour unions, which would certainly use these provisions to blackmail our shippers and hamper the competitiveness of the European seafaring industry."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, infringements of Community competition rules have, or may have, effects in several Member States."
"The possible application by legal authorities of the criterion of using as many legislations as countries affected may complicate actions for damages, hinder legal action and weaken competition."
"As rapporteur for the report on private actions for damages deriving therefrom, I believe that they deserve their own treatment, and I would point out that the Commission has reserved the right to present proposals once the consultation under way has been completed."
"The amendment that I presented, together with Mrs Berger, with which the rapporteur agrees - and I thank him for that - draws attention to this situation and proposes that the actor making the claim in the place of residence of the defendant should have the option of choosing the lex fori for their claim."
"The conciliation will enable us to go further into the issue and decide how to deal with it appropriately."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly at 12 noon."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"In view of the progressive cross-border movement of people, products and information it has become essential to achieve a common identification of the law applicable in non-contractual obligations."
"However, there appears to be a distinction with what is being proposed by the Commission and the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"The essence of this legislation is whether it can co-exist in harmony with existing national laws or it can supplant same."
"The Committee believes that national laws and what is being proposed will not hinder but enhance national laws."
"A clear distinction has to be made and once there is general agreement of more uniformity then this legislation should be all-encompassing and it is important that the possibility of ambiguity of the applicable law is resolved."
"It is apparent that there is a lacuna in the Rome Convention of 1980 and that subsequently entered into in Brussels, and whereas the applicable law arising from non-contractual obligations has been adequately tackled, the relevant disputes still need to be addressed in full."
"The second important distinction relates to the content."
"There seems to be a different approach as to what non-contractual obligations should be included in the current legislation."
"Such issues as environmental ones are to be left to national legislation, whereas the original proposal had a wider scope."

"I would like to ask the rapporteur whether he is able to give us any further information on those two amendments."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, the original wording of Amendment 22 created problems for some railway companies in a number of EU Member States, because they work with very short notice periods for contracts."
"In order to counteract these problems without necessitating fundamental changes, we have split the amendment into three sections, keeping most of the text but taking out the word 'existing' after the second split vote, and removing the last sentence after the third split vote, as a result of which we have retained the essence but managed to do away with the practical problems."

"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the ability to speak openly is not something to be taken for granted."
"I am sure that you have all heard about the terrible murder, on 19 January, of the Armenian-Turkish journalist Hrant Dink, who had, over recent years, frequently drawn attention to himself with his calls for engagement with the history of the Armenians under Ottoman rule, attracting the hostility of many nationalists and being repeatedly prosecuted by the Turkish justice system on account of what he wrote and said."
"I wish, on behalf of this House, to express our outrage at this crime."
"We acknowledge, and are glad, that the Turkish Government as a whole has expressed similar sentiments and that its determination has already resulted in the arrest of one who has admitted perpetrating the deed."
"The alleged murderer - who is only 17 years of age - is evidently motivated by, among other things, nationalist sentiments and complete contempt for the opinions of others."
"According to media reports, Hrant Dink's funeral was attended by thousands of people, and these included Mr Joost Lagendijk, representing me in his capacity as chairman of the delegation to the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, and Mrs HÃ©lÃ¨ne Flautre, the chairman of our human rights sub-committee."
"The overwhelming sympathy of the Turkish people and media give cause for hope that this sad event will prompt the Turkish Government to delay no longer in introducing further reforms in the area of criminal law aimed at protecting the free expression of opinion."
"I will now ask you to do as we did when the great Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya was murdered and rise from your seats to honour Hrant Dink in silent remembrance."

"Moratorium on the death penalty (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the moratorium on the death penalty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I have to talk to you about today is one of the most fundamental components of the European Union's policy on human rights, and the many motions for a resolution tabled by the various groups in your House indicate just how live an issue this is."
"Taking as its basis the guidelines for the EU's policy in respect of third states and the death penalty as adopted in 1998 by its Council of Ministers, the European Union is campaigning worldwide for the abolition of the death penalty under all circumstances, and the declaration of moratoria has for some years been a consistent feature of that campaign - albeit not as its main objective, but as an intermediate stage on the way to the practice's abolition once and for all."
"The European Union will continue its policy of protection for human rights under German Presidency and will therefore be arguing forcefully for moratoria on the death penalty and for its permanent abolition."
"That means that we will, on the one hand, continue to pursue the debate on the issue of principle - not only on bilateral contact but also in multilateral fora, the United Nations in particular - whilst also, on the other hand, continuing to be pro-active in approaching those countries that are at a turning point - that is to say, those in which either positive or negative trends are perceptible as regards the death penalty - and to bring influence to bear on them by means, that is, of very definite demarches in many urgent individual cases."
"I am aware that your House has been a constant advocate for this policy and am glad to be able to say that we have already, together, achieved a great deal."
"The fact that, in something like two-thirds of the world's countries, the death penalty has been legally abolished or is in practice a dead letter is attributable to the sustained efforts of all active campaigners against the practice, and I am happy to be able to stress that active involvement in the Council Europe has played its part."
"Thirty-three states have now ratified the 13th additional protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, the effect of which is to outlaw capital punishment even in time of war."
"I would also like to mention, however, that there are still too many states - numbering 66 - that continue to carry out executions, along with some regrettably retrograde trends when it comes to the observance of moratoria."
"This is why it is so important that we should be unstinting in our efforts and should aim our arguments for the abolition of the death penalty at international fora and elsewhere."
"The European Union submitted resolutions to this end to the Human Rights Commission from 1999 until the Commission's dissolution in 2005, and, over that period, it proved possible to secure stable majorities in favour of them."
"Since that body was dissolved, we have had to seek new ways of moving the debate on the abolition of capital punishment forward, although it has to be said that, since there are no easy answers to this, our actions have to be very well thought-out if - and this is a priority - we are to avoid being obliged to retreat from positions already secured."
"On this line there has, up to now, been firm agreement in the European Union, but we have, up to now, refrained from putting a resolution to this effect to the UN General Assembly in view of the continued high risk of it not being supported."
"Instead, on 19 December, at the European Union's initiative, and for the first time ever, a unilateral declaration against the death penalty was put to the General Assembly, and it is important to note that it was supported by 85 states from all parts of the globe."
"Encouraging though this result is, it does also confirm that the chances of a resolution from the EU meeting with success in the General Assembly cannot as yet be seen as 100% certain."
"What, then, is to happen next?"
"It is clear to all partners in the European Union that we want to continue to actively promote the cause of the campaign against capital punishment, at the United Nations and elsewhere, but I would, at the same time, like to make it clear that this is still a very difficult area, and so any campaign against the death penalty will only meet with success if the European Union's actions are step by step and well thought-out."
"Our watchword should continue to be that the possibility of a new EU initiative's failure should be excluded as far as possible, for a defeat for the European Union would be a victory for the advocates of the death penalty and hence a reversal in the fight against this inhumane mode of punishment, something that we do not want and must not allow to happen."
"I believe that we will also find supporters."
"It is for that reason that some of the principal players among the non-governmental organisations, Amnesty International being one of them, advise against precipitate action and are reminding us that insisting again on this subject being debated in the General Assembly of the United Nations could turn out to be counter-productive for the European Union."
"Agreement was therefore reached at the General Affairs Council of 22 January that we would first devise a well thought-out approach that would progressively enable us to present our concerns more effectively to the United Nations."
"The ambassadors in New York and Geneva were therefore mandated to do everything possible, and without delay, to bring forward a debate at United Nations level."
"It will also be necessary to draw on the experience and current estimates of the relevant NGOs as to what further steps to take in combating the death penalty at UN level."
"This will then enable the Presidency of the Council to make proposals in February to the EU partners as to further action."
"This I regard as a first and important step, and I hope that we will find others willing to support us in this course of action."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I also welcome this opportunity to exchange views on the issue of the death penalty and on the means to promote the universal abolition of this odious practice."
"As you know, the abolition of the death penalty worldwide represents a key objective of the external human rights policy of the European Union, and I am personally committed to seeing the EU continue to play a lead role, as we have just heard, in this global effort."
"Since all of us here agree on the ultimate goal of our action in this field, namely universal abolition, I wish to provide some thoughts on this process of abolition and on the means to reach our common goal."
"Firstly, let us not forget that the experience of abolition on the European continent has been a slow, often tortuous and protracted process, which has been, for most of our Member States, driven by a combination of strong political leadership and a mature level of development of human rights protection, the rule of law and democratic institutions."
"With some notable exceptions, including the United States of America and Japan, the global map of abolitionist countries also closely follows that of democratic pluralism."
"Visionary leadership and political courage are key to abolishing the death penalty."
"These efforts often need to be bolstered by a dynamic and open nationwide debate to ensure that the ultimate political decision to abolish the death penalty in a country is also a permanent one."
"In the Philippines, and to some extent Kyrgyzstan, the recent abolition of the death penalty was precisely the result both of remarkable courage on the part of the political leadership and a profound nationwide debate, which witnessed wide participation from civil society actors - which has been mentioned - and institutions."
"In the United States of America, there are also some encouraging trends in some states, like New Jersey and Maryland."
"On the other hand, it is not excluded that a country falls back into the practice of death penalty as we, unfortunately, have witnessed in Bahrain and need to fear in Peru."
"And in many other countries our appeals to abolish the death penalty have fallen on deaf ears until now."
"The execution of Saddam Hussein and his henchmen has now sparked a renewed debate on the death penalty."
"The horrific videos of his undignified end upset even some supporters of the death penalty."
"But let us not forget that every year thousands are executed, most of whom are certainly somewhat better people than Saddam and many are even innocent."
"Their deaths should outrage us even more!"
"While evidently the abolition of the death penalty in any country is, to quote Robert Badinter, 'a victory of humanity over itself', one must remain realistic as to the influence of external actors, such as the European Union, in this process, because this process remains first and foremost a domestic one."
"This is not to say that the European Union will sit on the fence."
"On the contrary, the EU has been and will remain at the very forefront of international efforts, notably at the United Nations, as was mentioned, to fight the death penalty."
"Last December, the EU presented a Declaration on the Death Penalty at the UN General Assembly, which received the support of a record 85 states."
"In line with our guidelines on the death penalty, the European Union has carried out numerous demarches on individual death penalty cases, including in countries such as the United States of America, Iran and Indonesia, and will continue to do so in the future."
"The EU is also the leading source of funding for abolitionist projects run by civil society, and over the past ten years, we have spent over EUR 15 million supporting such projects around the world."
"The European Parliament and civil society actors have traditionally played a crucial role in both supporting the abolitionist efforts of the European Union and in stimulating the debate on the means to enhance our policy."
"It is of prime importance to listen carefully to those voices when discussing possible initiatives in various international forums, as the Council is currently doing."
"This has certainly been illustrated most recently by the Italian proposal for a universal moratorium on the death penalty at the UN General Assembly."
"Without prejudging the final outcome of this process of reflection, I wish to share three observations made by abolitionist actors on the moratorium which have struck me as relevant for feeding today's discussion."
"While representing a key element in the EU's strategy towards universal abolition, leading NGOs have stressed that a moratorium is not a panacea."
"They claim it is by essence fragile, reversible and must be followed by abolition in law."
"They refer to the example of Kyrgyzstan, where the regularly extended moratorium on executions has not prevented the number of prisoners on death row from increasing."
"I think we need moratoria that hold firm."
"Secondly, some NGOs underline the fact that the moratorium is one abolitionist tool among others."
"I agree that, in this context, the promotion of the Second Optional Protocol providing for abolition, the support for legal counselling for death row convicts and other efforts have to be included in our toolbox."
"Hence, we should avoid the current discussion on the moratorium to eclipse the fact that abolition is a multi-faceted process."
"Lastly, when bringing the issue back to the UN General Assembly, we need to be cautious as to the possible outcome."
"It is paramount to secure a positive result."
"We need to be alive, however, to the risk of an ambiguous or even a counterproductive outcome - and the Council Presidency has alluded to it - given international divisions on this subject."
"Failing in such an effort could have negative consequences which will be difficult to repair."
"Therefore, we need to assess the situation and possible scenarios thoroughly before moving."
"In conclusion, I wish to underline the importance of maintaining a common EU approach towards the universal abolition of the death penalty."
"The Commission will spare no efforts to work with the Presidency and Parliament to this end."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) I believe that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner's words clearly indicate the model of Europe we want to see: a Europe of values."
"If I had briefly to paint a picture illustrating what the European dream has been over the years, I would have no hesitation in stating at this sitting, Madam President, that the idea of Europe represents a permanent call for peace, understanding, harmony and solidarity; and that, in addition to a legitimate vision of Europe, such as the Europe of financial perspectives, the Europe of the tangible, the Europe of net balance and net contributor, I believe that there is a higher vision of Europe, which is the Europe of values."
"It is precisely within this context and in accordance with this vision of a Europe of values that this initiative is seeking a universal moratorium on the application of the death penalty."
"It must be of a universal nature, because fundamental rights, and the right to life in particular, must not be preached for one region, one country or one continent, but they must clearly be of a universal global nature."
"We must therefore celebrate the fact that, in 2005 and 2006, a whole series of countries, such as Liberia, Mexico, the Philippines and Moldova, have decided formally to abolish the death penalty."
"I believe that we must continue to work tirelessly to ensure that the seventy countries that still apply the death penalty join the 128 countries that no longer apply it."
"Madam President, I would like to say that, if the European Union is to preserve that moral and ethical leadership that it has been exercising, it is essential that we fight to ensure that democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights, and in particular the right to life, prevail in all regions of the world, this year and over the years to come."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on which we will vote tomorrow and this evening's debate situate the European Parliament in that international movement that is appealing to the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a resolution for a universal moratorium, which is a first step towards the general abolition of the death penalty from the statute books of every country."
"As has been said, we would like the Council of Ministers to actively commit itself to achieving this objective; the Presidency is very committed, and we hope that this point remains one of the priorities of its term of office."
"The same commitment has been made by the Council of Europe and the European Commission."
"From what she has said, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner does not actually seem to me to be very convinced of the fact that, as a first step, we need to go through a moratorium."
"I, on the other hand, would emphasise this point, and I would ask Mrs Ferrero-Waldner: Would not going through a moratorium bring abolition any closer?"
"I do not think so: this could therefore be a first step, not least because the European Union, in its international relations, could bring to bear the extensive relations it enjoys in the context of the neighbourhood policy, the association agreements and the strategic partnership, and, in my opinion, Europe's political parties could also do their best within international forums to ensure that their organisations put pressure on the participating countries."
"I believe that the aim is to banish the death penalty from the statute books of every State, an act that would, among other things, help to ensure that the United Nations enjoys a reputation for being an institution that safeguards universally recognised rights."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine my speech to a statement and a note issued this morning by the German Presidency."
"Word for word, the note reads: 'the German Presidency calls on the governments concerned to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty with immediate effect'."
"I am reading the note from the German Presidency."
"This is precisely our position."
"I think I am right in saying that Mr Barroso also issued a statement fully supporting the Italian initiative, the aim of which is to have a proposal for a moratorium drafted within the current UN General Assembly."
"This proposal will undoubtedly win through: as far back as 1999 there was an absolute majority in favour of a resolution, which was not tabled."
"Faced with the enthusiasm that we are seeing throughout the world right now for our initiative - that of the European Parliament, of the chairmen of our groups, the initiative that was pre-announced very specifically in Strasbourg by Mr Watson and other Members - I therefore do not understand - or, rather, I understand only too well - how it is possible to stall, at a time when France is taking the incredible step of highlighting the abolition of the death penalty with a change to its Constitution; when Rwanda is also doing so; and when, just yesterday, Kyrgyzstan did so."
"Statements are coming in from everywhere - from Syria, from Lebanon - in support of our position."
"I believe that, in the future, the European Parliament, like the Council of Europe before it, will lead this movement."
"To conclude my speech, Madam President, I should like to point out that, 60 years ago, there was a Rome-Berlin axis."
"I was 10 years old, and I remember it well."
"It happens today that, with the coming-together of the German Presidency, the Italian initiative and the very recent French initiatives, a new situation is emerging: I believe that it is historically important that in a certain way Berlin and Rome are now taking a definite stand, with no hypocrisy or fear of winning, because there are too many people here who are scared of winning, not losing."
"Madam President, last week, during the debate on the Benghazi case, we stated our total opposition to the death penalty under any circumstances."
"It is now important to reaffirm this principle, which is enshrined in Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Union has always advocated the abolition of the death penalty, and has even gone so far as to make it a condition of accession and a key principle of its foreign policy."
"Moreover, guidelines were adopted in 1998, and civil society projects are regularly funded under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"This effort has been rewarded: the number of executions in the United States has gone down, and in countries like Mexico, Liberia, the Philippines and Moldova, the death penalty has been abolished."
"The same is not true everywhere, however."
"Some US States have extended the scope of the death penalty to other crimes apart from murder; in Singapore, a person is still automatically sentenced to death for carrying 15 grams of heroin, and China still executes more people than any other country."
"In addition, there are countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, which have reinstated the death penalty."
"Peru almost did likewise in the name of combating terrorism, but fortunately this did not happen."
"Against this backdrop and ahead of the developing world congress [against the death penalty], the EU must be extra vigilant."
"The international groundswell of opinion in favour of a universal moratorium on the death penalty should be addressed within the framework of a pro-abolition policy."
"Ensuring the ratification of the second protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aimed at abolishing the death penalty should therefore be one of the Union's priorities."
"It is crucial that France, Latvia and Poland, which have yet to ratify the protocol, do so at the earliest opportunity."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 'No one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed."
"No one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.'"
"This is what is laid down by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and this is what makes me - indeed, I believe, makes us - proud to be part of the European Union."
"It is the upholding of human dignity; it is realising that no one can rule another person's life and that there should be no revenge, only justice."
"This should be true for all courts, including military ones."
"Too many countries still have the death penalty, and they include not only large countries such as China, but also the most important military and democratic power - the United States - which has still not been able to leave its Wild West culture behind."
"I hope that the Congress against the Death Penalty being held in Paris, in which we, as Parliament, will take part, will be a further step on from the moratorium on the way to abolishing the death penalty and eradicating poverty around the world."
"I also hope that the people who take to the streets of Paris will be a warning to all those who, even in Europe, are thinking of bringing back the death penalty."
"In any event, it is these street protests that will lead to the UN's approving the moratorium in full."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Madam President, countries where capital punishment still exists do not deserve to be part of the civilised world, no matter whether these countries are Islamic, where adulterous women are stoned, the America of Bush, India, the world's largest democracy, or Communist China."
"I will therefore not hesitate to back the plea for a worldwide moratorium."
"One judicial error, the life of one innocent, is enough to write capital punishment off as barbaric."
"Allow me, though, to add two observations."
"Respect for life should not stop a constitutional state from giving serious offenders effective and irreducible penalties of 30 years, or lifelong imprisonment for that matter."
"This condition must, and indeed can, underpin the public's consensus against the death penalty."
"This consensus will not come about unless our citizens, who are increasingly faced with the most brutal forms of crime, add their voice to the worldwide abolition of capital punishment."
"Secondly, some opponents of capital punishment should display a certain degree of consistency."
"For example, on a recent friendly visit to China, which is a single-party state, the French Socialist Presidential candidate sang the praises of the efficiency of the Chinese justice system."
"This efficiency involves the families of the thousands of people who have been sentenced to death every year being presented with the bill for the bullets that killed the victims, but SÃ©golÃ¨ne Royal did not spare a thought for them."
"After all, they do not bring in the contracts, because the commercial interests of major enterprises in China must be protected, and that is when some European opponents of capital punishment go all quiet all of a sudden."
"If Europe wants to retain its credibility, it should exert pressure on countries such as China, whatever the political or commercial cost."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"The execution of Saddam Hussein has put the spotlight back on the debate on the death penalty, a debate that is absolutely timely, although it must not be used for tactical purposes and, above all, it must not be a subject that is raised on and off."
"This is first and foremost a battle of civilisation and progress."
"We do not just have here an essential guarantee for individuals, a request for the inviolability of individuals to be further strengthened; we are also faced with an historic and universal need, a global milestone and focal point for 21st-century civilisation."
"It has been said, and I agree, that, after the abolition of slavery in previous centuries and the ban on torture, the right not to be killed following a court ruling should be another common denominator, a new and inalienable dimension of humankind that makes a community of us all."
"Today, this Parliament is sending out the first clear message along these lines."
"Mr President, I want to support the strong calls from this Parliament today - and the campaign outside Parliament - for a worldwide moratorium on executions to be established unconditionally through a resolution of the UN General Assembly."
"For many years, the EU has maintained as a main pillar of foreign affairs and human rights policy the objective of ending the use of the death penalty globally."
"We have had some success, particularly as part of our neighbourhood strategy."
"Today's initiative is an ambitious attempt to raise the profile of the debate on the death penalty to a UN level and to have an impact on the 66 countries that have already been referred to that still use the death penalty."
"It is important to note that working towards achieving a moratorium on the death penalty should always be linked to achieving an eventual abolition through legislation, as previous speakers have pointed out."
"The pragmatic first step is a call for a moratorium, but we must always look at ways to promote abolition where possible."
"Looking at what we can do here in the EU from a policy perspective, I would urge the Council to review and update the guidelines on the death penalty, which date back to 1998, so that new elements and strategies that have developed since then can be taken into consideration."
"The Third World Congress on the Death Penalty, which is to be held soon in Paris, may be a good opportunity to do just that."
"To date, the EU's proactive policy on the death penalty has produced some positive results."
"For example, recently, the success of strong EU representations in Peru to recent proposals to extend the death penalty to that country, in violation of the Peruvian Constitution and the American Convention on Human Rights, needs to be acknowledged and welcomed."
"The EU stance did have an impact on the Peruvian Congress in its rejection of draft legislation."
"So the EU has shown that it can be a key influence on national policy towards the death penalty, and we should not be afraid to use that influence."
"(ES) Madam President, yesterday, Robert Wilson, of 24 years of age, was sentenced to death by a jury in New York."
"This is the first death sentence to be handed down in that State for 50 years."
"This is another tragic example of the current threat to the universal values that we are all defending here today, despite the very significant progress that has been made in countries such as Liberia, Mexico, the Philippines and Moldova."
"We must, however, continue to fight to ensure that others, such as China, with around two thousand official executions per year - eight thousand, according to unofficial data - join the global moratorium and suspend their executions."
"We must support Iranian civil society, which is rising up against the death penalty."
"Iran has one of the highest numbers of executions: 177 in 2006."
"Furthermore, it has broken the moratorium on stonings and it currently has six women sentenced to death by stoning."
"Above all, we appeal to the United States, a country whose decisions have an immense impact on global politics, to support the Italian initiative to establish a universal moratorium on the death penalty which will be approved - with this Parliament's support, I hope - in the United Nations General Assembly."
"As other speakers have said here today, the moratorium is a first essential step towards abolition."
"This is probably one of the most important challenges facing the human race at the beginning of this century."
"Madam President, worldwide, 20 000 people are on death row waiting to be killed by their own governments."
"Sadly, over 3000 of these are in the United States."
"I do not single the US out because it is the worst - that is China, with 80% of executions - but because we have hope of the Americans."
"The great prize would be for a change of mind in the United States and the signs are there."
"The number of executions in the states of the US has dropped dramatically since 1999: there were 277 in that year, and 128 in 2005."
"Twelve states have now abolished the death penalty, not including Texas, which clocks up an unimpressive one-third of the 1100 executions in the US in the last 30 years."
"I think the Commission and the Presidency need to be more proactive and less hesitant in seeking a moratorium and abolition worldwide through a UN General Assembly resolution."
"As in some other areas of human rights policy, like extraordinary rendition and war-on-terror abuses, the EU is not always as effective in putting its principles into practice as Parliament would wish."
"(EL) Madam President, as we speak, all the Member States of the Union have ratified the sixth protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the abolition of the death penalty."
"We also nourish the hope that it will be abolished both by law and in practice in all the countries of the world - be it in times of peace or in times of war - with the result that there will be an improvement in respect for human rights and human dignity will be reinforced, as the Council and the Commission emphasised today."
"Allow me, however, to ask you if you were concerned about the human rights and dignity of the dictator Saddam Hussein and his fellow detainees, who became food for the entire world's voyeurs."
"Is this the role of the European Union as a global stability factor?"
"What can you say about the statements by the British foreign secretary, Mrs Becket, who emphasised that Hussein simply got what he deserved and that justice was done?"
"What are European citizens supposed to believe when they read the condemnatory statements by the Council, on the one hand, and hear the derisory comments by the ministers in it, on the other?"
"We need to get our act together, because we are ultimately just fooling ourselves."
"Madam President, I must say that the arrogance of this EU knows no bounds."
"Not satisfied with dictating to Member States that they must not avail of the ultimate deterrent - the death penalty - it now wishes to dictate to the rest of the world."
"Awful as the fate of the Bulgarian nurses in Libya is, and while this House should be vigorous in protesting against their situation, it does not justify us demanding a global ban on the death penalty."
"Wrongful imprisonment is intolerable, but it does not lead rational people to oppose all imprisonment."
"No, I say that if there is a fair, transparent, human rights compliant judicial system, with a reliable appeal process, then a sovereign nation state is perfectly entitled to deploy the death penalty for capital crimes, if that is the democratically expressed wish of its people."
"They, not we, have the right to choose what is right for them."
"(IT) Madam President, I am delighted to take the floor because, among other things, I come from Tuscany where, for the first time in history, on 30 November 1786, capital punishment was abolished."
"I am also moved to point out that, in 1987, I, together with Amnesty International and the Italian Movement for Life, succeeded in having the death penalty of Paula Cooper, a 16-year-old black girl, commuted in the United States."
"She later came to thank me."
"I am also pleased to point out that, as an Italian Member, I proposed and achieved the legal abolition of the death penalty in the military code of war, which is the reason for my in-depth thoughts on the matter."
"I take an optimistic view of human history which, in spite of everything, is a struggle for goodness, a struggle that is spurred on by an ever more obvious and decisive value: the dignity of each and every human being."
"So great is this dignity that it cannot be graded, and thus it determines the equal status of everybody, no matter what kind of life they lead."
"Dignity is also indestructible: not even the hands of a criminal can wipe away the traces of dignity from the face of the very man who has committed the crime."
"No one can take away a person's life and dignity, not even individual States."
"That is the real reason why the death penalty must be abolished."
"All the other practical reasons, of which I am only too aware, may meet with objections, but not this one."
"A Europe that seeks to base its identity not only on competition and the market, but also on dignity and human rights, cannot keep quiet."
"Right now, I do not want to talk about inconsistencies."
"The time will come when human dignity and the associated right to life extend their persuasive powers to other areas of human life where they are now sadly being overshadowed, even within our Union: the most symbolic areas of poverty and human alienation, which are to be born and to die."
"(ES) Madam President, rejecting the death penalty is not a question of moral superiority, nor of lecturing anybody, nor of collective pomposity on the part of Europe."
"It is consistent with a basic belief in human dignity, many years' experience of the utter pointlessness of capital punishment and fear of the serious and perfectly well-documented risk of its being applied unjustly, even if in only one specific case (and there have been many of them, regrettably)."
"Europe must apply itself to what is possible, without forgetting the ultimate objective."
"What is possible is to demand a moratorium courageously, throughout the world, beginning with our closest partners, without forgetting - I would insist - the ultimate objective, which would be the global abolition of the death penalty."
"We must protest against the death penalty, but that must include the death penalty on Saddam Hussein as well as the death penalty on the person sentenced in the United States, following a trial with practically no defence, for a crime he committed when he was under-age."
"Those death sentences, Commissioner, must be condemned just as vigorously as the death sentence on Saddam Hussein; we must not have double standards, because if what we are advocating is to fight the death penalty, those more or less anonymous prisoners who have had practically no right to defence deserve our support even more than a criminal such as Saddam Hussein."
"(PL) Madam President, the political, religious and legal debate on whether or not to apply the death penalty has been under way for decades and will continue into the future."
"The famous writer Albert Camus spoke out against it in his time, and Robert Badinter, a former French Justice Minister, led a legal battle at European level for many years."
"As a rule, strong ethical arguments are adduced in heated debates of this nature, and references are made to the inalienable right to life."
"Horrifying statistics about the number of sentences carried out in countries such as China or India are also quoted."
"The largest democracy in the world, the United States, is placed in the dock."
"Catholics opposed to the death penalty and those in favour of it contrive to base entirely contradictory arguments on the same sources, namely the Gospels, the Catechism and Papal encyclicals."
"It is very difficult to justify to the families and loved ones of people, often children, who have been cruelly murdered that the death penalty should not be applied to those responsible for the crimes."
"At such times, people's emotions incline them to desire a very different outcome."
"I hail from a country that suffered under the iron rule of Hitler's totalitarian Nazi regime and later under Soviet Communism."
"I would like to point out that use of the death penalty is a key feature of each and every dictatorship."
"When I look back at events in my country, Poland, during the period to which I previously referred, I see how whole legions of Poland's finest sons and daughters were murdered, following sentences handed down by Communist kangaroo courts."
"Having considered both sides of the argument concerning the death penalty, I am bound to say that its abolition is essential in order to curb the madness of fanatics prepared to use the legal system to eliminate their opponents."
"The most the fellow citizens of these murdered heroes can do years later, once freedom has been restored, is to put up monuments in their honour."
"This is what I have learnt from the history of my parents' and grandparents' generations and also of my own."
"Only one of the 1 500 death sentences carried out in Poland during the Stalinist period involved a common criminal."
"The price of restricting the actions of dictators of various political hues may well be that, instead of being guillotined, offenders who deserve this ultimate punishment will have to spend the rest of their lives in prison, without the opportunity of parole."
"If that is the case, I believe it is a price worth paying, however painful it may be to do so."
"(LT) - 'The death penalty is the most offensive method of killing, because it is done with the approval of the community.'"
"These words of George Bernard Shaw, pronounced almost a century ago, are being endorsed by an ever-increasing number of people and a majority of countries."
"Unfortunately, the natural human right to life is still ignored by 68 countries."
"The death penalty is most often implemented not only in Asia, but also in the United States."
"The execution of Saddam Hussein, I would say, has become a display of impotence."
"We are now presented with an exceptional opportunity to work hand in hand with the Italian Government to seek abolition of the death penalty in every country of the world."
"Opposition to the death penalty is one of the values that unites EU countries; therefore, the Union's voice carries weight."
"The United Nations General Assembly will, I hope, support the proposed moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty, and its abolition should be the ultimate goal."
"At the same time, it is essential to condemn the statements of some official representatives of the new EU countries about the possibility of legitimation of the death penalty."
"World public opinion needs to be channelled in the European direction."
"(PL) Madam President, Article 1 of Additional Protocol No VI to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms reads: 'The death penalty shall be abolished."
"No one shall be condemned to such a penalty or executed'."
"This protocol was laid down back in 1983, and underpins the thinking and actions of the Member States of the Union."
"It is also the stance adopted by most Members of the Council of Europe."
"Essentially, these are European standards for the protection of human rights."
"The question as to whether the abolition of the death penalty is only relevant to Europe is a rhetorical one. Clearly, the answer is no."
"Every individual has but one life and that life deserves to be protected."
"We must therefore support a UN moratorium on the death penalty."
"We are aware that the death penalty is rooted in a culture of revenge and retribution from which mankind needs to break free."
"It is very easy to delete the death penalty from criminal codes."
"All that is required is the legislators' will to do so."
"It will be much more difficult for us to detach ourselves from it at an emotional level, to recognise it as an unethical penalty and banish it forever from human consciousness."
"However, we must be aware that if we fail to do so, we shall have to go on asking ourselves whether, in the 21st century, man can continue to kill his fellow man in the name of the law."
"(PL) Madam President, the European Union has consistently advocated a ban on the application of the death penalty since 1998."
"In October 2003, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the European institutions and Member States of the Union to put pressure on the UN General Assembly to declare a moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty."
"The European institutions and Member States of the Union must ensure that the issue of the death penalty is dealt with again at the current UN General Assembly."
"Acting on behalf of the European Union, the Member States must aim at tabling a draft resolution on a general moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty, with a view to its abolition."
"They should garner maximum support for this resolution amongst the Member States of the UN."
"The European institutions and Member States of the Union should do all in their power to secure, as soon as possible, a favourable outcome in a vote at the current UN General Assembly."
"(EL) Madam President, the fact that broad agreement between the political party has prevailed in today's debate confirms that the European Parliament can act as the guarantor of European democratic civilisation and for the protection of human rights, human dignity and the right to life."
"It has been proven that the death penalty not only does not prevent crime, but also feeds hatred and violence."
"The civilised world cannot respond to the barbarity of a criminal act with the barbarity of death."
"We welcome the initiative by Mr Prodi's Italian Government and the backing being given to it by the president of the Socialist International, Georgos Papandreou."
"All the Member States of the European Union should certainly ratify the voluntary UN protocol, the 13th protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. I would say, however, that the Member States should incorporate a provision abolishing the death penalty in their internal constitutional order."
"To close, I should like to say that we should not overlook the fact that today in European society there is a large percentage of citizens who are still in favour of the death penalty and, as such, we must also work in this direction, together with the European Commission, with programmes working through democratic consultation to convince European society."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, what has become apparent from this debate is how great a consensus exists as regards what is one of the most fundamental objectives of the European Union's policy on human rights."
"Frequent reference was made in it to the Italian initiative, about which there must be no misunderstanding."
"When talking about this initiative, we are not talking about the 'whether' of it, or about what it is intended to achieve, but rather about the 'how', 'where', and, of course, the 'when' of it, in other words about the procedure rather than the substance."
"You, Commissioner, made that very clear earlier on."
"At the General Assembly on 19 December last year, a unilateral declaration was read out, and 85 states endorsed it; encouraging though that is, we must also, on the other hand, consider and bear in mind the question of whether our objective is capable of being achieved at all in view of the fact that, to date, this declaration has gained the support of only 21 out of 47 members of the new Human Rights Council in Geneva."
"To put it bluntly, we do not yet have a majority for it."
"The situation in the United Nations' third committee is similar."
"As I said in my statement earlier, there are now various fronts on which we have to take the initiative."
"The General Affairs and Foreign Relations Council, too, has come up with a strategy for achieving the goal to which all of you, in your interventions, have referred, and, although we do not at present know when we will be able to implement it, I can assure you that we will support you in your efforts; that is something on which we, the Commission and the Presidency are agreed, for we too are endeavouring to do away with capital punishment for ever."
"Madam President, I endorse what the President-in-Office Council has just said."
"I think there is widespread consensus in this House and between all the EU institutions on the substance of today's debate and where we want to go, but sometimes we have to see what the next tactical step is."
"I want to clarify that the Commission is certainly favourable to the introduction of a moratorium as an important intermediate step towards the complete abolition of the death penalty."
"We of course support the Italian initiative and Parliament's motion for a resolution, but we have to see - and this is at stake - the tactical nature."
"How can we ensure that the planned UN General Assembly initiative will be successful?"
"We need to ensure very good preparation."
"We have to reach out to all the UN members, and we need pertinent timing for the launch of the initiative of such a worldwide moratorium."
"We are also quite active not only at UN level, but also at bilateral level; we try to do that be it in China or Peru."
"I have, for instance, written to the Peruvian President to express our deep concerns, and hopefully there is still a chance to block it."
"I would also like to thank Parliament, because it also has possibilities."
"It has used them in the past, and maybe it can use them even more by talking to the different delegations."
"Very often, as I said before, it is a domestic issue, and the more Parliament can talk to parliaments, the better we can influence this."
"I have received six motions for a resolution in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 p.m."
"1."
"Appointments to parliamentary committees (vote): see Minutes"
"Voting time"
"Climate change (continuation of debate)"
"The next item is the debate on climate change."
"Mr President, I will try again."
"First of all, I should like to congratulate Commissioner Dimas and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Gabriel, warmly on their proposals and their inspirational speeches."
"It is particularly thanks to the Al Gore campaign and Sir Nicholas Stern's report that climate change has been in the spotlight so much in recent months."
"This means that now is a good time to make some solid headway."
"Europe must indeed take the lead in the climate debate and in the measures to be taken."
"What matters now is for the Commission's recent proposals to be taken up not only by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but also by the Heads of Government of the Member States."
"The climate problem is so extensive that it will be necessary to keep it on the agenda for decades to come."
"Since climate change, and hence global warming, cannot simply be slowed down, only rigorous steps will have an adequate effect."
"These will involve a shift towards carbon-free and low-carbon fuels as a necessary measure."
"In specific terms, this means that we need to say goodbye to fossil fuels."
"The European Parliament has already indicated that by 2020, Europe should have achieved a 30% reduction in CO2."
"The Commission, however, has proposed a 20% reduction in order to allow room for negotiations in a bid to achieve global agreement, which would then involve a 30% reduction in emissions in Europe."
"I should like Commissioner Dimas to explain to us why he thinks this tactic will work."
"Mr President, I should like to ask you for a little more time as I was unable to speak at my normal speed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a fairly common desire in this House, and certainly among the public, to combat climate change."
"However, allow me to make a remark, which will be useful in highlighting the intellectual honesty that we owe those citizens who are less acquainted with this subject: namely, when we talk about combating climate change, it is worth specifying that we are referring only to the influence that man and his activities have on the environment, an influence that, as has been scientifically proven, is far less significant than that of geophysical and astronomical determinants."
"True, it is useful to have an energy policy that not only is as environmentally friendly as possible but also guarantees the energy supply that is crucial to our development, something that, in Europe, with all our political independence from non-European countries, has so far been a distant prospect."
"I obviously agree on the emissions reduction targets, just as I do on the efforts to develop renewable energy sources."
"All of that is, of course, right, and the idea of encouraging people to use less-polluting vehicles seems to be a good one."
"Is it not the case, though, that the situation will end up as it has in Italy, where the 2007 budget law favours those who are in a position to buy new vehicles and actually condemns precisely those who are least well-off, who cannot afford to change their vehicles, to a lack of mobility and heavy costs?"
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, while I am not being Sinophobic - please believe me when I say that - I would ask once again: is there any sense in all of our unilateral efforts regarding sustainability when, in one year, China and the Asian economic tigers emit as much climate-changing gas into the atmosphere as is produced in ten years by EU countries?"
"Mr President, I listened very carefully to what Minister Gabriel said, because the headlines in the Irish papers today state: 'Germany fights EU limits on car emissions'."
"The papers go on to state that 'German Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged to fight ""with full vigourâ the plans to introduce across-the-board limits on CO2 emissions from cars ...'. My two minutes does not allow me to continue."
"You have a big PR exercise, Minister, if what you say is accurate rather than that which the German President of the Council says."
"Therefore, please sort out the confusion that exists there at the moment, particularly as Chancellor Merkel's address at the start of the German Presidency was excellent and most encouraging in this particular area, and she has guaranteed that this issue will take high priority on the summit agenda in March."
"We need greater political ownership of this debate."
"The real problem is - and I say this through the Chair to our Commissioner as well as to the Minister - that we have left it to our officials and our diplomats."
"Yes, Nairobi was 'a step forward' in preparing the ground."
"That is what you said."
"But it was a baby's step forward, a tortuous step forward: hardly an improvement on what had been agreed in Montreal."
"It makes no sense for thousands of us from hundreds of countries to meet once a year, use up carbon and fly to all sorts of locations to sit and argue mainly about what should be on the agenda, then leave again after up to two weeks, only to come back 12 months later to pick up the argument about the agenda that we had left 12 months earlier!"
"If what we say and all the reports from economists, NGOs, environmentalists and eminent scientists are right - and they are right, 99% of the community agree they right - then we must take the highest political ownership of the resolution of the problem."
"That is at summit level: not only at summit meetings, but also at the COPs and the MOPs and in Nairobi and wherever else we meet."
"We must drive it upstairs to prime-ministerial and head-of-state level throughout the 12 months of the year, and not just the annual meeting at the United Nations Convention on Climate Change or the Kyoto MOP meeting."
"We need political ownership at the highest level."
"Drive the agenda, please."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Gabriel, I do hope we can agree on the proposal to reduce the CO2 emission of cars to 120 mg and, moreover, on a still greater reduction in the second generation of fuels."
"Measures are desperately needed, for very many people have grave concerns about climate change."
"Tomorrow, the United Nations will be announcing that the Earth is warming up at a rate quicker than we had previously imagined."
"Europe must show leadership in solving the problem."
"That is why it is important that we really stand firm with regard to this 30% and that we do not cave in to accept 20% if the rest of the world does not join in."
"The fact that we rely on other countries in that manner is very disappointing, although I can see why: first of all, we have a moral duty towards the rest of the world."
"Since we have caused climate change, we must also resolve it."
"Secondly, according to the Stern report, it is far cheaper to adopt solid climate policy than to pay for subsequent costs for adjusting to global warming."
"Climate policy offers ample opportunity for innovation and employment."
"Mr President, the Presidency has got off to a very good start on this issue."
"I do not doubt the commitment of the Minister in any way at all, and was very pleased to hear the strong words from the Chancellor just the other week."
"But of course the rhetoric has got to be matched by the reality, and Germany has a problem."
"It has the problem of the national allocation plan, first of all."
"I realise there is a problem as regards a difference in interpretation between the Presidency and the Commission, but one way or another it does not help with you in the hot seat not having a national allocation plan approved."
"So Minister, please get it sorted."
"Then of course there is the issue today of the German car industry and the rhetoric in the various papers."
"I have just come from and will return to chairing a hearing on reducing CO2 emissions from motor vehicles."
"The clear message from many of the experts speaking is that 120 grammes per kilometre is perfectly realisable within the five-year timescale that we are talking about at a cost of a thousand euros: that is the estimate that many of those experts are putting on it."
"And that is a thousand euros with a quick return for car-owners because of fuel economy and savings at the petrol pump."
"I ask you, how often in environment debates have we heard industry coming along and saying 'this is impossible, this is the end of our industry if you do this, European Union; this is going to cost an extravagant amount, European Parliament'?"
"And so often we introduce the legislation and somehow the problems are dissipated, industry copes with it and we become more competitive and our position across the world is strengthened."
"I suspect the same thing is happening once again."
"Industry exaggerates, it always does."
"We talk about dealing with this issue of climate change."
"If we are looking at the real price of a car, which has come down so significantly over the past 20 or 30 years, and we are saying that to reduce emissions by 25% would cost an extra thousand euros, still leaving the real price of a car at less than it was thirty years ago, can we not bear that price?"
"How can we look at our children and say that we were not prepared to pay just a little bit more to make such a big difference?"
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, as I see it, one reason why we should extend this debate on cars is that it highlights the gulf between words and actions."
"Mr Gabriel's proposal for combining the admixture of biofuels and the requirement for the efficiency of motor vehicles obscures the issue, for, even if I sell a car that can run on biofuels, I cannot be certain that the customer will use them in it later on, and so it is the very opposite of clear from the system you propose as to how the output is to be measured, and that gives rise to enormous problems."
"Although you talk in terms of a CO2 output of 120 grams per kilometre, what you actually want is the same as the German car manufacturers, namely 130 or 140 grams."
"That would be a fatal move not only for Europe but also for the world generally, for, as the target of between 60 and 100 grams must be achieved by 2020 at the latest, the figure of 120 grams can represent only an intermediate stage."
"I also want to thank you for your clarifications;"
"I hope that Mrs Merkel and Mr Glos take the same view, for it has not been clear from the press over the last few days that they do."
"I may well not be a German, but, for me, Germany has always been one of the great leaders, for the German public give the highest priority to the protection of the environment and to dealing with climate change, and for a German Presidency, having set itself to do great things on the climate change front, to fall over the first time the economy comes under even minimal pressure is an appalling disgrace."
"(EL) Mr President, scientists have been sounding the alarm for years."
"We are talking not about a future danger but about a present threat."
"That is why ambitious statements do not suffice."
"Specific measures are needed with tangible and quantifiable results."
"The example of the car is a typical example."
"As soon as general statements move towards specific measures, the lobbies react."
"My opinion is that the lives of all of us and of our children weigh and count more than the automobile industry."
"We welcome specific measures such as a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, support for renewable sources of energy, clean fuels and new, cleaner technologies."
"The European Parliament is calling on the Commission and the Council to set more ambitions targets and, more importantly, to attain them."
"We need to change a great deal about our living and consumption habits. The European Union must take the vanguard in creating a big global alliance."
"The Kyoto Protocol, which some still refuse to adopt, no longer suffices."
"Mr President, this issue is surrounded by half-truths and misleading statements which cast doubt over the integrity of the issue and raise more questions than answers."
"For instance, why, outside this House at any rate, is there continual reference to carbon emissions?"
"Carbon is a black solid; it is soot or graphite or diamonds."
"They should be talking about carbon dioxide which is, by the way, not a pollutant but a natural constituent of the atmosphere."
"Why did the director of a UK environment agency tell me they could not link global warming to climate change?"
"If global warming is due to CO2 and the greenhouse effect, as opposed to a variation in solar activity, why was the same director unable to tell me if the greenhouse affect rises in proportion to the extra amount of CO2 or rises greatly for the same amount of CO2 - an exponential - or a lessening increase, meaning a tapering-off graph and a static effect at some time."
"Why does the Stern Report show a hockey stick graph for global warming - a steady rise over 2000 years - when in fact it was warmer in the 14th and 15th centuries than it is now?"
"Why does Friends of the Earth say that incineration of waste to generate electricity produces more CO2 than conventional gas-fired generators when effectively much of the waste is bio-fuel and therefore carbon-neutral?"
"They ignore the fact that landfill waste will produce methane, which is 12 times more potent a greenhouse gas than CO2."
"Finally, why does the President of the Commission drive a car which produces 1.6 times more CO2 per kilometre than the average sort of car I drive?"
"(CS) Mr President, a number of experts have claimed that, apart from speculation based on short-term warnings, there is no incontrovertible scientific evidence that greenhouse gases from industrial growth lie at the root of climate change."
"Climate change takes millions of years and the climate will of course go on changing."
"I therefore do not share the view that people can change the history of the planet with their daily routine."
"That view is, to my mind, arrogantly anthropocentric."
"Caring for the planet has little to do with emissions trading, bringing in stricter standards, enacting new legislation or investing massively in cutting emissions from existing sources of energy."
"A far more sensible course of action would be to invest in developing new sources of energy and nuclear energy."
"I strongly believe that today's narrow-minded, anti-nuclear approach to global warming will, under the guise of combating greenhouse gases, lead us down a blind alley where both our incomes and our freedoms will be curtailed."
"Such an approach certainly does not amount to caring for the planet in the interests of our children."
"(FR) Mr President, we have a four-fold challenge in front of us: firstly, there is climate change itself and the public desire to tackle it; secondly, international involvement in the fight against climate change; thirdly, the innovation required for a change in production methods and the use of energy; and lastly, our countries' adaptation to the inevitable effects of climate change."
"It is tempting to ask: what is Europe actually waiting for before properly opening up the debate on nuclear power, by which I mean serious, dispassionate debate?"
"I would call on you to hold this debate without any further delay."
"The option of renewable energy is admittedly a very appealing one, but we have no choice but to look at these things realistically."
"Let us take two examples: wind energy and biofuels."
"The former accounts for 0.05% of the world's energy consumption."
"How fast would we have to develop wind energy in order to achieve 2% annual growth in global consumption of such energy over a period of 30 years?"
"It is impossible even to contemplate."
"Biofuels, on the other hand, are an interesting, media-friendly way of dealing with a problem of agricultural policy, but the possibilities offered by biofuels are limited by available agricultural space."
"Mr Dimas, you will have to convince your fellow Commissioner, Mr Verheugen, not to hinder our ambitions."
"Mr Gabriel, there are some battles in which we will have to support certain industries that, faced with this global threat, are leading rearguard actions."
"I trust that German car makers will be able to come up with the kind of positive responses that are sorely needed."
"What, then, are we to say to third countries?"
"Do we tell China, for example, that it has no right to develop its economy?"
"Not to mention the hypocrisy of Europe patting itself on the back about emissions trading."
"To conclude, those who indulge in alarmism will only end up destabilising public opinion."
"We must raise awareness and inform the public, but making people afraid serves no purpose."
"It is not constructive."
"We should try to propose workable solutions."
"This requires everyone to make an effort, and time is our only priority."
"(FI) Mr President, for many people climate change has only become a reality now that its cost has been estimated."
"According to one estimate, the cost of doing nothing could be as much as 20% of GNP globally."
"If we take action now, however, and halt climate change at two degrees, the cost will be a fraction of that."
"Moreover, investment in the low-emission economy will create a global market for energy-efficient technologies which is forecast to grow to a value of up to EUR 27 billion by 2020."
"For Europe to be part of this technological development, the Union needs to create a viable domestic market for renewable, low-emission forms of energy."
"We have to remember that nuclear energy cannot be the answer to this problem, especially if we want Europe to be a self-sufficient energy economy."
"(SV) Mr President, I shall not repeat what has already been said, but I just want to mention one thing."
"The European Parliament must embark on a direct dialogue with the newly elected American Congress."
"Instead of just following the American debate in the media, it is our responsibility to take action."
"The political balance in Congress has changed, and right now the door may be open for the cooperation that must take place if change is to take place."
"Congress has now even set up a special committee on climate change."
"Strength lies in the EU and the United States acting together."
"Only together can we influence countries such as China and India so that they too might be involved in global emissions trading."
"They must not firstly be allowed to pollute their own environment and ours at will just because they are developing countries, and only once they have achieved high living standards assume responsibility for the global environment."
"I propose that the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety make immediate contact with the corresponding committee in the American Congress."
"A joint meeting between the committees concerned should be organised as early as this spring."
"The objective of this dialogue must be to get the United States and other countries not included in emissions trading to get involved in it."
"As representatives of the peoples of Europe, we must dare to take the bull by the horns."
"That is why we were elected."
"Mr President, there has been a lot of rhetoric here this afternoon, particularly from the Council, but what is missing is a sense of urgency and a commitment to ambitious action."
"It is clear the EU has to do a lot more and to show real leadership."
"However, in my one minute I want to ask you, Commissioner Dimas, to do something very specific."
"There has been a lot of discussion about what is wrong today but not enough about what we need to be doing - some of the answers."
"I want to raise the issue of personal carbon allowances."
"It is a scheme that is growing in interest in many Member States whereby emission rights are allocated to all individuals on an equal per capita basis and then surrendered, for example when they are purchasing fossil fuels or electricity for personal use and, of course, over time those emission rights decline."
"It is complementary to the emissions trading scheme, but in many ways it is more equitable than much greater taxation, it has the advantage of being subject to an overall and declining cap and, crucially, it engages people on a personal level."
"It affects individual choices that they make, because one of the strongest disincentives to individual action is the sense that your neighbour is not doing what you are doing."
"Therefore, I would ask your departments to investigate what they can do to encourage the take-up of such schemes across the European Union."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the more than 40 deaths caused by the Kyrill storm are a sad portent of what is in store for us in the near future."
"Global warming and the associated climate change have not been dreamt up by environmental groups: during the 20th century, the average temperature increased by more than half a degree, and we must look for a cause in the emission of greenhouse gases produced by human activities."
"The European Union is responsible for around 14% of these emissions, the highest per capita quota in the world."
"That is why the fight against climate change, which requires the help of all countries, needs none other than the most advanced countries to lead the way."
"The EU must therefore continue to work in the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol, which has led us to bank on technological innovation."
"In recent years, however, some backwards steps have been taken, particularly in relation to energy, and the recent Commission proposals have not lived up to expectations."
"Even though you yourself, Mr Dimas, asked for emissions to be cut by 30% compared with 1990 levels, a poor compromise was reached to reduce them by 20%, and there is no strategy in the transport sector, on alternative energy sources or on technologies for green hydrogen."
"To say nothing of the ambiguity where nuclear energy is concerned ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(NL) Mr President, industry is bound to notice that drastic measures will be taken."
"Emission rights will need to be reduced annually and the allocation of emission rights free of charge will need to stop."
"Moreover, since more and more sectors will need to fall within the compulsory system of emission trading, it is to be welcomed that the Commission wishes to include the aviation industry in it."
"Both producers and consumers must take up their responsibility where the climate is concerned."
"So, then, must all of us."
"By way of a final remark, we should not attempt to address the climate problem unilaterally, which would mean that measures would lead to other environmental damage."
"The production and incineration of biofuels must be environmentally friendly, and that is where the problem was with palm oil."
"Environmental clangers of this kind must be prevented in future."
"(DE) Commissioner, Mr Gabriel, I too have only a minute in which to get through to your mind."
"The only thing one can say, having heard you, is that the lion has a mighty roar."
"We know that President Bush holds the reins of power, and the way you, Minister, roar is reminiscent of the way one of your predecessors - Klaus TÃ¶pfer - roared in 1992, when we were in much the same situation."
"It almost seems as if an historic window of opportunity opened up for us somewhere between the fall of the Wall and globalisation, but, as nothing happened that serves as an example of what not to do."
"I do, however, want to encourage you to stick with this issue, to sidestep as elegantly as possible the resistance with which you meet on the part of the German motor industry, and to really concentrate on the matter in hand."
"You will, of course, have to be aware that this will not happen without some sacrifices."
"If you succeed in getting the idea across to the rich Member States that doing without is sexy, your political destiny could be that of the successor to the environment minister whom I have named - and for you, and perhaps for the world, that would be no bad thing."
"Mr President, we have two tasks to fulfil: one is to reduce CO2 emissions and the other is to ensure that we can meet the changes that follow climate change."
"They both require that we have the resources for investment, that we have the opportunities for growth and the opportunities to take care of the environment."
"Limits and goals are important in this, but it is just as important to take action that is compatible with economic growth and resources for investments in order to safeguard what we must do."
"Sometimes we can look at the more practical and realistic actions."
"I shall mention only two."
"Long-truck combinations are one of the more substantial ways of reducing CO2 emissions regarding road transport."
"Commissioner, President-in-Office: you can do something about that as a practical action that will have a substantial result."
"The second task concerns energy policy."
"Phasing out nuclear power in the way and at a pace that is being planned in today's Europe is a secure way of getting increased CO2 emissions."
"If we succeed in launching more renewable energy sources, then the phasing-out of nuclear power will reduce the gains and maybe we will get into minus with increased CO2 emissions."
"I should like the German Presidency to take the lead in a new policy."
"You should do that not in order to solve the greenhouse effect, as some say, but in order not to make things worse."
"We must at least keep the same share of energy coming from nuclear power that we have today in order not to increase CO2 emissions."
"We need high-tech, not low-tech; we need more trade, not less trade; we need more investments, not less investments and we need more growth, not less growth."
"The challenge is to combine those things, and I look forward to your reply on my two certain tasks, however politically uncomfortable it might be for you."
"(PT) As Kofi Annan said in Nairobi, climate change is not science fiction."
"It is a global problem requiring a global response from both governments and citizens."
"Governments must, as a matter of urgency, take effective measures, but the citizens, too, must change their routines and their lifestyles, for example, by not using their cars and by walking more, which is healthy and protects the environment."
"Fighting climate change is a priority for the German and Portuguese Presidencies. I hope that, together, they can provide a major boost to this fight and that the EU will take the opportunity, at the next UN conference to be held in Bali during the Portuguese Presidency, to lead negotiations towards a whole new approach to the climate issue."
"Thank you for your excellent address, Mr Gabriel."
"(FR) Mr President, thinking ahead to 2030-2050, will fossil fuels have run out?"
"Will the ITER project have kept its promise on fusion?"
"Given the huge growth of China and India, will energy resources be sufficient?"
"What will the effects of growth be on the climate?"
"We do not necessarily have all the answers to these questions, but what is clear is that we must act within the framework of a European and world strategy, because energy is a fundamental need and the phenomenon of global warming must be stopped."
"I welcome the ambitious objectives consisting of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2020, because the EU must send out a strong message that behaviour and mentalities must be changed so that innovative solutions with global impact might be found."
"I also welcome the measures proposed by the Commission, but they must be accompanied by political action."
"Accordingly, more must be done to force the Member States to take more proactive measures, for example in connection with the use of biofuels and renewable energies, and to take taxation measures to foster energy saving and to promote the energy efficiency of buildings."
"Moreover, without wishing to be alarmist, a European communication campaign should be launched, with the support of the media, in order to present the citizens of Europe with simple things that anyone can do to help protect the climate."
"The future we desire will come about through fundamental technological development, as well as through actions that we can all carry out, starting today."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the day after tomorrow the UN will publish a scientific report that says that the earth is most likely to warm up by three degrees this century."
"If that happens it will mean that Greenland's ice sheet will inevitably melt and sea levels will rise by at least seven metres. It will mean that the map of Europe will be redrawn."
"This has to be prevented."
"We have to take very urgent practical action to stop the earth from warming up any more than two degrees, which is the EU target."
"We need to move from rhetoric to practical deeds, however."
"In this context, it is hugely disappointing to see that today the European Commission has once again put off the issue of mandatory limits for carbon dioxide emissions."
"We need to understand that the most important factor of all is measures to improve energy and fuel efficiency."
"That also applies to transport."
"We cannot get round this by substituting biofuel for improved energy efficiency."
"If we try and do this, it will only mean that the environmentalists will turn against biofuel."
"(Applause)"
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to thank the Commission and the Council for coming here to debate this issue and the strategy to be pursued in the future."
"We all agree with the principle of reducing polluting emissions that underlies the proposals by the Commission and the Member States."
"We agree with the diagnosis, though we have certain differences in terms of the remedies to be applied and each person's responsibilities."
"I am delighted to have heard something here that I believe to be essential. That is that there must be an international agreement on emissions reduction that includes everybody."
"Unless we achieve that, it will be difficult to find a solution if objectives are set unilaterally."
"Amongst other things, because, on its own, the European Union can neither reduce world emissions nor set objectives for maintaining temperatures at global level."
"I truly believe that our main objective must be to reach a global agreement through our efforts, of course, and also with the efforts of our industries."
"Like you, Commissioner, I would personally prefer a more flexible objective, to which everybody is committed, to an objective of a 30% reduction with no idea of who will sign up to it."
"In addition to that, we must take a series of principles into account."
"Firstly, the countries that have historically polluted more must reduce their emissions more, and reasonable emissions limits for the future should be set for the emerging economies."
"Secondly, all sectors will have to face their responsibilities in accordance with their emissions, because it makes no sense to talk about electricity but not to talk about transport."
"Thirdly, we must also bear in mind the benefits for carbon retention of agriculture and forests, which are natural regulators of the environment."
"Finally, I would like to point to the importance of promoting renewable energy sources and clean forms of transport and say that it is urgent that we discuss seriously the issue of nuclear energy once and for all."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner and the Minister for their personal commitment to this crucial issue and remind the House that these are the good guys!"
"There are plenty of people in the Commission and in the Council who are going to be pushing against these in terms of where we are at."
"The proposals that have come forward from the Commission are indeed ambitious."
"However, they are not ambitious enough and they do not follow through the science."
"The science suggests that if we are to follow through what the ministers have already decided - that is not to go above two degrees - then you have to have a 30% cut in carbon emissions."
"If you follow Stern, you have to take the pain now to save later."
"What we want to see is world leadership."
"A 20% cut is not world leadership."
"The ministers have to follow through."
"If they sign up to this, they have to follow through."
"It is disappointing to see that the Member States are not signing up to 20% binding targets on renewables."
"It is disappointing that the Commission has caved in to the German car lobby, but it is good to hear the ministers say that actually we are not going to cave in to the car lobby, as some Commissioners have done - not Mr Dimas."
"Please Minister, sort out your national allocation plan."
"It is crucial."
"It is time for the Council not just to talk the talk, but to walk the walk."
"(Applause)"
"(HU) I agree that climate change may have catastrophic consequences for the world - and with it for Europe."
"If over the next ten years we do not radically turn around our current practice, if we do not change our current way of life, then this may cause enormous economic and ecological damage."
"It is precisely for this reason that it is in the interests of each Member State, and their moral obligation, to commit itself to the climate policy announced by the German Presidency - namely, by 2020 reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, increasing the share of renewables in the total energy mix to 20%, as well as raising the proportion of biofuel in the fuel consumed to 10%."
"As far as actions are concerned, I call upon the Commission to compare the operating programmes of the Member States, which are currently under assessment, with these targets."
"Insofar as the Commission should determine that in a particular Member State there are insufficient EU sources allocated to reaching these targets, it should make use of its powers and refuse to accept in this form the operating programme of the country in question."
"It is unacceptable that a few Member States should support energy efficiency and the joint European efforts made in the area of energy savings with words alone."
"Hungary and Poland want to devote scarcely more than 1% of the Union budget to this area, while Lithuania, for instance, is willing to devote 5.4%."
"It is already clear that this will not enable Hungarians and Poles to fulfil even their current EU commitments."
"If we think and act responsibly, then in the next six months the third industrial revolution may begin."
"The goal of this industrial revolution is to stop climate change, and its result will be the creation of a low-carbon, and then a carbon-free economy."
"(ET) In recent days, a great deal of interesting information has come from Davos about the extent of climate change and its possible catastrophic impact."
"I participated in the same event 12 years ago, and I must admit that climate change was not mentioned on that occasion."
"Talk, however, is not enough."
"The melting of Greenland's ice sheet, the Arctic ice and the Siberian permafrost have noticeably reduced the amount of ice on the Earth, which will lead to a dangerous increase in the sea level around the globe."
"It appears that this has helped us to understand better the dangers that we face."
"It is clear that the Kyoto Treaty itself as a political mechanism is insufficient - we need quicker action."
"This was also mentioned at Davos."
"We must set binding and ambitious objectives in Europe to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases."
"The developing economies of China and India are key countries and must hold an important position in the new political mechanism."
"In order for them to follow us, we must first show that Europe is taking this topic seriously, and will not just limit itself to a 20% reduction."
"(SK) In dealing with such a serious issue as climate change, it is necessary for us at the European Parliament to support better communication and a more standardised procedure for identifying appropriate strategic solutions."
"I believe that the initiative of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety could have involved prior consultations with the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, particularly regarding the energy package of the European Commission."
"The draft resolution of the Committee on the Environment comes up with new binding objectives that are much more ambitious and yet we are not at all sure whether or how we will meet the goals set out in the existing proposals of the European Commission."
"We all know that it is time to act, since the situation in the area of climate change is indeed serious."
"I am not going to list those areas of the energy sector where substantial improvements can be achieved as regards CO2 emissions."
"Expected growth levels will, however, bring forth new ideas concerning the problem of rising demand for energy."
"There can be no doubt that the development of new energy-generating installations should be based on carbon-free technologies."
"Renewable sources, which we have so often advocated, and quite justifiably too, will scarcely be able to meet the ever-growing demand."
"It is therefore difficult to understand why nuclear energy, which generates virtually no CO2 emissions, still finds little support and is mentioned only vaguely in the strategies of the European Commission and the European Union in general, leaving the decisions to the discretion of Member States."
"Mr President, in my one minute of speaking time, I would like to focus on three issues based on my amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety yesterday."
"Transport is one of the main sources of climate change; road transport uses five times more energy than train transport for the same number of passengers."
"The same goes for private cars on the one hand and trams and subways on the other hand."
"That is why public transport should be a priority for us."
"In a market economy, in a capitalist society, most of these fine goals could be reached by using economic and financial tools."
"Energy efficiency can be increased only along with a very balanced green tax system."
"In the longer term, Europe should have a harmonised ecological tax system, because without such a system, our common environmental policy does not have proper tools."
"Our developed Member States have exported their energy and natural-resource-consuming activities to less-developed countries, exporting greenhouse emissions and environmental damage as well."
"We must prevent such practices in the future."
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although a lady Member has just said that political problems such as climate protection must not be talked about for too long if there is no solution to them, the opposite is also the case, in that, in politics, you have to take care that problems are not whipped up into the most important problem full stop and into something that presages the end of the world, without, at the end of the day, any solution being offered that really does amount to a change for the better."
"It is also with a certain amount of concern that I see some recent debates being conducted in a way that loses touch with reality, with people talking about storms being caused by changes in climate, even though anyone who reads intelligent meteorology knows that that is not how it works."
"There are also certain questions that are simply not being asked, or not being answered, for example, why it is that, despite the worldwide increase in the amount of CO2 being generated over the past 120 years, a temperature increase of only 0.3 degrees is being recorded at most locations, and why it was that it was between 1930 and 1960 that there was the greatest increase in storms of the highest category, with a less marked increase over the last four decades?"
"Why is it that we have no explanation for the fact that, even if all the industrialised nations were to reduce their greenhouse gas output by 30%, we would, by 2100, have done no more than delay the warming effect by six years?"
"I am not questioning the need for us to give this problem our urgent attention; I am merely asking whether we are giving it thorough enough consideration and whether we are perhaps sometimes acting precipitately without asking the right questions."
"We are discussing climate change, security of supply and competitiveness, albeit without weighing up the various points, and instead considering them in terms of what the alternatives are."
"Why is no serious thought being given to the possibility of deriving 70% of the CO2-free electricity from nuclear power, for, if the protection of the climate is so important, surely all the alternatives have to be considered fearlessly and without ideological presuppositions, and one of those alternatives, in the future, will be nuclear energy."
"If we are to have this debate at all, it must be conducted on a broad basis, openly, and with the necessary time being set aside for it."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I do not doubt that the topic of climate change will occupy us for a long time to come and there is going to be a long timelag between any action taken and the actual effect of turning climate change round."
"That makes it all the more important that we should get Europe, its policies and the legislation that goes along with them adjusted to this fact and should get something practical done about it, which will of course involve - along with the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol after 2012 - strategies for reducing CO2 emissions in individual sectors, for example, from private motor vehicles, in respect of which we must not only express concerns but also discuss opportunities."
"Reduced emission of CO2 from motor cars and the associated savings in fuel will have a positive effect on security of energy supply when one bears in mind the fact that road traffic accounts for all of 26.5% of the European Union's total energy consumption."
"The special measures already mentioned do not involve reinventing the wheel; other states, Japan among them, have also brought in programmes for reducing the CO2 pumped out by motor cars, which involves vehicles being divided up, in 'top runner' programmes, into nine different weight classes and binding targets for reductions being laid down."
"As the report put before us recently by Mr Stern reminded us, the saying that time is money acquires a new significance in climate policy."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to agree with Mrs Doyle that the problem that we are facing is not environmental."
"It affects all sectors of society and we have to take a systematic and comprehensive approach."
"To Mr Reul I would like to say that I think we have to realise that parallel to climate change, we are also affected by the depletion of fisheries, huge and rapid deforestation, and water scarcity in many parts of the world."
"We have to face the fact that the lifestyles that we have developed in a world with 8 to 9 billion people goes beyond the carrying capacity of the globe, and that is why we have to take a systematic approach that brings us back onto a normal, sustainable path."
"The reason I asked to speak is primarily that I am very disappointed with one aspect of the energy and climate package from the Commission."
"You talk, Commissioner, in that package, about an energy partnership with Africa."
"That is good. But why not the same for China and India?"
"I know there are technology agreements, but there is very little money to back them up."
"In the coming five to ten years, emissions from these countries because of expanding energy systems will totally overwhelm us unless we help them to do the right things now."
"Some people say 'let China pay'."
"But then we disregard the historic responsibility we have for all the emissions in the past and we also disregard the fact that the Chinese need skilled people; they need technology to make it happen; they need to invest in clean technology."
"So my question to you and to the Minister is, why do you not think big?"
"Why do you not establish a partnership with China and India and beef it up with financial resources so that we can really do this together aggressively?"
"Otherwise I think what we are doing here will be rather marginal in the years to come."
"We have to have this dual approach, and I feel the omission of this in your energy package is conspicuous."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, this is a golden opportunity to overcome Europessimism by showing citizens the added value of our sovereign states sharing power to address the global problem of climate change, about which they are all seriously concerned."
"However, decisions must be made transparently and democratically so that we can see who is pressing to have decisions deferred."
"Later decisions will be too late on this issue."
"We must pool our resources, adopt common rules and regulations and the necessary penalties to guarantee implementation."
"Hard political decisions must be made on taxation, renewable energy, fuel efficiency and cleaner technologies that will revolutionise our industries and our consumption."
"Indeed, why not benchmark the national infrastructure programmes which in many cases the European Union is funding?"
"I would also argue that we must beware false prophets, like the nuclear industry, which claim to be the answer to this problem."
"Îember of the Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking everyone who took the floor today for their very positive speeches, which illustrate the extent to which the members of the European Parliament are fully aware of the problem of climate change and this is, of course, also a reflection of public opinion, which has also become very aware of the problem."
"I should like to thank the German Presidency, especially Minister Sigmar Gabriel, for the cooperation we have enjoyed, for the way in which he spoke and for the way in which he defends environmental issues and I trust that the German Presidency will perform well and meet the expectations of European citizens and respond to the views expressed here this evening."
"Climate change is a global challenge and the leading role of the European Union is of decisive importance in addressing it."
"Today's debate has given us the chance to emphasise the importance of the forthcoming decisions due to be taken in the European Union this week and in coming weeks; these decisions are needed so that international negotiations can commence and so that we can push for an agreement at global level."
"We must safeguard the credibility of the European Union in the leading role which it plays at global level in addressing climate change and we must send the strongest possible message to our partners in both the developed and the developing world."
"We must also emphasise the importance of the decisions which need to be taken over the next few years as regards the international regime for climate change - I may come back to this matter later - in order to ensure that even greater efforts are made worldwide after the first period of commitments based on the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012."
"The scientific and economic arguments in favour of taking ambitious, global action to address climate change are obvious and incontrovertible."
"Even greater political effort is needed in order to bring about broader and more fundamental commitments."
"This is precisely the Commission's objective with the package of measures on climate and energy."
"The next few years will be of decisive importance in shaping a global framework with the objective of ensuring that irreversible and possibly catastrophic climate change is avoided."
"The active participation of all of us is needed - and I have seen it here tonight with a great deal of satisfaction - in this dialogue."
"It is crucial that you support the strong commitment by the European Union for decisive action at both European and international level."
"I should like to answer some of the observations that were made tonight."
"Firstly, concerning targets, I must repeat that 15 months ago we were not discussing targets."
"The word 'target' was not mentioned."
"In the European Council Conclusions, the Council mentioned exploring reduction pathways in the range of 15 to 30% with developed countries."
"It did not occur to anyone to have a unilateral commitment for the European Union."
"Somebody mentioned that perhaps there is some confusion."
"I have to make it clear that we have a target, which is 30%, and this is the mandate we are asking the European Council to give to the Commission to negotiate with other developed countries."
"However, irrespective of this agreement and until such an agreement is reached, we have a unilateral commitment to reduce by 20% the emissions in the European Union."
"To underline the magnitude of this commitment, I should like to point out that it is more than twice our total obligation."
"I heard that there is not enough ambition and that we have not exercised leadership by setting this target."
"No other country in the world is so ambitious - not even California."
"Governor Schwarzenegger has received much praise."
"I have been asked why we do not have a similar target to that of Governor Schwarzenegger - a 25% target for 2021, but using 2006 as a basis."
"Therefore, if you do your calculations, his ambition is less than half of our 20% reduction."
"Therefore, let me make it clear that we are ambitious, we have to exercise leadership in the world, we have to practice what we preach and our target is really ambitious."
"Of course, in order to achieve what science tells us, to limit the average increase in temperature on the planet to 2Â°C, we need a 50% reduction by all the countries in the world by 2050."
"That goes for the developed countries and the developing countries - a 60-80% reduction by the developed countries and a 30% reduction by the developing countries by 2020."
"Someone mentioned flexibility: these targets of 20% and 30% are flexible."
"They are not for all the countries in the European Union, but they will be adjusted according to the burden-sharing agreement that we had a few years ago regarding the achievement of our total target."
"It should be a similar system."
"Nairobi was mentioned."
"Of course, Montreal was different from Nairobi."
"In Montreal we had a big achievement in the Montreal Action Plan."
"According to this plan in Nairobi we had certain priorities which were achieved."
"Mrs Doyle was right when she said they were not ambitious, but it was a step - a bigger or smaller step, but still a step - and the European Union achieved all the priorities it had set, especially in terms of trying to help the least-developed countries to get some of the investments with the usual cut-off and flexible mechanisms."
"Mr Wijkman said that we were not ambitious because we do not have a partnership with China or that we have a partnership that we do not finance."
"The truth is that we have a European Union-China partnership and a European Union-India initiative, and both have specific objectives which will be financed by European Union funds and funds from various Member States of the European Union."
"Of course they are very important, because, as you said, after 2020 China, India and the other fast developing countries will emit more than all the OECD countries."
"Therefore it is absolutely necessary to bring them on board so that we can fight climate change together, but according to the common but differentiated principle of the United Nations Convention."
"I said how important it is to have the participation of China and India and the other fast developing countries."
"However, it is more important to have the developed countries."
"Our first objective should be to consider how to bring on board developed countries, like the United States, which emits 25% of the emissions in the world and has not ratified Kyoto."
"Public opinion in the United States is changing and we are encouraged by the signals we are getting there."
"However, more work is necessary."
"In particular, we must strengthen our emissions trading system, because a market-based instrument like this could be the best way to bring the United States on board. Some states in the USA already have an emissions trading system."
"In the north-east there is an emissions trading system regarding power generation."
"California and some other western states will be introducing them, and we will cooperate with them in order to have a similar system in order to link the systems together."
"So the global emissions trading system can be born from the bottom up."
"In order to do that we need a strong emissions trading system in the European Union, otherwise we cannot argue with them."
"That is why we need to have national allocation plans that really create scarcity in the market."
"If I had accepted all the proposed national allocation plans from the Member States, the emissions trading system would have collapsed."
"You, the Members of the European Parliament, with whom we had a lot of discussion about the emissions trading system, should help to persuade those Member States that have reservations about the national allocation plans."
"I am going to do my job and I shall assess the national allocation plans as is necessary in order to fight climate change."
"It is very important to determine what the basic elements are for a future regime."
"We have to set goals, the means by which we are going to achieve these goals and establish who will be participating in achieving these targets."
"I spoke about the participants - both developed and developing countries."
"I must now mention the targets: 2Â°C is the target."
"The means are: firstly, the use of the market - a global emissions trading system is necessary; secondly, we need research, technology, development of technology and deployment of technology, as Minister Gabriel mentioned."
"Therefore we need to make it financially interesting for the economic partners to deploy new technologies."
"We also need to transfer technology to developing countries and in order to do that we need finance, because without finance it will not be possible."
"We have the Kyoto flexible mechanism - the CDMs, the joint implementation - but we also need other funds."
"I am grateful to Minister Gabriel, because when I announced the adoption by the European Union of the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund, he immediately came forward with a significant contribution from Germany."
"Italy followed, and I hope other countries will do so, because this money is necessary in order to transfer technology to developing countries to enable those countries to be energy efficient and to make efforts in order to fight climate change."
"Today I heard much about biofuels and second-generation biofuels."
"I said that today the Commission adopted a very important piece of legislation."
"However, everybody looked at the cars and not at this piece of legislation."
"But it is very important!"
"I would say that we would save more carbon dioxide with this directive than with the other one, without saying that cars are not important - they are very important, especially for the future."
"Having a new car fleet in the European Union is important for fighting climate change."
"Today's adoption by the Commission of the fuel quality directive is encouraging sustainable fuels for transport, biofuels, and especially encouraging second-generation biofuels, which are friendly to the environment."
"On cars, my proposal still stands."
"My proposal is there, as it was 15 days ago."
"I am very happy that today the President said that next week we shall be discussing it in the College."
"We need clean, competitive, affordable cars that will contribute to the fight against climate change."
"We must protect the consumers, the workers, the public in general and, of course, fight climate change, protect our planet and protect our countries."
"Finally, on Davos, it was very interesting because although there were very important issues to be discussed - Iraq, the Middle East and Doha - a poll revealed that a majority of 57% of the participants who were asked said that the number one issue the world faces today is climate change, which means that the politicians who reflect public opinion have now also had responses from business leaders."
"The business leaders have joined politicians and public opinion and showed their determination to fight climate change."
"That is why I ask for your help in adopting the resolution, which would be very helpful for carrying on our proposals."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the February part-session."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity, and it is one where isolated and patchy responses by individual countries would be entirely inadequate."
"The European Union is a level at which action can be highly effective, both in setting stringent common rules for our common market and in terms of leverage to secure action at world level."
"Without the EU, there would have been no Kyoto agreement, but we must now move forward with all the more vigour to secure a successor agreement."
"We must also look at strengthening our emissions trading scheme and seeking to extend it to other parts of the world."
"Indeed, EU action on the environment must become so effective and visible that our citizens begin to equate the letters EU with 'Environmental Union'!"
"(FR) The fact that we are meeting to debate climate change at exactly the same time as international experts are meeting in Paris to discuss climate change and the consequences thereof sends out a strong message."
"Global warming is not a figment of the imagination of a few publicity-seeking scientists and politicians; it is a reality that we must now come to terms with."
"It is up to us as lawmakers to draw up rules aimed at limiting the impact of climate change."
"This is what the Commission's proposal to include aviation in the emissions trading scheme is designed to do, and there are other such cases."
"This legislation is necessary if we are to offset the impact of the dramatic rise in air transport."
"We must, however, pay careful attention to the way in which we decide to implement this mechanism, because this is not about undermining European airlines or holding back air transport, but about reducing the impact of air transport on climate change."
"Furthermore, in order for our efforts to have genuine impact on CO2 emissions, I would like to see the Union also enact laws on other means of transport, not least in the car industry."
"(PT) As we know, the Commission recently proposed a package of measures on energy and a number of targets on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy, thereby affirming their desire to combat climate change and to foster energy security and EU competitiveness."
"The Commission has now come to this Chamber to restate these objectives and targets, highlighting an international agreement on the post-2012 framework and the target of a 30% reduction in emissions in developing countries. Accordingly, the EU must immediately undertake to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% and to implement practical, energy-specific measures."
"However, the possibility remains open - unsurprisingly - of emissions trading, which especially affects the more economically fragile countries that do not have the money to buy emissions rights."
"Whilst there are some welcome proposals in the area of emissions reductions and renewable energy, there is another set of proposals that would be difficult to implement given the stringent requirements placed on the different countries, knowing the opposition, that is, the USA."
"Most importantly, however, all of this must not be taken as an opportunity for more liberalisation and further concentration in the area of energy, and the further domination of the most powerful countries."
"We are speaking as though the debate is over, and the threat of catastrophic global warming is real."
"Yet there are many climatologists who take a different view."
"They believe that current changes are within the normal historic range, and that predictions of future warming are exaggerated and alarmist."
"Nevertheless, whatever our view on climate change, energy security demands that we reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels."
"We can no longer rely on Russia, the Middle East, Nigeria and Venezuela for energy."
"While we must develop renewables, and enhance energy conservation, there is only one non-carbon technology which can provide the continuous, reliable base-load power we need to drive economic growth, and that technology is nuclear."
"It is bitterly ironic that many of the climate alarmists, who call for dramatic reductions in carbon emissions, also oppose nuclear power."
"(IT) As the German Presidency rightly pointed out, we can no longer put off drafting a proper energy and environmental policy if we want to guarantee our citizens and the EU healthy and sustainable development over time."
"I therefore agree with my fellow Members that we should make this subject an absolute priority in our work over the coming months."
"It seems strange, but precisely on the 50th anniversary of the European project, and at a time of political deadlock due to the failure of the Constitution, the difficulties in relation to enlargement and the estrangement that a section of the European population is reporting, we have the opportunity, armed as we are with far more adequate economic, technological and political instruments, to relaunch the process with practical proposals, by reviving and adapting to everyday needs the idea behind the European process: that of combining our efforts and aims to achieve a sufficiently independent and sustainable energy supply."
"Economic development, as well as the health of our citizens and of our environment, will depend on this, just as it did 50 years ago."
"Furthermore, thanks to the role that it now plays at international level, the European Union can also influence the world's political stability and serve as an example for those fledgling economies that are booming economically but are not yet aware of the consequences that that entails."
"New PNR agreement SWIFT (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on"
"the oral question by Pervenche BerÃ¨s, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Jean-Marie Cavada, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to the Council, on the new PNR agreement and SWIFT B6-0001/2007), and"
"the oral question by Pervenche BerÃ¨s, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Jean-Marie Cavada, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to the Council, on the new PNR agreement and SWIFT B6-0002/2007)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, we now turn from such fundamentally demanding issues as energy and climate change to discuss another very important matter that has, in the past, demanded your attention here in the European Parliament, and also that of the European Union as a whole not merely on one occasion but repeatedly, and the issue to which I refer is that of the sharing of airline passengers' personal data."
"As we all know, following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the United States enacted legislation according to which airlines running flights into and out of the United States must permit the US authorities electronic access to the data in their automatic reservation and processing systems, the material known as 'passenger name records', and, should the airlines decline to comply, they are threatened with the withdrawal of their landing rights."
"I would now like to briefly remind the House of the state of play."
"In May 2006, the European Court of Justice had, in response to an appeal by your House, declared null and void the Council decision on the agreement between the European Community and the USA relating to the forwarding of passenger data to the US authorities and, likewise, the Commission's decision on the appropriateness of the data protection measures."
"The ECJ's fundamental justification for its decision was the European Community's lack of power to conclude any such agreement, since it was not within the sphere of the first pillar."
"It had nothing to say about the material question of whether the data was sufficiently protected."
"As you will be aware, negotiations with the USA on a successor agreement proved to be highly problematic, but it was nevertheless eventually possible to conclude them with an interim agreement due to expire on 3 July this year, which is on the basis of the third pillar and of the USA's undertaking given in respect of data protection, which had already been taken as a basis to the earlier agreement between the European Community and the United States."
"At the beginning of January 2007, the Commission made a recommendation to the Council to the effect that it should approve the commencement of negotiations with the USA on a new passenger data agreement that should replace the present interim one."
"The EU's negotiating mandate for the Council Presidency, which the Commission endorses, was today discussed by COREPER, and the prospect is that the Council will adopt a resolution on the subject and lay down negotiating guidelines in February."
"It is likely that the negotiations on a new passenger name record agreement will prove to be extremely difficult, since there is no evidence of any interest on the part of the United States in improving data protection."
"Indeed, it seems far more likely that they will claim that their undertaking in respect of data protection no longer applies."
"The conclusion of an agreement is, however, essential in terms of the standard of data protection that is to be guaranteed and in the interests of the European Union, for, in the absence of an agreement, the airlines would be under great pressure to pass on the passenger data in order not to risk losing their right to land in the USA."
"The German Presidency of the Council will, with the Commission's support, be pressing for a legally watertight arrangement that secures the protection of data, taking the interests of the passengers and of the airlines into account and maintaining a high level of security, and I would like to stress that it is, in this, taking due account of the positions of your House as expressed in the relevant resolutions of September last year on data protection, on the combating of terrorism, and also on the defence of human rights."
"This subject also brings me to speak in response to the oral questions put to me by Mrs BerÃ¨s and Mr Cavada on the subject of SWIFT."
"The Council wishes to thank them for their interest in this dossier, in relation to which it has already had the opportunity to answer questions from your House's Members on various occasions."
"As regards my answers to these questions, I would refer the honourable Members to my statement."
"In December 2006, the Council informed the Members that the questions they had raised demanded careful examination; the Council is still engaged in doing this, and its inquiries have not yet been completed."
"In the remainder of this speech, I shall be endeavouring, on behalf of the Council, to answer the various questions put to me by Members of your House, although all the matters to which I can refer are still subject to the Council's inquiries."
"In a speech in July 2006, the Finnish minister for European affairs, as the then President-in-Office of the Council, announced to the plenary that the Council was not at that time able to confirm press reports of an exchange of information between SWIFT and the American authorities."
"She reminded your House that finding out what had actually happened was a matter for the national authorities, and went on to state that the European Union was then, and would in future be, prepared to act if it turned out that events made legislation at the European level necessary."
"As I have already mentioned, the Council and the Commission are currently still engaged in examining every aspect and every issue of potential relevance to this dossier, while also taking the outcomes from the data protection group into consideration."
"The Presidency is giving thought to how the work on this at Council level might be organised, and will, in so doing, take account of what emerges from the current investigations, but what I can tell you is that no new group has as yet been appointed with this purpose in mind."
"Since investigations are still ongoing, the Council is at present unable to answer the question as to whether these matters will impact Regulation 1781 of 15 November 2006 on the information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds."
"The Council has no knowledge of whether or not the Commission is considering submitting any proposal for the amendment of this Regulation, but I am sure that we will learn that when the Commission makes its statement."
"Under the Treaty, it is the Commission's function to monitor the implementation of Community law in the Member States and to take appropriate action as and when a Member State fails to discharge its obligations under EC law."
"Reference has also been made to the 'automated targeting system', an American system affecting the transport of freight and persons within the United States and from and into them."
"Whether data obtained from SWIFT have been fed into this system is one of the questions currently being examined."
"When it stated that an international framework for combating terrorism was already in place, the data protection group was referring to the working party on fighting money laundering and the funding of terrorism and the recommendations made by it."
"The Council believes that good work is being done within this framework, although it has to be said that this group's recommendations are addressed to banks and financial institutions."
"While I am on this subject, I would like to stress - speaking on the Council's behalf - that SWIFT cannot be regarded as a financial institution for this working party's purposes and that the Financial Action Task Force framework is therefore not directly applicable, except possibly to certain specific aspects."
"That concludes the Presidency's statement on behalf of the Council."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, I shall begin by addressing PNR."
"As you all know, the temporary agreement concluded in October with the United States will expire by the end of July this year, in a few months' time."
"There is therefore the need to negotiate a very solid and stable legal framework which will enable the exchange of PNR data with the United States with full respect of data protection and privacy rights."
"As the Presidency of the Council just said, the Commission has recommended to the Council that it authorise the Presidency, assisted by the Commission, to open negotiations on the basis of a set of negotiation directives."
"I am confident that these recommendations will be examined very soon."
"I personally strongly hope that by mid-February we will get a negotiating mandate to open this very difficult exercise."
"The Commission is recommending to the Council to strive for full respect of fundamental rights, notably the right to privacy."
"I have said on a number of occasions that the right to privacy is for me non-negotiable."
"It has to be respected, fully and completely."
"Legal certainty is also an important element for air-carriers."
"It must be taken into account, as it has been from the very beginning."
"As I have already stressed in this Parliament several times, the Commission is committed to continuing to give due consideration to privacy on the one hand and legal security on the other, as they form key principles of this file, without forgetting the importance of preventing and fighting terrorism and related transnational crimes."
"The negotiations for a new agreement with the United States on PNR data are a key priority for the Commission, and for me personally, and I understand from what the Presidency of the Council just said that it shares this view."
"I warmly welcome the close cooperation between the Commission and the Council Presidency, which is crucial if we want to succeed, if we want to speak with one voice."
"On my side, of course, as usual, I will keep Parliament informed as this work progresses."
"You know very well that, as it was in the past, for me it will be a political commitment, though this document - for example, the negotiating recommendations - once approved will be classified as EU-restricted."
"The negotiations will present a real challenge for Europe."
"It will require imagination; it will require a lot of common effort from all the EU institutions and from the United States as well in order to reach a very robust, solid solution."
"To conclude, I would like to see, for example, this Parliament, together with the United States Congress - following the political phases of this very difficult exercise - making, perhaps for the first time, a joint political commitment which would be particularly useful for the ongoing negotiations."
"However, it is up to you to decide."
"(IT) I shall now refer, ladies and gentlemen, to the SWIFT matter, which has also been addressed by the Presidency."
"You will recall that a few weeks ago, before the Christmas holidays, I informed the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that the SWIFT case needed to be addressed from a European perspective, and I said on that occasion that we would begin an exploratory dialogue with the US authorities in order to address both the general issue of data protection and the specific issues raised by the use of SWIFT data by the US Treasury."
"You will probably be aware that these informal, yet important, discussions have already begun."
"I am in favour of finding a European solution to addressing this issue, a European solution that ought, in my opinion, to include clear rules and precise guarantees, which the US Treasury should endorse and include in its documents."
"In other words, the two points at stake are, as ever, legal protection for personal data that are transferred and legal certainty for all parties concerned and, I must say, legal certainty for banks, too, for, as the Presidency has clearly highlighted, SWIFT is not a bank."
"It is quite clear, then, that when I talk about guarantees from the US authorities, I intend to specify in which circumstances, for what purpose and by whom these data may be known and used."
"I would say right away that it must be made clear that the purpose is restricted solely to terrorism investigations and thus to preventing the funding of terrorism, so that we avoid the, albeit indirect, risk of such data being misused, for example for economic espionage purposes."
"It is also clear that there seems to be a need for a further restriction, and that is to link the use of these data to research on specific individuals who are suspected of terrorist activity."
"In other words, there should be no non-specific transfers of data without suspects who warrant further investigation having first been identified."
"You are aware of the letter that I wrote to all of the Member States in November asking for information about the conditions under which their banks use personal data through SWIFT."
"Only seven Member States have so far replied to my request for clarification."
"This is unfortunate, and I will obviously be asking for a reason in certain cases: in the specific case of Italy, for example, it has requested more time to respond."
"In other cases, there has simply been no response."
"From the seven responses that I have actually received - although no general conclusions can be drawn from them because too few Member States have responded - it emerges that banks normally use personal data for the sole purpose of executing payment orders and that they were not informed, in such cases, of the fact that personal data are transferred to the US Treasury by SWIFT."
"Therefore, the general response given is simply that they are not aware of the fact that someone, namely SWIFT, transfers data after having received it from them."
"However, it has emerged - but you already knew this - that, in many cases, central banks had been informed precisely by the US Treasury of the transfer of data from SWIFT Europe to SWIFT United States and from SWIFT United States to the US Treasury."
"You are aware that actions and further investigations are being carried out by the national data protection authorities with the aim of shedding some light on the issue and of finding out whether, apart from the Belgian case, which is now well known, there are other specific cases in which national data protection authorities can open a file and thus start proceedings."
"Clearly, as soon as I have some information in this regard, I will pass it on to you, as I have done in the past."
"There is a specific question concerning the possibility of applying the Automated Targeting System to SWIFT data."
"On the basis of the technical explanations given to me, it would appear impossible or highly unlikely for the system in question to have been used for processing SWIFT data, for the simple reason that it is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which relates to the protection of borders and thus to the movement of people passing through the US."
"It was not surprising that the European Parliament asked about the application of this mechanism to PNR data."
"SWIFT data are in a totally different category because they come under a different administration, which is the Treasury."
"The question submitted also asks whether the Commission is aware of other examples of US authorities requesting data from private parties in this sector."
"I have no information on that, and so I cannot answer that question."
"There is no doubt, however, that, while the fight against the funding of terrorism is a vital instrument for preventing terrorism, this fight cannot undermine or limit a fundamental right, such as that of customers to have their personal financial data protected."
"As you know, one of the violations uncovered by the Belgian authorities and the European Committee for privacy protection is precisely the lack of prior information for customers, which coincides with what the banks said, since they had not been informed of these transfers either."
"To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that there are two reasons why we need to work towards a European instrument."
"Firstly, we cannot limit or destroy our Euro-Atlantic collaboration in relation to the fight against terrorism: that would be a serious mistake, which I believe the European Union should avoid making."
"Secondly, we must also point out to our American friends that it is in everyone's interests for fundamental rights and the protection of personal data to be scrupulously adhered to."
"If, by virtue of having a European instrument, we succeed in doing the same thing that we are trying to do with the PNR - even though the two issues are very different, the principle is the same - and find a European solution that prevents differences in treatment between one EU Member State and another in relation to the United States, I believe that it will be possible to strengthen the European Union's negotiating power and to demonstrate at the same time that our aim is to strengthen the Euro-Atlantic link, not to weaken it."
"author. - (FR) Enriched by the lessons of the case of passenger name records (PNR), we should be able to make quicker progress when it comes to SWIFT."
"I should like, if I may, Mr Gloser, to correct you on one point."
"I believe that this is the first time we have held a specific debate on SWIFT here in the Chamber, and this is no doubt in the normal course of things, but I do hope this debate will enable us to make progress."
"SWIFT is not an undertaking that operates solely in Europe or solely between Europe and the United States."
"It operates everywhere."
"To put it simply, after September 11 the nature of relations between SWIFT and the US authorities changed beyond all recognition, and we are now seeing the consequences not only in terms of data protection for the EU but also in terms of the balance that should be struck between data protection, the fight against terrorism, the security of payment systems and protection against economic espionage."
"The Commission has acknowledged that there is a problem and has begun to put forward proposals."
"In a recent letter addressed to Mr Cavada and me, the Central Bank also recognised that the time had come to enter new phases, without going too far in the proposals."
"This confirmed what it had said to us at the hearing, which, unfortunately, neither the Council nor the Commission saw fit to attend."
"The Central Bank had told us at the hearing that it bore very little responsibility for what had happened in the case, and the letter partly confirms that view."
"Reading the memorandum concluded between SWIFT and the US Treasury in April 2004, it is very clear that there was awareness of the data protection issues involved in the manner in which SWIFT transferred information to the US Treasury."
"Just as a train driver bears some responsibility for his train and the post office bears some responsibility for what it carries, SWIFT must bear some responsibility for the data it passes on."
"The key point here, following the hearing held jointly by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs last October, is the briefing of the 'Article 29' working group which, on 22 November 2006, clearly confirmed our concerns, namely that, in the SWIFT case, data that should manifestly not have been concealed from the US authorities had in fact been concealed and that, accordingly, the 1995 Directive had not been complied with."
"We should like to thank the Commissioner for taking the initiative of calling on the Member States to rectify, without delay, the issue of non-compliance with the 1995 Directive, but, as he himself also said, the results up to now have been quite poor."
"The European Central Bank, for its part, has heeded the lesson that it should demand customer consent."
"That remains a very prudent thing do."
"As regards this last question, there are two points we must raise."
"The first is the nature of transatlantic relations and the manner in which data are used in something of a spirit of free, unbridled competition on the US side, and, on the European side - we have experience of this in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - sometimes with a degree of naivety."
"One would like to think that these data are used solely for the purposes of combating terrorism. We dare to hope so, but we have no proof."
"Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if there is a message that, I believe, Parliament would like to convey to you when you hold talks with the Americans on the issue, it is that the purpose of the talks must not be to validate the current state of affairs as regards the transfer of data via SWIFT."
"It should be to ensure that the level of data protection and the concept of data protection itself that we have here in the EU are respected and accepted."
"Everything leads me to think that the task facing us in this area is a tough one, but you can count on Parliament's unwavering support."
"Just one more minute, Mr President, to address the last aspect, which is the issue of the status of SWIFT."
"As SWIFT is a Belgian company, we are always being referred back to the Belgian State."
"That being said, the fact that SWIFT is a Belgian company is because we are in a legal vacuum."
"It is clear that SWIFT is doing a job that should really be done by a European-level body, overseen by a European supervisory body."
"I believe that in this area too, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you need to proceed on the basis of new information."
"Parliament is once again ready to discuss this matter, but we cannot accept the current state of the debate."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, there is an expression in French to describe the surreal confusion of an institution when it finds itself faced with an unexpected situation."
"We say that it behaves 'comme une poule qui a trouvÃ© un rÃ©volver [like a chicken that has found a revolver]'."
"Frankly, Mr Gloser, without wishing to underestimate you, the least we can say is that your position on this matter is extremely disappointing."
"I therefore feel entitled to remind you that your mandate is to defend European sovereignty, something of which I have seen little sign so far."
"As you will have appreciated, we are therefore disappointed and above all worried."
"I will talk firstly about PNR data."
"In a few month's time, as we know, as you have said and as Mr Frattini has pointed out, the interim agreement on air passenger data will expire."
"We have no clear information on how it is working."
"I would also like to point out that when the previous agreement was annulled by the Court, it was based on an assessment of the adequacy of data protection in the United States."
"This is not the case with the agreement in force, however, even though this assessment is required by the protocol to Convention 108 of the Council of Europe, which is binding on the Member States and hence directly, or at least indirectly, on the European institutions."
"Having a dubious basis, the agreement has not so far been properly implemented, since the data transmission system that should have been in operation since 2004, the 'push' system, is not yet operational, and that is despite the announcements made, most notably last September."
"In a spirit of cooperation, I would like to ask certain questions publicly."
"Firstly, I wonder whether the Commission should have applied more pressure in order to ensure that the 'push' system was implemented by the airlines and electronic reservation centres that it monitors."
"Secondly, I wonder whether effective information for air passengers should have been demanded with regard to the use of their personal data for security purposes, in the same way that information campaigns have been carried out on rights in the event of delays or flight cancellations, for example."
"For our part, with regard to this dossier, we are awaiting clarification from the Commission and, above all, from the US authorities on a number of points."
"I shall mention two of these."
"First of all, we do not understand why, in order to fight terrorism and organised crime, it should be necessary to have all thirty-four pieces of data listed in the PNR and not just the nineteen pieces of data that Parliament and the data protection authorities had deemed sufficient for that purpose."
"Secondly, how can it be that European citizens and passengers could have been classified as dangerous for years, unbeknownst to them, without us demanding anything in return?"
"I shall now turn to the SWIFT system."
"This second issue is even more delicate and it concerns the American authorities' access to data relating to financial transfers."
"My fellow Members have already dealt with a number of points."
"I shall therefore just express the views of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"At stake here is the protection of our citizens' fundamental rights and the credibility of our partnership with the United States."
"It is really incomprehensible that no reciprocal arrangements have been proposed in order to negotiate with a partner, even if it is a friend."
"Will we one day act in the same way with another partner to the east of our borders, Russia?"
"I would therefore like to say that European sovereignty is not being respected."
"In agreement with the political groups, therefore, I have taken the initiative to invite the competent committees of the American Congress and I am awaiting a response."
"(The President asked the speaker to conclude)"
"I understand perfectly well that Parliament's timing is extremely important, and since I am confident that my colleagues will say everything else that needs to be said, I will stop there."
"I have said the most important things I wanted to say."
"I honestly thought that I had five minutes."
"I am of course very sorry, Mr Cavada, but unfortunately, when we organise our parliamentary business, it is essential to abide by speaking times in general so that we can proceed, especially in the case of 'mini-sessions', when times are accordingly short."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is working towards consistent compliance with the acquis communitaire and all the documents that uphold the values of European civilisation and protect the freedom and personal integrity of each individual."
"We are opposed to any unlawful conduct which restricts such freedoms and works against the individual."
"We recognise, however, that protecting peace and security also imposes certain constraints."
"For this reason we believe that any intrusion into personal privacy should be kept to a minimum and be conducted on a legal basis."
"On the basis of the documents that are available to us, there is a well-founded suspicion that access to the data held in the SWIFT System could represent an illegal intrusion into personal privacy."
"So, please allow me to put to you the following questions:"
"First, I would like a detailed answer as to which data held in the SWIFT System are available to the US authorities and which data are they entitled to access on that basis?"
"Second, do the US authorities have access to all the transactions carried out in SWIFT branches in the USA, and can they, through these or other SWIFT branches, also gain access to transactions carried out outside the USA?"
"Third, I would like to ask the Commission, the Council and the European Personal Data Ombudsman whether accessing the data held in the SWIFT System represents a violation of the provisions on data protection and, consequently, an illegal intrusion into personal privacy."
"Fourth, at the October hearing we did not get any convincing or sufficiently clear answers on the competence of institutions with respect to SWIFT."
"So I would like to ask who is actually competent to rule on the SWIFT issue and on what legal basis?"
"And fifth, I am interested in the principles underpinning our negotiating platform with the USA on these issues and whether, within that framework, we will also learn how the US authorities make use of the data obtained and what dangers are involved in data leaks and abuses."
"Mr Coelho will address the PNR issue."
"Thank you."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, the controversy surrounding the transmission of personal and banking data by SWIFT to the US law enforcement authorities and the judgment on the EU/US agreement regarding PNR data have demonstrated the urgent need to draw up a global framework for the transmission and protection of personal data within the context of trans-Atlantic relations."
"Europe understands the United States' increased need for security and we want to enhance our cooperation with our American partners with a view to fighting terrorism effectively."
"Having said that, it is also essential to deal with the protection of fundamental rights and privacy within the framework of trans-Atlantic dialogue."
"We are in favour of reaching a new PNR agreement, but it must be respectful of fundamental rights and provide guarantees on the protection of European citizens' privacy."
"That is why we want the Commission to communicate to us the details of the proposed mandate for the negotiation of this new agreement."
"The European Parliament must be fully involved in this process."
"Could you also provide us with more information on the work of the high-level working group on the sharing and protection of data?"
"We would also like to know about the priority proposals recently put forward by our American partners."
"With regard to SWIFT, the Belgian data protection authorities and the 'Article 29' Working Group believe that this transmission represents a violation of the Belgian and European rules on the protection of personal data."
"So far, no concrete solution has been proposed to put an end to this violation."
"All of the actors involved agree that it is urgent that a European solution be found, a solution that is respectful of fundamental rights and which companies can implement properly."
"The European institutions must ensure that the payment system in the European Union, provided by SWIFT, complies with the Community legislation on data protection."
"We would therefore ask the Council and the Commission what measures have been taken to resolve this problem."
"Are there plans to negotiate an international agreement, similar to the PNR agreement?"
"You tell us that the Commission has held a dialogue with the American Treasury department with a view to finding a solution."
"Can you tell us what solutions have been studied?"
"Furthermore, at our last debate on the same subject, you informed us, Mr Frattini, that a questionnaire would be sent to the Member States in order obtain all possible information on this transfer of information."
"Have you really received all of the necessary replies and how are you going to follow up on that questionnaire?"
"Furthermore, in 2006, within the codecision procedure, Parliament adopted its Alvaro report on the regulation stipulating the personal data that must accompany transfers of funds and under what conditions."
"The transfer to a third country of banking data that does not have a specific link with that country clearly falls outside of the scope of the regulation and may represent a breach of the fundamental principles of data protection."
"For the same reason, given that the transfer of the SWIFT data does not just involve data relating to transactions between Europe and the United States, but also data relating to transactions within the European Union, it would appear to be clear that this issue belongs in the first pillar."
"An agreement pursuant to Articles 24 and 38 of the European Union Treaty would not be an appropriate solution."
"We cannot accept an agreement to legalise current violations on a case by case basis."
"SWIFT has no legal obligation to use a mirror site in the United States."
"Would it not be possible to find a solution in another country in order to move that mirror site to one that contains European data, as the 'Article 29' Working Group suggested?"
"Finally, SWIFT, PNR, and also the Automated Targeting System, ATS, and perhaps in the future telephone data, demonstrate that the exchange of information is intensifying and the urgent need to draw up a common framework for protecting the privacy of European citizens."
"Do you not believe that the European Union should take a global approach to these issues, in order to establish general principles for the transmission and protection of data with our American partners."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I am always very touched when I hear how attached the Council and the Commission are to involving Parliament, because it is indeed true that in the area of counter-terrorism policies, the decision-making is profoundly undemocratic because it totally excludes the European Parliament, and national parliaments are only very partially involved."
"Therefore I would have a solution to offer you, and that is not just to make solemn pledges here before the House, but to actually consult Parliament on a voluntary basis on the mandate for negotiations on PNR and SWIFT, because that would not only lend democratic legitimacy to such a mandate: it would also actually strengthen your negotiating position, because frankly, although I have a high appreciation for the officials who do the actual negotiations, I think matters of such importance should have a political mandate."
"Secondly, I fully agree with the remarks made by Mrs Roure on the need for global standards on data protection."
"People who think that we are anti-American are wrong."
"I have actually seen how attached the Americans are to their privacy laws, which are very good, and how critical they are when the public authorities do not respect the rules on privacy."
"So I think we should take their critical attitude as an example."
"I would like to know if Commission and Council are aware of other categories of data being accessed by the US authorities, not only passenger data and SWIFT data, but also, for example, telecommunications records and insurance company or social security records, and if not by the US authorities, by other countries."
"If you are not aware of this, maybe you should start investigating."
"With regard to PNR, SWIFT and ATS, I will not repeat here all the expectations that we have of the PNR negotiating mandate."
"That has been said already."
"But I would like to know why the Commission and the Council did not bother to insist on a second joint evaluation of the implementation of the PNR agreement before agreeing on a new negotiating mandate."
"Would it not make sense to first evaluate how this one works and how effective it has been before we start talking about the next one?"
"I would also like to know what the state of play is with regard to the switch from push to pull, which was scheduled for December 2005, then for December 2006."
"It is now January 2007."
"Where are we on this point?"
"I would also like to know what the state of play is with regard to information to passengers."
"I have been travelling myself lately and I could not get any information on the matter."
"I would also like to know on what basis the European Commission will actually be negotiating an agreement on SWIFT."
"Finally, with regard to ATS, you get a letter from the Department of Homeland Security saying, 'Do not worry, we comply with the PNR agreement as we understand it'."
"I am not a lawyer, but I think that is rather a funny formulation."
"It does not reassure me and I would like further reassurances about profiling and data-mining."
"Does it take place?"
"I should like to know about the discrepancy with regard to storage periods and about purpose limitation."
"What other data are being fed into this and what are the exceptions as regards the privacy act?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this extensive legal-political debate involves the fundamental issue of European sovereignty, as the chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has also rightly pointed out."
"Consequently, there is a factor that has not yet been referred to that should not be left out, which is the statements made by the highest US authorities; I do not think they have been challenged, but they are worth mentioning."
"The SWIFT system, which we are analysing in relation to European law, has certainly had the merit of cutting short some atrocious terrorist initiatives; it has made it possible to uncover or has helped to identify the perpetrators of the London bombings in July 2005; and it has at least led to the capture of key players, such as the terrorist Hambali, who seems to have been the brains behind the Bali bombing in October 2002."
"It should certainly also be said that the publicity surrounding this procedure has, in all likelihood, led many terrorists to give up using such methods."
"On the other hand, it is undeniable that, when the SWIFT society was faced with a contract involving both European law and US law, it confined itself to negotiating data protection mechanisms with the US Treasury Department without obtaining further safeguards."
"This is a problem that must be addressed, as is the problem of the European Central Bank's role and responsibility."
"The ECB had been informed about the issue right from the start, and it played a leading role in this instrument - I shall not go into the matter of its transparency."
"Before the Committee on Civil Liberties, the ECB, through its president, Mr Trichet, sheltered behind the confidentiality agreement among the ten banks and also claimed that it had not been able to give SWIFT its blessing because that was not within its power."
"What, then, we wonder, are the powers of the ECB if it does not have power in a situation like this one?"
"This is a very important point, and I think we will have to thoroughly re-examine the ECB and its transparency."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs in 't Veld may be unwell physically, she is still in excellent form verbally."
"That being so, I should like to carry on where she left off."
"I still feel that we are very much running behind the facts."
"When it became evident that the United States collected credit card data, as well as other personal data from our passengers, it was a scandal, and we as MEPs wanted a regulation in place, and in most cases, the governments did not want anything, except that if rules were broken, they wanted this to be done quietly; eventually they were forced into a form of action."
"With SWIFT, we saw a repeat of past events: the government mounted a low-level investigation, which will hopefully culminate in some sort of action, and the question is indeed: are we now entirely convinced that this is it?"
"The Commission is quite clear-cut when it says that although it is not in any event aware of any developments, it does not rule them out either."
"I should like a response from the Council to this."
"Do you consider it conceivable and what will you do now to know for certain?"
"We are always saying that we are partners with the United States, which is true, for that is what we are, and we have a great deal of work to do."
"This also means, though, that you are entitled to know what your friends are getting up to."
"I would therefore like to find out from the Council how it intends to address the issue in order to know exactly what data are being collected of our citizens in all kinds of areas."
"According to the Council, it is hard to conclude a fresh agreement, because the United States is not so keen on this data protection."
"There is, however, a limit to the level of blackmail we are willing to accept."
"You cannot say that we have to reach agreement, at any cost, if at a given moment in time, the price we need to pay is too high."
"It could, in fact, be quite funny, once we have sunk as low as we can, to draw the line at some point. This may imperil the landing rights, but will, at the same time mobilise quite a bit of opposition, including in the United States, because it is true that although the US administration would very much like to force this through, there is much support for our position among the parliamentarians."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Gloser, Mr Frattini, I have to say how astonished I am that, in your remarks about the PNR negotiations, you made no mention of the Automatic Targeting System (ATS)."
"I, for my part, wonder how it can have come about that a system like ATS, which was originally designed and implemented for freight, could, for years, have been used, in conjunction with PNR data, for passengers, and this without anyone knowing."
"While we have been negotiating agreements with the United States in order to guarantee the protection of our citizens' fundamental rights, a system such as this has, at the same time, been operating behind the scenes."
"The USA now assures us that ATS is compatible with the present, as well the previous, PNR agreements."
"That being said, I want to state very clearly that assurances of this kind are not enough for me."
"For me, it is not obvious how 40 years' data storage using the ATS system is compatible with the PNR Agreement."
"There is also the fact that ATS can apparently be used for any old purpose."
"How, then, can this be compatible with the obligations under the PNR Agreement, whereby PNR data is only allowed to be used for the purpose of combating terrorism and other serious crimes?"
"We have not so far received any convincing answers to any of these questions, any more than we have to the question of why the ATS system was kept secret at all."
"How, during the negotiations for the PNR Agreement, could the United States conceal such essential information from its partner?"
"One would probably be justified in asking how it might be guaranteed that there are no further ATS-style systems that we simply know nothing about."
"With regard to the new PNR Agreement, I should expressly like to support what my fellow Member, Mr Cavada, said, namely that the number of transferable items of information about airline passengers needs to be significantly reduced."
"It must be guaranteed that the US customs and border protection authorities are not just passing on data willy-nilly to any old authority involved in the fight against terrorism."
"What is more, we must, as the European Union, insist that European citizens be given the same opportunities for safeguarding their rights as are American citizens."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to take a stand against the black and white terms in which this debate is all too often held."
"It also appears, some of the time, that the United States is an enemy instead of an ally in the fight against terrorism."
"One may well deny it, but just about every measure that has been taken has come under fire from this House."
"It is, of course, the case that the SWIFT case evokes a number of justified questions, which Members from various groups have already asked."
"Where, for example, do you draw the line between tracking down terrorists and respecting fundamental rights?"
"It is a question, in fact, that has also been put to the American Congress."
"In the final analysis, the fight against terror is largely related to risk analysis, the calculation of probability, in other words."
"The processing of commercial data on top of personal data pure and simple can make a useful contribution in this respect."
"What we must do, though, is to put guarantees in place to prevent misuse."
"For example, among other things, this House must monitor the functioning of the system, as well as the algorithms that are used which, moreover, have to be highly confidential; sanctions must be put in place in the case of misuse; the information obtained may be used only for the purpose of combating terrorism, and there must be a call centre where complaints from the public can be handled."
"It goes without saying that this requires a great deal of consultation with the United States."
"A clear legal framework is needed, and, in creating one, all partners must be open to fresh ideas and new techniques."
"(PT) I should like to begin by saying that I see the United States of America not as an enemy but as a friend and partner in shared fights."
"Of course, in our shared fights we must pay particular attention to combating terrorism, but it is also important to mention that, in some of these fights, the US Administration has at times gone too far, both at internal and international levels, and I am chairing a European parliamentary committee to look into some of these excesses on the international stage."
"It should also be noted that the US Congress has undergone a shift of balance, which has led the US Administration to pull back from implementing some of its more controversial plans at internal level, and I hope that this will have an effect at external level, too."
"This, to my mind, means that the USA is clawing back its good record of placing the emphasis on civil liberties, which is a good thing."
"Mr Frattini has reminded us that the demands of security must not undermine the values of essential freedoms and in particular data protection, and Mr Cavada rightly pointed out that the amount of data requested is excessive."
"Does Parliament want to know what data is involved?"
"Who can have access to it?"
"How can we ensure that objectives are limited and that data are not used for other purposes?"
"With whom can they be shared?"
"For what length of time can they be kept?"
"Then there is the issue of the push system, as mentioned by previous speakers, and the question of people's rights to appeal in the event of the misuse of their personal data."
"Previous speakers have said that, if we in Europe offer US citizens the same level of personal data protection that we offer European citizens under the principle of reciprocity, we are legitimately entitled to claim the same, namely that European citizens in the USA should enjoy the same level of data protection as that offered to US citizens."
"(EL) Mr President, the debate on the PNR agreement - SWIFT and secret CIA abductions and flights unfortunately highlights a philosophical divide between America and Europe."
"The US Government considers that the fight against terrorism warrants any means."
"Europe does not."
"However, the recent elections in the USA now give the European Union the chance to negotiate a new PNR agreement from a different position of strength, with many more allies among the people of America and Congress itself."
"Let us hope it will do so."
"In order to achieve the objective of an agreement which protects fundamental rights, it must, inter alia:"
"Firstly, insist that the USA makes an explicit undertaking to provide full and effective personal data protection, as opposed to the current, unacceptable practice of a non-binding and unsatisfactory protocol."
"Secondly, restrict the number of data items currently transmitted to the USA, many of which have little to do with the legitimate objective of identifying terrorist suspects."
"Thirdly, ban the use of data for purposes unrelated to the fight against terrorism."
"Fourthly, expressly stipulate and limit the US departments which will be entitled to access data."
"Fifthly, ban at long last the right of direct access in the USA to airline company files."
"We must bring this saga to an end."
"Sixthly and finally, make provision for the European Commission and the European Parliament to have the facility for constant, direct and effective control of the strict application of the USA's obligations and to stop immediately any investigation that infringes the intended purpose."
"We have even been told by a private company, by SWIFT, that they demanded and achieved this in its negotiations with the USA."
"There is no excuse for twenty-seven European prime ministers to be unable to negotiate and achieve this."
"If they do not, it will be a question not of 'I could not' but of 'I would not' and we shall all rightly judge them at that point."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, data protection has high status in the EU."
"It was therefore a shock for us to learn from the media - and from the American media at that - that, despite the data protection requirements documented in all the EU Member States, SWIFT was prepared to give in to pressure from the United States and to forward data concerning European citizens to Washington."
"This happened without the knowledge, never mind the agreement, of the European Parliament, the national parliaments or the individuals concerned."
"To date, we have not been able to examine the memorandum of understanding between SWIFT and the United States that forms the basis for transferring the data."
"We can only hope that the data has in actual fact been used only for the purposes of combating terrorism and not, for example, for economic espionage."
"We do not to date have any confirmation of this."
"We all support, and appreciate the need for, determination in fighting terrorism."
"However, individuals' fundamental rights must be safeguarded."
"Emphatically, the fight against terrorism must not be conducted to the detriment of basic civil rights and the right to data protection."
"That is a particular concern of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe too, and that is why we requested a hearing on this issue."
"It did not surprise us that the Americans, who were also invited, stayed away from the hearing without saying why."
"We welcome the prompt and thorough investigation by the Belgians, who have come to the clear view that a violation of rights or, as Commissioner Frattini put it, a criminal offence has taken place."
"Incidentally, the people responsible at SWIFT either knew, or at least suspected and feared, this from the beginning, and they have indirectly informed us that they did so."
"The failure of corporate governance at SWIFT is still incomprehensible to me."
"The supervisory bodies were informed, but did nothing to enlighten people as to what was happening or to tell the governments about it."
"With the best will in the world, that is no way to treat politically mature citizens."
"People's confidence in the EU as a legal community has been badly damaged. The SWIFT case is leading to an increase in Euroscepticism in the population, and it will be difficult to win back the confidence that has been lost."
"I would ask the Council and the Commission to conclude the careful inquiry, of which Mr Gloser has spoken, as quickly as possible and to present practical proposals as to how the rights of European citizens might be enforced in respect of the United States too."
"You should show people that you are not kow-towing to the United States but take the European Union seriously as a community of values and courageously defend it in relation to major partners too, and precisely because they are friends rather than enemies."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Parliament was quite right to become fully involved in monitoring the routine transfer of European Union citizens' personal data to the United States."
"Control by the European Parliament is acceptable."
"Refusal to transfer data is not."
"It seems that data transfer can be justified on the grounds of the terrorist threat, posed mainly by Islamic extremists."
"Nonetheless, such a threat cannot be perceived and exploited as a good pretext for the uncontrolled and unrestrained restriction of citizens' rights."
"We must not become extremists ourselves."
"We must not retreat from the front line of the war against terror under the banner of citizens' rights."
"On the other hand, we need to control those who would like to control us in the interests of that war."
"I refer to the monitoring our flights, financial affairs and privacy."
"If the justifiable war against global terrorism is not to transform into a dictatorship and a war against citizens' freedoms, it must itself be subject to strict scrutiny by the European Parliament."
"(DE) Mr President, we need a thorough assessment in the run-up to an agreement."
"Central to this will be the issue of the effectiveness not only of the present agreement, but also of the previous one."
"This question must be answered before we can make further progress in this matter."
"Any future agreement must be based on the push system."
"The pull system is no longer acceptable, since, as is well known, the push system ought already to have been introduced in the previous agreement."
"The transfer of passenger data needs to be strictly limited in terms of the purposes for which such data is used. Otherwise, we cannot contemplate such a regulation."
"The future agreement must also be given full democratic legitimacy, a process that should involve the European Parliament and, if appropriate, the national parliaments."
"We also need an annual evaluation as a necessary component of any agreement, and the evaluation reports must be publicly accessible."
"Clearly, the rules governing personal data need urgently to be protected under the third pillar, as do global standards covering all the categories of personal data."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very well remember the statements by Chancellor Merkel in Strasbourg, in which she rightly spoke of European values and also about our need to get across to people, and make it clear to them, what Europe's strong points are."
"Mr Gloser, this would appear to be a case in which we should explain to people that the European Union helps them safeguard their rights."
"We are not concerned in this instance with the issue of combating terrorism."
"There is consensus in this House on that matter, and it does not need to be discussed."
"Where, however, do we stand, then, in this debate?"
"We began by discussing airline passenger data, and now we come on to SWIFT."
"In view of the speed with which the Council debate is currently being conducted, it is to be feared that, over the next few years, we may possibly have further SWIFTs to contend with, but we still have not made further progress."
"In the meantime, we have a situation in which, under pressure from the United States, a European company signs a memorandum of understanding with the Americans, which Europeans are unable to scrutinise."
"Moreover, SWIFT still does not even have a registered office in the United States, but only a data bank."
"That is sufficient for American regulators to be able to take SWIFT to task in Belgium."
"This is like a running theme. There is more and more American regulation of European affairs, appropriated by the United States without we Europeans managing to adopt corresponding countermeasures and to monitor the effects of these."
"I would therefore, bearing in mind that Germany does not only have the Presidency of the European Council but also chairs the G7, urge the Commission to take an active stance in this area and, as well as investigating matters, to resolve one issue: how, on the basis of our common values and while adhering to data protection requirements and safeguarding human dignity, are we to join together in combating terrorism?"
"Mr President, of course the reality of this is that on PNR, the Americans are setting a negotiation bar for conditions of entry into the US or into their airspace."
"That is the reality."
"They can set the bar as high as they like."
"We have citizens who wish to travel and businesses who want to work there."
"That is the reality."
"The reality on SWIFT is that we had an institution, not I believe the only institution, that was dealing with a conflict of jurisdictions, operating and holding data in the US and equally in the EU."
"It had subpoenas which it legally had to meet in the United States of America and that was where we had the conflict."
"SWIFT, I believe, has actually operated and negotiated an excellent memorandum of understanding."
"We can either come into politics to name, shame, moan and whinge, or to try and solve a problem."
"I came in for the latter."
"Therefore I believe, Commissioner Frattini, you are absolutely right."
"We need legal certainty for EU citizens, for EU businesses operating outside the EU and with offices outside the EU as well as within, and in which they hold data."
"We need a joint political commitment of Congress and this Parliament working across the transatlantic divide to fight the threat of terrorism which affects us all, and indeed we need to protect above all our fundamental rights and freedoms."
"Therefore I welcome the joint meeting of this House and US elected representatives so that we can reach an agreement."
"Finally, this will only be achieved by decisive action at Council level, not just at Commission level."
"I welcome the excellent suggestion of the previous speaker of bringing this up at the G7."
"Let us solve the problem; let us not moan about it."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner and the President-in-Office for being present at this very important debate."
"We have heard that maintaining good cooperation with the US was crucial in our fight against terrorism."
"I do not deny that."
"I even believe that the transatlantic relationship must be reinforced because terrorism is a global phenomenon."
"We must join forces to fight it efficiently by exchanging information and providing our law enforcement agencies with the necessary means."
"Our citizens have the right to live in a safe and secure place."
"However, the SWIFT case is showing us again the drifts arising if we do not ensure strict safeguards when exchanging information."
"There is a correct balance to be struck between freedom and security, and in this case, security has once again prevailed."
"You cannot combat terrorism by giving up the very rights that terrorism seeks to destroy."
"Our high standards must not be lowered under pressure from any third country, even from our closest partners."
"It is even more important that many of the new Member States have a long history of dictatorship and mass surveillance of their population."
"Unfortunately, in some of these countries, there is a perception that the illicit practices of the past are still carried on."
"That is why Europe must remain the defender of fundamental rights, and that includes the right to privacy."
"On the one hand we need a framework decision on data protection in the third pillar to ensure high standards in police and judicial cooperation."
"We have been waiting for it for too long now."
"On the other hand, we must also remain vigilant and ensure that the existing instruments are properly enforced in our own countries."
"We must prosecute those who infringe our basic rights to privacy."
"We need to reassure our citizens that we want to maintain high standards in Europe."
"Mr President, as my colleagues have said before, this is not a debate about the shape of the transatlantic relations."
"Everyone in this House should know that the United States is our strongest ally in the fight against terrorism."
"But this does not change the fact that if we are partners it makes it easier for us to stand firm and really defend our values and our laws."
"I can only echo what my PPE colleagues - especially Mr Radwan - have said: in order for us to really safeguard the respect of the European regulatory framework, we need full information from the Commission and Council on the information that is delivered to the US authorities and how this information is protected by the US authorities."
"We have to start to negotiate and get an agreement on information exchange which is on a viable basis and which respects the EU laws."
"If this does not happen, we have to immediately stop delivering any kind of information to the US authorities."
"Even after the ECB's response, I am quite puzzled as to what the role and the responsibility of the ECB is in this case."
"The ECB itself is subject to the data privacy requirements of EU law, but it does not seem to take any responsibility for what it might have in this information exchange."
"I also understand that there is a clear need for the US to track down information on international bank transfers that might have a link to terrorist financing, but these details have a link to other kinds of financing."
"Our European businesses, especially, might be at risk if we do not act and stand firm."
"The information that will be given should always be in line with our legislation and protect our citizens and European businesses."
"The national financial transfers contain such delicate information that this is really an issue which should be taken seriously by the Commission and by the Council, this Parliament and the US Congress."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council should, in my view, observe the following guidelines in its current negotiations with the United States on the transfer of airline passenger data."
"Firstly, it is through a proportionate approach that an appropriate level of security will be achieved, and that approach is not apparent in the case of the current agreements."
"Such an approach depends - and this is my second point - on implementing compliance with normal European data protection standards, and that in my view involves changing the status quo, mainly through reducing the quantity of behaviour-related data."
"Where switching over to the push system is concerned, Austrian Airlines has, to my knowledge, operated this system from the beginning - successfully, too."
"The system involves having a clearly defined framework for using the data, a limit on the period for which the data is stored and, not least, the ability to lodge a complaint in the event of data being misused."
"Mr Gloser, you rightly said that we need legal certainty as quickly as possible for European airlines."
"As a politician involved in transport issues, I can only concur with that."
"Given that the transfer of data really is about making progress in combating terrorism, it has an international dimension, and we no doubt also need international agreements with internationally binding data protection rules."
"These are what we should be negotiating towards."
"We must always be concerned to uphold our right to freedom of movement, which can only be achieved in an open society in which people can move about freely without falling under general suspicion."
"It would be unacceptable to us as Members of the European Parliament if the principle of equality were to be violated and if different levels of data protection were to apply to US citizens, on the one hand, and to non-Americans, on the other."
"I have confidence in the determination of the German Presidency of the Council as it conducts the negotiations."
"I know that these will not be a simple matter."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, the fact that you have heard the same refrain right across the political groups should, I believe, give you pause for thought."
"The message is that we do of course need a transatlantic partnership and that we are allies in the fight against terrorism."
"Not only the refrain, but even the verse was the same across the board, namely that credibility, confidence and transparency are necessary where these issues are concerned."
"Let us begin with credibility."
"I still remember very well how, in his last speech in this House, the Commissioner particularly praised the data protection aspects of the agreement."
"I do not believe that such praise is compatible with the rights that we should have from the point of view of data protection law."
"Where the transfer of airline passenger data is concerned, there is no duty to provide information, and the individuals concerned have no right to correct the data."
"What, moreover, has happened to credibility when you call the conversations you are conducting with the United States 'negotiations'?"
"You are standing with your back to the wall and with a pistol pointing at your chest."
"The United States is threatening no longer to allow aircraft to land, and none of the European Union's institutions has the backbone to say that, in all good faith, we shall not allow ourselves to be treated like that."
"Credibility is undermined by our hearing again and again that Parliament is to be involved."
"If you are serious about that, then include us around the table and, in so doing, show us that you mean what you say."
"Turning now to the subject of transparency, which European citizens are aware that, when they board an aircraft, 34 items of data, including information about what they have to eat and where they sit, are transferred?"
"None do."
"I have discussed this very question with citizens in a broadcast."
"No one knows that this is what happens when he or she boards an aircraft."
"We are on your side, so involve us instead of just fobbing us off."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the SWIFT debate very clearly fits within the wider discussion on the high-wire balancing act between the fight against terrorism on the one hand and the protection of fundamental human rights and privacy on the other."
"Not only, though, is there a clear dividing line between the European and American positions, we cannot even seem to agree on a common definition for terrorism."
"The Commissioner has indicated on this platform how he would like to develop a European instrument for the future that would meet these requirements, but that is something that cannot, of course, be done overnight."
"We are, indeed, left with the situation from the past and present, something about which I have quite a few questions."
"To this day, data are being passed on, as if there was nothing wrong, within the SWIFT dossier."
"The conclusions of the reports from both the Belgian privacy committee and the European Committee are clear and unanimous: the Belgian and European rules on data protection have clearly been flouted."
"In view of the fact that the Belgian courts have now decided not to prosecute SWIFT, and the Belgian Government cannot see any point in continuing those illegal practices, I should like to ask what Europe's response to this is."
"Will the Commission now start an infringement procedure against Belgium?"
"If so, when will this be decided?"
"If not, what does the Commission intend to do to ensure that the European privacy rules are respected hic et nunc in all Member States, including Belgium?"
"Finally, at the Council of 15 December, the SWIFT case was also raised by the Belgian Prime Minister who argued in favour of a European approach."
"Although I understand from the presidency that the inquiry is still underway, I have a very straightforward question: are the Council, and hence all the Member States, behind the idea of regulating this issue by means of a European instrument?"
"Mr President, I do not doubt Commissioner Frattini's own personal good faith and commitment to data protection."
"But I think the Commission, as well as the Council, are being as feeble about SWIFT privacy abuses as they have been over PNR over the last four years."
"This is European data, belonging to European citizens, made available for commercial purposes in Europe under the protection of European data protection law."
"But despite the persistent and insistent demands of MEPs, the EU, in the less than robust hands of the Council and Commission, has allowed a large degree of US extra-territorial jurisdiction."
"In any global framework for exchange of mass commercial data for security purposes, the EU must forcefully project its own laws and principles."
"Commissioner, you say that it is 'unlikely' that SWIFT data have been used in the automated targeting system, which is a profiling exercise assigning a risk score to each individual based on assumptions - and no doubt stereotypes - deriving from their behaviour and characteristics."
"But why do you not know categorically, yes or no, whether SWIFT data has been used in ATS?"
"In relation to PNR, you accept the Department of Homeland Security's assurance that the use of PNR data for profiling complies with the undertakings of the PNR agreement."
"But do you agree with the DHS assessment?"
"Yes or no?"
"The lack of clear answers is undermining trust, and I think that we are owed those clear answers as to the Commission's legal evaluation."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, you did not beat about the bush when you made your commitment to the negotiations known."
"Full compliance with the fundamental rights, including privacy, there is no room for any misunderstanding here, and we will keep you to this pledge."
"There is, then, little point in 780 MEPs sitting where the negotiators should be; it would not work."
"That does, however, mean that the Council must be ambitious in its negotiations, instead of - as I now hear them doing - mainly weighing up the hazards it might meet with along the way."
"We assume, however, that your commitment to the negotiations is as firm as Commissioner Frattini's, because we will hold you to that as well."
"This is about SWIFT now, and SWIFT not being a bank should not be a licence not to take privacy rules seriously or not to comply with them."
"The inquiry you mounted, Commissioner Frattini, is to be welcomed, but you will need to take legal measures promptly in order to fill the vacuum, because data exchange at SWIFT should also be able to stand the test of European privacy rules."
"The fight against terror must also be able to look into financial transactions in this framework, because this may well lead to terrorist organisations."
"Something that has struck me is that many citizens have much sympathy for the difficult dilemmas we face in this context."
"We cannot resolve this overnight."
"I am, for example, quite shocked by the fact that there has not been more of a fuss made about the rules on liquids in aircraft."
"We should not seize this as an excuse, though."
"Tough negotiations are needed."
"The suggestion mooted by Mr Radwan to place this in a wider G7 context is something I am happy to endorse."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, none us in this House disputes the fact that there needs to be enhanced prevention of terrorism in the future."
"However, the issue inevitably arises of the means to be used in this connection, as well as the issue of the strategies to be adopted."
"Undoubtedly, international cooperation and the exchange of data are just as much a part of the process as, on the other hand, legal certainty and the necessary data protection."
"As all of us do in this House, I support transatlantic cooperation in this connection."
"We must, however, attach importance to seeing a balance maintained between security and the combating of terrorism, on the one hand, and data protection, on the other."
"If, moreover, it is now a question of negotiating a new agreement, then this new agreement needs to fulfil certain basic preconditions."
"Firstly, personal data needs to be given the same level of protection as has already been achieved in the interim agreement."
"Secondly, the airlines must be afforded legal certainty so that the promise to switch over to a push system, enabling us to control which data is delivered to whom and at which juncture, is kept."
"The purpose for which the data can be used must also, of course, be laid down so that the data can only, and is only allowed to, be used for the purpose of preventing and combating terrorism. There should also in future be a duty to provide travellers with information in this connection."
"I would make one last point, which I do think is important. In negotiating the new agreement, added value should also be created."
"As soon as an act of terrorism is suspected, the US authorities should be obliged to notify the corresponding judicial and police authorities in the Member States, as well as the corresponding EU institutions, namely Europol or Eurojust."
"If all this is guaranteed, we shall have available to us a further instrument designed to make EU citizens more secure."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank you most sincerely for the many comments, ideas and of course - whether one likes them or not - the critical remarks."
"In a debate, they serve to indicate whether or not one is on the right track and whether it is possible to prevent some state of affairs that was not perhaps right in the past from arising again."
"Not only legal protection and legal certainty but also the issue of how we are to combat specific forms of international terrorism are, it is true, unanimously deemed to be important, but we must not in any circumstances play these off against each other."
"Where the two areas of PNR and SWIFT are concerned, we face different situations."
"In the statement by the Presidency, I again made a point of clearly emphasising cooperation and interchange with the Commission, on the basis of which we wish together to arrive at a legally certain regulation."
"This raises many issues to which you have also referred today, including those of how extensive the information is, what access there is to it and what controls need to be exercised by the other party."
"Similar issues arise too where the subject of SWIFT is concerned, and in this connection I am again happy to take up Mr Radwan's idea."
"Irrespective of whether or not it is at present on the agendas of the G7 or G8 or comes within the area of relations between the European Union and the United States, it is important to address this issue."
"There would certainly be no benefit in just moving constantly from one aspect to the next, as what is at issue here is essentially the same."
"We are concerned with data protection, with legal certainty and, furthermore, with the form to be taken by the transatlantic partnership, in connection with which we are of the view that partnership is not a one-way street."
"It is a question of working with, rather than against, each other."
"We need the information concerned, and relations between the European Union and the United States should be such that, in the forthcoming meetings between the two countries, it should be possible to address the issues very clearly, above all with a view to confronting the danger that some of you have described."
"I can do no more than say how absolutely right it is to address these issues openly."
"When are we to be confronted with the next case in which data is perhaps unsafely accessed?"
"That is a point that we should like to take up."
"Without now going into technical details, I also say that with, specifically, SWIFT in mind."
"Where is the data?"
"Is it here, and would we have the opportunity to put it in order and limit its extent without its being passed on?"
"Or is the data possibly already available in the USA where, because of the nature of data protection there, it is very easy to access?"
"The implication in that case, however, is that we have no influence at all."
"The question is, however, that of what influence the European Union has on data that is transferred and that is, as it were, ready to be called up elsewhere?"
"Specifically where SWIFT is concerned, this is certainly a complicated procedure."
"All this should, however, give us the opportunity for discussing these matters in depth and for arguing how important it is for us in the European Union to stand for certain values and also to act in defence of those values. It should also give us the opportunity for arguing how essential it is to maintain the existing balance."
"That does not mean that we are always in agreement about the fight against international terrorism."
"It is just that all these matters have to be balanced out."
"Commissioner Frattini did in fact make this very clear in giving precedence not only to people's safety but also to legal protection and to the very high level of data protection such as we do in fact have in the European Union."
"I can only assure you that these many facets that you have discussed are also to be included for discussion in the forthcoming negotiations, and in relation not only to PNR but also, of course, to SWIFT."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as always I shall be perfectly sincere in my reply to this House, and I shall also address the points on which I do not share your views."
"First, as the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is well aware - and its chairman, Mr Cavada, is here - I have never, under any circumstances, either denied or concealed any information, including confidential information, that I could have given to the committee and thus to Parliament."
"I intend to continue in the same way, as I said in my introduction."
"Thus I do not share the opinion - which is actually to prejudge the issue - that the European institutions and Parliament in particular might be in danger of being excluded from this political process."
"You are well aware that I am in favour of your being politically involved, even when the Treaties do not allow for it."
"I have said it a thousand times and I shall say it again: we shall find a way, and that is why I welcome Mr Cavada's idea of even organising an agreement with the US Congress to monitor the political stages of these negotiations."
"It is also clear that this debate has affected Euroatlantic relations, contrary to what somebody said."
"I am convinced that, if Europe wants to be a leader on the world political stage, it must achieve a global balance between the right - I personally consider it a duty - to pursue and investigate terrorists and the duty to protect fundamental rights, such as the privacy of personal data."
"It is therefore obvious that if, as the President-in-Office of the Council has just said, we want to achieve an overall balance together with the United States, we want to do so because we are convinced that Euroatlantic relations are crucial, not only with regard to Europe's past history but, above all, with regard to its present and future history."
"As many of you are well aware, I have on many occasions supplied detailed answers, above all to the Committee on Civil Liberties, of course, but I address Parliament when I am invited to do so and I speak to those committees that invite me."
"Regarding the 'push' system, for instance, I announced in December that experiments with such a system for passenger name records would begin before the end of the month, and they did."
"The experiment was started with the US Administration's Customs and Border Protection System and Amadeus."
"There is a technical point regarding requests for ad hoc data, but it is a technical problem, while the 'push' experiment has indeed started, as we had been promised."
"With regard to the number of data items, I was interested to hear what many of you had to say about the 34 items that are currently the subject of the PNR agreement."
"I can tell you quite openly that, as far as my part in the negotiations is concerned, I intend to call for the number of data items in question to be cut, but not because I subscribe to the idea that the US is asking for too many."
"If all 34 items were of use in pursuing terrorists, I would not be afraid to tell you that 34 items were needed."
"However, the really useful items are probably those 19 that have been mentioned: that is to say, a much smaller number."
"Believe me, though, the principle that counts as regards the data to be processed is not the number of items but rather the usefulness of the data, and it is on those grounds that I intend to take action in the negotiations."
"I do not mean to endorse the idea that, if we cut the 34 items down to 15, we will in any case have done a good job: we may actually have done a very bad job if some of the excluded data items could have prevented a terrorist attack."
"I am in no doubt about one thing: I am quite certain that the main aim is to make the system effective."
"Who has access to the data?"
"What for?"
"How many data and for how long?"
"These are the points of an agreement that we are going to start negotiating soon, and Parliament will be kept informed, as I have already said."
"Ladies and gentlemen, many of you believe that passenger information is the missing factor in the PNR system."
"It is fair to imagine that if no consensus is reached between the two sides, no agreement will be made at the end of July."
"Just in my mind's eye, I can see a very simple solution: every ticket to the United States that is purchased could come with a sheet for the passenger to sign, informing them that their data will be processed in a particular way."
"If that should happen - and I strongly hope that it never will - we will certainly have ensured that passengers are given information but, without an agreement at European level, passengers' rights will be limited to the private sphere of the air carriage contract."
"That is an eventuality that we must avert by every possible means, which is why we must try to achieve a new European agreement."
"The alternative would be very simple: passengers would merely need to be asked to accept a few restrictions as part of the air carriage contract, and I believe that the majority who want to go to the United States for honest reasons would sign it."
"We would, however, be giving up a role for Europe that we have already played and which it is vital that we still play."
"That is why we need new negotiations, in part to cut down the number of data items, but in such a way that reducing the amount of data does not jeopardise the fight against terrorism."
"In connection with the ATS system, I have mentioned to the Committee on Civil Liberties that I have received written assurances from the United States regarding compliance with the PNR agreement."
"In a speech made in this Chamber, I was criticised for not having checked the veracity of this statement."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if I, in Brussels, had the power to investigate the behaviour of the United States, I would have powers that no authority at either European or national level has ever had or is ever likely to have."
"Everything is possible, apart from checking the veracity of that letter, as I was asked to do in that speech."
"When I receive a formal reply saying that the rules are being complied with, I have to take it at face value unless there is evidence to the contrary."
"That is what happens between allies, unless you have some evidence to the contrary - which I frankly do not have, and I am being absolutely honest - because otherwise we would have to open a permanent inquiry into every minute detail of the letters we receive from the United States."
"Mrs Roure asked me whether we can give Parliament our information on the negotiating mandate."
"As you know, such information is classified; nonetheless, as I said before, even though it is classified, we will find a way to keep Parliament informed, in other words a way to give you political information without violating a rule enshrined in the Treaties, whereby classified ('EU restricted') information cannot be published."
"This is the political solution that I propose: if the Treaty is amended so as to specify a mechanism by which classified acts may be communicated to Parliament, I shall apply such a rule without hesitation."
"It is a matter, however, of overcoming the obstacle that Parliament cannot be informed if classified material is involved."
"I shall keep you up to date on this."
"Many people have called for a framework agreement, Mr President, which I think is the right way to go."
"A framework agreement on data transmission is precisely what we have started working on with the Presidency: we are setting up a joint working party to deal with a number of topics relating to personal data processing - separate, therefore, from the SWIFT case and PNR, which are going on in parallel."
"We believe that the time has now come to conclude a Euroatlantic political agreement - a framework agreement - with the United States on personal data processing, and we intend to work on this agreement in order to specify what kinds of data can be transmitted, for what purposes and for how long."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is a further point that has not been addressed in this debate, but which needs to be addressed: how can we preserve the confidentiality of the technical information that forms part of this agreement?"
"Since it concerns investigation procedures, it would be a gift to criminals if it were revealed."
"Such information needs to be kept confidential."
"There is thus another problem, because it is obvious that we would be giving suspected terrorists a powerful tool if we revealed details about how they are monitored."
"Can a solution be found?"
"I am quite sure that one can, but there needs to be political will on both sides."
"I should like to end with a final thought: none of all that justifies the specific violations of European law and the legislative failings in the SWIFT case."
"You may recall that, when nobody was yet talking about a European agreement, I addressed the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the need for such an agreement, because it is much better to close a legislative gap with a European rule than to leave it to the individual Member States to legislate as they please."
"The SWIFT case is typical: out of 27 Member States, only seven have given me a reply."
"That is a sign that the issue needs to be addressed at a European level."
"For all these reasons, therefore, I can assure you that 1) I believe that a political agreement is essential and that the legitimacy of such an agreement will be weaker if Parliament is not involved; and 2) such a political agreement should be aimed at solving the problems constructively, without pointing the finger at the United States as if it was the problem: the problem, ladies and gentlemen, is the terrorists, not the United States."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next part-session."
"Since it is time to resume the sitting, there will be no suspension."
"I would like to thank the interpreters for their generosity and professionalism; this Parliament could not function without them."
"Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"(PT) There have been months and months of condemnation of the unacceptable transfer of passenger name records by airlines and of personal data by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) system to the security and information services of the United States."
"Yet, in response to the questions asked here in Parliament, the German Presidency of the Council and the Commission have offered nothing that would result in complete clarification of these matters and an end to this blatant violation of the citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"Their responses do not contain a single word on the practical measures needed to put an end to these unacceptable, illegal practices, or on demanding full clarification from the US Administration."
"Such behaviour is ultimately indicative of the Council's submissive, passive attitude to the USA's blackmail and demands."
"I must also mention the attempts by those whose only goal is to benefit from these situations by further applying qualified majority voting in the Council on issues of justice and home affairs."
"All measures that, under the guise of the so-called 'war on terror', undermine the citizens' fundamental rights must be rejected outright."
"(EL) Both the Commission and the Council have confirmed in their statements that they will continue to satisfy US demands by holding files on all European citizens and handing over their personal data to the US secret security services."
"The representatives of the German Presidency and the Commission have not only accepted that the new agreement with the USA on the transmission of the personal data of passengers flying there will not differ from the present agreement; they have also cynically admitted that they are prepared to legalise the SWIFT scandal by laying down so-called principles for the provision of information on financial transactions by European citizens in the USA, so that this will now be legal."
"As they clearly stated, they will not commit the cardinal sin of disrupting relations between the EU and the USA."
"As far as the protection of fundamental rights, personal data and privacy are concerned, they will try to persuade our 'American friends' to respect them, obviously just as they respect them in Iraq and Afghanistan."
"It is crystal clear that the policies of the EU and the USA are identical, are equally reactionary and anti-democratic and are equally dangerous to democratic rights and grass-roots freedoms, using as they do the 'fight against terrorism' as the necessary pretext to limit fundamental rights."
"Limitation periods in cross-border disputes involving personal injuries and fatal accidents (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on limitation periods in cross-border disputes involving injuries and fatal accidents."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, in opening this discussion I would like us to imagine ourselves as one of those people we represent, perhaps off on holiday to another European country or a young person off to study somewhere else, or somebody off to a business meeting in another European capital, or even to work on a building site."
"All of these are simple everyday scenarios that sadly contain the potential for mishaps, for accidents involving personal injury or even death in another country."
"Let me also give you some figures by way of example: in 2004 alone in Germany, just one of our 27 Member States, there were 50 000 road traffic accidents involving personal injury and a foreign national from another European country."
"In the UK last year, one firm of lawyers alone reported opening some 6000 files on cross-border personal injury accidents in Europe."
"Well, you might say, let the lawyers get on with it."
"But the lawyers have come to us with a problem."
"All legal actions are subject to a period of time within which they have to be commenced, a so-called limitation period."
"All good lawyers are training in their national system to observe and watch these time limits very carefully."
"Otherwise the whole claim is dead, finished, struck out."
"It is one of the nightmares of every young lawyer to miss a limitation period deadline."
"Of course, they all know their own, but can they be expected to know the intricacies of 27 national systems?"
"And there are intricacies, sometimes involving differing definitions of what is a civil or criminal claim."
"More importantly, the time limit itself varies tremendously, between one and thirty years across the European Union."
"It is bad enough to be an accident victim in another Member State."
"But then to fall a secondary victim to a technical difficulty over limitation periods which then stop any claim being made is, as we say in English, really a case of adding insult to injury."
"This is a real, practical and growing problem as we encourage free movement of persons."
"I hope that the very limited numbers I have been able to quote give an idea of the problem which in reality must be multiplied many times across the Member States of the Union."
"As I have stated above, legal practitioners, insurers and victims alike have come to us with this problem asking that we approach you, Commissioner, to look at a range of possibilities."
"We know the issue is sensitive."
"It concerns national procedural law, so any intervention at European level should be strictly limited to the cross-border cases only."
"It may be that for these cases a harmonised limitation period of say four years might be considered, or maybe we should adopt clear conflict of laws rules."
"Whatever the shape of the ultimate solution, practitioners and claimants alike need certainty if valuable and personally critical claims are not to be in danger of being lost because of differing procedural rules that can really cause individual and family misery if things go awry."
"This is a practical problem arising out of the use by our citizens of free movement and all that the internal market offers."
"On our side we should be prepared to respond with a system of European civil justice which does not, as I have said earlier, just add insult to injury."
"I hope, Commissioner, that you will feel able to respond to this initiative which has been the subject of a good deal of positive lobbying from citizens and others towards Members during the weeks leading up to this debate."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"I think this report is a very interesting attempt to deal with a very difficult subject."
"Mrs Wallis is to be congratulated on trying to see a way into a general European solution to the differences in limitation periods as they relate, as she just said, to actions for damages for personal injury and death."
"This is of particular concern to citizens who have the misfortune to suffer road traffic accidents in countries other than those in which they live."
"But it could also apply in other matters, such as medical claims and product liability."
"Having said that, the area of limitation is a complex matter, as the rapporteur also acknowledged."
"It is very closely linked to prescription, which is not dealt with in the report."
"Any further work on the subject would need to deal with prescription, since the majority of European legal systems solve the problem of time limits through the use of prescription rather than limitation periods."
"The UK system uses both."
"I am ready, I am open to examining this question in the future, taking into account the different legal nature of limitation and prescription, and the fact that the Treaty base proposed excludes harmonisation of internal law, which, in large measure, is what is implied by the report."
"I have to be very frank in pointing out that we will also have to take into account the priorities established in our current work programme, which will also have to be integrated in line with the human resources available in the European Commission."
"That said, I can see that this very new point put by the rapporteur should be left open for further discussions."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the rapporteur has done excellent work with this report."
"There is much to applaud in this initiative."
"This, like our rapporteur said, is a practical solution to a practical problem."
"For one, it concerns one of the unfinished areas of the single market: how people's rights travel with them when they exercise their four freedoms inside the Union."
"The European Parliament must point out any anomalies and invoke its Treaty rights to prompt the Commission into action."
"Secondly, it concerns justice and home affairs."
"People need as much certainty as possible about their rights and obligations in order to engage in any society."
"Engaging across borders in always going to be more uncertain than doing so at home but we have a duty as EU legislators to address these concerns."
"The mere fact that the disparate national laws do not allow for a quick uniform solution is no excuse for inaction."
"The European Parliament is doing its part by opening the debate today."
"The Commission should follow with a proposal and the Member States should assume their sovereign responsibility and enact the necessary changes, employing the passerelle clause of the Nice Treaty if needed."
"However, we have to be careful how we approach this."
"While my group strongly supports the report of Mrs Wallis, we cannot support her amendments to it."
"We believe it is too early in this report to point towards overly-harmonised and specific definitions of, for example, date of knowledge, interrupted proceedings, and special rights of minors."
"We do not believe them to be fully consistent at this stage with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"Let us first hear about the Commission's inquiry as to what kinds of cross-border problems exist in the domain of limitation periods in cases of personal injury and then move on to the concrete definitions."
"For example, if the inquiry were to show that there is not such a huge discrepancy between Member States' rules, the country of origin approach, as the report suggests, might show the way."
"Personally I would support this approach."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) I shall speak in Spanish, and this is the first speech in Spanish, but I believe that the Commissioner understands my language perfectly."
"I would like to point out that the Castilian version of the report says 'recomendaciones destinadas a la ComisiÃ³n sobre la prescripciÃ³n en conflictos transfronterizos'. In other words, it does not use the phrase 'estatuto de limitaciones', because, according to my knowledge of Anglo-Saxon law, the expression 'statute of limitations', at least in Spanish, is translated as 'prescripciÃ³n'."
"I know that the Italians are very sharp and precise lawyers, and this issue probably deserves to be discussed in greater depth, although I agree that the origins of the two institutions differ."
"In any event, I believe that Mrs Wallis's report reflects the European Parliament's desire to push the Commission in a certain direction."
"Neither we nor the report are asking the Commission to present a legislative proposal quickly, but I believe that certain stages such as the one indicated in paragraph1, which states that an investigation into what is happening is needed should be carried out."
"As Mrs Wallis has said, there are currently thousands of people, or hundreds of thousands of people, crossing national borders, and I believe that Mr Frattini was right on another issue, and that is that we should not just focus on cross-border accidents or incidents, but on all of those cases in which, as a result of a series of situations - such as medical treatment or accommodation - a person suffers damages in one country and the problem of limitations arises in another country."
"I believe that we should extend the possibilities as far as possible and that for the moment - and perhaps Mrs Kauppi is right - it is probably not yet time to go into details, but the Commission should at least be aware that we elected representatives of the peoples of the European Union believe that it should adopt certain kinds of initiative in relation to this issue."
"As the rapporteur proposes, this kind of initiative should begin with acquiring proper knowledge of the situation, so that we have a true picture of that situation and of the possibilities available to us for legislating in this field."
"When the House comes to vote on this, it may perhaps be worth noting the problems arising from the various language versions."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Wallis for taking this initiative aimed at harmonising the rules on commencement of running time and limitation periods for claims relating to property and personal injury in cross-border disputes."
"Road travel has increased significantly of late, partly due to the various enlargements of the European Union, and also to people becoming more affluent and being able to travel freely."
"Unfortunately, this has resulted in more people being involved in road accidents."
"At present, under national civil systems, limitation periods vary from the very short, such as one year, to the very long, such as 30 years."
"This is not helpful for the protection of the injured parties, who are often unaware of the variations in limitation periods in various countries and submit claims for damages to foreign courts after the expiry of the relevant period."
"What happens then is that the court rejects the application and the individuals, whose health or property has been affected, are unable to assert their rights."
"Harmonisation would help with the introduction of reliable and transparent principles, which would allow claims to be asserted by both the injured parties and by their legal representatives."
"As a lawyer myself, I am well aware of the situation the latter can find themselves in."
"That is why I fully support this initiative."
"(PL) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Wallis very much for the work she has undertaken."
"In particular, I recall the special meetings she arranged for the Committee on Legal Affairs, enabling us to fully understand the task before us, which is of great significance for all European Union citizens."
"I cannot agree with the Commissioner that the simple explanation for the delay and postponement of this legislative initiative lies in the formal inability to interfere in national legal systems."
"Whenever I take the floor in this House, and the opportunity arises, I stress that the fundamental duty of every parliament and every institution with legislative power is to create simple legislation that is readily understandable and serves the citizens' interests."
"In other words, it is incumbent on us to create legislation that makes the citizens' lives easier."
"At present, there are 27 different legal systems to deal with with regard to limitation periods for pecuniary claims related to different types of accident."
"It is therefore the duty of the European Parliament, the European Commission and also of the Council to find a way of rectifying the situation and creating new legislation that would make life easier."
"It is difficult to explain to a claimant or to a deceased person's family that, formally, the case has long since been closed, and that all we can do is to commiserate with them because all claims submitted after the expiry of the limitation period have to be rejected."
"I therefore appeal to the European Commission and ask it to use all the means at its disposal and all its legislative competence to find a legal solution to this problem."
"I am firmly convinced that the individual Member States believe that this matter, which affects hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of European citizens, must be resolved quickly and appropriately."
"If it is our intention that European Union citizens should pursue activities that involve moving between countries, we must come up with solutions that make it easier for them to do so."
"(PL) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Wallis for all the work she has put into this European Parliament draft resolution."
"At present, there are significant discrepancies across the territory of the European Union with regard to the time periods applicable in cross-border disputes involving injuries and fatal accidents."
"We must acknowledge that this is the case."
"As the rapporteur rightly pointed out, the problem is a complex one."
"It encompasses both the limitation periods and the commencement of running time."
"Limitations, the time period for presenting information concerning the event, the possibility of suspending or halting the course of the period, as well as the examination of evidence and the process for lodging objections concerning limitations are also involved."
"Major discrepancies can have undesirable consequences for accident victims, making it difficult for them to assert their rights in court."
"Priority must be given to guaranteeing legal certainty for all European Union citizens and making it easier for them to enjoy the freedoms laid down in the Treaties."
"I therefore urge the Commission to submit a draft legislative proposal to the European Parliament."
"The proposal should take account of the wise recommendations appended to this draft resolution."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Wallis for an excellent and much-needed report which responds to the needs of the victims of various types of accidents."
"Mrs Wallis rightly highlighted that the Union is open to its citizens, who may travel and relocate without any restrictions."
"Unfortunately, this is associated with an increased probability of accidents."
"Accident victims often suffer twice over, first as a result of the accident itself and then because they are unfamiliar with the law of the country where the accident took place."
"Limitation periods are therefore often exceeded and it becomes impossible to assert legitimate claims."
"Accordingly, we should endorse the proposal before us, so that a minimum limitation period for cross-border disputes involving accidents can be established across the Union."
"The proposal protects the victims' interests, and provides them with better opportunities to exercise their rights."
"It therefore truly deserves our support."
"I trust that, further to this report, the Commission will very soon table specific proposals to protect the interests of people to whom fate has been unkind."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"The recommendation is not intended to substitute national legislation but to take into account when proceedings involve parties who reside or are domiciled in different countries of the European Union, or a party residing or domiciled in a non-community state, or a choice between the laws of different countries."
"It is becoming essential for principles governing limitation periods to be laid down clearly in an appropriate form for claims to damages."
"The general limitation period which is being proposed is four years, except where the proper law of the claim provides for a longer period."
"This general principle may cause problems, since the national legislation may cater for a shorter period, in which case there would be a discriminatory scenario when claims for damages arise between nationals or persons domiciled in the same state and when the issue relates to parties residing or domiciled in different states."
"The same may be said for interruption, suspension and methods of calculating when the period limitation initiates."
"Having stated the above it is better to have clear regulations for cross-border disputes which at the same time differ from national legislations."
"Perhaps the dilemma can start to be solved if national legislation is harmonised with the proposed regulations."
"Strategy for a strengthened partnership with the Pacific Islands (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Nirj Deva, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on EU relations with the Pacific Islands A strategy for a strengthened partnership."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, it is so hugely flattering to speak to an almost empty Chamber!"
"The Cook Islands, the Fiji Islands, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu - exotic places, fantastic places, so distant, so far away, so romantic and so on, but actually they are in need."
"All these countries are part of the Pacific Islands."
"Historically, Europe has had the strongest influence in the Pacific region through colonial rule."
"The end of the Second World War hastened the end of European colonialism, but the relationship continued."
"Through the LomÃ© Convention and the Cotonou Agreement, the Pacific region is now linked to us and our daily lives through the ACP."
"Even if the population of the Pacific Islands is small, we have to bear in mind that the Pacific Ocean itself covers nearly 30% of the planet's surface."
"Their location, while bringing huge benefits to the region through fisheries and tourism, means they find themselves isolated through a tyranny of distance."
"However, advances in technology, air travel and infrastructure have helped to alleviate their economic circumstances."
"Another thing they should consider - and I am very pleased to see the Commission in full strength here - is that the English-speaking digital economy may provide another way forward for them to provide business process outsourcing and knowledge process outsourcing services to the United States and Australasia."
"The region shows an economic contrast, with annual GDP per capita ranging from EUR 500 to EUR 8000."
"This is like comparing Somalia to Bulgaria."
"Therefore, the strategy for the region must have a certain flexibility in order to ensure that the development assistance is channelled according to national and regional parities and to achieve maximum benefit in both the richer and poorer islands."
"For many Pacific islanders, agricultural products are their primary exports to international markets, supplying commodities such as sugar, copra, bananas, coconuts and palm oil."
"However, they face challenges such as global warming, which is a huge challenge for them."
"We have also given them another interesting problem: economic partnership agreements - EPAs - which they have to contend with."
"What are they to do?"
"Do we help them, support them?"
"Do we create infrastructure so that they can come out of this problem?"
"We need to think about this."
"One of the major challenges faced by the region is the sustainable management of fisheries."
"Tuna is especially abundant in the Pacific, with a third of the world's catch caught in the Pacific Islands, valued at EUR 2 billion."
"Are we protecting their catch?"
"Are we making sure that the benefits of their catches go back to their people?"
"I do not know."
"Maybe the Commission should look at this."
"I do not know exactly where their catch is going."
"They should not be as poor as they are if they are getting EUR 2 billion for those catches."
"My report stresses that any encouragement of tourism in the region must go hand-in-hand with increased local ownership of the tourist sector."
"I stress that in the majority of cases only the richer countries, with more developed infrastructure and more frequent air connections, attract significant numbers of tourists each year."
"In these cases, for the poorer countries, development assistance must continue to be used to finance infrastructure and to encourage sustainable tourism."
"In this regard, why have we not looked at creating a Pacific hub, a regional hub?"
"We could create a hub, like Dubai."
"After all, what was Dubai?"
"Dubai was full of sand 20 years ago!"
"Today it is a hub for regional air transport."
"Sheik Maktoum and those intelligent Arabs have created something quite extraordinary."
"Why do we not that in the Pacific for these islanders?"
"My report recommends that the more developed Pacific island countries should continue to deliver local processing, thereby creating more employment."
"They should explore the possibility of the European Investment Bank giving soft loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, to add value to their exports."
"Many of the islands are politically fragile, as we have seen through the many military coups in Fiji."
"I am sick of hearing about military coups in Fiji, but they need to be able to feel that they are going to have a future as two communities together, and we need to help them with that."
"They must stop or we should stop the aid."
"That is a threat, but we need to have some sort of quid pro quo on this issue."
"Provision of good governance throughout the Pacific is vital, and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals we must also achieve a certain measure of mutuality."
"In Papua New Guinea, for example, and the Solomon Islands, they have problems with regard to AIDS."
"The EU, as a major donor to the region, has an opportunity to create a strategy that will support the island countries of the Pacific in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and bringing their people to realise their full potential."
"Our report is just the start."
"Mr President, I welcome the report on EU relations with the Pacific Islands, and I especially want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Deva, on his results."
"When my colleague, Commissioner Michel, took the initiative to have the first ever EU strategy for our relations with the Pacific ACP States prepared, he did so because these countries are becoming increasingly important and because they are facing difficult challenges."
"We can benefit from closer contacts with the Pacific, as the region is of global significance and we can contribute significantly to its development."
"Parliament's report clearly reflects this and it points out important avenues forward."
"These countries are mostly remote, relatively poor, small and have become independent fairly recently."
"Most have strong population growth."
"They have a difficult balancing act to perform between tradition and the pressures of modernity."
"Globalisation is an opportunity for them, but also carries risks for their cultural heritage."
"In many countries in the Pacific, democracy has difficult growth conditions and, at the same time, the Pacific needs high-quality governance to move forward."
"For this reason, your commitment to their democracies, international exposure and contacts is very important."
"They have significant natural resources, such as oil, gas, fish and tropical wood, as well as fantastic biodiversity."
"The Pacific Ocean is so important that it must be considered as a global public good."
"This gives the Pacific Island countries opportunities on the international scene and prospects for the future."
"However, climate change threatens many of the islands, even whole countries."
"The overseas countries and territories serve as bridges between Europe and the Pacific and between our cultures."
"Where the Pacific countries have needs and we have comparative advantages, there we propose to assist."
"We have identified the 'blue-green' theme as the cornerstone of the focus on the sustainable management of the region's natural resources."
"In addition, we have committed ourselves to a strengthened political relationship, more focused development action and more efficient aid delivery."
"In our communication we foresaw that the Pacific countries would face more problems in the future if a number of significant trends were not reversed."
"Last year alone there were serious security problems and political crises in the Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga and Fiji."
"The problems are so difficult and severe than many of the Pacific ACP countries cannot handle them alone."
"For this reason we are working with our Australian and New Zealand friends and, as Mr Deva said, with stable conditions we can develop tourism further in the Pacific."
"Parliament has, of course, noticed the Council conclusions regarding the Pacific strategy, which confirmed that the EU will strengthen its partnership with this region."
"A number of Member States follow the Pacific closely."
"The EU has an important role to play in the Pacific."
"Your report demonstrates this very clearly and we count on your continued support and solidarity for these really extraordinary countries."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tonight we are debating the report by Mr Deva on the European Union's relations with the Pacific Islands - Strategy for a strengthened partnership."
"I was rapporteur for the opinion issued and approved by the Committee on Fisheries."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Deva on the work he has done and I am delighted that the Committee on Fisheries' proposals are going to be included in the text of the resolution, at least in part."
"The Pacific is one of the richest fishing grounds in the world, and the European tuna fleet has been fishing in those waters for some time thanks to the bilateral agreements signed with the countries of the region."
"According to the scientific studies, the level of stocks is entirely satisfactory, and European Union financial aid represents an important source of income for the countries of the region."
"We must therefore strengthen our relations with those countries."
"We have a mutual interest."
"We can contribute to promoting measures in those waters for the sustainable management of fisheries resources, and for EU fishermen fishing tuna it would be a very positive thing to make more progress towards creating a network of tuna agreements similar to the one already in place in the Indian Ocean, as requested by the Committee on Fisheries in its opinion."
"When it comes to strengthening the partnership with that region of the world, therefore, we must not overlook fisheries."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, many thanks to the rapporteur for his hard work."
"A strategy to strengthen partnerships with the Pacific Islands sounds good at first encounter and inert enough not to cause any measure of suspicion or discontent."
"After all, the projected aim is to improve relations, mainly trade, for the mutual benefit of EU citizens and the Pacific islanders."
"This might be the case for the majority of the Pacific Island countries."
"But for a significant number there is a hidden truth in the fact that many of the Pacific Islands are not countries at all: they are 21st century colonies, and two of the colonising nations happen to be members of the EU, namely France and Britain."
"Take for example New Caledonia."
"It has an area of about 18 500 km2 and its approximately 250 000 inhabitants are recorded as being merely a 'sui generis community'."
"New Caledonia is not a country but an overseas Department of France."
"On a much smaller scale, the Pitcairn Islands are an overseas territory of Britain administered by a governor appointed by the Queen of England."
"So colleagues, apart from the despicably shameful ethics of accepting that France and Britain should continue to have colonies, we seem to be content with going on to form relations with such colonies as though nothing wrong is going on."
"In fact, nothing about colonisation and consequent democracy deprivation is mentioned in this report."
"In conclusion, let me pose the following question. Since some of the islands are in essence parts of the aforementioned EU Member States, then in reality are France and Britain going to form relationships with themselves through this strategy partnership?"
"Perhaps the Commissioner could enlighten us on this exciting but strange prospect."
"(PL) Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Deva for this very important report on a strategy for a strengthened partnership between the European Union and the Pacific Islands."
"The European Parliament supports the European Commission's view that a more intensive political dialogue with the Pacific Islands Forum is required."
"Indeed, the Forum's leaders have adopted a new agreement establishing the Forum as an intergovernmental organisation under international law."
"At the same time, we wish to emphasise that strengthening dialogue at regional level must also take account of the needs of the poorest countries in the region."
"The exploitation of natural resources must help to generate income for all the citizens of these island nations in the Pacific."
"In particular, it must help to reduce poverty."
"The European Parliament wishes to highlight the importance of tourism in the region, bearing in mind that the natural beauty of the Pacific islands is one of their main assets."
"Support for tourism in the region must go hand in hand with an increased involvement of the islanders themselves in the provision of tourist services, in order to secure the future of the tourist sector and maximise its benefits for the local economy."
"I would also like to point out that the report emphasises the need to support technical education and training systems in the countries of the region, within the framework of the 10th European Development Fund."
"The European Parliament shares the European Commission's view that political instability and conflicts can have a destructive impact on the region's economic development, particularly as regards the loss of income from tourism and damage to economic infrastructure."
"We wish to draw attention to the situation in East Timor, where an outbreak of violence took place in May and June of 2006."
"It is to be hoped that, working in close cooperation with the international community, the Commission will be able to assist the leaders of East Timor to solve the problems underlying the crisis, taking account of the need for political stability, alleviation of poverty, social development and reconciliation between the various social groups."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"(FR) The European Parliament is being consulted this week about the first formal strategy for 30 years on relations between the European Union and the Pacific."
"This strategy is aimed at strengthening political dialogue, improving cooperation and increasing the effectiveness of development aid, more than a quarter of which is supplied by the European Union."
"In the case of a number of vital sectors, the strategy emphasises sustainable development from both an ecological and an economic point of view."
"These sectors include tourism, transportation, mining, agriculture and fisheries."
"In the Committee on Fisheries, I had an amendment adopted to the effect that the European Union should support regional cooperation projects on the evaluation, monitoring and management of fisheries resources, conducted with third countries in the area and with the overseas countries and territories associated with the European Union: French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna and Pitcairn."
"I am delighted that the European Union is willing to get more constructively involved in the Pacific by emphasising economic development, political stability and the sound management of resources in the immediate neighbourhood of our overseas countries and territories."
"Let us hope that the financial resources will match the declared ambitions."
"(PL) I would like to record my support for the content of Mr Deva's report on EU relations with the Pacific Islands entitled 'A strategy for strengthened partnership with the Pacific Islands'."
"I hope this much-needed document will herald a new era in contacts between the EU and the Pacific Islands."
"European countries have now been involved in the Pacific region for thirty years, and are major donors to the area."
"It is therefore particularly important to develop a long-term strategy."
"This is actually the only part of the world for which the Union has not yet developed a overarching, integrated strategy."
"The adoption of the document under consideration represents an excellent opportunity to create a new relationship with this region."
"This relationship should be both economic and political."
"The Pacific Islands play a very important role in stabilising the climate, and they also possess a great wealth of natural resources such as mineral deposits and fish."
"It would be a partnership with a region that is a world leader in tuna fishing and which accounts for one third of global catches."
"My support for the aforementioned document also relates to the need to promote democracy and stability in the Pacific region and to prevent extremist ideologies from taking root there."
"The European Union has historical ties with these islands, and should support them in their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"Adopting the Strategy for a strengthened partnership will provide us with an opportunity to set higher economic and social targets."
"The European Union's involvement in these efforts could go beyond simply providing support to former colonies."
"EC-Gabon Fisheries Partnership (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Stavros Arnaoutakis, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Gabonese Republic - C6-0303/2006 -."
"Mr President, the Community and the Republic of Gabon have negotiated and initialled, on 28 October 2005, a Fisheries Partnership Agreement for a period of six years."
"The new Protocol has been in provisional application since December 2005 under a decision of the Council."
"On the date of its entry into force, this Agreement will repeal and replace the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Gabon on fishing off the coast of Gabon, which entered into force in December 1998."
"The financial contribution is fixed at EUR 860 000 per year."
"Of this financial contribution, 60% will allow annual financial support for defining and implementing a sectoral fisheries policy in Gabon, with a view to introducing responsible and sustainable fishing."
"This new Protocol provides fishing possibilities for 24 tuna seiners and 16 surface long-liners, with an annual reference tonnage of 11 000 tonnes."
"The Agreement is part of an important network of EC Tuna Agreements in the Atlantic Ocean off the Western African coast."
"The Commission considers that the Agreement will give the Community and Gabon an appropriate legal and political framework for monitoring and controlling the activities of the EU fleet in the Gabonese fishing area."
"It also allows the Community to support the development of the sector in this country, for the mutual benefit of the parties."
"Mr President, the European Union and the Gabonese Republic negotiated and signed on 28 October 2005 a multiannual fisheries partnership agreement which will cover relations between the European Community and the Gabonese Republic in the fisheries sector."
"The partnership agreement, which is accompanied by a protocol, has been concluded for a period of six years, while the technical and financial terms governing fisheries activities entered into force back on 3 December 2005."
"The main objective of the partnership agreement, which goes beyond the narrow commercial framework of the previous bilateral agreement, is to develop a sustainable fisheries policy with responsible exploitation of fisheries resources, support for coastal populations and the creation of small local freezing and processing industries through general economic and scientific cooperation."
"One important innovative step is the monitoring of fishing vessels by satellite in order to stamp out illegal, undeclared and uncontrolled fishing."
"As emphasised by the Commissioner responsible for fisheries, Mr Borg, this new agreement opens up a new chapter in cooperation between the European Union and the Gabonese Republic, given that it will step up its efforts to safeguard the future of fisheries in its waters."
"We should emphasise that agreements such as this are particularly important, because they promote economic development and cooperation with third countries."
"This agreement with Gabon in the fisheries sector is another development tool being used by the European Union in order to emphasise its solidarity and intention to cooperate further with developing third countries."
"I therefore consider it necessary for the European Parliament, as the institution directly elected by the citizens, to be kept informed well in advance and not to be called on a year later purely and simply to ratify the decisions."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I wish to protest once again at the fact that fisheries is always dealt with in a secretive nocturnal manner; that is what is happening today once again."
"I would like to thank Mr Arnaoutakis for his wonderful report."
"Since it is so late, I shall be concise and stress three aspects relating to Gabon and fisheries agreements in general that I believe to be important."
"I must once again point to the Commission's delay in presenting this issue to the European Parliament and point out that the European Union is going to be paying the first portion of the financial payments to Gabon at least six months late."
"This is unacceptable and the European Union must not cause this kind of delay, especially when it comes to third countries whose economies are so weak."
"I believe that we have reached an agreement with Commissioner Borg and I hope that there will be no more such delays in future."
"Secondly, I would also like to stress the financial aspects of fisheries agreements in general, this specific case being one very infamous example."
"There are many people here - and I regret that they are not actually the people who are most critical of the fisheries agreements - who complain that the fisheries sector does not cooperate in, or hardly contribute to, the funding of these agreements."
"In fact, in this case, in the Gabon agreement, the fisheries sector is going to pay almost 20% more than the European Union pays from the Community budget."
"That should reassure those who say that the fisheries sector does not contribute to the funding of the agreements."
"Finally, Mr President, I would also like to put a request to the Commission relating to the agreements that we in the Committee on Fisheries have been making repeatedly: that, in the name of greater transparency, Members of this Parliament should be able to participate as observers in the joint committees that control the implementation of fisheries agreements."
"We have already achieved that for the regional fisheries organisations and it would be good if we could take part in the joint committees in the future."
"We put this request the other day to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and I hope that Commissioner Figel' will communicate this request to the European Commission, so that, amongst the three institutions, we can obtain greater participation by Members of this Parliament."
"If only because of the time of night we have to work, I believe that we deserve to be in those committees as observers."
"Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez, I agree with your assessment and I shall pass on to the Bureau your concerns about discrimination regarding the topics for debate."
"Perhaps a rota system would be fairer."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"Mainstreaming sustainability in development cooperation policies (debate)"
"The next item is the report by DanutBudreikaitÄ, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on mainstreaming sustainability in development cooperation policies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all who have found the time at this late hour to discuss here in the plenary session the important question of integrating sustainability into development cooperation policy."
"The most important EU documents - the European Community Treaty and the EU Sustainable Development Strategy - define sustainable development as development which allows the present needs of society to be satisfied without reducing the chances of future generations to meet their needs."
"Sustainable development is an all-embracing EU rights principle which should have an influence on all spheres of EU policy, including the development cooperation policy."
"One of the most important aims of our community is to fight poverty in the world, to pay back some old debts to developing countries, to help them climb out of the status of least-developed nations and to reach the status of developing nations, and ultimately - the level of developed nations."
"Developed nations know what the cost of progress and modern life is."
"I have in mind the environmental impact of human activity - the development of various fields of economy, especially industry."
"It is a huge cost that is being borne by the whole world, even though not all countries have or use the technology that contributes to the greenhouse effect, CO2 or other pollution."
"We are all paying, and we all would like to see the amount of pollution reduced."
"We direct our attention not only to our own economies, adopting appropriate solutions, but we also want developing countries to use non-polluting renewable types of energy and non-polluting technology."
"However, this is not so simple."
"The report raised some of the problems of sustainable development and offered some directions for possible solutions for developing countries - and not only for them, but also for the EU itself."
"Sustainable development comprises three fundamental aspects: stable economic growth, protection of the environment, and social justice and cohesion."
"This means that economic issues, environmental protection issues and social issues are interrelated and reinforce each other, and their interconnection should already be in evidence at the policy formation stage."
"Economic issues are linked with management, human rights, democracy, regional integration and other aspects of economics and life."
"The financial support of the EU and other countries is necessary for their solution, as are the strengthening of developing countries' institutional competence, the fight against corruption, new methods of helping businesses and markets to implement sustainable development, the attraction of direct foreign investment, and so on."
"The environment is affected by unlawful destruction of forests, which encourages corruption and the possibility of armed conflicts; lack of access to potable water and shortcomings in sanitary conditions; pollution, especially the greenhouse effect; and the use and depletion of natural resources, which are also precursors to conflict situations."
"In the social sphere environmental issues are also important, such as access to potable water and sanitary conditions, access to education and health care systems, and the fight against poverty."
"In implementing three fundamental aspects of sustainable development, it is evident that the stimulation of economic growth and the elimination of poverty, together with ensuring the protection of the environment, are the greatest challenges to the EU development cooperation policy."
"Therefore, in this policy the EU must also encourage other large economic actors, such as the United States, China and India, to contribute to the implementation of global sustainable development."
"When stimulating economic growth, it is essential to implement sustainable development in all sectors, to invest in non-polluting technologies, to introduce alternative energy technologies, and, most importantly, to apply entrepreneurial behaviour standards."
"Talking about the environment, it is important to highlight that international corporations operating in developing countries must respect the environment."
"A start should be made to implement a code of corporate social responsibility for European firms."
"Seeking to fight the deterioration of environmental protection in developing countries, the EU should cooperate more actively with small and medium-sized firms to shape their respect for the environment."
"The protection of biological diversity, monitoring of the ecological state of the environment and the appropriate measures to support it are our collective debt to coming generations."
"In the social sphere we must try to achieve the defined millennial development goals, to encourage a sustainable consumption model, to combat diseases, and to direct more official development aid to education about health and environmental issues."
"In addition, it is essential to involve the civil society, NGOs and women in finding solutions for the problems of sustainable development, and in invigorating social dialogue."
"As well as these three fields of sustainable development, I would also like to mention the strengthening of institutional competence as a priority side issue for all sectors."
"In assisting institutional, administrative and legal reforms, expansion of infrastructure systems and national financial management, the environmental, economic and social impact needs to be evaluated."
"These are long-term action programmes to achieve sustainability in development cooperation policy."
"Already, however, the EU can take action to achieve sustainability, to solve the agricultural export subsidy issue, and to encourage the importation of products that have been produced with respect for sustainability and without contravening international agreements, invoking a migration policy to stop the brain drain from developing countries, as well as stimulating investment in developing countries, and faithfully applying 0.7% of GDP to development assistance."
"Mr President, I shall aim to comply with my allotted speaking time so that we can finish before midnight!"
"Of course we welcome this report which is so focused on mainstreaming sustainability in development cooperation policies."
"I am pleased to know that this report is well in tune with our own analysis of this subject."
"The Commission is fully committed to improving the mainstreaming of sustainability in our development cooperation."
"The overarching objective of this cooperation is the eradication of poverty in the context of sustainable development."
"We are working in the direction of most of the recommendations which are made in the report, and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs BudreikaitÄ."
"I shall illustrate this only with a few examples."
"Firstly, we are improving the mainstreaming of environmental concerns in development policies in a variety of ways, for example by staff training, by setting up an environmental helpdesk, by systematic preparation of country and regional environmental profiles and, whenever relevant, strategic environmental assessments and environmental impact assessments."
"Secondly, we are stepping up assistance to developing countries to adapt to climate change."
"We are working to enhance our alliance-building with the developing countries in the area of climate change adaptation and mitigation."
"Because the most immediate effect of climate change on developing countries is the incidence of extreme weather phenomena, we are also preparing a new disaster risk reduction strategy."
"Thirdly, we are promoting clean and renewable energy through specific projects."
"Another new initiative that has been well received by the international community is the global energy efficiency and renewable energy fund."
"Fourthly, we are working hard towards preventing the import of illegally sourced wood via the negotiation of voluntary partnership agreements under the forest law enforcement governance and trade initiative."
"Negotiations have recently started with Malaysia, Ghana and Indonesia."
"Lastly, we are programming resources for building capacity in developing countries to prevent illegal dumping of toxic waste and to clean stocks of solid pesticides."
"The efforts needed to deal with these objectives and with others also raised in the report certainly remain considerable."
"The European Parliament's support in relation to the development cooperation instrument and the environment and natural resources climatic strategy will be critical, and from this point of view I want to express gratitude for your engagement and support."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can do no other than extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs BudreikaitÄ, for a successful job of work, and for a very balanced report that does not give rise to contention."
"The report contains the core of what the Committee on Development wanted to say about, firstly, the challenges presented by climate change; secondly, the protection of biodiversity; thirdly the discharge of the least developed countries from their debts; fourthly the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises for the sake of improved social, environmental and economic cooperation in the countries of the South, and, fifthly, more foreign direct investment and greater diversification in exports."
"The report calls on the Commission to base all the Community's development programmes on transparency and accountability, since corruption damages sustainability in the developing countries, and this House therefore advocates the introduction of independent offices to combat it, together with an adequate allocation of funds to them, and I can do no other than ask all Members of this House to endorse this report when we come to vote on it."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I, too, should like to join in congratulating the rapporteur."
"The idea prevailed for a long time that protection of the environment and sustainable development were luxury items that could not be discussed, let alone achieved, until a society had developed to a certain level."
"Sustainable development has since then become one of the millennium development goals, since the effects of poor environmental conditions impact poorer people far more directly."
"Their living conditions are largely dependent on access to natural resources - for example, 90% of people living in absolute poverty are dependent on woods for a living."
"It is also the case that the developing countries are harder hit by the consequences of climate change than the industrial nations that are largely responsible for it, and so the Commission's proposal for a Europe-wide reduction in CO2 emissions from new cars by 2012 is to be welcomed."
"In this report, we are again calling on the United States, but also on India and China, to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and to join with the European Union in taking responsibility for sustainable development worldwide."
"While the building of infrastructure can be an important factor in sustainable development, it is also important that social and environmental considerations be borne in mind, and so we urge the Commission to have an environmental impact assessment carried out on every project receiving financial support from the EU and made available to the public."
"We are again and again shocked by reports of the inhuman conditions under which people in developing countries have to work, and the code of practice for European businesses operating in such countries really must be made more effective."
"We must also play our part in ensuring that the International Labour Organisation's core labour standards are applied."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 09.05)"
"Documents received: see Minutes"
"The European private company statute (debate)"
"The first item is the report by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on the European private company statute."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel particularly honoured to be able to see this topic discussed today, when you, Madam President, are chairing a sitting of this House for the first time."
"The action plan on company law already envisaged examination of which additional forms of company might be considered as subjects for legislation within the European Union."
"As a result of the studies carried out at that time, these questions were, in essence, left open."
"Now, the Commission, a number of years ago, invited discussion of the company law action plan and subjected it to a wholesale revision."
"This House made a full contribution to this debate, and, following on from it, decided to produce and discuss an own-initiative report on the European private company."
"Such is the background to this item on today's agenda."
"We have considered this question carefully and organised in this House a hearing on the subject, which drove home the fact that there is a real need for that sort of European private company and for the Commission to initiate legislation to create it."
"Smaller industrial companies in particular - export-driven businesses that are at present obliged to set up subsidiaries and companies in other Member States and in accordance with those states' laws on companies - would welcome with great enthusiasm the creation of a European legal form whereby they could organise their subsidiaries throughout the European Union."
"At present, they are in serious need of advice, which may well be good for the lawyers, but it does cost a lot of money, since there has to be, again and again, examination of individual cases to ascertain what rights and duties their directors and members of their supervisory boards actually have and what they have to do in order not to end up at odds with the law."
"I think they will be able to avoid that if they can be offered a single European legal form that regulates a number of core matters, in particular directors' powers and questions of liability, in one way at the European level and thus offers something to businesses."
"There is, then, absolutely no question of additional bureaucracy, for companies can decide for themselves whether they want this legal form or not; it is simply something of which they can avail themselves, something that plugs a real hole in the law left over after we created the European Limited Company for bigger firms."
"Let me also say, by way of an aside, that the insufficient progress made in the past in the development of European company law is one explanation for the European Court of Justice's rulings in such cases as Inspire Art, and this is where we can help to provide and create an exemplary structure in the European Union."
"I believe that the Committee on Legal Affairs - which adopted this report by a large majority, or, indeed unanimously - has succeeded in finding a suitable compromise between the different approaches to the structure of such companies found in continental Europe on the one hand and in British legal thinking on the other, especially on the issue of equity, where we achieved a good compromise on the basis that equity ought, as a matter of principle, to exist, but without the obligation to make cash payments, which, as a means whereby registration may be made easier, is, in my view, a step in the right direction and also shows how it is possible for the Commission to submit a proposal with the Council then being able to find a rational compromise between the various legal traditions."
"What we in the Committee on Legal Affairs - and I think, after today's vote, this House too - expect of the Commission is that it should, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty, with our Rules of Procedure, and with the interinstitutional agreement, stir itself into action and, within the foreseeable future, take definite steps to put a definite proposal for legislation before this House and the Council."
"As I draw to a close, I would like to mention another consideration that has had some input into the amendments, that being the debate on workers' participation in decision-making."
"Let me make perfectly plain something that was not a bone of contention in our deliberations, namely that nobody is seeking to restrict workers' rights in any way whatever."
"In so far as they are guaranteed at the national level, they are also to be guaranteed and maintained when this legislative project is put into effect."
"This is something on which there have been a number of amendments, which I do not regard as crucial, for they all have the same end in mind, that of protecting workers' rights."
"One final comment - and yes, I do mean final, for I will then have used up my five minutes: I note with pleasure that the German Presidency of the Council has declared the European Private Company to be one of its priorities, and so I assume that the Council, too, will be as supportive of this as - I hope - an overwhelming majority in this House is about to be."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, firstly I would like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, for the excellent work done in the preparation of the report on the European private company statute on which you will vote today."
"My departments are already studying in detail the suggestions and recommendations proposed in this report."
"We need to make it easier and cheaper for small and medium-sized companies to conduct cross-border business."
"It is important to take action that will help small and medium firms to reap fully the benefits of the single market."
"The growth of small businesses is crucial for the competitiveness of the European economy."
"One means of facilitating the expansion of small businesses is to simplify the current legal framework and reduce unnecessary administrative burdens."
"These burdens are particularly onerous for SMEs that do not have big legal departments at their disposal."
"That is why I have decided to present a communication on the simplification of EU company law in the spring of this year."
"This fits in with the broader programme of the Commission on simplification of the acquis communautaire which provides for a 25% reduction in administrative burdens by 2012."
"I am all for initiatives that will give European firms, and in particular small and medium companies, a flexible regulatory framework."
"The European private company statute could be a useful option for them in this respect."
"The idea was supported by industry in the recent public consultation on future priorities for the action plan on company law and corporate governance."
"Many respondents stressed that such an option would create more choice for companies and reduce compliance costs for firms which wish to operate in several Member States."
"However, a number of our respondents also questioned the usefulness of such a measure and, as you know, in accordance with better regulation principles the Commission must carry out an impact assessment before any initiative is proposed."
"Accordingly, my departments are now examining the costs and benefits of such a statute, as well as alternative measures to address the problems at stake."
"I would only propose a European private company statute if the impact assessment clearly shows that this is the most appropriate instrument to tackle the problems SMEs face today and that the European private company form would be useful to them in expanding their activities and developing their businesses across borders."
"Experience with the European company statute has shown that creating a new European corporate form can be a very long and complex process."
"The end result may be legal instruments that are not always easy to use."
"If a European private company statute is to be worthwhile, then agreement would need to be found swiftly."
"The end result would have to be simple for SMEs to use, thereby bringing real added value."
"I note that your report and associated resolution are based on Article 192 of the Treaty calling on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal."
"Under the framework agreement, the Commission undertook to take account of any such request made pursuant to Article 192 of the Treaty."
"I intend to live up to these commitments."
"We will assess the practical suggestions set out in the report in detail."
"I want my departments to take the time necessary to consider carefully all possible options in order to provide the best balanced solution for SMEs."
"Upon conclusion of the impact assessment, I will report back to you on its results and the policy conclusions we draw from it."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I, too, as a former fellow-member of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, wish you every success in the exercise of your functions."
"If every President were to keep the Chamber as quiet as you have done this morning, our deliberations would indeed be much more constructive, and so I can only ask you to carry on the way you have begun."
"I can tell the Commissioner that small and medium-sized enterprises are the driving force behind the European internal market."
"That may well be reiterated time and time again, but the progress towards the achievement of this goal is often too slow."
"I, too, therefore, am among those who believe that the creation of a European legal framework with the interests of the self-employed and smaller businesses particularly in mind is an extremely important matter, not least for the Committee on the Internal Market."
"Mr Lehne's own-initiative report is much to be welcomed, not least on the grounds that it sends an important signal to the Commission - and, let me add, to the Presidency of the Council too - and I would like to thank him for the splendid work he has done in this regard."
"It is cause for thanksgiving that many small and medium-sized businesses already work across borders, and you, Commissioner, were able to see that for yourself when you visited Offenburg, my own electoral district."
"In many instances, though, their dedication and growth are hampered by bureaucratic restrictions and the lack of experience of the local legal situation, and small and medium-sized enterprises from the new Member States have hitherto been put at a considerable competitive disadvantage by this."
"Offering in future a European legal form in parallel with the legal forms of the nation states therefore not only serves to further the completion of the European internal market, but also makes it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to set up subsidiaries in European countries other than their own, and hence to develop their activities beyond their own country's borders."
"What is of the essence in this is that the consultancy and administrative costs involved in setting up and running a company can be reduced to a considerable degree and that cross-border business activity no longer involves the laws of more than one Member State being applicable."
"A survey conducted by the German International Chamber of Commerce - I can refer only to German businesses - showed that enterprises were very keen that there should be a European legal form that met the needs of small and medium-sized businesses, and the businesses that responded said that they saw this as being a 'little sister' to the European Limited Company and believed that it needed to be slimline, practicable and - above all else - European."
"I can therefore tell the Commissioner that what this House is saying by means of this report is that it wants to see the Commission presenting a legislative proposal on the basis of Article 308 before this year is out."
"We are of course pleased to hear you advocating the impact assessment, but we have also seen, from the example of other directives relating to the internal market and consumer protection, that, where the political will is present, an impact assessment can either be carried out briskly or limited to specific individual questions, and so I would ask you to move the impact assessment forward with some speed in order to arrive at a legislative proposal as soon as possible."
"I would also ask the German Presidency of the Council to process this dossier as soon as possible and with vigour."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I believe that this is the first time that I have had the opportunity to speak while you are presiding over the sitting and I would like to congratulate you on your appointment."
"I am sure that you will do your duties in your characteristically independent manner."
"Secondly, I would like to thank Mr Lehne for his report."
"I believe that he has done a good job, but I would like to point out a couple of problems that we have."
"Firstly, I do not believe the Committee on Legal Affairs' current approach of presenting reports on an issue of legislative initiative with an annex which has not been sufficiently discussed to be the appropriate legislative technique."
"We are talking about an initial phase of legislative proposals."
"What we are doing is asking the Commission to look into the possibility of presenting a report, and I believe that at this stage we should restrict ourselves to the first part of the resolution."
"I do not believe that the annex to the motion for a resolution has been sufficiently debated."
"We cannot therefore take the view that these conclusions of the annex genuinely reflect the will of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"Secondly, I believe that Mr McCreevy was absolutely right to point out that we should not be legislating for the sake of legislating - our failure in relation to the European Company should give us cause for concern in this regard - and the impact study is therefore clearly necessary."
"Furthermore, it is clear that we in this House believe that it is necessary to draw up a statute to enable small businesses to operate and that we should work towards achieving that."
"In doing so, we are faced with certain difficulties: for example, the problem of worker participation."
"We have held discussions on the text of recital H. In my political group, there have been certain reservations about the way Mr Lehne had worded it."
"I believe that the final formula proposed by Mr Lehne is satisfactory and I hope that we in my group can approve it."
"In short, I believe that Mr Lehne's proposal is a good one."
"We are not demanding that the Commission accept it, but we are asking it to look into this possibility."
"I hope that Mr McCreevy will do everything he can to ensure that this Parliament's will in this regard is implemented."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, first let me also extend my congratulations to you on your appointment and the conduct of your first debate."
"I must also start with an apology to the rapporteur because, although I attended the hearing on this subject, I was unable to participate in the debate in committee and I know it is a bit irritating when somebody then pops up in Plenary."
"I broadly welcome the underlying idea in the proposal, but I have some concerns that I hope the Commission will investigate further during future work on this matter."
"Mr Lehne, you have said in your explanatory note to the report - and indeed the Commissioner has also said just now, and I agree - that the statute will need to focus on the needs of SMEs."
"But that of course covers just about all companies except multinationals."
"To me it is clear that if we follow all of the recommendations in the annex, those that are likely to benefit or choose this option are towards the medium rather than the small end of the spectrum of companies."
"They certainly would not be start-up companies."
"The suggested capital requirements ensure that is the case."
"I do not want people to say 'here you are standing there as a Brit not wanting any capital requirement'."
"I recognise that the capital does not necessarily have to be paid in and I welcome attempts to find a compromise on that, but it will still have an impact, especially on small businesses."
"Smaller businesses, whether at the start-up or whether trying to expand, have enough cost and difficulty trying to give belt-and-braces guarantees to banks without there being an added tier of financial expectation."
"And, make no mistake, the fact that shareholders could potentially lose EUR 10 000, even if not paid in at the start, does add an extra tier of financial expectation."
"Now, that may not matter at all since it is optional, and if you do not like the statute, you do not have to use it, but I would prefer that if you propose something, it would be liked and used and accessible to all companies."
"While I have said that there may be little incentive in some quarters to choose this, that does not mean it is because small companies do not conduct cross-border business or do not aspire to do so."
"Many quite small companies do engage in significant cross-border business and European Court of Justice decisions make it clear that they can do so."
"But, as it is optional, maybe that is no matter."
"Or is that really the case?"
"I would not like to see the situation where the new statute introduced a factor of discrimination where consumers were concerned that if you were not big enough to consider it worth being a European private company, you are not big enough to do business in Europe."
"That would run completely counter to the notion of a single market and the mutual importance of fostering and nurturing small businesses within that market."
"In a single market, size must not matter."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, I fully support the view that the European Private Company Statute should be based on Community legislation and dispense with references to national law."
"The aim is to create a new legal form for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the driving force behind all European economies."
"A new legal form will help to foster cross-border activity too."
"We must also keep in mind joint activities when it comes to promoting the development of the internal market, and consequently economic growth."
"If a single European legal form is created, consultancy costs will be cut."
"In the many countries involved, the law will no longer apply to cross-border activities."
"Instead, we shall have a single, uniform statute."
"For this type of company to be competitive on the market, it must be flexible and able to adjust to market requirements."
"This could be achieved by endowing such a company with a wide range of possibilities for transforming itself."
"In this context, the issue of legal harmonisation arises, for instance, with regard to the cross-border transfer of registered offices."
"For an undertaking of this nature to be able to operate with maximum efficiency on the market, however, it must focus primarily on the security of business transactions and on protecting the company's creditors."
"We still need to give further consideration to these issues."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, I find this absolutely fascinating!"
"Every time I come here I have to smile."
"What this place knows about running small businesses is absolutely unbelievable."
"When I look up the CVs of Members of this Parliament, I find that nobody has ever had any serious responsibility for a small company in their lives."
"It is amazing what we all know about these things!"
"In 1992 I started a small business."
"I thought about it and I bought some old-fashioned, second-hand furniture."
"I sucked my pencil and thought, 'My goodness me, what have I done?"
"I have left a big corporation, where do I go from here?'."
"That business now has branches in Hong Kong, Jersey, the Channel Islands and South Africa, as well as London and York, which is my constituency."
"I really do not think I could do that again."
"There are so many regulations, it is unbelievable."
"If you really want to fire up small business in the European Union, and particularly the United Kingdom, I would suggest that these people here and the Commission get their blasted noses out of everybody else's business and stop trying to tell us how we should run our businesses!"
"Just let us get on with it, because if you do not, more and more businesses are going to go to Dubai, Bermuda and the Channel Islands - I am moving half my business to the Channel Islands as it is."
"I would counsel you and the Commission to please keep your ill-informed noses out of small businesses!"
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - Madam President, this report is a contradiction in terms."
"Governments cannot micro-manage enterprise."
"Since when has the European Union initiated anything that improves trade, minimises costs, cuts red tape, generates new wealth, creates new jobs, frees up enterprise?"
"When ever?"
"Most governments can hope to contribute to economic growth only by clearing the decks of obstacles and creating an enterprise-free environment."
"Government ought to be about enabling people and their initiative to thrive."
"After that it should stand well back."
"The UK has a huge, permanent and growing deficit with the EU."
"Does anyone here seriously imagine that by seizing control over company law relating to SMEs, the European Union will change or improve that situation?"
"Do you really imagine that possible, especially as these proposals are based on German and French ideas of a social market?"
"I endorse what Mr Bloom has just said."
"How many of you here have ever started a new business at your own risk?"
"Created jobs?"
"Funded it for yourselves and successfully run it for, let us say, 20 years?"
"How many of you have done that?"
"How many people on that committee have done that?"
"How many of you know what it takes to start a new business in the UK?"
"Well, I will tell you."
"Less than a hundred pounds, ten minutes on the phone and you can do business anywhere."
"Compare that with these proposals."
"We have centuries of company law in the UK, thank you very much. And it works just fine."
"We also have SMEs trading all over the world and they do just fine."
"Most of their nightmares come from past misguided attempts by the EU to 'help' with trade on the Continent."
"Most of that 'help' merely interferes with their activities, and the idea of yet more 'help' will be greeted with horror."
"Over the years we have seen masterpieces of unintended consequences from this place."
"There is the Working Time Directive, which finally proved to a business friend of mine that the EU was clinically insane."
"There is the drive for a level playing field, the very antithesis of wealth and job creation, which totally depends on finding differences. And now we have got the licensing of authorised economic operators, which hugely benefits those who qualify and undermines everyone else with extra costs and bureaucracy."
"Even the Socialist British Government has figured out that this proposal is expensive and dangerous nonsense and it belongs in the bin."
"(PL) Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for a very sound and detailed report."
"In my view, it sends out an important message to small and medium-sized enterprises, indicating that their development and activity on the common European market will soon become much more straightforward."
"It also sends out a further message to SMEs, namely that European legislators recognise the role of SMEs on the Union's market and are making an effort to improve their situation."
"The main aim of our activities relating to the common market should be to create an optimum situation whereby European enterprises are not hindered by unnecessary red tape or commercial and technical obstacles when they move from one country to another, or set up branches in various Union countries."
"It should be just as easy as if they were moving from one part of their own country to another."
"All companies should be able to operate on the same principles across the length and breadth of the Union."
"Only then will it really be possible to speak of a common European market with benefits for all."
"Mr Lehne's report is a further step in developing legislation designed to enhance the efficiency of the SME sector's activities on the common market."
"Its implications will certainly significantly contribute to increasing the economic activity of European companies, and consequently to improving all our lives and meeting one of the aims of the Lisbon Agenda."
"I was actually a businesswoman myself in the past."
"I ran my own business for 15 years, and employed some 100 people."
"I am well aware of the problems entrepreneurs face and am convinced that the proposal to develop a European Private Company Statute represents an excellent and much-needed solution for undertakings conducting cross-border business."
"It is important, however, to proceed with caution and learn from the mistakes made when developing the European Company Statute."
"Companies of that type do not fully fulfil their role as European Companies because of the large number of references to national law."
"That is why the European Private Company Statute must be based mainly on Community law, with minimum reference to national law."
"Such an approach will result in a more uniform text and legal provisions."
"In addition, it will provide legal certainty, which is crucial to entrepreneurs."
"We must make every effort to ensure that the Statute is as uniform as possible, and that it makes minimal reference to individual legal systems whilst referring to Community law as much as possible."
"(PL) Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Lehne, the rapporteur, for all the work he has undertaken on a matter which is of such vital importance to the future of European integration and the development of economic cooperation within the framework of the internal market."
"The current situation regarding the internal market is that we already have a European Company."
"It is intended for large capital-based companies."
"A legal form which will also make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to conduct cross-border business is therefore essential."
"It is important to bear in mind that SMEs are the main driving force behind the European economy and the main source of employment for Union citizens."
"That is why further efforts should be made to enhance the economic activities undertaken by these companies."
"However, the new legal solutions we are proposing to our entrepreneurs do call for detailed consideration."
"We should learn from the experience gained when introducing the legal form for the European Company on to the common market."
"That statute took a long time to draw up and was the result of a compromise."
"In fact, the final compromise has not proved entirely satisfactory."
"We should therefore learn from our mistakes, as Mrs Handzlik suggested earlier."
"As far as is possible, the European Private Company Statute should be a uniform European legal form."
"It must provide for the simplification of the principles of establishment and organisation."
"It will be important to retain a balance between protecting creditors, a flexible company structure, and ensuring the security of business transactions."
"In the interests of protecting the flexibility of such undertakings, provision must be made for ensuring ease of transformations such as mergers or changing the registered office."
"Therefore, there is every justification for the European Parliament's initiative containing recommendations to the Commission on the European Private Company Statute."
"(PL) Madam President, there are several reasons why the development of a European Private Company Statute is such a crucial project for accelerating the economic growth of the European Union."
"Firstly, measured in terms of GDP growth, the rate of economic growth of the United States is more than twice that of the European Union."
"This has been the case for many years."
"In addition, the rate of economic growth of the countries of South-East Asia is several times higher than that of the Union."
"Secondly, many internal barriers still persist within the common market created by the free movement of capital, goods and services."
"Thirdly, the draft European Private Company Statute is aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the cornerstone of the economies of all the Member States of the European Union."
"Fourthly, a European Private Company would be a very useful instrument for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, which places great emphasis on eliminating obstacles to the development of European entrepreneurship."
"These reasons alone justify supporting the development of a European Private Company Statute."
"It is important, however, not to repeat the mistakes made when drawing up the European Company Statute."
"The market has refused to accept the European Company as a company form, despite the long and difficult process involved in developing this statute."
"An effort must therefore be made to ensure that the European Private Company Statute contains the minimum number of references to the national legislation of individual Member States, so that it is relatively flexible in nature and provides security for both owners and contractors."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this legislative proposal on the European private company statute is very important."
"It is, in fact, crucial not only to remove barriers to trade but also to develop the factor of production at Community level."
"To that end, there is undoubtedly a need to create unitary legal entities in order to overcome the current legal uncertainty."
"It should not be forgotten, however, that, as well as trying to make markets transparent and to protect savers, the company law reform will also directly affect the future of the European social model."
"Therefore, if allowing companies to move wherever they like in order to take advantage of the single market is a legitimate aim, it must be fulfilled by giving our workers the same transnational rights."
"That was the thinking behind some of my amendments, certain of which were accepted, which were aimed at safeguarding the rights to codetermination, information and consultation that exist at the time of a company's turning into a European private company."
"We are talking here about an important adjustment that will mean more careful attention being paid to aspects relating to the strengthening of social Europe, one of the fundamental elements of which must be worker participation."
"We therefore endorse this important proposal and we thank Mr Lehne for his work."
"We would point out to the Commission that, if allowing companies to move wherever they like in order to take advantage of the single market is a legitimate aim, it must be fulfilled without the demands of the market prejudicing those of social equality."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the Members very much for their comments on this important topic."
"The growth of small and medium-sized enterprises is crucial for the competitiveness of the European economy."
"It is, therefore, necessary to facilitate the expansion of these small businesses."
"Looking at the legal form of companies that operate across borders can make an important contribution to this."
"I will take Mr Lehne's report into account."
"As it is under Article 192 of the Treaty, we are bound to do it in a prompt manner."
"But even if it was not under that article, I will still deal with it in as prompt a manner as possible."
"I give you that commitment."
"Commissioner, I should like to thank you for your participation in the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 today."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"(FR) The creation of the European private company statute has the support of both the Member States and industry, and I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report and his pragmatic recommendations."
"I am very much in favour of the creation of this statute for at least two reasons."
"Firstly, because the adoption of this statute will help remove one of the obstacles to SMEs' mobility."
"All too often, company founders are reluctant to do business because they do not understand the legal environment very well, particularly when they establish themselves in another Member State."
"Next, this statute will enable us significantly to enhance legal transparency and thus to build confidence among the various economic players."
"The fact is that confidence is crucial in trade relations and forms the basis for a prosperous economy."
"I am therefore in favour of Mr Lehne's report, with one exception: its recommendation 7."
"Including legally reprehensible behaviour in the private company statute would mean amending Title VI of the Treaty and unnecessarily complicating the link between the statute and our national laws."
"I therefore feel that this provision runs counter to the objectives of the European private company statute: to produce better legislation and to make European entrepreneurs' lives easier."
"Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) (debate)"
"The next item is oral question to the Commission on the renegotiation of the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) by Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade - B6-0450/2006)."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are putting this oral question on the renegotiation of the Government Procurement Agreement, which will end in March, because we are at a crucial moment."
"Furthermore, in view of the importance of that agreement and its period in force, which will once again be ten or twelve years, it became necessary to raise the issue with the Commission here in Parliament."
"The government procurement markets are becoming increasingly important in the world, in view of their volume, which may be up to 25% of world GDP and, furthermore, because they represent a comparative advantage for the European Union, since at the moment we can be competitive in this sector compared to the competition that we are facing from other countries in other sectors, such as agriculture and industry."
"If we want to adapt to globalisation, therefore, it is important that the European Union develop the sectors in which it can be competitive internationally and thereby create fair and favourable conditions for European companies."
"In most countries, these markets are reserved for national companies, which is one of the main non-tariff barriers to international trade."
"There are two aspects in this renegotiation that I would stress in particular."
"Firstly, the geographical extension of this agreement, with the entry of significant players, such as China and the developing countries, and, secondly, the need to ensure fair, balanced and reciprocal conditions for the companies of the different countries."
"With regard to the first point, the greater the geographical area covered by this agreement on government procurement the more valid it is."
"Parliament therefore wishes to know whether any new countries are interested in signing up to the agreement in the short term, and particularly whether we can expect substantial commitments from China in relation to the opening up of its public markets."
"Let us not forget that China committed itself to opening up its government procurement market - which largely remains closed, or has requirements that are unacceptable to European companies - and to beginning negotiations in 2008 on accession to the Government Procurement Agreement, following its accession to the World Trade Organisation."
"Secondly, with regard to fair and reciprocal conditions, we must remember that the European Union's public markets are already very much opened up to international competition."
"This has considerable advantages for the public bodies awarding contracts, since this openness gives them greater choice and therefore makes it possible for them to find better quality goods and services at lower cost."
"Let us not forget, however, that this may harm European companies in cases where foreign competitors are preferred."
"The Union's trade policy is geared towards greater opening up of all aspects of the international markets."
"The solution is not therefore to close the public markets to foreign companies."
"For this reason, we have the legitimate right to demand that our companies enjoy similar conditions of access to the public markets of our main trading partners, whose companies currently enjoy access to our public markets."
"That is not currently the case, however, since the commitments made by our trading partners are very limited compared to those made by the European Union."
"Commissioner Mandelson also referred to this imbalance in his communication on a competitive Europe in a globalised economy."
"In it, he suggests the possibility of introducing concrete restrictions to access to certain sections of the Union's public markets, with the aim of persuading our trading partners to open up their markets in a reciprocal manner."
"Having said all of that, I consider this oral question on behalf of the Committee on International Trade to the European Commission, calling upon it to explain its strategy in this renegotiation of the agreement, to be timely - and hence more than appropriate. I would repeat that we are at a crucial time, since we need to reach an agreement over the coming weeks."
"How is the Commission going to defend the interests of European companies in the markets of sectors in which we are highly competitive, such as transport, energy and public works, within the context of the objective of continuing along the path towards greater commercial openness, and not the reverse?"
"Within this context, how are we going to deal with the situation of European SMEs, which are already at a disadvantage compared to large companies, compared to the situation of other SMEs in other countries whose governments reserve a proportion of their public contracts for them, as in the case of the United States?"
"In view of the lack of reciprocal arrangements, the disadvantages faced by European SMEs and their importance in terms of the main objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, we would call upon the Commission to demand that the other parties in the negotiation remove their exceptions or, if that is not possible, to accept our application of an exception of this same kind in favour of European SMEs."
"In any event, we need that kind of reciprocal arrangement since European companies are currently at a disadvantage."
"I would therefore ask the Commission to tell us how the negotiations are progressing, particularly with regard to the issues that I have raised and those referred to in the text of our question."
"I would also ask the Commission to take note of the concerns expressed by the European Parliament and to take them into account in its negotiations in Geneva."
"Madam President, the issue of the renegotiation of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, known as the GPA, is important for Europe as it should provide our companies with future opportunities outside the Community."
"Last December, after many years of long and difficult negotiations, the GPA parties reached a provisional understanding on a new revised text."
"I consider this to be a major achievement in the current context of the Doha Round."
"It demonstrates that the political will to reach an understanding on sensitive issues remains alive."
"The new text provides for more clarity and transparency, as well as better guarantees for equal treatment in the procurement procedures."
"It includes, for the first time, provisions for conducting electronic procurement."
"The European Community played an important role during the negotiations."
"The existing agreement is unbalanced, both in terms of procedural guarantees and coverage."
"Our main objectives were to fill the gaps and to eliminate ambiguities."
"We wanted to obtain better legal guarantees for our suppliers, similar to those offered by our internal regime."
"At the same time we sought to make the new agreement more attractive for developing countries via new specific measures."
"The final agreement on the new text is subject to a satisfactory outcome of the market access negotiations which are ongoing."
"Here as well, we need to rebalance the situation in favour of the Community."
"Hence the coverage our partners currently offer should be extended to the level the Community has offered and it should be more uniform."
"We all want to see improved access for our companies to foreign countries' procurement markets."
"The Council emphasised in its recent conclusions on the Commission's communication 'Global Europe - Competing in the World' that we need to achieve additional improvements in market access with our future major trading partners, namely in public procurement."
"The Community has submitted a comprehensive request and offer which will give the other GPA parties all the necessary incentives to offer significant additional procurement opportunities."
"Should we fail to get a substantial improvement from other GPA parties, we will consider taking the necessary measures to adapt the Community commitments in the new GPA accordingly."
"In the absence of improved access for the EU to third-country procurement markets, Commissioner Mandelson and I are reflecting on a market-opening instrument to enhance EU access."
"The case of our SMEs certainly deserves particular attention."
"It will specifically benefit from the new text, with the introduction of rules on electronic procurement and, if negotiations are completed successfully, the lowering of thresholds of some parties."
"However, let me remind you that the agreement deals with rather large procurement contracts which are mainly undertaken by big companies."
"SMEs certainly have an important role to play, but mostly as subcontractors."
"This is why we have asked our GPA partners who currently maintain specific derogations for their domestic SMEs to abandon them."
"On the prospects of extending the geographical scope of the agreement, eight WTO members are in the process of acceding to it."
"Among those, Jordan is the most advanced."
"China has indicated that it will start accession negotiations by December this year and, following my visit there last year, we are already preparing this important accession."
"As already mentioned, the Community has pushed for better provisions on the special and differential treatment for developing countries."
"I believe we have achieved a good result with tailor-made new rules that fully take their specific needs into account."
"I am confident that if we succeed, this new agreement will constitute a milestone for international trade and create new opportunities for our companies."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall start by congratulating my esteemed colleague, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, and by thanking him for having asked, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, this oral question on the negotiations under way at the World Trade Organisation regarding the rules on access to public contracts."
"We need derogations for small and medium-sized enterprises, Commissioner."
"The subject bringing us together today is a crucial issue as far as growth and employment in Europe are concerned."
"The WTO rules on trade in goods and services do not apply to purchases made by a State for its own use, that is to say to public procurement."
"That is why some countries, operating just outside the Marrakech agreements of April 1994, have voluntarily signed a special annex containing an agreement on public procurement."
"With the exception of the European Union, all the major countries participating in this agreement - Canada, Korea, the United States and Japan - have excluded from their offer contracts that they reserve for their SMEs."
"This imbalance is unacceptable, and the public contracts that have thus been excluded are precisely those that concern our small and medium-sized enterprises, while the SMEs from those countries have unrestricted access to all our public contracts."
"Our SMEs are thus under-represented where public procurement is concerned, and we need to launch a broad debate on the reasons for this."
"We need to put right this imbalance by obtaining a derogation on public procurement that favours European SMEs."
"We cannot accept distortions of this kind."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over and above this negotiation, the issue at stake is the will of the European Union to provide small and medium-sized enterprises with the favourable environment that they need and to use access to public procurement as an extraordinary lever for growth and employment; also at stake is the need to provide legal certainty, within the European Union, between the international legal system, European law and national laws."
"We are not talking here about protectionism; quite the contrary, we are talking about increasing the supply by having more businesses to meet the demand."
"Commissioner, there are three areas on the planet today: Asia, excluding Japan, which has poor countries but strong growth; the United States, which is a rich country with strong growth; and Europe, which has rich countries but weak growth."
"We need to reflect."
"When we regulated the internal market by voting for the Services Directive, we built this market on the laws of competition, and the European Union took a great interest in consumers."
"We now need to take an interest in our manufacturers."
"The renegotiation of the multilateral agreement on public procurement that is currently under way at the WTO is, in our view, an extraordinary opportunity to act and to reflect on the place occupied by SMEs in terms of accessing public contracts."
"We need, Commissioner, to give the internal market the gift of a European Small Business Act that includes social market economy considerations."
"The debate is open, and I welcome that."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair."
"What is interesting and fascinating about this debate is that we are talking about a plurilateral agreement that is very specific in character. It is, of course, part of the multilateral framework but, as it is plurilateral in character, it allows much more flexibility for those Member States that are part of this agreement."
"With regard to this, and as it is its tenth anniversary, could the Commissioner tell us a little bit about it: how it worked in the past, whether he is satisfied with it and thinks it is a worthwhile undertaking that is worth renegotiating."
"It is not part of his portfolio, but does he consider that it is also worthwhile renegotiating the telecoms agreement, which is also ten years old this year?"
"With regard to the agreement on government procurement - which Mr Audy mentioned - we are very concerned about SMEs, because we know by experience that they are definitely having much more difficulty in accessing international markets."
"What is the Commission going to do about it beyond what has been done in the past?"
"China is of great concern."
"We are happy to have China as part of the global environment, but it puts a lot of pressure on some companies."
"So once China becomes a member of the plurilateral agreement, what safeguards will the Commissioner put in place to safeguard the interests of European companies and workers?"
"How much is this exercise part of global Europe?"
"How much is it related to the new approach from the Commission agreeing on different bilateral agreements and what will be part of this connection?"
"With regard to services of general interest, how, again, will the Commissioner ensure that European interests will be safeguarded?"
"Can the Commissioner tell us more about that?"
"He has not touched on that."
"Finally, can the Commissioner ensure that Parliament will be kept informed?"
"Can he promise that the Committee on International Trade, which has just elected its new chairman this morning, will also be kept informed?"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, it is entirely appropriate for the House to be dealing with the question of the greater liberalisation of public procurement markets today, and I believe it is regrettable that the same determination was lacking when we debated the liberalisation of services across our continent."
"Essentially, the issues are the same."
"It is right to consider extending the geographical scope of the GPA, and it is unfortunate that we did not seize the opportunity of significantly deepening our services market a few months ago."
"Both cases involve more than just measures to help the operation of the larger European companies."
"There is a particular emphasis on promoting the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I support contract negotiations that will allow us to participate in the Chinese public procurement market, but it is also important to bear in mind the actual opportunities for participation in the European market for the other side, as Mrs Mann just mentioned."
"As far as our Chinese partners are concerned, there are two sides to this coin, and it seems to me that we should also take into account the specific challenges that exist for the European market in this area."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, congratulations!"
"It is very good to see you in the Chair."
"Commissioner McCreevy, I too should like to start off by talking about how best we support small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I am very pleased that there seems to be a concern right across the different political groups of this House."
"I think we all share that."
"I would like to ask first of all for some clarification of remarks made by the French Trade Minister, Christine Lagarde, when she came to Parliament's Committee on International Trade just last week."
"She spoke very passionately and rightly, I believe, about the importance of defending small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe. And yet you, Commissioner, seem to have a very different view of the role of SMEs and how best to support them."
"Guaranteeing better access to public procurement contracts for innovative small and medium-sized enterprises is essential."
"They represent 75 million jobs in the Union and 50% of Community GNI, and they are a vital component of thriving local and regional economies all around the EU."
"But it seems that the Commission is voluntarily giving up the right to support its SMEs."
"There are already five countries- Canada, the US, Israel, Japan and South Korea - that will introduce provisions into their legislation which give privileged access to SMEs for public procurement, and yet the EU, bizarrely, has decided it has no interest in standing up for its own SMEs."
"So Commissioner, can you really justify this position?"
"For the EU to forego the right to a level playing field which would allow SMEs to have an equal opportunity to compete like the large multinationals seems both extraordinary and indeed unacceptable."
"Surely we too should be using the renegotiation of the GPA in Geneva to break down the WTO barriers which prevent Member States from implementing a privileged access measure for SMEs should they so wish."
"We too should be arguing for derogations as part of the revised GPA to allow us to bring in preferential measures, and by doing this we are simply restoring equality of treatment in order to prevent the large multinational corporations from having all of the advantages."
"I very much regret as well that we have not had the opportunity for a prior debate really in Europe about whether it is appropriate to try to extend international trade rules to cover government procurement at all."
"Many would argue that government procurement has little or nothing to do with traditional matters of trade, tariffs and quotas, and that it is an unacceptable area for negotiations at the WTO, because subjecting government procurement at the national, local or regional level to one-size-fits-all rules at a global level on how taxpayers' funds are spent I think destroys citizens' reasonable expectations that they should have a level of democratic accountability over how their money is spent."
"Essentially, taxpayers' money is different from private, corporate money, and citizens rightly expect that they should have the right, for example, to lobby to cut off expenditure on companies that were doing business in South Africa when there was apartheid, or to disqualify companies with bad labour or environmental records."
"I believe we have a really important role to play in defending local sourcing and procurement as a vital instrument of local employment and industrial policy."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President - with my warm congratulations on your election, Commissioner, the Government Procurement Agreement has hitherto applied only to the OECD states, and their expenditure on public contracts in respect of supplies, services and building works make up something between 10% and 25% of their GDP."
"China has now been giving consideration to the possibility of joining them."
"The renewed negotiations currently in progress are, in general, aimed at extending the scope of the Agreement, and that would, of course, give it a vast amount of added significance in terms of the international exchange of goods and services."
"While the Commission must certainly, in the revision process, seek to improve transparency and combat corruption in international public procurement, the urgent environmental challenges mean that ecological sustainability in the public sector must be given high priority, and that, as I understand it, means that regulation is needed to deal with it."
"It must, for example, be lawful and legitimate, when awarding state contracts, for preference to be given to environmentally friendly goods and services, even if they are minimally more expensive."
"One crucial question is how one deals with developing countries."
"It needs to be ensured that public procurement, in the same way as the other Singapore issues, is dealt with absolutely independently of the current Doha development round negotiations, the need for which was expressed very clearly by the developing countries at CancÃºn."
"The document that we are talking about - the one that is due to be renegotiated - can in fact only apply to partners of comparable strength, and so I see something problematic in the idea of non-discrimination or reciprocity, which seem to me once more to tend towards treating highly industrialised countries and developing countries in exactly the same way, which does not work."
"The proposed provisions for developing countries, involving a transitional period of three years - or five for the least developed - are quite utterly inadequate when it comes to persuading them to sign up to the Agreement."
"I think one regrettable consequence of this is that many of these countries will give this Agreement a wide berth, which I, in principle, regard as a disgrace when this is meant to be being handled plurilaterally."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, the debate we are having about this oral question epitomises so much of what is wrong with the European Union."
"Firstly, we have to deal with the WTO through one man who represents no less than 27 nations."
"He has no popular mandate and in the light of his record in British politics would not have been chosen to run a village fÃªte."
"I do not want an EU representative to speak for my country at the WTO."
"I want a representative of Her Majesty's Government who not only knows my country but cares for it too."
"Then there is the whole issue of competitive tendering."
"China was mentioned as a potential provider in the oral question and it may well be highly competitive."
"Whilst I condemn the suppression of individual freedoms and rights in China, the Chinese know a few things about running a successful economy."
"Government spending is only some 20% of GDP, whereas in the eurozone it was 47.5% in 2005."
"In China, business runs with a light regulatory touch."
"In the European Union, we are regulating ourselves to death."
"In 2005 Mr Blair promised that the British Presidency would cut red tape."
"It did nothing of the sort."
"How many thousands of pages did it add to the mountain of legislation?"
"My country was hoodwinked into joining the European Union in 1973 on the basis of it being just a free trade area."
"This is all it should be: no Parliament, no Commission, no directives."
"Instead it has become a bureaucratic monster which is wrecking our economy."
"(EL) Mr President, provisional agreement has already been reached on the revised text of the Public Procurement Agreement and is expected to be reached on the final agreement."
"I respect the need for negotiations to be carried out in secret, but do you not think, Commissioner, that you have been late informing the European Parliament about the priorities, demands and offers of the Union during the renegotiation of this important agreement?"
"I think that the Union's basic negotiating principle should be reciprocity and the achievement of a balanced result between the trading partners."
"The balanced result should not be at the level of theoretical commitments between the trading partners on behalf of the other partners."
"It must be evaluated at the level of the real facility to make full use of the volume of invitations to tender subject to cross-border competition."
"Has the Commission prepared studies on the real access of European undertakings to the market of the other states from the application of the agreement so far?"
"The USA, Canada, South Korea and Japan - the parties to the agreement - have already safeguarded preferential access for small- and medium-sized enterprises to the public procurement market."
"Paradoxically, however, the Union has not."
"I believe the European Union should demand an exemption within the framework of the application of the Public Procurement Agreement for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This demand is reasonable, especially as our partners have already acted."
"Small- and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the European economy and an important source of development and employment, as both Mr Varela, the author, and Mr Audy have emphasised."
"They contribute to economic and social cohesion."
"We have an obligation to take initiatives that will safeguard their dynamic role."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate you on your appointment."
"I am not going to speak about SMEs because many of my colleagues have already done so, but I want to emphasise and agree with them that this is an extremely important issue."
"Government procurement accounts for 20% of GDP in developing countries and around 15% of GDP in developed countries."
"I feel a little bit Janus-faced on this issue, because intuitively I am in favour of opening up public procurement to competition."
"It should in theory reduce government costs and increase transparency in government procurement and therefore cut out corruption."
"That should bring benefits both to the developed and the developing world and, in the developing world, would free up resources for health and education."
"However, if you look at the list of those who have signed up for GPA, there is not a single African country among the 36."
"It is clear that the African countries and other LDCs feel that the costs potentially outweigh the benefits of signing up to this agreement."
"I would ask the Commission what support could it plan to give, firstly, African and other LDC countries to enable them to compete in the European market and the other developed markets on a fair footing and what assistance can they be given to develop their own industry so that they can sustain competition inside their own country if they sign up for opening of the government procurement contracts."
"I also worry, as Mrs Lucas has indicated in a slightly different way, how non-trade issues will be taken into account in GPA and the application of GPA, how issues like the environment, human rights and labour rights will be taken into account."
"I agree with Mrs Lucas that this is public money and that there is a danger, if we simply have GPA without any conditions, that labour and environmental standards could be driven down."
"On the one hand I can see the advantage of opening up public procurement, but it is fraught with dangers and I hope the Commission will examine these issues."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate you once again, and to thank the Commissioner."
"In Britain, SMEs are unfairly shut out of public procurement due to well-meaning requirements such as corporate social responsibility and environmental standards; quite often a requirement for three years of audited accounts, which many small businesses cannot meet; a lack of competitive tendering; the bundling of contracts that become too big for SMEs and favour the large companies; and secrecy and a lack of transparency."
"We know that the EU directive requires transparency and competitive tendering, but most contracts that SMEs bid for are quite often below the threshold."
"So when you speak to SMEs and ask them what they want to see, they say they want to see a cut in bureaucracy and paperwork."
"They want to see authorities avoiding the one-size-fits-all requirement for certification."
"They want to see contracts advertised on websites such as 'supply2.gov', and they also want to see unbundled contracts."
"But we have to recognise that government departments are not commercial organisations and will often want to seek to avoid the extra work involved in multiple tenders, so we therefore need to provide incentives for governments and local government."
"In America, targets have been provided as to whether fair competition actually does or does not exist."
"SMEs do not require quotas, but they need a performance metric to see whether there is fair competition."
"Also in America there are small SME advisers helping the government to enable SMEs to have fair access."
"These requirements - benchmarks and competition advocates - would probably not be allowed under the WTO agreement, and I understand the reason, but it does unintentionally forbid measures which ensure fair competition."
"The WTO agreement is actually generally positive, as it is anti-protectionist, but it forbids measures which are needed to help small businesses."
"So while some Member States want an opt-out, others rightly fear that this would increase protectionism."
"Therefore, let us call on the Commission to seek a compromise whereby an opt-out is secured, but a new agreement is drafted to allow SME-friendly measures and to greatly extend anti-protectionist measures."
"If we allow SME-friendly measures, the agreement would remove America's reasons for its opt-out, which has been used to retain the Buy America Act."
"It would also help British and European SMEs to compete globally."
"(NL) Mr President, a Government Procurement Agreement could mean more transparency and thus less corruption."
"It could also mean fair prices - which is not unimportant given that public service contracts involve taxpayers' money - with the right, though, to include social and environmental criteria at the tendering stage."
"Developing countries could also benefit enormously from all these advantages."
"Needless to say, their participation in the international Government Procurement Agreement in future cannot be ruled out, but the Commission should ensure that they can implement this method - and the same applies to fair competition rules - nationally or regionally at first, just as we did in Europe, and do not need, therefore, to allow in the entire world and the large monopolies straight away."
"It would then have to be up to the developing countries to determine when they would feel sufficiently developed."
"Something that, in fact, applies the world over, is that forced large-scale tenders, as a result of which the small and medium-sized enterprises are pushed out of the market, should be avoided at all costs."
"Unfortunately, I have first-hand experience of exactly that at a train station in Amsterdam where the train station's security service was put out to tender."
"The company that was previously responsible for the station's security was a small company and was doing an excellent job."
"During tender, however, this company proved too small to compete for the total tender for many of those stations and was elbowed out of the market, therefore."
"My fellow Members have undoubtedly come across similar examples, and that is why we would like to ask the Commission how the SMEs can be guaranteed better access to procurement contracts."
"Finally, the forced break-up of the national and semi-public provisions for the sake of large foreign suppliers is fundamentally wrong."
"Every country has the right to regulate publicly what the public would like to retain."
"We are talking about basic provisions here, like education and water, provisions that are at the heart of society and that should not be messed with."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner McCreevy, ladies and gentlemen, it is because the question raised by the Committee on International Trade on the problem of procurement at WTO level directly affects the European internal market that I believe that we have to consider these more closely."
"Of course, on the one hand, it is the WTO agreement that is at issue here, but, on the other, it must also be clear to us that these international treaties - as is the way of things with globalisation - have direct effects on the European internal market."
"Mr Kamall pointed out that, in a number of WTO member states, the United States of America being one of them, certain quotas are to be adhered to even now in the award of national contracts to small and medium-sized enterprises, which means, at the end of the day, nothing other than that the scope of the procurement regulation laid down by the WTO is being restricted."
"I would like to see an impact assessment indicating whether or not this is of any long-term benefit to small and medium-sized enterprises; that it is, in any case, not certain."
"As long as we do not know that for certain, we do not need to worry about the limitation of scope, for it is of course the case that small and medium-sized enterprises live from markets that are as transparent as possible and that they find easiest to access, and if the WTO member states reduce the scope by a quarter, I do not know whether small and medium-sized businesses actually derive any benefit from that."
"It would surely be a worthwhile exercise - and it is with this in mind that I, too, support this question - if the Commission were to be able to examine this closely and show us whether this does have positive effects on small and medium-sized businesses."
"In the Council, of course - none of whose representatives are, alas, present - a balance must be found between those who would favour an approach like that of the USA and those who want to see the precise opposite of that, that is to say, the reduction of quotas to create a free and open market right across the WTO, giving small and medium-sized enterprises a chance everywhere."
"It is for that reason that I believe that the crucial problem for small and medium-sized enterprises in this respect is much more that we have not yet really got a handle on the problem of sub-contractors, for it is in that capacity that small and medium-sized enterprises are often used, being in that way able to create jobs and have the chance to earn money, but they are, ultimately, managed from higher up and that often puts them in a difficult position, with their feet in two different camps."
"What I think we should do is give this problem, in particular, closer attention, and so I would be glad if the Commission were to give some thought to this and keep us up to speed with what is going on."
"In other words, it should start by addressing the problem to which this question refers and then we can make definite demands of the Commissioner."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and to thank him for having submitted his question, which gives us a means of addressing the issue at stake."
"I was rapporteur in this House on the reform of contracts, supplies and services, in this case Directives 17 and 18."
"Even though there is very little time, I think that it is worth pointing out the main aspects of the problem."
"As I have heard some speakers say this morning, Parliament has very much focused Directive 18, or the general directive on contracts, on environmental issues, the updated system of electronic contracts, the social sphere and the issue of thresholds, and I therefore believe that we have legislation that is without doubt exceptional, but that does not actually concern this morning's subject matter."
"The issue raised is completely different: a review is under way of an international agreement that places EU countries - and therefore EU businesses - at a disadvantage compared with others."
"What is the problem?"
"In 1994 and in subsequent years, very different types of activity were planned worldwide through plurilateral agreements."
"The United States, China and other countries in reality enjoy privileges that are not enjoyed by EU businesses."
"This system is now being reviewed, but the methods of reviewing it need to be laid down, because, as my fellow Members and I myself should recall, the United States alone has an annual output of almost USD 200 billion, a sum that actually remains within the United States."
"The point is that, while anyone can come and work in Europe, our small and medium-sized enterprises cannot go and set up business in the rest of the world."
"The GPA agreements are, among other things, agreements that deny European businesses access to the international system."
"What decisions can therefore be made today?"
"As I see it, the Commission believes that, by abolishing the privileges of others, we can compete once again on an equal footing."
"That is not so."
"I believe that we need instead to protect Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises, by guaranteeing them the same privileges within the European Union and thus with regard to the European Union that are enjoyed by small and medium-sized enterprises from the United States and from other countries in the world."
"Therefore, not only am I grateful to Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, but I am also of the opinion that the argument being upheld by France at the moment within the Council should definitely be favoured and supported over the European Commission's position."
"Mr President, I should like to thank all Members for their comments."
"I attach the utmost importance to public procurement."
"Proper, fair and transparent procedures are crucial not only for businesses that want to bid for projects but also for authorities that would be able to save themselves and taxpayers huge amounts of money if they applied the procedures properly."
"Getting commitments from our trading partners to open their procurement market for European bidders is essential."
"Our companies have something to offer."
"They are competitive, but too often they are simply not allowed or invited to make a bid."
"SMEs benefit from public procurement."
"They already have a big share of the market, but I do not think that setting aside quotas or giving preferential treatment is the answer."
"If we were to do that, so would more of our trading partners and the result would be that European companies would lose out."
"I believe that all sides are best served by open markets."
"Our SMEs are dynamic and strong."
"They will benefit as well."
"Mrs Mann asked to be kept informed."
"I shall ask my officials to keep her committee closely informed."
"They will attend meetings of the committee and will answer your questions about the details of the negotiations."
"Various Members referred to special arrangements for SMEs and that this should be part of our negotiating stance."
"As I have said, I do not agree."
"I agree with a lot of what Mr Kamall said, and his observation that Member States themselves could do a lot to assist their SMEs in the area of public procurement without contravening any rules at all."
"If they unbundled some of their contracts and cut out a lot of the bureaucracy, that would benefit SMEs substantially, and would not require the setting-aside of quotas."
"Where I would disagree is with the conclusion drawn by some people that the way to do this better for SMEs is to set aside quotas."
"Mr Kamall also raised the issue of the United States having a Small Business Act and an agency to deal with these matters."
"However, the figures show that, either in volume or in quantity terms, SMEs in Europe get a far higher percentage of contracts than they do in the United States."
"That should be of some interest to people."
"Therefore, I say - and people are entitled to disagree with my views on this - that public procurement is all about competing: the best goods and services for the lowest amount."
"That means value for money."
"Reserving parts of the market underlines this."
"We were also discussing SMEs in an earlier debate this morning."
"Members said that SMEs need opportunities."
"I certainly agree."
"However, protectionism is not the answer."
"But, of course, we will not be naive: we expect our trading partners to open their markets as well."
"We shall suspend the sitting and resume at 11.00 a.m. for the formal sitting with the President of Bulgaria."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.25 a.m. and resumed at 11.00 a.m.)"

"(DE) Mr President, I would like to suggest that we avail ourselves of the option provided by Rule 168(2) of our Rules of Procedure and send this report back to the committee."
"The reason I have for saying this is that I am familiar with the problem of Article 90 and that this report surely describes the situation of the Dalits, India's so-called untouchables, in accurate terms, it is no less apparent that nobody among us finds these conditions tolerable, and we are obliged to do whatever we can about them."
"However, it also appears that India has raised serious objections to this report on the grounds that it discusses the caste system in India and hence something that is part and parcel of that country's traditions and culture."
"I would, then, ask that consideration be given to whether it might be well-advised, in the interests of what we are trying to do, to discuss this again in the committee, even if what emerges from it later on differs from the present motion for a resolution in no respect whatever."
"We would, however, be well advised to talk to the Indian authorities again, since it is all too often we Europeans who wag the finger at others and tell them what to do, which tends to hinder us from achieving the objectives we seek, so I put it to the House that this would be a wiser course of action."
"(DE) Mr President, unless my ears deceive me, you said that this act, under Rule 90, is adopted, in the absence of any objection to it."
"Secondly, embassies keep on interfering in what we do; in this instance it is the Indian embassy doing it, but we speak for a people rather than for any embassy, and so we should stick with the resolution as it stands."
"Mr President, I have an altogether different point to make."
"I was the Vice-President of the Human Rights Sub-Committee and the deputy coordinator in the Committee on Foreign Affairs at the time when this report went through the Development Committee."
"It is primarily a human rights report."
"The opinion of neither Foreign Affairs nor Human Rights was sought on this."
"We have had no opportunity to amend it."
"It is a human rights report going through Development."
"It is not within that committee's remit."
"It is not just a question of the Government of India, it is a question of procedure."
"How can we have a report going through Plenary without a vote or an opportunity to amend it when the committees with the main responsibilities for the issue have never seen the report, have never had an opportunity to correct factual inaccuracies?"
"It is not factually correct!"
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, as Mr Swoboda has said, it has already been adopted, so the debate is over, and all other deliberations are superfluous."
"If Mr Nassauer and Mr Tannock want to produce another report, they will have to start from the very beginning, and we will vote on it five years from now."
"Mr President, as a negotiator on this report in the Development Committee, I recognise the point made by my colleague Mr Tannock, because if we have a Human Rights Sub-Committee, this report should have gone to that committee for comment."
"It only went through the Development Committee, but it should have gone to the Human Rights Sub-Committee because this is fundamentally a human rights report."
"Therefore I recommend that we send the report back to committee and ask the Sub-Committee on Human Rights of the Foreign Affairs Committee to give an opinion on it."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, speaking as chair of the SAARC Delegation, I recognise that this is a very delicate report."
"However, we also have to recognise that there are factual inaccuracies in here."
"For procedural reasons, this report was approved in the Committee on Development on 19 December 2006 and the deadline was 15 January 2007."
"Most of the intervening period was taken up by the Christmas break."
"We have looked into the issues; we have had several meetings; we have opinions; and I would ask, as a delegation chair, that we have an opportunity to make our view heard."
"I would support referral back to committee."
"You cannot have a report without any debate or any vote."
"It is short-circuiting the democratic scrutiny process and I think it is important that we do credit to this House."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply saddened by the example we are setting regarding a resolution that we have debated thoroughly within the Committee on Development and on which we have had time to table amendments."
"This is an issue that does not interfere - certainly no more so than many other far more forceful resolutions adopted by this House - in China's internal affairs."
"We know perfectly well that the caste issue is an extremely sensitive one, but we have listened to the Dalits, who do not just live in India, but in many other countries too: we are talking about millions of people who live in degrading and inhuman conditions."
"I am sorry but I really think that our Parliament is setting a very bad example and, as with all the other resolutions that are being voted on, I believe that this resolution, being, as it is, a resolution voted on by the Committee on Development, should be voted on in Parliament, since it concerns a problem of human dignity and of the right of millions of people to live, and to have their lives and their dignity respected."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must do as the law says."
"I shall now read out to you Rule 90(4), and I ask you to listen carefully, for this is pretty difficult legalese, but this is the Rule to which the President has to keep, for the President must be guided by the law as it stands."
"Rule 90 (4) states that: 'Recommendations drawn up in this way shall be included on the agenda for the next part-session."
"In urgent cases decided upon by the President, recommendations may be included on the agenda of a current part-session."
"Recommendations shall be deemed adopted unless, before the beginning of the part-session, at least forty Members submit a written objection, in which case the committee's recommendations shall be included on the agenda of the same part-session for debate and voting."
"A political group or at least 40 Members may table amendments.'"
"I have to say at this point - and I am keeping to the law, as I am required to do - that no written motion has been submitted by 40 Members prior to this sitting, and so my recommendation is that the relevant committee should continue to discuss this issue - which is a very delicate one - and, should they come up with another result at some other point in time, that is in order, but right now, I have to do as the House's rules require."
"(Applause)"

"(PL) The report refers to many negative aspects of so-called feminism and segregation, and I therefore consider it is worth highlighting a positive example."
"Marie SkÅodowska-Curie could serve as an inspiring example of a woman, mother, wife, scientist, Nobel prize-winner and exemplary European."
"That is why I am surprised that Mrs FlasarovÃ¡, the rapporteur, is opposed to Marie SkÅodowska-Curie and I cannot understand why."
"Is it a case of woman against woman?"
"Is it politically and psychologically correct?"
"- Before the vote on the amended motion for a resolution:"
"rapporteur. - (CS) Thank you for giving me the floor, Mr President."
"I feel that in terms of women who have made a significant contribution to our European Union and to Europe, there are too many to name."
"I therefore feel that it is not only Marie Curie-SkÅodowska, a woman for whom I have great admiration, who should be on the list."

"Explanations of vote"
"in writing. (DE) I cast my vote for the recommendation on the approval of partitioning systems to protect passengers against displaced luggage, supplied as non-original vehicle equipment, since this, firstly, makes easier trade in motor vehicles between one contracting party and another and, secondly, also guarantees a high standard of safety and environmental protection."
"With these considerations in mind, I can do no other than support the harmonisation of the rules applicable to motor vehicles."
"I cast my vote in favour of a regulation concerning the approval of motor vehicles with regard to the forward field of vision of the motor vehicle driver."
"The harmonisation of regulations applicable to motor vehicles will, on the one hand, reduce obstacles to trade between various contracting parties and, on the other, guarantee high safety standards."
"The draft guarantees an adequate field of vision through the windscreen and other windows on the motor vehicle, which, from the point of view of general safety, is to be endorsed without exception."
"I will be supporting this report which reinforces our agreement with the Republic of Korea on scientific and technological cooperation."
"Seoul is an increasingly important global industrial player and it is vital that the EU engages with this country which traditionally has been closer to the US rather than us."
"I presume that this agreement will cover scientific and technological research in the Kaesong Industrial Zone jointly administered by North and South Korea, and in that I am sure the Republic of Korea will welcome our commitment that is currently withheld by Washington."
"We are radically opposed to the Council proposal on scientific cooperation between the ÎU and Korea, because the orientation and fragmentation of research contributes to the profitability of the monopoly groups of companies and to capital in general."
"It is contrary to the real needs of the workers."
"It is in the people's interest to fight this reactionary choice for research and similar agreements and the anti-labour policy overall and the EU itself and to fight for radical change so that research can be oriented towards satisfying the contemporary needs of the working and grass-roots classes."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by Lithuanian MEP Mrs BudreikaitÄ, on mainstreaming sustainability in development cooperation policies."
"She rightly points out that sustainable development is based on the idea that the needs of the current generation should be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs."
"It is right to mainstream sustainable development concepts in public policy at European and Member State level, concepts that include economic prosperity, social cohesion and respect for the environment."
"This is essential when it comes to development cooperation, which is very difficult to achieve given the planet's demographic development and the need to eradicate poverty."
"The EU should be at the forefront of the worldwide affirmation of sustainable development concepts."
"This, after all, is one of the EU's key missions."
"The report omits to mention the underlying causes of the increasingly deep social inequality and disparity in development, of the unchecked exploitation of natural resources and of the massive destruction of the environment around the world, and fails to mention the real culprit, which is capitalism."
"Despite this, it does contain a wide range of proposals and points that we welcome, such as the call for the target of 0.7% GNI to be met in order to achieve effective development cooperation characterised by solidarity."
"However, we cannot accept the following points, for example:"
"because 'local authorities in developing countries are not always in a position to provide the volumes of financing required to make major investments in the construction and maintenance of infrastructure networks, for example to supply water or provide sanitation', the report concludes that the solution is 'only supplementary injections of private capital, through public-private partnerships, will be able to provide the requisite volume of funding', thus handing this fundamental resource for life on a plate to private capital;"
"and making the reduction - rather than the cancellation - of the debts of the least-developed countries contingent on what is termed 'good governance', the criteria for which are dictated by the whims of the major powers."
"Hence our vote."
"in writing. (DE) Over the past fifteen years we have made progress in combating poverty, albeit far from to the extent we had hoped, for even if we manage to drive a country's economic development forward, this does not mean by a long chalk that poverty has thereby been reduced."
"Funds intended for those in disadvantaged circumstances must not be allowed to seep away into corrupt systems or be able to be used even for such things as the purchase of weaponry or the shoring up of dictatorial regimes."
"It is here that effectiveness needs to be better monitored if development funds are to be applied in the right place and for the right purposes."
"It might also be worth considering concentrating them on what are termed 'anchor countries', which are capable of fast-forwarding a whole region's development, and we should also be open to new approaches, including the use of microcredit as a means of getting the poor permanently back on their own feet."
"I just wanted to expand on what I said earlier regarding the way the resolution on Dalits' human rights went through the House without an opportunity to amend it, and in particular to point out a number of factual inaccuracies in the report which never came before either the Foreign Affairs Committee or the Human Rights Sub-Committee for an opinion."
"I would like to protest at the way in which Rule 90(4) is being used by certain Members of this House."
"For instance, the resolution highlights the incidence of crimes against the Dalits and talks about frequent heinous crimes against them, e.g. murders."
"Well, I would like to point out that in fact the incidence of murders in India against Dalits is 2.04%, whereas they constitute 14% of the population."
"So actually, if you are a Dalit, you have a safer lifestyle than if you are somebody from one of the other castes."
"The resolution makes no mention of the workings of the Prevention of Atrocities Act, which was designed to help convict those who have attacked Dalits, and in addition it makes no mention of the fact that the rate of literacy, although very low for Dalits, is extremely close to the national average."
"It does not mention that there is a national reward from the government, basically designed to eradicate untouchability, and there are cash incentives given to encourage inter-caste marriages."
"This report is very unbalanced; it is full of factual inaccuracies and I lament the fact, Mr President, that you were not in a position to refer it back to committee, but my case rests."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution tabled by the European Parliament's Committee on Development on the human rights situation of the Dalits in India."
"Although I believe that the European Union should be very careful when it comes to interfering in countries' constitutions, I support this resolution denouncing the unacceptable situation of the Dalits, which is due to the non-application of various provisions prohibiting caste discrimination."
"According to the report and numerous studies, the Dalits are the victims of unpunished crimes and offences."
"Added to this are the abuses of children and women, who are the victims of two forms of discrimination - caste and gender discrimination - throughout their lives, with sexual abuse being included in this."
"Yes, the European Parliament was right to denounce this disgraceful situation."
"The treatment of the Dalits in India presents some serious human rights concerns."
"There should be a universal right to decent work and non-discrimination and the caste system as it currently exists in India guarantees neither of these right to Dalits."
"As the EU and the European Parliament's very foundations are based on shared values, of which non-discrimination is a key element, then it is our duty to voice concern where we see these values being violated and these rights denied to others in third countries."
"The huge problem involving people who are, to this day, considered outcastes and therefore 'untouchable' is disturbing."
"The social segregation experienced by Dalits can be likened to Apartheid as it used to be in South Africa."
"The largest group of these 'untouchables' live in India, where more than 160 million people are affected."
"They are often excluded from basic provisions, such as education, health care and clean drinking water, are not allowed to own land and are regularly at the receiving end of violence and exploitation."
"This is why I intend to vote in favour of this resolution which insists on the Indian Government stepping up its efforts in effectively stamping out caste-based discrimination and in promoting equal opportunities."
"It is to be welcomed that the European Parliament is making specific proposals in order to counter this structural discrimination against a people."
"As the Indian Prime Minister himself said on 27 December 2006: 'Dalits have faced a unique discrimination in our society that is fundamentally different from the problems of minority groups in general."
"The only parallel to the practice of 'untouchability' was Apartheid in South Africa.'"
"I hope that the EU will be discussing this in its relations with India and will help stamp out this gross social injustice."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to express my support for the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Gabon, as well as the other similar agreements with other ACP countries (Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific) and with certain other States."
"These agreements are based on the principle of reciprocal cooperation and are in line with the partnership approach which is being applied to the external dimension of our common fisheries policy."
"By means of these agreements, we achieve a twin objective: firstly, we guarantee that the interests of the Union's deep-sea fishing fleet are protected and, secondly, we improve the conditions with a view to achieving sustainable fisheries in the waters of the partner countries."
"In this regard, I would like to end by stressing that the Union and our deep-sea fishing fleet, in contrast to others that operate illegally - has committed itself to ensuring that world fishing activities are sustainable and has accepted the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation's Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries."
"We must support this and other agreements, because they promote the development of our partner countries."
"in writing. (PT) The new Partnership Agreement with the Gabonese Republic, which entered into force on 3 December 2005, is valid for six years and contains a protocol that will lead to a 40% reduction in the fishing opportunities available to the various fleets of the EU Member States operating in these waters, including the Portuguese fleet."
"Furthermore, in common with other tuna fishing agreements, fees for ship-owners have increased from 25% to 35% of the total cost, obviously with the reduction in the Community contribution."
"What may now happen is low uptake of the opportunities offered by the agreements, and the scrapping of many long-distance fishing vessels, which is already happening in Portugal."
"This situation leads us to question the actual impact of these agreements, the costs of which to the fleets are rising while fishing opportunities are falling."
"It is alarming, not least for the Portuguese fleet, that this agreement will undermine the proportionality and the relative stability of the previous one in terms of the distribution of fishing opportunities with other fleets."
"Portugal is to lose 50% of the fishing opportunities for surface longliners, with only three licences as opposed to the six under the previous agreement."
"I support this report amending the Fisheries Partnership Agreement."
"I particularly support the call for greater parliamentary involvement prior to any extension of the agreement."
"I am also glad that the development needs of coastal populations are addressed."
"(NL) Mr President, I have, needless to say, voted in favour of the resolution on a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty, because I am a staunch opponent of capital punishment, not least at a personal level."
"I do want to make myself absolutely clear though. I may be opposed to capital punishment, but I do firmly believe that we should come down hard on crime."
"What I am trying to say here is that it is because of the apathy and cowardice on the part of many European governments that, as is the case in my country, serious common law criminals, assassins and child rapists, are systematically given early release, and so it is because of this laxity and this cowardice that people are calling for the reintroduction of capital punishment in Europe."
"As an opponent to capital punishment, I can see where these people are coming from, and my view is that proper account should be taken of the complaints lodged by them."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the joint motion for a resolution that was tabled by five political groups and that concerns an initiative in favour of a universal moratorium on the death penalty."
"At a time when the third international congress against the death penalty is being held in Paris, it made sense for the European Union to restate its convictions and to ask that everything be done to obtain a universal moratorium on executions, with a view to the complete abolition of the death penalty."
"I write this with a certain sense of pride in belonging to a Member State that, on the proposal of its President, the President of the French Republic, Mr Chirac, and thanks to the wisdom of its elected representatives, will shortly be amending its Constitution to include a ban on the death penalty, as is already laid down in law."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, because I am opposed to the death penalty, which, in the 21st century, is an appalling example of barbarity and a violation of human dignity."
"This state of affairs cannot be allowed to go on."
"I therefore agree with the proposal to call for a universal moratorium on the death penalty at the United Nations General Assembly."
"I did not sign the draft joint resolution, tabled by several political groups, on a global moratorium on the death penalty, nor do I intend to vote in its favour."
"I fully endorse the undertakings Poland entered into under international law on joining the Council of Europe and the European Union, but I do not consider that the abolition of the death penalty in other parts of the world is a solution to the problem of violence and brutality."
"I believe it is right to condemn the abuse of capital punishment and its barbaric implementation, as was the case at the execution of Saddam Hussein and of Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti."
"Nonetheless, the total abolition of the death penalty for criminals, terrorists and bloodthirsty dictators in the most unstable and violent parts of the world is an irresponsible, nonsensical and harmful proposal."
"As it seeks to achieve the introduction of this global moratorium, the European Union is unable to offer countries ravaged by violence any significant aid in the area of public security."
"Consequently, the Italian Government's initiative, which is to receive the European Union's support today, may also be deemed hypocritical."
"The EU has as part of its requirements for membership for Member States that they do not exercise or have on their statute books the death penalty."
"It is only right that we try to promote this around the globe."
"It is a disgrace from the US to China, from Central Asia to Central Africa."
"The problem is that we exhibit a degree of hypocrisy when some executions are more acceptable than others."
"It is just as wrong to execute Saddam Hussein and Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma Bomber, as Ken Sara-Wiwo, the Nigerian human rights activist, or the hundreds of victims of Saddam Hussein's brutal, totalitarian regime."
"I can only hope that in future we oppose those barbaric public spectacles in the same way we oppose China's executions, as now modern technology allows public executions to be replaced by execution broadcast via mobile phone."
"I did not sign the draft joint resolution, tabled by several political groups, on a global moratorium on the death penalty, nor do I intend to vote in its favour."
"I fully endorse the undertakings Poland entered into under international law on joining the Council of Europe and the European Union, but I do not consider that the abolition of the death penalty in other parts of the world is a solution to the problem of violence and brutality."
"I believe it is right to condemn the abuse of capital punishment and its barbaric implementation, as was the case at the execution of Saddam Hussein and of Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti."
"Nonetheless, the total abolition of the death penalty for criminals, terrorists and bloodthirsty dictators in the most unstable and violent parts of the world is an irresponsible, nonsensical and harmful proposal."
"As it seeks to achieve the introduction of this global moratorium, the European Union is unable to offer countries ravaged by violence any significant aid in the area of public security."
"Consequently, the Italian Government's initiative, which is to receive the European Union's support today, may also be deemed hypocritical."
"Fundamental human rights are a core part of the European Union's role and identity."
"As an institution of the EU, the European Parliament has a duty to support efforts to spread these values outside of the borders of the Union."
"Supporting the moratorium on the death penalty sends out the message that certain human rights should be upheld universally."
"I particularly support the reference in the resolution to the disgraceful manner in which the execution of Saddam Hussein was carried out."
"in writing. - (FR) Of course, there is France with its judicial imbroglios; yes, there is Iraq, where those charged with judging the Head of State turned up astride the missiles of the invaders; and, naturally, there is China, where everything is up for sale, even bullets for people to blow their brains out with."
"Then there is Libya and the case of the Bulgarian nurses."
"In the 21st century, where, increasingly, the issues are wilfully confused, the death penalty is now carried out in French hospitals, where the old are finished off in order to free up beds and balance the accounts."
"It is carried out in the Europe of Maastricht where, by pulling the plug on vital investment, we have killed off our future."
"The ideological scourge of the Reverend Malthus - of zero growth and sustainable underdevelopment - has infected our decision-makers."
"There would seem not to be enough room at the banqueting table of the human race."
"So we leave the old to the mercy of heatwaves and lethal injections, and we retire folk early and reduce their working hours."
"Tax law exerts its stranglehold, labour law may leave no room to breathe and budgetary law short-changes us."
"Meanwhile, at the top of this ladder of Malthusian penalties, criminal law tops off this society of ours with the culture of death."
"In the Malthusian economy, the 'euthanazi state', the 'precautionary principle' and the ultimate penalty of execution are the bedfellows of pride and complacency."
"in writing. - (FR) There is a long list of countries that permit the death penalty, and the list of victims is longer still."
"In 2005 alone, 2 148 people were executed."
"So what about Europe?"
"Is it possible to be a European state and, at the same time, to permit the death penalty?"
"No, it emphatically is not."
"Moreover, countries that are candidates for accession to the European Union are actually obliged to abolish it."
"We MEPs even think that there is a need to go further than that."
"That is the objective of the resolution against the death penalty, adopted today by Parliament."
"With the predictable exception of the extreme right, all the political groups in Parliament had already signed the declaration in favour of a moratorium on the death penalty with a view to its universal abolition."
"The majority required for the adoption of the resolution has been obtained, constituting an unusual consensus in Parliament."
"This majority makes it clear that being a Member of the EU is not only about agreeing to fishing quotas."
"Above all, it makes it clear that Europe does not compromise on its basic values."
"Europe is at the forefront of the fight to abolish the death penalty, a fact worth pointing out."
"I did not sign the draft joint resolution, tabled by several political groups, on a global moratorium on the death penalty, nor do I intend to vote in its favour."
"I fully endorse the undertakings Poland entered into under international law on joining the Council of Europe and the European Union, but I do not consider that the abolition of the death penalty in other parts of the world is a solution to the problem of violence and brutality."
"I believe it is right to condemn the abuse of capital punishment and its barbaric implementation, as was the case at the execution of Saddam Hussein and of Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti."
"Nonetheless, the total abolition of the death penalty for criminals, terrorists and bloodthirsty dictators in the most unstable and violent parts of the world is an irresponsible, nonsensical and harmful proposal."
"As it seeks to achieve the introduction of this global moratorium, the European Union is unable to offer countries ravaged by violence any significant aid in the area of public security."
"Consequently, the Italian Government's initiative, which is to receive the European Union's support today, may also be deemed hypocritical."
"(SV) Mr President, Mrs Ries's report and the fight against obesity make serious inroads into issues that I think come within the competence of the Member States."
"Moreover, the report addresses issues with which politicians ought not to concern themselves at all. In my view, the individual's perspective is entirely missing."
"To state that obesity is a chronic disease is not only mistaken, it is to accept responsibility for people who are overweight or, worse still, to deprive a great many overweight people of the hope of being able to influence their own situation."
"Being overweight can, in fact, be a symptom of a chronic disease, but to assert anything more is to create the stigma that the report maintains it wants to do away with."
"What, in my view, is most serious, however, is something quite different: namely, the desire to steer the media in a direction that, in the present situation, is opportunistic."
"That is unacceptable, and it is not what politicians should be doing."
"It amazes me that so many of my fellow Members from Sweden have voted in favour of this report."
"We Swedish Conservatives obviously voted against the report."
"in writing. (SV) We do not believe that the assessment of what may be referred to as chronic obesity is a political issue."
"That needs to be a task for medical science."
"We therefore abstained in the vote on this issue."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my fellow Member, Mrs Ries, on a European dimension for the prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases."
"The number of people in Europe who suffer from obesity has increased spectacularly over the last 30 years."
"This development is comparable to what happened in the United States during the 1990s: today, in Europe, 27% of men and 38% of women are classed as overweight or obese."
"The European Parliament's proposals are based on healthy eating, physical activity and treatment from childhood and throughout adulthood."
"Health professionals, sport, the quality of agricultural produce, school canteens, education, communication and nutritional labelling are all factors, among others, on which the European Union must rely in order to fight this scourge."
"It is very important for the European Commission to carry out a socioeconomic study into the consequences of diseases linked to a person's being overweight, not only at the level of health care spending, which we know represents between 4% and 7% of total spending, but also at the level of employment: unemployment, lost time and invalidity."
"Earlier this week I called on the Irish Government to bring forward proposals which will have the effect of totally banning television adverts of food and drink products that are high in fat, salt and sugar and which specifically target children under the age of 16."
"Child obesity is a serious problem in Ireland and in Europe and this problem must be effectively tackled head-on."
"A ban such as that to which I am referring is being introduced in Britain after four years of extensive research and consultation."
"This research included 2000 interviews with children, parents and teachers as well as details of family eating habits drawn from a panel of 11 000 people."
"This research clearly found that television advertising does have an effect on the dietary preferences of children."
"It is estimated by the British Government that in households where children's viewing includes a large number of programmes targeted at adults as well as at children and young people, children would see 41% fewer adverts of food and drink products that are high in fat, salt and sugar."
"We are talking about the protection of our children, and that must be our overriding interest at all times."
"in writing. (SV) Public health issues are very important, and people with health problems need all the support they can get."
"In our opinion, this resolution oversteps the limits of subsidiarity, however."
"The issues concerned should instead be dealt with at national and regional levels, which is why we chose to abstain in the vote."
"I voted in favour of this report, because the fight against obesity should be a political priority for the EU. After all, 27% of men and 38% of women in Europe are overweight."
"More worrying still is child obesity. More than 5 million children (in the EU-25) are obese and around 300 000 new cases come to light every year."
"This is a trend that, as a matter of urgency, must be reversed."
"I endorse most of the measures proposed, for example informing consumers from childhood; restrictions on television advertising; nutrition and health claims on food labelling; and greater consistency between the common agricultural policy and health policies."
"We welcome the adoption of this report, which, among other points, includes the following key issues: the recognition that promoting a healthy diet and physical activity should be a political priority for the Member States and the EU as a vital component in the fight against obesity, and the recommendation that obesity be officially recognised as a chronic disease."
"Obesity is the most common form of malnutrition and arises from an excessive storage of fat. It is associated with progressive debilitating diseases and constitutes a greater risk of death rate among the rest of the population."
"As the report says, according to data from 2006, more than 300 million people around the world are obese, a figure that has more than doubled in the last 15 years."
"Accordingly, in addition to boosting the fight against the disease in terms of providing patients access to healthcare, medicine, psychological advice, and so forth, a prevention strategy must be adopted that involves promoting healthy diet and lifestyles, with particular focus on women and children because, as studies have shown, they are particularly vulnerable to this disease."
"Everything that we try to do on the environment and health fronts is aimed at protecting health."
"Responsibility for this rests with the Member States, and that is where it must remain. The idea of prevention is becoming ever more prominent."
"The Ries report describes the health risks involved in obesity, excess weight and chronic illness."
"Why is it that our children are overweight?"
"What are the causes?"
"These issues need to be discussed in order to raise awareness, particularly in families."
"The ability to keep our bodies healthy on a day-to-day basis is something that must be communicated through school and general education."
"Preventing these illnesses will, of necessity, involve social changes, but that will be accomplished not merely through bans on advertising, providing information relating to health and giving children sports bags when they start primary school."
"We live in a fast-living society; when both parents work, time for the family, for bringing up children and for cooking is often lacking."
"This makes it ever more important that society should take preventive action, and schools and educational facilities must be entrusted with the communication of day-to-day life skills."
"Even so, we must not stop reminding families of those tasks and duties that are inherently their own, and empower them to perform and fulfil them."
"Not even the EU can make people be slim and enjoy life and health."
"The Member States must produce action plans and measures, but people have to put them into practice themselves."
"in writing. - (FR) It is to its credit that, in order to combat excessive weight, obesity and chronic diseases, the European Commission is concerned that everyone should have a healthy diet and engage in physical activity."
"The marathon motion for a resolution, with its 18 recitals and 53 paragraphs, produced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is, however, unacceptable inasmuch as it proposes provisions recommending dubious interference in the competences of the Member States, partly in the form of a Community legislative framework."
"I do of course sympathise with the warning that we wish to sound, faced with the epidemic of obesity affecting three million children and between 20% and 30% of adults at a time when 14 million children and half the adult population are overweight."
"In the fight to promote healthy eating habits and the use of high-quality products, we have high-calibre allies in the form of the Eurochefs - an association bringing together 4 000 cooks from 17 Member States who stick to a code of honour, championing the intrinsic quality of food and acting to safeguard rural products."
"I believe that we should do well to benefit from their knowledge and their readiness to promote best practices ..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"I strongly support this report as well as the Commission Green Paper entitled 'Promoting healthy diets and physical activity: a European dimension for the prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases', which the report addresses."
"Public health issues are of increasing concern in Europe, and this report provides a welcome contribution."
"The report's emphasis on the key role played by schools is to be welcomed, as is the call for action to be taken to address the alarming decline in the nutritional value of fruit and vegetables."
"in writing. (DE) The fact of the matter is that we all know what is healthy and what is not, even without labels prescribed by the EU, yet our eating and living habits have changed to such a degree that obesity, with all its consequences for our health, has assumed disturbing proportions."
"However, the combination of lack of movement, poor nutrition and too much television also makes people more aggressive."
"Various action plans on health have been running for some time, and it is only right that they should start in children's early school years, since it is then that the risk of compulsive over-eating is very great, but nutritional certificates, health-oriented playgroups and even bans on advertising will not get us where we want to be."
"It is in the family that the love of sport, which is so important in reducing stress and aggression, and healthy eating habits, must be experienced and encouraged."
"Yet it is this, the fundamental building block of our society, that is under constant bombardment from the modern working world, with its flexible working hours, weekend and shift working patterns, and the constantly-renewed call for longer opening times."
"When people are tired to the point of exhaustion from a long working day, it is easier for them to grab fast food than to make the effort to cook; they find themselves wanting to flake out in front of the television with crisps and a fizzy drink, and their children imitate their behaviour."
"While preaching that people should exercise more, we reduce sports lessons on budgetary grounds or excuse foreign children from them on religious grounds, and sports clubs see their support ebbing away."
"I support the report by Mrs Ries on promoting healthy diets and physical activity."
"I agree the fight against childhood obesity should be a political priority of the European Union and its Member States."
"We should take urgent steps to encourage children to enjoy a healthy lifestyle and to urge Member States to increase the amount of physical education available in schools."
"I am glad to see the report recognises the importance and potential of food signposting systems in place in several Member States."
"I welcome calls to the Commission to research and develop a scientifically based EU-wide 'front-of-pack nutrition labelling scheme'."
"I feel this is a straightforward but very effective way of encouraging people to choose healthier options."
"We must act urgently in informing people that their health and that of future generations is in their own hands."
"Long-term bad eating habits and a lack of sufficient exercise result in thousands of people in the European Union being faced with obesity every year."
"This increases the risk of numerous serious diseases, including heart diseases, higher blood pressure and respiratory disorders."
"Not only does this affect public health, it also increases the cost to health insurers in the Member States."
"I would therefore argue in favour of an integrated way of addressing the problem."
"Providing information, as well as educating, consumers, exchanging best practices among Member States, clear labelling on foodstuffs or campaigns in schools in order to promote healthier life styles: these are all ways of bringing about the necessary behavioural changes."
"The battle against the bulge transcends borders."
"We in Europe can make a positive contribution and learn from each other's ways of addressing the problem."
"Cooperation with the Member States, industry, the media, education and civil society strikes me as being the right way."
"in writing. (SV) There is no doubt that obesity and excessive weight are a major public health problem in Europe too, and one that must figure high on our agenda."
"It ought not, however, to be regarded, as it is in the report, as a chronic disease."
"It is also important that school children be given opportunities for sports education and for physical activity during breaks."
"However, it is for each Member State to determine what priority to give to this issue."
"In view of the principle of subsidiarity, it cannot be transferred to EU level."
"I have therefore chosen to vote against the report as a whole."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by Mrs Wallis, which contains a range of recommendations on limitation periods in cross-border disputes involving injuries and fatal accidents."
"As part of the construction of our European area, we should do everything we can to make our fellow citizens' lives easier."
"This applies to the timeframes for harmonising limitation periods."
"The introduction of the country of origin principle, at least provisionally, is a very interesting idea insofar as it would confer on victims rights with which they are familiar."
"This report sends a strong message to the Commission, and demonstrates that Parliament is expecting a legislative proposal that should be preceded by a study into this issue."
"As cross-border traffic has increased, so has the number of accidents involving people from other EU Member States."
"An inquiry into the effects of the existence of differing limitation periods and in particular into the number of personal injury cases involving citizens in cross-border areas and differing limitation periods may help us understand the situation."
"There are limitation periods that vary from as little as 12 months in some countries to 30 years or more in others. This may lead to injured people having their right to compensation denied because they did not initiate legal proceedings in accordance with the applicable foreign law on limitation."
"The most vulnerable members of society are thus at great risk of seeing their rights curtailed. That includes those who have been most seriously injured or those who for some reason are incapable of protecting their own rights adequately."
"It might therefore be appropriate to find a fair and workable solution that helps the victims and their representatives without insurance costs becoming prohibitive and without undermining the principle of subsidiarity, or that of seeking countries in which the costs to insurers is lower, as may happen when the country of origin principle is applied to them."
"I have voted in favour of the proposals on limitation periods in cross-border disputes involving injuries and fatal accidents."
"I believe it is essential that Europe's citizens can enjoy the freedom to travel in the European Union, and be safe in the knowledge that should problems arise they will not face unnecessary constraints in getting proper legal redress across borders."
"This report will play a part in ensuring that."
"It calls for the European Commission to carry out an inquiry into the effects of the existence of differing limitation periods on the internal market, and particularly on citizens exercising their freedoms under the Treaty."
"It is important that any new legislation in this area is based on sound evidence, not least to ensure that any future law brings forward specific and focused measures to tackle the problems."
"I have therefore voted in favour of the Wallis report, which demands that the Commission bring forward the evidence to enable this law to go ahead."
"(CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what struck me in the report was the emphasis on the fact that women achieve significantly fewer academic qualifications than men."
"Only 15% of full professors are women, whereas the number of women graduating from university is higher than that of men, at 59% of the total."
"The low proportion of women with academic qualifications cannot be put down to discrimination against young women and girls concerning access to education."
"There are a number of other factors behind this low figure."
"If we really want to reverse the trend, it is crucial that we define and analyse these factors, and try to address the matter in a targeted fashion."
"For example, take the need to eliminate stereotypes in organisational hierarchies."
"Women are very much welcomed and accepted as members of research teams."
"Their capabilities are less trusted, however, when it comes to being team leaders."
"Yet it is precisely these positions which enable and allow the formation of scientific schools and contribute to the development of various disciplines and specialisations in university faculties."
"Declaring from time to time that the number of women in academia should be increased is all very well, but it falls a long way short of what is required."
"What we need to do is to define the conditions of the process carefully and to work on optimising them in such a way that women become more involved. Thank you."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by Mrs FlasarovÃ¡ on educational discrimination against young women and girls."
"The current situation, in which fewer women than men obtain post-graduate level qualifications and go on to pursue lifelong learning for reasons of gender, is one that we must combat collectively."
"Education is one of the essential prerequisites - albeit not the only one - for citizens to enjoy all their other social, economic, cultural and political rights, and to assume all their duties as citizens."
"I have high hopes for the activities of the future Institute for Gender Equality."
"It is also essential to fight against the discrimination with which women, and in particular the youngest women, have to contend when they live in communities where gender equality is not respected, by rejecting all forms of cultural and religious relativism which could violate women's fundamental rights."
"Young girls, as well as boys, should have access to compulsory schooling."
"As the rapporteur says, although there has for a long time been evidence to show that young women and girls are no less capable than men and boys when it comes to education, there is a series of factors that continues to place them at a disadvantage, especially in higher education and lifelong learning."
"In 2004, eight out of ten girls studying in higher education in the EU Member States completed their studies."
"This figure is higher than that for boys, of whom only three out of four completed their studies, which proves that girls are no less motivated or capable when it comes to education."
"Yet the proportion of girls who took their studies further or embarked on an academic career is lower."
"Although women outnumber men in university education 59% to 41%, only 43% of PhD graduates and only 15% of full university professors are women."
"These figures demonstrate the major inequality between the sexes in terms of lifelong learning and in the continuing vocational education of women outside the academic world, thereby confirming that both phenomena are rooted in the continued inequality between the sexes, which can clearly be seen in pay discrimination."
"I voted in favour of this report as it seeks to address the inequalities for women which still persist, mainly in gaining access to and obtaining higher academic qualifications, including at postgraduate level and in scientific research, and in the area of lifelong learning."
"There is a need to reform the content of school textbooks and to ensure that the training of educational workers be directed towards fulfilling the requirements of a balanced gender policy."
"I think it is important that the Commission and the Member States implement a policy towards national, ethnic and cultural minorities, paying particular attention to a multicultural approach and allowing access to quality education in order to avoid double discrimination."
"I voted in favour of this report as it has the potential to eliminate stereotypes discriminating against women in the workplace."
"in writing. - (FR) The progress made when it comes to equality between men and women in the field of education is mainly quantitative. From now on, we need to fight for a qualitative improvement and for a change in attitudes, paying particular attention to the situation of girls and young women, who are the victims of two-fold discrimination."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report by Mrs FlasarovÃ¡, which recommends to the Commission and the Member States that they put in place a policy targeted at national, ethnic and cultural minorities, ensuring in particular that a multicultural approach is adopted and permitting access to high-quality education, and this with a view to preventing two-fold discrimination."
"The report also asks the Member States to make the option of lifelong education available to women and men who choose to look after their children and to make it easier for women to obtain jobs involving responsibility and decision-making."
"Finally, the Member States and the Commission should use all the means available to them to eliminate the stereotypes that contribute to discrimination against women in the workplace."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by United Kingdom MEP Mr Deva on EU relations with the Pacific Islands, calling for a strategy for a strengthened partnership."
"The EU has a significant presence in the Pacific Islands, against a backdrop of the majority of island states in the Pacific having recently gained their independence."
"The policy of helping the poorest island countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals is a decent and legitimate ambition for the EU."
"Whether we are talking about issues such as fisheries, the problem of climate change, the protection of biodiversity, farming and tourism, providing funding for infrastructure, support for education, the fight against corruption, support for democracy in the parliaments of these countries and the use of the euro, there are many areas in which the presence of the EU can bring unquestionable added value, but much remains to be done."
"in writing. - (FR) After 30 years of EU-Pacific cooperation, it is now time to move up a gear."
"That is why I am delighted about the adoption of this 'strategy for a strengthened partnership'."
"It entails a strengthening of political dialogue inasmuch as we have to support our Pacific partners in their efforts to overcome ethnic tensions, as in Fiji, or to promote reconciliation after a civil war, as in the Solomon Islands or in Timor Leste."
"Over the next few years, this political dialogue must also enable us to face a major challenge together: that of global warming."
"In order to launch this enhanced political dialogue, we can join with our regional partners in organising the 'regional conferences' provided for by the new Cotonou Agreement."
"The strategy involves common responses to the economic and social problems of the region and, here too, the priority is to attain the Millennium Development Goals within the timescales set."
"The ongoing negotiations on the conclusion of an EU-Pacific regional partnership agreement appear to have got off to a bad start in this respect."
"Most of the proposals of the countries in the region have been rejected by the Commission."
"It would be paradoxical to vote today in favour of a strategy for a strengthened partnership aimed at development only to find that, tomorrow, the conclusion of a bad economic partnership agreement emptied it of all content."
"I voted in favour of this report and welcome the fact that it calls for the banning of nuclear tests and that the Pacific region should be made nuclear-free."
"In view of the fact that some EU Member States have a historical relationship and continued links with this region, either in political or in cultural and economic terms, the EU as a whole should strengthen these ties for the mutual benefit of both the countries in the region and EU Member States."
"Given the heterogeneity of the region, the dispersal of its communities and the specific problems arising from the insular nature of many of the countries in the region, there needs to be a European approach that is both flexible and balanced, with Europe already one of the biggest international donors."
"Coming from Portugal as I do, I can only welcome the rapporteur's calls for the Commission to set up programmes aimed at combating malaria in East Timor."
"I feel, though, that this call should be extended to other infectious and contagious diseases that are also devastating the country."
"I also welcome the attention drawn to the particular problems of Timor and endorse the call for the Commission to support the Timorese leaders in their efforts to build a democratic, stable, peaceful, free, prosperous and fair society."
"in writing. - (FR) In the Pacific Ocean, fishing constitutes a vital resource for the local economies, and ships from all over the world, and in particular from Europe, operate there."
"That is the justification for consulting the Committee on Fisheries, of which I am a member, on this report."
"The Committee on Development and its rapporteur sought to impose this report on us in October, with no possibility of its being amended, and its request was rejected."
"The Committee on Fisheries has therefore been able to propose improvements to the report in the form of better regional cooperation and, above all, the inclusion of overseas countries and territories."
"The opinion of the Committee on Fisheries was adopted unanimously by its members in November."
"What now happens is that, on the eve of the debate in plenary, we are told that our opinion will not in the end be included and that only a few arbitrarily selected aspects of our opinion will be proposed as new amendments."
"In view of our indignation, it was decided to add our opinion to the final report as an 'erratum/addendum', without a vote, which is scarcely any better."
"The strategy in question was designed, in particular, to strengthen the political dialogue between the EU and the Pacific islands."
"More dialogue between our parliamentary committees, which are not, for their part, separated by thousands of kilometres, would certainly be just as desirable."
"in writing. (SV) If a new company statute is to be established at European level, it is important for existing legislation in the Member States on workers' influence, codecision and representation on boards not to be impaired."
"Of the amendments tabled prior to the vote, we have therefore chosen to support those by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, because they are better than the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by Mr Lehne, which sends a very important message to the Commission on the need to provide entrepreneurs with a means of ensuring the functioning and development of their businesses in the internal market."
"Like Mr Lehne, I feel that the time has come to enact laws to set up the European Private Company as a reliable legal form for small and medium-sized undertakings (SMEs) engaged in cross-border business."
"It is not possible, on a sustainable basis, to try to construct the internal market without simplifying life for SMEs that want to develop."
"The report contains some very interesting proposals, for example to allow SMEs with capital of EUR 10 000 to have a single entity that can develop in all European countries without having to register in each Member State, and whereby one single set of European rules is observed, rather than various national regulations."
"Naturally, workers' rights are not affected by these proposals, which deal solely with the European Private Company."
"I voted in favour of this report as the public hearing held in the Committee on Legal Affairs on 22 June 2006 underscored the need for an European Private Company as a legal form for small and medium-sized undertakings engaged in cross-border business."
"In order to consolidate the single market and thereby achieve the desired improvement in the economic and social conditions in the Community, one clear priority is the elimination of barriers to trade."

"The final draft of the agenda for this sitting, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents meeting on Thursday, 8 February 2007, in accordance with Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been circulated."
"It has been requested that the draft be amended as follows:"
"- Tuesday:"
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the report by Mr Lehne on the exercise of certain rights attached to voting shares, which was to have been voted on in accordance with Rule 131, be debated and put on the agenda for Thursday afternoon at 3 p.m."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, it is repeatedly made clear to us by the various discussions in the media that this is an important subject; it is one that we should not simply let pass on the nod, and I hope that the rapporteur, too, can agree with us on that."
"As you mentioned, there are two possibilities: Thursday afternoon might well be one of them, but, as there are - or so I gather - fewer Members pressing to speak on Thursday morning, that might be another option, and then the vote could be held at Thursday lunchtime."
"Both are workable options."
"We would prefer Thursday morning, but have no objection to the afternoon."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not, of course, have any objection to this subject being debated;"
"I am happy to see one. I would only ask, though, that the vote on it should be held this week, since the committees have come to an amicable agreement on this and the Council intends to agree to whatever we adopt in this House relatively rapidly and promptly."
"If we are to take this legislative report on Thursday afternoon, it would probably not be advisable to vote on it at the same time, and hence my request that the debate be scheduled either on Thursday morning or on Wednesday evening, since there are windows left on both days."
"If we do that, we could vote on Thursday at midday."
"(DE) Mr President, yes, of course, we can have the vote on Thursday afternoon."
"There is a reason why I find Wednesday problematic, and it is that I gather that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would like to have Darfur put on the agenda, the plan being, I believe, for this to be discussed on Wednesday evening, but we would like to have the Gahler report moved to Wednesday, on the grounds that a large number of Members have indicated their desire to speak to the reports by Mrs Batzeli, Mr Goepel and Mrs Hall, so we are not going to manage with the time available."
"We would be very satisfied if it were possible to discuss Mr Lehne's report on Thursday morning and to vote on it at noon."
"(Parliament adopted the motion.)"
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has asked that Mr Gahler's report on budget aid to developing countries be moved to Wednesday evening."
"Mr Swoboda has the floor in order to explain why."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, as I have just explained, I am working on the assumption that Darfur - which also has to do with development issues - is going to be debated on Wednesday evening."
"We would like the Gahler report to be debated that evening as well."
"We have informed our group of this, but I do not know whether the rapporteur is aware of this or whether he can manage that time."
"The fact is that we will be having a lot of speakers to the other reports, particularly to Mrs Batzeli's, wine being such an important subject, especially in terms of Europe's agricultural development, and so, if that were possible, we would be very much in favour of it."
"Mr Gahler has indicated his agreement, and so the formal requirement has been met."
"(Parliament adopted the motion.)"
"- Wednesday:"
"The Group of the European People's Party and the Group of the Liberals have requested the inclusion of statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Darfur, with a debate to be concluded by motions for a resolution."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I should like to speak briefly in support of this motion from the PPE-DE Group and the ALDE Group."
"Darfur should be a priority debate in Parliament this week and we believe it would be a missed opportunity to delay that debate and resolution until next month."
"What continues to happen in Darfur is an international scandal in humanitarian terms."
"The Council has today released its conclusions on Sudan and the UN Human Rights Council is trying to get an assessment mission into Darfur as we speak, so the international focus is on Darfur right now."
"This Parliament should also be having its say."
"That is why the PPE-DE Group and, I believe, the ALDE Group are so insistent on a debate as well as a resolution this week."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, needless to say, the Social Democrats wholeheartedly endorse the request for a debate on Darfur, since the emergency situation is critical and violations persist."
"The problem is extensive, and we - the European Union, its Member States, and the European Council - have an important part to play in this."
"That is why it is important that we have this debate."
"The problem, though, is vast, and our fellow Member was right to point that out."
"He made a valid point when he asked the Council and Commission to make a statement."
"As I understand it, we have to hold a debate on Wednesday evening, and neither the Council nor the Commission will be present or provide a statement."
"We will be thrashing things out among ourselves, and that will, of course, be very unfortunate."
"Whilst I, on behalf of the Social Democrats, wholeheartedly support the request, I very much hope that we can also have a serious debate involving the Council and Commission."
"That is, after all, what gives our debate real substance and political meaning."
"(Parliament adopted the motion.)"
"Mr President, may I enquire why you have not made use of Rule 156 of the Rules of Procedure in relation to the reports from the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners?"
"Given the extraordinarily large number of amendments tabled, it would be appropriate to make use of a rule that was tailor-made for this sort of situation."
"Rule 156 was added to the Rules of Procedure in the reform three years ago in order to provide a filter when we are faced with a very long voting time."
"This would enable the committee concerned to vote and to see which amendments have a sufficient degree of support to merit this House's time being used up in voting on them."
"All those amendments that have almost no support would be filtered out and save the rest of us an enormous amount of time."
"Mr Corbett, this matter was discussed in the Conference of Presidents last week and the majority was against using that procedure."
"In that case, Mr President, I just wonder when on earth we would ever make use of that rule."
"It was added to the Rules precisely to save the time of this House in this sort of situation."
"I must express my surprise at the decision of the Conference of Presidents."
"You have every right to express your surprise at this decision."
"There are two aspects: first, the majority in the Conference of Presidents; and then, regardless of that majority, the fact that the President can take a decision one way or the other."
"This is a further aspect of the question and one which will certainly be considered in greater depth in future in the light of your remarks."
"(FR) Mr President, if my memory serves me correctly, the Conference of Presidents objected to the report being referred to committee."
"However, if I have correctly understood what Mr Corbett just said, this is a different matter."
"If I have understood him correctly, he is proposing not to submit to the vote amendments that received an extremely low number of votes in committee, which is a different matter."
"I do not believe that we spoke of this aspect in the Conference of Presidents."
"OK, but even that would require a meeting of the committee responsible."
"(FR) Mr President, I understood what Mr Corbett was proposing, and that was for the committee to meet tomorrow evening in order to sift through the 180 amendments, so as not to submit in plenary those that did not receive at least 10% of the votes in committee."
"If I have understood him correctly, Mr Corbett feels that this requires a meeting to be held in committee tomorrow evening."
"The problem is that his committee ceased to exist at the end of January."
"Now, if I am not a complete fool, we are in February, and the mandate given to the committee by Parliament expired at the end of January."
"Therefore, I should like Mr Corbett to explain to me how a committee can vote on things that no longer exist."
"In theory, we would need to reinstate this committee, which could then meet tomorrow evening, and sift through the amendments."
"I really do not care;"
"I am simply saying to you that this is the problem."
"Mr President, I think the answer is easy: Rule 156 gives complete discretion to the President of our House."
"If he chooses to reconvene the committee at a special meeting tomorrow to filter the amendments so that we here only need to vote on those that get more than 10% support, then he is free to do so under Rule 156."
"Rule 156 gives the President enormous power in this respect, even if the Conference of Presidents disagrees with him."
"That is, in principle, the case, but the President does of course regard the consent of the majority in this House as important, especially when dealing with such thorny issues, and that is why the Conference of Presidents ended up, in agreement with him, deciding as it has done."
"I think the vast majority of us would like to vote on Wednesday, and that is the idea behind the whole discussion."
"For the future we will go deeper into the discussion and keep in contact with everybody who might have remarks to make."
"(The agenda was therefore adopted.)"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"We now come to the one-minute speeches on important political issues."
"(MT) Mr President, last week the European cruise industry organised a one-day conference in Brussels for all the stakeholders in the industry."
"During this conference a report was presented concerning the extremely important contribution that this industry has to make to Europe."
"Amongst other things, it was announced that the cruise industry is responsible for providing around 190 000 jobs within Europe."
"I believe, Mr President, that this Parliament ought to recognise the importance of this industry, and, consequently, the European Union must do its utmost to pay greater attention to it and place it within the policies it develops."
"Thank you."
"(EL) Mr President, the Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink was murdered recently by extreme nationalists in Istanbul."
"The constant threats against his life forced the writer Orhan Pamouk to leave Turkey and take refuge in the United States of America."
"The unchecked activities of extremists and the worrying increase in nationalism are not just an internal problem for Turkey; they are a matter for every European democrat."
"It is a question of solidarity with the democratic movement in Turkey which is fighting under difficult conditions for an area of freedom of expression and dignity."
"Rhetorical declarations of sympathy are no longer enough."
"Collective initiatives and action are needed on the part of the European Union and, in particular, on the part of the European Parliament."
"Initiatives must be taken immediately towards the Turkish Government by you, Mr President, and by all the political groups."
"I therefore propose that plenary should adopt a motion for a resolution as a first specific step in the condemnation of the nationalism and terrorism threatening the weak democratic fabric in Turkish society."
"(LT) Mr President, 16 February is the day that Lithuania celebrates the Restoration of Statehood; however, in the calendar produced for the Members of the European Parliament, it is indicated that we celebrate our National Day not on 16 February, but on 1 February."
"Furthermore, in this calendar the dates of four of my country's public holidays are mixed up."
"Just imagine: the calendar states that St John's Day, which all of the Christian world celebrates on 24 June, is celebrated in Lithuania on 1 June."
"This is absurd, total carelessness on the part of parliamentary staff."
"I understand, Mr President, that you were not responsible for these mistakes at the time; nonetheless, I would prefer that, in future, you and other managers of Parliament do not allow such errors to occur."
"The purpose of these calendars is to enable us to get to know our colleagues from other countries better, including their public holidays."
"But in regard to Lithuania, the calendar is a total collection of errors."
"We will check that and get the right date put in, namely 16 February."
"The twenty-fourth day of June is the Feast of St John the Baptist."
"(PL) Mr President, the events of the last few days have shown once again what the meat dispute between Russia and Poland is really about."
"It is political and it is about, on the one hand, an attempt by Russia to punish Poland for the independent and democratic direction of Poland's political changes and the withdrawal from Russian influence, and on the other it is a test of the unity of the European Union and an attempt to undermine its solidarity."
"The Russian political elite is watching carefully to see whether or not the European Union will unite to stand behind one of its members."
"I am convinced that the time for the European Union to grasp the nettle, to state its position and to deploy effective instruments to resolve this dispute is long overdue."
"All previous attempts have been fruitless."
"The only solution is to raise the issue in no uncertain terms and to show Russia that it has to deal with the might of the entire European Union."
"(DA) Mr President, last Friday, something happened that ought not to have happened."
"Contrary to the EU's nature protection directives, the Polish authorities gave permission for the Via Baltica road to be built."
"The plan is for it to go right through a Natura 2000 area in one of Europe's genuinely unique areas of natural beauty."
"This happened in spite of the fact that, back in December, the European Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Poland."
"Now, the green light has been given for contractors to begin felling 20 000 trees this week."
"It is scandalous that the authorities of an EU country should be consciously infringing EU legislation."
"It is not only appalling for the natural environment, it also in fact undermines legal certainty and the EU's reputation and may become a slippery slope whereby environmental legislation and environmental considerations are set aside as people see fit."
"I therefore very much hope that the Commission will live up to its responsibilities, follow up its letter of formal notice as quickly as possible and put a stop to what Poland has set in motion."
"(PT) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to welcome the victory of the 'yes' vote in yesterday's referendum in Portugal on the decriminalisation of the voluntary termination of pregnancy in the first ten weeks, on the woman's volition."
"This result puts an end to all the false obstacles thus far created, including yesterday's referendum, blocking the Portuguese Parliament from exercising its legitimate legal powers on this issue."
"The time has now come to make up for years and years of lost time."
"I should like to thank all the MEPs from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, who for years have shown solidarity with the struggle of Portuguese women, many of whom suffer the undignified and inhumane experience of being put on trial for abortion."
"Yesterday's result is an important victory for Portuguese women and for all those who, like us, have fought for decades for an end to backstreet abortions, for the promotion of women's health and for free, aware and responsible parenthood."
"(PL) Mr President, despite the European Union's purported task of establishing a zone of freedom, security and justice, the European media make accusations and persistent attacks against public figures, particularly when they are ideologically inconvenient."
"For this reason we are appealing for, and have drawn up a petition asking for media persecution and terrorism to be treated as acts of violence that threaten human rights."
"Without any proof, the media have lynch-mobbed a Polish archbishop for the purpose of preventing him from becoming the Metropolitan Bishop of Warsaw."
"Similarly, the European media have been pillorying Pope Benedict XVI and have for years been slandering the charismatic monk who created the only truly free radio station in Poland, along with others who oppose the ideas of the logic of disintegration that characterises the new left."
"We appeal with the greatest insistence for the values on which the European Union is based, namely human dignity, freedom, democracy and equality, human rights and the right to profess one's religion, to be respected."
"Mr President, this is the third time I have taken the opportunity to use a one-minute speech to bring to the attention of this House the fact that another poultry-processing factory in Northern Ireland has closed with a substantial loss of jobs."
"It seems to me that we are continuing to lose jobs within the European Union."
"We are allowing cheap poultry meat to be imported into the European Union, produced at lower standards than those imposed on our farmers and our processors within the European Union, and putting our own people out of jobs."
"In my opinion we are also risking the health of the people of the European Union because this poultry meat imported into the European Union does not meet the same high standards that we expect here."
"There is a lot more I could say on this."
"It seems that we continue to ignore the dangers of this, and I have to warn this House that we do so at our peril if we put our people, farmers and workers at risk."
"The Commission must investigate this and try to put a stop to it."
"(FI) Mr President, since the 1960s, 14 people have died in Italy in football riots."
"Last week, a policeman with a family was killed in Sicily when spectators threw a bomb at him."
"There are problems, however, all over Europe."
"It is sad and shameful for Europe that football breeds violence both on and off the pitch."
"All those involved in football need to work together to defend the sport's tarnished reputation."
"Zero tolerance on racism and violence would seem to be the only way to combat these problems."
"Penal measures are not working: we have to come down hard on the clubs in terms of financial penalties, as has now been done."
"Suspending matches and playing to empty stadiums will hurt the clubs' pockets."
"This way, they will not be able to neglect their responsibility to improve security for long."
"This way, the clubs will also start to show a genuine interest in keeping their supporters under control."
"Mr President, today I would like to link two issues together."
"First of all, the comments from President Barroso with regard to the holding of referenda on the draft constitution."
"His inference was that countries might consider not holding referenda."
"Well, coming from a country where a referendum must be held on these issues, I find this extremely puzzling to say the least."
"On the one hand we have Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m talking about plan 'D' for democracy and dialogue and debate and engaging our citizens; on the other hand we have the comments from President Barroso."
"At the end of the day, are we supposed just to inform and consult and debate and discuss with our citizens, but not to trust them when it comes to voting?"
"The other issue I wish to highlight is that a bill is currently being debated in the Irish Parliament that would give sweeping and retrospective powers to ministers to create indictable offences in order to comply with European legislation."
"In this context, the directly-elected Irish Parliament would be bypassed."
"So, on the one hand we are bypassing citizens; on the other hand bypassing national parliaments."
"I have to say, as a committed European, I think these are worrying times for the EU."
"Mr President, last week the Russian authorities presented new charges against the former Yukos managers, Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev, who were already sentenced two years ago on highly questionable grounds."
"Many Members of this Parliament have followed with great concern the fate of these two men, who can be classed as political prisoners."
"A new sentence will probably mean their moral and political execution."
"I suggest that a temporary committee should be set up to investigate politically motivated trials and murders which, unfortunately, are continuing in Russia, despite the concern expressed today."
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to raise an issue relating to European policy, which is of the utmost importance: the fight against extremism, which is sadly developing throughout Europe right now."
"The democratic parties on the right and left, the Liberals, the Greens - all the parties represented here, in this House - have unanimously declared the need to distance themselves from any form of extremism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and minority exclusion."
"We have managed, in this House, to quarantine-off extremists."
"That is a huge achievement."
"Ladies and gentlemen, can you imagine the vice-president of the UMP in France or the vice-president of the CDU in Germany taking the floor during a demonstration in which extremists are present and banners with neo-Nazi slogans are brandished, and not distancing himself?"
"I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that all the parties present in this House should stand back from the extremists on all sides, who are wreaking havoc throughout the countries of Europe."
"(ET) Although today is 12 February, I would like to return to the end of January for a moment."
"On the evening of 25 January, Galina Kozlova, wife of Vladimir Kozlov, Chairman of the Council of Mari El and 2006 winner of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, was brutally attacked in Yoshkar-Ola."
"Galina Kozlova was brought to the neurosurgery department of Yoshkar-Ola City Hospital with cranial damage and a concussion, as well as damage to her sight resulting from the use of nerve gas in the attack."
"In spring 2005, Parliament passed a resolution on the violation of human rights and democracy in the Mari Republic in the Russian Federation."
"As you remember, this resolution stated that journalists that are not part of the state-controlled media continue to be attacked, persecuted and disregarded."
"In 2001, three journalists were killed, and on 4 February 2005, Vladimir Kozlov himself was seriously beaten."
"I regret, Mr President and esteemed colleagues, that I must inform you that the situation with regard to minorities and human rights in the Mari Republic has not improved since that time."
"(PL) Mr President, MEPs are not subject to anybody's orders."
"That is what the electoral rules say in our countries."
"But what is the situation like on the ground?"
"We have in recent days been observing infringements of the independence of MEPs."
"Parliament has undergone a crisis regarding the election of the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"On the basis of earlier decisions by the CD coalition, this post was awarded to the Polish Member, Mr Saryusz-Wolski."
"Since then the Poles have been subjected to disgraceful pressure."
"The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, telephoned the head of the party applying to chair this committee of the European Parliament and asked him to withdraw the nomination."
"The ex-chancellor, Helmut Kohl, telephoned a Polish politician for the same reason."
"Furthermore, former Austrian Chancellor SchÃ¼ssel, together with the prime minister of Luxembourg, sent a special letter about this to the EPL fraction."
"All of this in an effort to ensure that the European Parliament's foreign policy is conducted by the previous president, the German politician, Mr Brok."
"Is that what is called free and unfettered exercise of the duty of an MEP?"
"I think not, Mr President."
"Interference in this matter by the highest authorities in Germany, Austria and Luxembourg is an infringement of the independence of this House, and makes a mockery of democracy."
"I ask that the independence of this House be protected in the future."
"(DE) Mr President, I would also like to mention the political detainees Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, who have been charged again, on the basis of obscure accusations, in order to prevent their early release, for which Russian law makes provision."
"It is by these means that the justice system is continuing its absurd and clearly politically motivated show trial of Yukos' former owners."
"Khodorkovsky's commitment to a more democratic Russian society made him an opponent of Putin, and, their major oil group having been broken up, the greater part of the owners' shares are now in the hands of the state."
"If Russia disregards basic human rights - and we have just heard of it doing so in Munich too - then that makes it a very problematic partner for the EU."
"We in this House should monitor this trial on the ground and protest against such practices."
"(SL) On 1 February this year, unidentified persons set fire to a nursery school in Trieste for children from the Slovene minority."
"As a result, the children had to be moved to other, temporary premises."
"Similar incidents directed against the Slovene minority have taken place in the past, for instance when a Slovene primary school was set on fire."
"Despite six years of promises, the building has still not been repaired."
"For this reason, Slovene parents fear that the same thing might also happen in this case."
"The Slovene minority demands, quite justifiably, that the authorities in Trieste find and punish the arsonists and protect the Slovene minority from similar incidents in the future."
"They also expect the children's nursery and school to be repaired as soon as possible."
"I would like to draw the attention of this House to the fact that, despite many recent promises, the Italian authorities are still failing to implement in full the legal protection granted to the Slovene minority."
"(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, Ahtisaari's Kosovo report is complete."
"In Munich, President Putin explicitly stated Russia's objectives in the world and in Europe."
"The time for waiting is over; now is the time to act."
"The EU's help in leading the Western Balkans towards stability will be the moment of truth for the European Union's foreign and security policy."
"The best way to solve the Kosovo question is to obtain Serbia's support, and in order to do that we must support the democratic forces in that country."
"We must confirm that we support the continued rapprochement between Serbia and the European Union as soon as that may be possible."
"We must state which criteria will decide whether the continuation of that process is possible."
"The Serbian Government, which is implementing the fundamental values of the European Union - democracy, human rights and the rule of law - must merit our support on their journey towards joining Europe."
"Thus we will be able to foil Russia's threat to veto the Kosovo plan in the UN and use Kosovo as a pretext to support separatists in countries that are part of the European Union's neighbourhood policy."
"(SV) Mr President, as a former fellow Member stated, a significant referendum took place in Portugal yesterday."
"As you are no doubt aware, it was about no longer treating women who terminate a pregnancy up until the tenth week as criminals."
"The Portuguese people voted in favour of the proposal."
"I wish to congratulate the women of Portugal on having taken this step towards taking charge of their own bodies."
"I also wish to thank our Portuguese fellow Members and those parties that have conducted such an objective, serious and informative campaign."
"Each Member State is entitled to take its own decisions concerning reproductive rights."
"These are matters that each country has to decide for itself."
"However, it is extremely important for us to be able to reach across national borders in providing information, putting forward shared opinions and showing solidarity with women."
"I hope that Malta, Poland and Ireland will be able to follow Portugal's example."
"(SK) On 22 January radio broadcasting by the BBC was discontinued in Slovakia on the grounds that it was broadcast in English, which is not permitted under a notoriously anti-European national language law enacted in 1995."
"Under this law, no radio frequency may be allocated to broadcasts in a foreign language."
"The termination of BBC broadcasting has caused great disappointment among Slovak citizens, all the more for the fact that the current government has been emphasising the need to improve foreign language education, of which the BBC was a model."
"Although the culture ministry too realises how absurd such regulations are, it is planning to impose stricter controls and sanctions, rather than coming up with a positive solution."
"The free movement of services is one of the basic principles of the European Union, and information dissemination cannot be made conditional upon the language in which the information is conveyed."
"This case proves that the language law in question does not comply with the principles of cultural and linguistic diversity or the values of the European Union."
"Mr President, I wish to raise the event last week in Paris where the International Treaty to outlaw enforced disappearances by governments was opened for signature."
"Fifty-seven states signed it and I congratulate them."
"I regret that my own country, Ireland, was not among them."
"Over 50 000 people have been disappeared by governments over the last 25 years."
"Forty thousand of them are still missing and their families do not know if they are dead or alive."
"It is astonishing to me that only eight EU Member States signed last week, given that it was agreed last November, following five years of negotiations and a twenty-year campaign."
"There are also worrying reports that the United States and some EU Member States are going to refuse to sign this Treaty."
"The reason I am raising it here, Mr President, is that I would ask you to have the Commission and the Council clarify in this House that all EU Member States are committed to this Treaty and will sign it without delay."
"(HU) The Cuban dictatorship, through the medium of its party newspaper Gramma, accused some new Member States of conspiracy against Havana."
"True, the accused states, for example the Czech Republic and Poland, have often raised their voices recently on behalf of Cuban democracy."
"However, their efforts can only be crowned with success if the European Union takes a united stand in defence of the island state's democratic forces."
"Even in the midst of its own reforms, the EU has to find a way to lend support to those dissenters, inside as well as outside of Cuba, who are raising their voices ever more loudly."
"Indeed, the role of Europe in the world will be defined not only by its economic performance but by its commitment, expressed in actions, to the cause of freedom."
"Though hundreds are still in prison for political reasons, in my opinion the Fidel Castro brand of socialist dictatorship is already on its last legs."
"But for this to herald the advent of democracy, the international community, including the European Union, must stand up unambiguously for fundamental freedoms."
"I would like to explain that one factor borne in mind when choosing speakers is who spoke last time."
"You may be wondering why one person or another has not been called."
"It always, to some small degree, works on the basis that if you got the floor last time, you do not necessarily get given it today, and so the last speaker to be called is Mr Papastamkos, who did not get the chance to speak last time."
"(EL) Mr President, five years on from the introduction of the euro, the Union is still not offering equal terms of competition, be it for credit cards or when changing banks by transferring an account to another bank or for other banking transactions."
"Consumers throughout Europe are forced to bear unjustifiably high charges."
"Also, charges are subject to impressive fluctuations of up to 400% for commercial transactions on credit cards."
"According to the Commission, bank charges cost European companies about EUR 25 billion a year."
"The message I wish to send the Commission is about whether it intends to exercise all its powers under Community legislation, by which I mean in practice and not just with declarations of a proclamatory nature."
"It is high time a single payment area was created."
"That concludes this item on the agenda."
"Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) (debate)"
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, finally, we are about to reap the rewards of more than two and a half years of sustained commitment by a huge number of people, both in the Commission and in Parliament, who firmly believe in the added value of the INSPIRE Directive for environmental policy in the European Union."
"I know for a fact that this is not the sexiest issue we have ever discussed here, and given the highly technical content, everyone assumed that an agreement at first reading was on the cards."
"This was, however, overlooking the fact that some Member States were dead set against any form of harmonisation of spatial environmental information, and that were, above all, also concerned about compensation and licences and saw this initiative as a threat to national monopolies."
"No fewer than five Council presidencies had INSPIRE listed as a priority, but it was the Finnish Presidency that managed, during the night of 21 November 2006, to persuade the Member States to end their resistance."
"I should also like to take this opportunity of warmly thanking everyone who has done their bit to achieve this success, not least the Commissioner and his staff."
"They have done much of the groundwork, in tandem with an international team of experts that has responded with particular enthusiasm, as a result of which no time has been lost."
"I should also like to make a point of thanking the shadow rapporteurs and their staff, Parliament's Legal Office, the Secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the conciliation secretariat, the Council presidency and all their staff."
"Having discussed the procedure, I should now like to turn to the content."
"As you know, INSPIRE seeks to set up an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe in an attempt to assist environmental policy at every level."
"Everyone will be agreed that sound policy can only be adopted on the basis of information that is reliable and of the highest quality."
"When drafting fresh policy measures, policy makers must allow for the fact that problems that affect today's quality of life have become ever more intertwined and complex."
"The areas to which the Sixth Environmental Programme gives attention are this reliable knowledge along with informed participation on the part of the public."
"The directive that we hope to approve tomorrow sets down the objectives, and the Member States now have two years to fine-tune their national legislation and administrative procedures."
"In other words, by the next European elections, INSPIRE will be a fait accompli and will be based on the existing infrastructure for spatial data of the different Member States."
"After all, via a geo-portal, INSPIRE will offer Member States the opportunity of making all geographical databases available as a first step towards harmonisation."
"This idea, which everyone obviously welcomes as such, was, however, the cause of heated discussions within some Member States that were anxious to protect their returns on the sale of geographical data, but also with regard to access to information, wanted to impose stricter restrictions than provided for in the Treaty of Aarhus."
"It is precisely these two latter challenges that have prevented Parliament from reaching agreement with the Council at second reading."
"I should like to repeat to the House that I am delighted that during the conciliation procedure, we managed to ensure that in general, services for searching and consulting spatial information must be made available free of charge."
"Only if the conditions are clearly formulated can compensation be applied for so as not to jeopardise the financial viability of some government services."
"As for intellectual property rights, Parliament has decided to impose the provisions of the Treaty of Aarhus concerning access to information in environmental matters to the letter and thus not to admit any stricter restrictions on the basis of confidentiality, in line with the Council's request."
"I think we have struck an honourable compromise, and I hope that tomorrow, Parliament will be supporting this agreement unanimously so that implementation can really start in the Member States."
"I would like to add a brief comment about the scope of applications."
"This is virtually inexhaustible once the loopholes have been plugged and inconsistencies between European geographical databases have been resolved, which at the moment, often make planning impossible and, in certain cases, even cause chaos."
"The system as it stands is essential to improve and manage the water quality in Europe."
"The information collected can also help prevent and control floods."
"All in all, I would go so far as to say that INSPIRE is a valuable addition to existing environmental legislation in the European Union, and we will follow its transposition in the Member States from close range and with much interest."
"Îember of the Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating you on your election to the office of president;"
"I am sure that you will meet all the expectations of European citizens and of those who elected you."
"I shall be very brief."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my warmest thanks to the parliamentary delegation involved in the compromise proceedings with the Council on 21 November 2006."
"In particular, I should like to thank and congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras, who headed the parliamentary delegation and, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, whom I should like to praise and thank in particular for her exceptional contribution to the discussions throughout the negotiations."
"We have secured a sound basis on which to build an integrated infrastructure for spatial information in Europe."
"We need this infrastructure for the following reasons:"
"First of all, good legislative arrangements are based on good information."
"Good information means integrated analyses of the environmental problems we face, the reasons for them and the possible repercussions of various solutions."
"These analyses depend on geographical data."
"At the moment, our policy making is hampered by the fact that these data are scattered over various databases which are difficult to access."
"In addition, different data storage rules are used, with the result that it is impossible to combine them with other data, which would facilitate policymaking."
"I am delighted that we managed to overcome the final difficulties and reach a satisfactory result."
"The Commission approves the text of the compromise unreservedly and I would like to urge Parliament to accept the good result achieved by its negotiating team."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Dimas."
"Speaking personally, let me say that I am very appreciative of your good wishes and we will continue to work well together."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Mr President, first, as a member of the Conciliation Committee, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, and the delegation chairman, Mr Vidal-Quadras, for their excellent work."
"The Finnish Presidency also deserves credit for the conciliation process."
"The success of the Community's environment policy is largely dependent on the availability of scientific information and the smooth flow of such information."
"So this proposal for a directive, which has come about through conciliation, and which will establish a legal framework for establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe, is a precondition for scientific evaluations carried out on the basis of environmental legislation."
"At various stages of the debate on INSPIRE, the main aim was to remove some of the barriers that in particular hamper the shared use of environmental data among authorities."
"In conciliation, general agreement was reached on the principles enabling authorities and other Community bodies to use cartographic and other special data within the scope of this directive and now in the possession of other authorities."
"A good end result was also achieved with regard to public access to information."
"In the future, a wider range of Internet services relating to the environment will be available."
"These services, meant for the general public, will in most cases be free."
"It will be permitted to charge for rapidly changing information, such as certain weather information services."
"Even before INSPIRE, the Community used certain instruments to enable it first to promote the accessibility of reliable information, especially information on the public sector, and later on to harmonise information in order to make comparisons possible at Community level."
"One of them is the Directive on Public Access to Environmental Information, for which I was rapporteur."
"The problems noticed during the debate on this have been taken into account in preparing INSPIRE, and I would like to thank everyone warmly for that."
"All in all, the directive will create a sound and viable basis for developing spatial information infrastructures in the European Community and making it possible to maintain quality data and services in the Member States."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) I would like firstly to congratulate Mrs Brepoels and the other Members for their work on the drawing up of this report."
"I believe the result to be positive, thanks to the work of this House, which has improved it considerably, to the efforts that the Commission has made in helping us - I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Sornosa - and also, lastly, to the understanding of the Council in the Conciliation Committee."
"I have absolutely no doubt about the usefulness of this proposal as a fundamental tool for drawing up, applying, monitoring and evaluating environmental policies at all levels and policies or activities which may directly or indirectly affect the environment."
"Furthermore, we believe that it is appropriate to base this Community infrastructure on the spatial data infrastructures already established and managed by the Member States, in full application of the principle of subsidiarity, particularly when the Member States have several levels of public administration, as is often the case, in my country, Spain, for example."
"Network services are necessary in order to share spatial data across the various levels of public authority in the Community."
"Those services must make it possible to locate, process, view and download spatial data, and also to access spatial data and electronic commerce services."
"This instrument must serve to exploit as far as possible the benefits and possibilities that the globalisation of data and services offer to governments, to private enterprise, to universities, to society as a whole and, most importantly, to the citizens."
"I believe that it is essential because it brings us up to date with something that is already common as a result of the Internet and the information that it provides."
"I also believe that it is crucial that it has been designed as an instrument for providing public information."
"In this regard, we hope that INSPIRE complements public sector information and the directives on access to environmental information adopted in application of the Aarhus Convention, which we approved recently, and that it deal with a series of issues not provided for in those directives, such as the sharing of data amongst public authorities and issues of interoperability."
"Finally, I must express my satisfaction with the agreement reached by the Council with regard to free-of-charge access to the service, in the majority of cases, as well as the chapter relating to the confidentiality of data, which in the end will coincide with the provisions laid down in the Aarhus Convention, on public access to information on the environment."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Women in Turkey (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Bozkurt, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on women's role in the social, economic and political life in Turkey."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in two days' time, it will be Valentine's Day, day of love and affection."
"I could not imagine a nicer Valentine's present for women in Turkey than the adoption, tomorrow, of the report on women's rights."
"There are 40 million women in Turkey."
"They want to be given the opportunity of developing and improving their living conditions."
"My report alone will not be able to bring this about, but it is a means for the women and the women's movement in Turkey to claim their rights in respect of their husbands and their fathers, the Turkish Government, but also the European Union."
"My report is building on last year's findings."
"I have taken note of what has happened since then and what has not."
"Legislation, by and large, is now as it should be, even though a few things still need to be done in that area."
"The second step is creating a framework in which legislation can be implemented, that is to say sufficient funds and a well-trained government apparatus, with a government that shows sufficient commitment and is not afraid of making that commitment public."
"Only if the second step has been taken can we move on properly to the third step, when women notice improvement in their daily lives - a step which we have not yet reached."
"People are still working very hard on step two, and that is why women are still seeing little in the way of practical improvements to date, although the government is committed."
"Whilst two years ago, women's rights were not yet really an issue, these days, Prime Minister Erdogan opens nearly every speech with it."
"The different ministries too devote more attention to women's rights."
"Our report of last year has contributed to this, and we in this House should be proud of this."
"There are also better government instructions to officials and police on how to deal with women's rights."
"The police and the army are being trained and memos contain clear instructions for ministries and municipalities."
"These instructions, which are desperately needed, focus on blood feuds and violence against women."
"Indeed, the number of sentences that have been passed with regard to blood feuds is still giving a mixed picture."
"Some judges are tougher in their sentencing, while others are more lenient."
"This has got to stop."
"The report also contains other areas that need attention."
"Fighting violence against women must be priority number one in government policy for women."
"More refuge centres must be created which I intend to visit so as to monitor whether these places of safety meet the quality requirements."
"This year, a committee on women's rights and gender equality must be set up in the Turkish Parliament."
"A committee of this kind is indispensable if legislation is to take real account of gender issues, and is also an important and essential interlocutor for the European Parliament and the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly."
"More objective and accurate data are needed about the situation of women in Turkey, particularly in relation to violence, illiteracy and discrimination."
"Fortunately, this is an area that is being addressed by Turkey and the Commission together."
"Finally, there is a need for proper anti-discrimination policy if women are to be given full access to education and the labour market."
"I should like to make a brief comment about one compromise amendment that has been jointly tabled by the European People's Party, the Socialists, the Liberals and the European United Left, and about which I am sure you have received a huge number of letters."
"It is about the use of the words 'Kurdish minority' in the report."
"Kurds themselves, as well as the Turkish Government, have indicated that they have difficulty accepting these words."
"In order to avoid confusion, we have now decided to say that all women, irrespective of their race, language, origin, religion or political persuasion, must have access to women's rights programmes."
"In this light, I would urge you to support the compromise amendment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, 2007 will be an important test for Turkey to see how seriously this country is taking women's emancipation."
"That country has parliamentary elections coming up in November."
"Far too few women are taking part in politics at the moment."
"It is not that they are not there."
"Only two weeks ago, I spoke with women of nearly all political parties, but their names are not yet included in the electoral lists."
"How Turkey solves this, is up to Turkey. If, however, the political participation of women does not increase, then Turkey will not be able to say that it did not know what to do."
"The report contains suggestions, including temporary measures of positive discrimination."
"Temporary, because I am convinced that once women become more visible in politics, this will have a snowball effect."
"Girls need role models so that they can see that they too may be able to carve out a career in politics."
"I am hopeful for women in Turkey."
"The country is moving in the right direction, but should not backpedal."
"This is why I would make a plea for accelerating the implementation of reforms, and also for actually carrying them out."
"The accession negotiations with the EU can work as a catalyst in this respect."
"I hope that our report will be able to do its bit."
"I would like to thank you all for your support in advance."
"I am persuaded that the women in Turkey will also be indebted to you."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, first, I would like to congratulate Parliament and you, Mrs Bozkurt, on the report."
"It is an accurate and carefully balanced description of the situation as regards women's rights in Turkey and it is also a valuable contribution to the debate on women's role in the social, political and economic life of the country."
"There has indeed been progress in the area of women's rights: legislation has been passed; an Advisory Board on the Status of Women has been established; an official circular has been issued by the Prime Minister, instructing the administration to deal with domestic violence; a joint EU-Turkey project is setting up a database on violence against women; and the 'Let's go to school, girls' campaign has resulted in the enrolment of 177 000 girls in school."
"All this is positive and is acknowledged in the report."
"However, we also very much share your concerns as regards women's rights in Turkey."
"Women's participation in the labour market, political representation of women, education for girls and violence against women are areas of main concern and we concur with the thrust of the analysis and recommendations of the report."
"Low levels of participation by women and low employment rates, together with the large size of the informal economy, represent a major employment policy challenge."
"We also agree that political participation by women in Turkey is dramatically low and that important efforts have to be made to deal with this issue."
"In addition, we cannot agree more with the importance education has for the economic independence of women."
"You will know that gender equality is a major theme in the context of the political criteria."
"That is why the Commission follows all these issues closely as part of its regular monitoring."
"We also cover them in the context of the negotiations."
"We report regularly on the situation in the annual progress reports."
"Inadequacies are also raised in our bilateral monitoring meetings with the Turkish authorities."
"In the framework of our pre-accession assistance, the Commission also funds a number of projects aimed at promoting women's rights."
"Particular emphasis is given to violence against women."
"In 2007 we will support the establishment of eight shelters for women who have been subject to domestic violence."
"Gender equality is also given a high priority within the civil society dialogue between the EU and Turkey."
"This dialogue aims at improving mutual knowledge and understanding."
"Several projects have already been funded, including some involving women's NGOs."
"The Commission will continue to promote actively non-discrimination against women in all areas of life."
"This will include future projects."
"We will also continue to encourage civil society initiatives aimed at increasing public awareness, such as the 'Stop the Violence Against Women' campaign."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to our rapporteur for her work, and I welcome the lively and fruitful debate that took place within the committee responsible on women's role in the social, economic and political life in Turkey."
"I should like to make three points in connection with this debate."
"Firstly, there is still some misunderstanding in terms of the difference between the simple act of debating the role of women in Turkey and that of concluding from the debate whether Turkey can or cannot join the European Union."
"This merging of the two does not help us to focus on the role of women in Turkey, which is an issue in itself."
"In this House, we regularly debate the role of women in Afghanistan, the Maghreb and Africa, without Afghanistan, the Maghreb or Africa necessarily being called on to become members of the European Union."
"The same applies to Turkey."
"From this perspective, I also call on our counterpart from the Council of Europe to demonstrate responsibility and to conduct a dialogue with Turkey as a Member State of the Council of Europe."
"I call on my fellow Members to continue to focus on the role of women in Turkey."
"We, as women, represent added value for the common good of society; we bring about peace, we have knowledge to share and a special kind of wisdom to pass on, wherever we are, including in Turkey."
"Secondly, the debate on the role of women in Turkey reminds the EU Member States of their own responsibilities."
"How can we lecture Turkey when we are incapable of fulfilling our duties in our own countries?"
"We will only be able to criticise Turkey when we are ready to criticise ourselves."
"So let us not pretend to sermonise."
"Thirdly, we cannot tackle the situation of women by disregarding the role of men."
"The fact is that no one dares mention this obvious fact which, politically-speaking, is a very accurate one, but men also have a very important role to play where gender equality is concerned."
"During our meeting in Istanbul, Prime Minister Erdogan clearly confirmed his opposition to violence against women."
"I called on him to express himself publicly on this matter and to set a good example to Turkish men."
"It is not enough to be deeply convinced that violence is not a solution; he has to say it out loud, bolstered by his political reputation."
"That is why I am repeating my call to Mr Erdogan from this Chamber."
"Take a public stand against violence against women, including in your country."
"Mr Erdogan, set a good example of which men can be proud; we can then take a step forward together and improve the situation of women in your country."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to say 'thank you' to Mrs Bozkurt for having now presented the second report on behalf of the women's committee and for her very judicious and expert approach to the subject."
"The possibility of Turkey joining the European Union means that we in this House must give pride of place to respect for human rights - and in this specific instance women's rights as an integral element in them - as an indispensable precondition for its accession."
"Speaking as a member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I see three great blocks on which work is urgently needed."
"The first is education and the world of work; the unfortunate fact is that the presence of women on the labour market has decreased from 35% in 1998 to 25% today, even though there are hopeful signs in some areas - in the number of women practising as lawyers and physicians, for instance - but, if the Lisbon Strategy's targets, which include 60% participation of women in the labour market, are to be met, none of this fits together, and, if Turkey wants to be a candidate, it has to be well aware of that."
"Education is a key to bringing about development and change; unfortunately, particularly in eastern Turkey, a very large number of women are still excluded from it, and 25% of them are still illiterate."
"More also needs to be done - and as a matter of urgency - where the combating of violence is concerned."
"Mr ErdoÄan has committed himself to more being done on this front, but that is far from enough; the establishment of women's refuges would be another step in the right direction, and the public debate on violence against women and 'honour crimes' must go on."
"Finally, I have an appeal to make in relation to the Turkish elections; it is that there has to be discussion of quotas if Turkey is to continue to make progress."
"The existing level of women's participation in parliamentary life - 4% at the national level and 1% in the municipalities - is unsustainable, so urgent action, including such things as a quota system, needs to be taken to deal with this, and that will do a great service not only to women but also to cooperation between Europe and Turkey."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we are, today, discussing the situation of Turkish women, making recommendations and suggestions to Turkey, making demands of it and insisting that it make changes."
"This report by Mrs Bozkurt is a good one; it will move democracy forward and help to improve the conditions under which Turkish women live, yet all the things that we, this week, are enjoining on Turkey as it seeks accession are things that we would do well to act on ourselves."
"Let us, then, once and for all, stop denying fundamental rights to an ethnic group here in Europe."
"Let us enable them to put forward their demands and claims here in this House."
"Let us, at last, allow them to trade with the EU and with the rest of the world."
"Let us allow them to attend schools and universities legally, and let us recognise their qualifications."
"Let us allow them to participate in European sporting events."
"Let us do away with this discrimination within the EU."
"You will be aware of whom I am talking; I am talking about an ethnic group that, in 2004, and by an overwhelming majority, said 'yes' to the European Union and sought reunion with the other ethnic group in their homeland, and whose isolation we then promised to end."
"I am talking about the Turks in Cyprus."
"What is the winning card up the European Union's sleeve?"
"What is that thing of which we are rightly particularly proud?"
"It is that the European Community is a peace-building project."
"How is it that we can become so indifferent as to look away when an EU Member State has serious problems with getting two ethnic groups to live together peacefully, when it needs UN troops and is over-militarised and full to bursting with soldiers and weaponry?"
"If Christian and Muslim cultures cannot manage to co-exist in Cyprus, how is that going to be possible in the far more complicated structure of the European Union?"
"The EU is losing credibility by being insufficiently committed to addressing its own problems."
"It cannot be united in peace for as long as Cyprus remains a divided island."
"Let us help not only the women of Turkey, but also the Turkish women of Cyprus, to avail themselves of their rights."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must congratulate the rapporteur on the well-structured report that she has presented to us."
"It is a document that addresses subjects of prime importance and highlights the status of women in Turkey and hence in the European Union."
"Many people say that the progress made by that country on its journey towards EU accession should be judged first on respect for human rights and then on equal rights for men and women."
"We agree with that, but I believe that women should gain equal rights in Turkey regardless of any aspiration to join the European Union."
"This is an issue that lies at the basis of any modern, democratic country, but unfortunately, in this context, the European Union is not particularly well qualified to stand up as a champion of safeguards and rights."
"The rapporteur specifically points to the extreme scarcity of Turkish women in positions of power, and item 41 suggests that adopting a mandatory quota system would be a short-term remedy."
"I remain sceptical: if the quota system has proved ineffective for us in the European Union, why should it ever work in Turkey?"
"I have two contrasting reactions to the approach taken in the report: on the one hand, I am pleased to see that there is no reference to cases of torture or of excessive policing during demonstrations, but on the other I am concerned to note that a great many problems like female illiteracy and honour crimes are still worryingly common."
"I am afraid that the time to put them right is still a long way off, much further off in fact than any optimistic prediction."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mrs Bozkurt for her report, which described the situation of women in Turkey very well."
"Even two years on from its first publication, and despite the small amount of progress that has been made, I see that there are still serious deficits as regards the equality of women and men in Turkey."
"The problem lies mainly in the high level of illiteracy, which stands at 25%, rising as far as 40% in some regions - and the still very small number of women in decision-making positions at local and national level."
"What I find even more appalling, though, is the continuing violence against women."
"Mrs Bozkurt rightly takes a critical line in her report on the regrettable and continuing lack of exact data on this, and what I find disconcerting in this regard is the fact that, in Turkey, which has a population of 70 million people, there are no more than thirty women's refuges, even though Turkish law requires that a refuge for victims of violence be set up in communities with over 50 000 residents."
"As regards honour killings, one gets the impression that the number of them has decreased since the penalty was made tougher, but I cannot dispel my own concern that the increased incidence of suicide in some regions might well conceal honour killings."
"The Turkish Government cannot - it must not - stand idly by and let these things happen."
"It must compile reliable data and set up women's centres offering women facing the threat of violence not only protection but also emotional support."
"That is the only way to offer women and girls, from the very outset, the prospect, most of all, of coming out unscathed from a situation that appears to be hopeless."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the report on the role of women in the social, economic and political life of Turkey calls for a more effective implementation of community concepts as regards the equality and rights of women."
"At the present stage, however, it is obvious that the great diversity of the European Union means that many of its recommendations have not had the desired effect and create various conflicts as well as being - contrary to the slogans - a denial of freedom."
"There are huge cultural as well as religious and moral differences between the two societies, which is why it would be more relevant to give Turkish women the tools to resolve their own problems in their own way, rather than imposing a mindset and solutions on them that are alien to their traditions and culture."
"Our Community is based on the principles of dignity and freedom of nations, as set out in countless documents, and our task should be to provide support to combat poverty and violence and to promote education, rather than imposing an alien world outlook on the Turks, which in itself constitutes coercion of the kind the European Union supposedly does not tolerate."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Mr President, although the legal situation of women in Turkey has improved to some degree, we are a long way from being able to talk in terms of success."
"If one considers how things work in practice and the attitudes of the broad majority of the population, it is at once clear that most of these improvements have been accomplished only on paper."
"In theory, for example, domestic violence - which statistics show is frequently resorted to - now constitutes grounds for divorce, yet the incidence of divorce is lower in Turkey than in many other developing countries."
"In what sense can the rule of law be said to apply when the state discontinues prosecutions when the suspect objects to them, and when women under threat only very rarely get protection from the police?"
"What is the point of making improvements to laws, when court rulings take them to absurd conclusions?"
"I also believe that the high level of illiteracy among women, and the high incidence of forced marriage, not to mention the increasing number of honour killings disguised as suicide, speak volumes, and, in the event of the poorly educated women losing their jobs - in which they may well work under conditions analogous to those of slavery - they do not even appear in the official statistics."
"This falsification of the unemployment rate and the consequent threat of large-scale migration is reason enough for the EU to step on the emergency brake, for the way women are treated in Turkish society and their position in it constitute, as I see it, yet more proof that Turkey is not a European country and will never become one."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I will begin with a word of apology for my late arrival, since I was detained in a meeting of the coordinators of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"I very much welcome the report put forward by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality under the guidance of Mrs Bozkurt, for it is even-handed and constructive, highlighting not only the progress achieved on women's issues but also the deficits that still remain, and spelling out the need for continued and consistent progress down the road of reform on which Turkey has set foot."
"Turkey's Prime Minister, Mr ErdoÄan, would therefore be well advised - despite having many elections to fight - to press on with the gender justice policy and encourage women to work independently."
"The report gives a good overview of the role of Turkish women in their country's social, economic and political life."
"It is good that measures are being planned to combat violence against women, among them the initiative to prevent violence during military service or training in the police force."
"The principal exponent of this approach is the Turkish Minister for Women, and it is an important and good one, for it is only by means of initiatives such as these that attitudes can be changed - and they need to be."
"Mr ErdoÄan's decree in response to the Turkish parliament's report on violence against women and killings on the alleged grounds of honour and morals is another move in the right direction, in that it incorporates many different aspects of policy on women's issues and instructs all ministries, public institutions and local authorities to be consistent in counteracting violence against women."
"It must be said, though, that it now has to be followed up by binding and specific instructions on how to implement this, which have still not yet been forthcoming, for his circular will remain a toothless tiger for as long as there are no specific details of how to implement the necessary measures or proper sanctions against the event of them not being put into effect."
"The most recent experience gained in the combating of violence against women indicates just how important it is that such public bodies as the courts, the administration, the police or the health authorities should be involved in it, for, here too, a change of thinking is urgently needed; it has been a too frequent occurrence that women seeking protection have been turned away by the authorities and fallen victim to domestic violence, and that is why we are urging the Turkish government to afford women affected by violence all the protection they need and, where public institutions fail to protect its victims, to set in motion a judicial inquiry and cause those responsible to be prosecuted."
"State institutions must also work more closely with independent women's organisations and support the latter financially."
"Mr President, this debate is not really about women in Turkey."
"Turkey had a female Head of Government 14 years ago."
"Eighteen of the 27 Members of the EU have not yet reached this landmark."
"Yet that does not stop this Chamber from hectoring Ankara about women's political representation."
"No, this report is really about Turkey's membership bid."
"It demands, for example, that Kurdish women's groups be explicitly recognised as such: a deliberate provocation to Ankara, which has long maintained that all Turkish citizens are equal before the Constitution."
"Once again the bar is being set higher for Turkey than for any past applicant."
"We hector the Turks in the most importunate manner about Cyprus, about the status of minorities, about the Armenian massacre."
"We damn them either way."
"If they repress signs of Islamic devotion, we call them authoritarian."
"If they do not, we call them fundamentalists."
"The truth is that there are many in this House who are determined, in Gladstone's infamous phrase, to 'turn the Turk, bag and baggage, out of Europe'."
"Their real concern is not about human rights."
"It is that the accession of a populous, proud and assertive Muslim country would retard their dream of a federation, of a country called Europe."
"Although I do not share their position, I recognise that it is a legitimate point of view."
"But it would have been better for all concerned had Brussels been honest, had it said 'no' at the outset and then settled down to work out an amicable bilateral relationship."
"Instead we shall string Turks along for perhaps another ten or fifteen years, wring painful concessions from them on foreign and domestic policy, force them to assimilate tens of thousands of pages of the acquis communautaire and then, only then, turn them away."
"This is no way to treat an allied nation, colleagues, a nation that guarded Europe's flags for a half a century against the totalitarianism of the Soviet Union and whom we may look to one day to do the same against the totalitarianism of the religious fanatics."
"Turks are as entitled as any other people to their pride."
"By abusing them in this manner the EU risks creating the very thing it purports to fear: the rise of anti-western sentiment among a people who have long been our friends."
"(HU) It is extremely important for Turkey's system of democratic institutions to be further strengthened, achieving those reforms which promote European integration."
"A report of the European Parliament at the end of last year noted the slowing down of the reform process, and gave special emphasis to the fact that there is insufficient progress in guaranteeing women's rights."
"It is unacceptable that Turkish women suffer discrimination in nearly every area of life: in the labour market, in decision-making and in education, and that they experience considerable disadvantages in comparison with their male counterparts."
"Rights guaranteed by law are of no use if their implementation in practice is not ensured."
"The political will of the Turkish Government can best ensure implementation of these rights."
"For this to happen, a social dialogue is necessary, involving organisations of civil society."
"Information campaigns would be the most effective way of drawing society's attention to guaranteeing the rights of women."
"The continued violence against women is shocking, and is unacceptable in a country which seeks to adopt the basic principles of European integration."
"It is the task of the Turkish Government to find suitable instruments for solving this shameful problem and for gradually phasing it out."
"To this end, the European Union can offer help by sharing the experiences of its programmes and best practices."
"I am hopeful that Turkey is willing to accept a helping hand, and will truly take action to tackle this problem."
"I thank my fellow Member Mrs Bozkurt for her work, for the report is excellent and I recommend its adoption."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Bozkurt wholeheartedly for her excellent and important report, one which I feel is even more important because it comes from a brave European woman of Turkish origin who knows and understands the special circumstances and norms of a Turkish, Islamic, partly secular and partly fundamentalist society."
"Looking back many years ago, women in Turkish society were regarded more as objects than human beings."
"They have suffered enormously and it is only in recent years that this sad situation is beginning to be remedied."
"But although steps have been taken in the right direction, there is still very much that needs to be done."
"It is my view in fact that progress is not as much as we would have hoped for."
"Indeed, in large parts of Turkey, especially in the south-east, women are still treated as second-class citizens and are grossly discriminated against."
"Illiteracy amongst Turkish women is at record levels for a European-orientated country."
"Additionally, the degree and extent of violence against women is still unacceptably high and unfortunately is in many cases accepted as the norm by large sections of Turkish society."
"The despicable criminal and offensive activity of honour killings still happens only too regularly in Turkish villages and cities."
"It is true that the Turkish Government is making some efforts to correct matters."
"For example, much attention has been focused recently on better education for women and on educating the police and the judiciary in order to deal more appropriately with violence against women."
"A country-wide information campaign and stricter implementation of the law are taking place, but are not having the desired effect, because drastic changes also have to happen at a core political level."
"Prime Minister Erdogan himself recently drew attention to the 'deep state' in Turkey that is opposing his Government's reforms and is fighting against parliamentary democracy."
"This deep state, supported mainly by the army and other extreme nationalist elements, is impeding progress in Turkey - and incidentally, Mrs Resetarits - is keeping Turkish Cypriots isolated and Cyprus divided."
"Such forces do not want liberated women equal in all respects to men."
"It is our duty to support this report and bring liberation to Turkish women."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, apart from being clear, this report by my fellow Member, Mrs Bozkurt, has the great virtue of summarising the sad reality of women's rights in Turkey."
"Indeed, despite all the declarations of intent from the Turkish authorities and the pseudo-reforms undertaken in the area of human rights, the reality is that domestic violence, honour crimes and forced marriages keep increasing, and that discrimination against women in the workplace and in education still goes on."
"However, this finding should not make us forget that, while it is true that these violations of women's rights are incompatible with the concept of human rights, as they are laid down, for example, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the fact remains that Turkey is not European and that its future should not lie in the European Union."
"Indeed, even when it turns out that all the economic, legal and social criteria laid down at the Copenhagen Summit have been met, Turkey, 99% of whose population is made up of Muslims and 94% of whose territory is located in Asia, will still not share our values, which bear the stamp of Christianity and humanism."
"Turkey is a beautiful country, a great country, with a courageous, proud and hospitable people."
"We should, of course, preserve the privileged relations that we already maintain with Turkey as part of the customs Union, but Turkey cannot and must not under any circumstances join the European Union."
"(PT) Mr President, the process of assessing Turkey's compliance with the EU's accession criteria involves frequent evaluation of the progress that has been made, not least on human rights."
"In this context, Mrs Bozkurt's excellent report places great emphasis on how the situation of women in Turkey is evolving, for which the rapporteur deserves commendation."
"I should like to highlight a few of the report's recommendations: incentives for the social partners to promote the involvement of women in social dialogue, calling on the Turkish authorities to establish a monitoring system to keep girls in the education system, a quota system operational in various countries - from the Iberian Peninsula to Scandinavia - to guarantee fair representation for women on electoral lists, instructions for judges to deliver severe sentences for 'honour crimes' and forced marriages, a campaign to promote the image of women as players driving economic and social development, and the inclusion of the social partners and some NGOs in the Advisory Board on the Status of Women."
"Mrs Bozkurt's report is thus an excellent contribution to progress in assessing the situation of women in Turkey."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must take this opportunity to tell you that there can be progress on the situation of women throughout Europe."
"Yesterday in Portugal, the Portuguese people voted in a referendum to decriminalise the voluntary termination of pregnancy."
"This was a great day for Portugal, and an absolutely marvellous day for women."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was probably not the rapporteur's intention, but there is actually no denying that the Bozkurt report is yet another illustration of the fact that Turkey simply does not belong in Europe."
"Indeed, it is wrong to think that Turkey is simply a country where a couple of things need fixing and that everything can be solved with a few new laws and rules or with the absorption of some tens of thousands of pages of acquis communautaire, whereupon a new European Member State is allegedly created."
"This is absurd."
"First of all, Europeans are people who live within a very specific geographical European framework, and that framework does not include Turkey."
"In addition, Europeans are also people who form part of a very defined community of law and a community of values, which comprises, among others, gender equality."
"Other areas that play a role are culture, mentality and even religion, when this religion, as is the case with Islam, is not restricted to internal perception but wants to impose its outdated and, in many cases, totally reprehensible rules on the whole of the community."
"Returning to the subject of this report, I would say that Turkey is without a doubt the most modern Islamic country, but it remains, where women's rights are concerned, a backwater."
"Indeed, it is an Islamic country, where women are deemed inferior, something which will not improve as Islamicisation gains ground; quite the reverse."
"Let us therefore stop treating the symptoms, rather than the cause, which is the fact that Turkey may well be a neighbouring country, but can never become a European one."
"(PL) Mr President, the lack of female involvement in Turkey's social, economic and political life is mainly the result of a lack of proper access to education."
"While appreciating the changes that have been made, it needs to be said that there is still a high level of illiteracy among girls and women in Turkey."
"Estimates provided by UNICEF show that every year between 600 000 and 800 000 Turkish girls do not attend school because their families forbid it or because just getting to school is difficult."
"However, Turkish women face other problems as well."
"Violence against women is common, and honour killings as well as forced marriages violate the fundamental human right to make one's own decisions about one's life."
"In some parts of south-eastern Turkey, girls are not even registered at birth, as a result of which they are deprived of rights such as access to education or health services."
"Women play a very small role in Turkey's political life, and the Turkish parliament does not have a permanent committee on women's rights and equality."
"The Turkish Government must implement women's rights legislation as soon as possible so that those rights can be effectively implemented in practice."
"Public institutions such as the courts, the police and the health system must guarantee to protect and afford all assistance to women reporting violence against them."
"The social partners should also play an important role by promoting the rights of women and organising debates or courses to promote the image of women as equal citizens of Turkey with an important role to play in their country's economic and political life."
"Finally I would like to congratulate Mrs Bozkurt on her important report, which I hope will contribute to further positive changes in the situation of women in Turkey."
"(ES) I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Bozkurt on her work and on her monitoring of the situation of women in Turkey."
"Thanks to her good work, the issue of women's rights is being treated on a par with other policies."
"I believe that you are making history in that regard, Mrs Bozkurt."
"Congratulations!"
"As someone who has been closely following this process, your first report, the extremely interesting working meetings that a delegation of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality held in Istanbul and Ankara, and now this second report, I must say that I agree with you that we must now ensure that the legislation on women's rights is not revoked."
"Although the improvement in the legislation in this field has, generally speaking, been a success, it is urgent that we create the appropriate environment to make it possible for the legislative reforms to be applied."
"It is very difficult to carry on making progress if the important changes introduced into the legislation are not implemented in practice."
"Women must be able to see their situation improve in their daily lives."
"It is not just a question of their having rights, but also of their being able to complain in practice when they are not respected."
"Only by speeding up the practical application of the legislative reforms throughout the territory will we be able to ensure that the new legislation on women's rights is maintained."
"I would also like to stress that the Turkish authorities' willingness to tackle cases of violence against women and to accept the use of positive action measures with a view to combating gender inequalities is particularly significant."
"I would finally like to highlight the government's willingness to hold dialogue and to better coordinate with women's organisations active in the field of gender equality, and therefore the rapporteur's request that the European Commission provide support in order to facilitate that cooperation seems to me to be highly appropriate."
"Congratulations once again, Mrs Bozkurt."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament for this discussion and the Members for their remarks."
"I think we can all agree that despite recent positive developments, the situation concerning women's rights in Turkey needs to be improved."
"While progress has been made towards improving legislation, implementation remains a challenge and needs to be speeded up."
"We are now looking forward to further positive developments and hope that the work of the European Parliament and the Commission will support this process."
"Last but not least, I would like to underline the importance of the participation of civil society in this effort."
"I shall briefly mention some figures which might be of interest to you."
"This is in relation to the funds allocated by the Commission."
"Combating domestic violence against women: EUR 2.968 million."
"Strengthening civil society in the pre-accession process: EUR 2.5 million."
"Establishing shelters for women subjected to domestic violence: EUR 8.5 million."
"Through these and many other activities the Commission will continue to support that which is focused upon in this report."
"Let me once again express my gratitude to the rapporteur for the excellent work which has been done."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 10.05 p.m.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 10.05 a.m.)"
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (announcement of motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"Inaugural address by the President of the European Parliament"
"Former Presidents of the European Parliament, Madam Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, President of the European Council, Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, Mr van der Linden, President of the Assembly of the Council of Europe, Presidents and representatives of the European institutions, honoured guests, and, above all, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the European Parliament, electing a new President every two and a half years - a short time by historical standards - has been the tradition of the European Parliament since its first direct elections in June 1979, but let us not forget that one President of the European Parliament lives through five European Council Presidencies - in this case Germany, followed by Portugal, Slovenia, France and the Czech Republic - and so the responsibility borne by our Parliament is self-evident, particularly at this time when the task of uniting Europe has come a long way, but is not yet complete and indeed, given the current failure of the constitutional process in France and the Netherlands, is still in danger."
"Being aware of this responsibility, the European Parliament cannot allow itself to be outdone by anybody when it comes to completing this task of unifying our continent."
"(Applause)"
"We all live within a continuum including those who went before us and those who will come after, and so I would like to thank my predecessor, Mr Josep Borrell Fontelles, most warmly and sincerely on behalf of the whole European Parliament and, in particular, also on a personal level, for his great commitment and indefatigable work as our President over the past two and a half years!"
"(Applause)"
"I also extend warm and sincere thanks to the former Presidents who are with us today:"
"Mr Emilio Colombo, President of Parliament in the days before it was directly elected, and then his post-1979 successors Mrs Simone Veil, Lord Plumb, also known as Henry Plumb, Mr Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo, who is still with us here, Mr Egon Klepsch, Mr Klaus HÃ¤nsch, who is still an MEP, Mr JosÃ©-MarÃ­a Gil-Robles, Mrs Nicole Fontaine and Mr Pat Cox."
"(Vigorous applause)"
"I extend a very warm welcome to all of you."
"It is a cause of great joy to us that you have all accepted the invitation to be here."
"Mr Pierre Pflimlin and Mr Piet Dankert are no longer with us."
"We remember them with gratitude."
"I share with Mr Klaus HÃ¤nsch, Mr Ingo Friedrich, Mr Karl von Wogau, Mr Francis Wurtz and Mr Jens-Peter Bonde the privilege of having been a Member of the European Parliament since its first elections in 1979."
"Since then we have lived through highs and lows in European politics."
"The greatest success has been overcoming the division of Europe."
"Our shared values have prevailed."
"The accession to the European Union of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - and of Cyprus and Malta - on 1 May 2004, and of Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January this year, together with the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990, remain for me the miracle of this generation."
"We all have reason to be extremely happy about this, now as always."
"(Applause)"
"We all, however, still have to learn from each other and to strengthen our respect and understanding for each other."
"We should stop talking about the 'old' and the 'new' Member States."
"All of us, together, constitute the European Parliament, and the nations that we represent are the community of the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"In the 1980s, there was talk of 'Eurosclerosis'."
"Then, however, along came the single market and the single European currency."
"We in this House fought to secure our rights, and will continue to do so."
"Today this Parliament is influential and self-confident."
"Experience, then, teaches us that we can win successes for Europe when we want them ourselves, when our will to achieve unity for our continent while maintaining its diversity remains strong and determined."
"I would like, today, to ask you all to continue in this determination."
"We shall only succeed in this, though, if the citizens of the European Union - alongside their attachment to home and their own country - understand and are aware, as Europeans, of what binds them to one another."
"A sense of community and a sense of being 'us' are necessary conditions for our shared future."
"European unification is not simply a desire dictated by our minds; European unification is also an affair of the heart."
"Making this clear to people is perhaps the greatest challenge that we must meet together."
"What we have to do is to serve the citizens of the European Union."
"Europeans should be proud of what they have achieved by their labours over the centuries in terms of values, freedom, law and democracy."
"It has been a long haul."
"We know that our European roots lie in Greek philosophy, Roman law, the Judeo-Christian heritage, the Enlightenment - in other words, in our shared European culture."
"Together with those, though, there have also been tragic European civil wars, and in the 20th century the totalitarian ideologies, with their contempt for humanity, and then, in 1945, the courage of the founding fathers in following the path of forgiveness and reconciliation, in building a new, better, more peaceful, shared Europe."
"We should still remember this today, and rediscover the things that are common to us all."
"The great French European Jacques Delors followed Robert Schuman in speaking of the 'European soul'."
"The great Polish European WÅadysÅaw Bartoszewski once said: 'Europe means above all else freedom of the individual and human rights - both political and economic'."
"They were both right."
"I would like to talk about European values."
"They are, in essence, founded upon the idea of human dignity."
"It is in the dignity of the individual that we respect the other, place ourselves under obligations, and thus build a system based on responsibility and solidarity."
"In our practical political activities we should always serve the cause of human dignity, and I would like to encourage all of us to defend that, and human rights throughout the world."
"That is not an abstract plea."
"We are not the world's teachers, but our humanitarian image and our values become more convincing to others if we live our own lives with credibility."
"This has very concrete implications for our policies:"
"we want partnership with a Russia that is democratic and capable of action, and so we expect the Russian authorities to make visible efforts to ensure that the murderers of Ana Politkovskaya, who did so much for press freedom in her country, are punished appropriately."
"(Applause)"
"We shall never forget that without the United States of America neither National Socialism nor Soviet communism could have been vanquished, but we also have to say to our American friends that GuantÃ¡namo is incompatible with any legal order founded upon our European principles."
"(Applause)"
"We protect human life."
"If anyone - as, for example the President of a nation with a great history of civilisation has done - denies the Holocaust, we will firmly repudiate such assertions in order to ensure that the horror of a new holocaust is not visited upon us."
"(Applause)"
"It is our conviction that the people of Israel and Palestine are linked by their common human dignity."
"We therefore support equally the right of Israel to exist and the right of the Palestinian people to live in a State of their own."
"(Applause)"
"We stand alongside those who are fighting peacefully for freedom and democracy, and that explains our solidarity with the Sakharov Prize winner Alexander Milinkevich and his fellow fighters for a democratic Belarus free from fear and oppression."
"We stand in the same solidarity with our other Sakharov Prize winners, 'Las Damas de Blanco' (The Ladies in White) in Cuba and Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma/Myanmar."
"We defend human dignity and human rights."
"We, in the European Parliament, are utterly convinced that the death penalty is irreconcilable with these."
"I urge us all, the institutions of the European Union and the Member States, to stand up, the United Nations, for the abolition of the death penalty."
"If we want to achieve our goals, we must continue to work on building a European Union that is capable of action."
"We must endow ourselves with a constitution that ensures that we can represent our values and interests in Europe and as a respected partner in the world."
"The great speech given by Louise Weiss on 17 July 1979, here in Strasbourg, in her capacity as Oldest Member of the first directly elected European Parliament still rings in my ears."
"She said: 'In any event, let us never forget that we are heirs and executors at one and the same time: the heirs of an intellectual world and its executors for the benefit of coming generations'"
"I cannot put it better myself."
"Our feelings today are scarcely any different from those expressed in 1979 and yet at the same time we live in a world of new challenges that are peculiarly our own."
"The idea of uniting Europe has for the most part been carried through successfully since the signing of the Treaty of Rome 50 years ago."
"It has become the outward expression of one of the happiest periods in our long European history."
"To begin with, after the Second World War, the idea of Europe drew its strength from the desire for peace and freedom."
"Then strengthening prosperity and achieving social equality became the tasks and motivations for European union."
"In both ideas Europe remained true to itself, as the unifying of our continent afforded a unique opportunity for the two halves of the continent, which had been divided for far too long, to grow together in freedom."
"Today, Europe is motivated by its citizens' desire for security, and is respected by them on that account."
"This is our very serious concern, thrust upon us, unasked for but unavoidable, by the need to combat terrorism."
"For this we need answers to the questions that weigh heavily on the minds of our citizens."
"The need for security also includes the task of providing employment and social protection in a rapidly changing world."
"We cannot make ourselves safe from globalisation."
"We must construct a cushion by strengthening our competitiveness while retaining the European social model."
"It includes not just talking about the dramatic change in climate, but taking the necessary measures - together with our partners in the world - and enforcing them with determination, before it is too late."
"Security involves such things as a shared supply of energy and a common immigration policy that takes as much account of human rights as of the need for integration in our society."
"We must not allow people to go on dying in the waters of the Mediterranean."
"We cannot find the security we seek in a world that is going up in flames, in which people live in poverty and subject to social pressure, a world in which disorder prevails and in which the natural environment continues to be destroyed."
"If we in Europe wish to live in security, we must commit ourselves as a partner to every aspect of the world's security, and we must be aware of the fact that, without European solutions, most of the challenges faced by this continent and the world can no longer be met."
"Paradoxical though it may seem at first sight, Europe's unity has always been strengthened by crises."
"I am not saying that we need crises because we are incapable of extracting good results from good circumstances."
"The European Union needs a new departure, a renewal."
"The road is a hard one; that is true, but I am firmly convinced that our continent is better equipped today for its future in the world of the 21st century than it was 15 or 20 years ago."
"We ourselves shall be judged on how well we set the newly achieved European unity on a lastingly good and safe path."
"Politicians, such as ourselves, are expected to exercise leadership; we must give better reasons than we have so far for why Europe is good for us all, what added value European union brings and what the aims of our efforts are."
"We must overcome the impression that European policies only have a technical function, with no long-term goal or enduring meaning."
"We must persuade by what we do, and if we are to do that, we must concentrate on essentials."
"It is our common task to prepare for the future in such a sustainable way that it is as safe as humans can make it for our children and our grandchildren."
"For this we need to make a new start, for a better Europe, a stronger Europe, a Europe that looks to the future."
"Above all, though, we need a Europe that believes in itself, that draws its strength from its values and that wants to, and can, be a good partner in the world."
"Without the media we cannot convey Europe to the public."
"I would like specifically to thank the correspondents and journalists here in Strasbourg for their fair and objective reporting, but I appeal to the national media, particularly the television channels, whether private or public, to play their part in relations with the European public."
"It is no longer appropriate to the times to portray European union only from a national perspective."
"I ask the national broadcasting corporations to open their studios to European themes and to invite Members of the European Parliament there as guests to talk about them."
"(Applause)"
"We need a new pact between the citizens of Europe and their political institutions in the European Union."
"The 'Citizens' Europe' and the credibility of the European institutions depend upon each other."
"The 'Better Lawmaking' programme can make a contribution to this if it achieves more democratic oversight, transparency in the Council, reliable transposition into national law, social, environmental, economic and administrative impact assessment, and simplification of the legal texts."
"When planning a piece of European legislation, we should always ask ourselves: Does it serve people and the environment?"
"Is it necessary in the light of the subsidiarity principle?"
"Does it make us more competitive?"
"Does it reduce red tape and costs?"
"Only if these questions can be answered in the affirmative should we, the legislators in the European Parliament, go into action."
"We, the European Parliament, should not only be at pains to represent citizens' interests."
"We should also show our respect for the dedication of European citizens who by their work are raising Europe's profile - in Europe and in the world."
"We should introduce a European Parliament award for that."
"Why, too, for that matter, should we not also pay particular honour to commitment on the part of young people to the European idea?"
"High-ranking European awards have had such a good effect on public awareness, why do we not create awards for the younger generation, for young Europeans who are showing exemplary dedication to the European ideal?"
"In national museums, European history is nearly always represented in purely national terms."
"I would like to suggest a locus for history and for the future, where the concept of the European idea can continue to grow."
"I would like to suggest the founding of a 'House of European History'."
"It should not be a dry, boring museum, but a place where our memory of European history and the work of European unification is jointly cultivated, and which at the same time is available as a locus for the European identity to go on being shaped by present and future citizens of the European Union."
"A 'House of European History' such as this should be established in the seat of the European institutions and should network with comparable foundations in the Member States."
"The 'Declaration on the Future of Europe', to be adopted jointly by the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission on 25 March 2007 in Berlin - an event over which you, Mrs Merkel, will preside - could create the conditions for this."
"The European Union is the largest grouping of nations in the world, consisting of 27 nations with almost 500 million citizens."
"Europe is a complex continent, one that presents us with enormous challenges, and the European Union can no longer be governed by the instruments of current Treaty law, which have become inadequate."
"If our community of values is to endure, it needs fundamental reform."
"The Constitutional Treaty strengthens both the European Parliament and the national parliaments, strengthening both parliamentary life and democracy."
"Communal self-administration as the basis of our European democratic order is recognised for the first time."
"The distribution of powers defines European competencies."
"I will be quite frank in saying that I say to you quite openly that I do not understand people who on the one hand criticise 'Brussels' - and sometimes that is just as justified as it is to criticise national politics - but at the same time reject the Constitutional Treaty, which is the very instrument we need to help eradicate and rectify the perceived deficiencies."
"(Applause)"
"This House stands by the Constitutional Treaty - about that we must not allow there to be any doubt."
"We want to help make the principles and substance of the Constitutional Treaty, including its values, a legal and therefore political reality."
"The consensus arrived at here in the European Parliament on the services directive and on the limits of the European Union's ability to enlarge is a constructive response to people's concerns."
"The 'Declaration on the Future of Europe' scheduled for 25 March 2007 in Berlin could be another important milestone on this road."
"At its heart should be commitment to our values and to the necessary reforms; an undertaking to rise jointly to the challenges of the future of which I spoke earlier; a commitment to solidarity among the nations of Europe and to the supremacy of law as the basis for our actions."
"No country, no nation of the European Union is to be left alone with its fundamental problems."
"That also, however, rules out national selfishness."
"Anyone who serves only the interests of his own country will ultimately squander these as well, because he will destroy the solidarity that is needed if they are to be defended."
"(Applause)"
"We intend to help to ensure that under the German Council Presidency a road map and a mandate are agreed at the summit in Brussels on 21 and 22 June, as the outcome of which full implementation of the substantive core of the European Constitution will be in place by the next European Parliament elections in 2009."
"I would like to remind you that the Constitutional Treaty was signed by all 27 governments and has already been adopted by 18 countries."
"Of course, we have to respect the results of the referenda."
"Quite apart from that, though, if a change of government in a country calls into question that which has been agreed by the European Union, not only is society split in that nation, but our continent, which is already quite complicated enough, is increasingly incapacitated."
"We must commit to our European legal principles: pacta sunt servanda - treaties are to be honoured."
"Our will to implement these necessary reforms must be strong and determined, and we must drive forward these reforms in such a way that the nations of the European Union are brought together rather than driven apart."
"We insist that the European Parliament must be appropriately involved in the work."
"We in this House must also be prepared to reform ourselves."
"In the first instance that will make great demands on every one of us, for example in terms of being present for votes and important debates."
"As we are all aware, a lot remains to be done in this respect."
"I wish the House were always as full as it is this morning, although there is still room for a few more, and so, on Thursday, the day after tomorrow, I shall be submitting a proposal to the group chairmen for a comprehensive reform of the way this House works."
"The Conference of Presidents, in other words the group chairmen - and they are important people - have already set up a working party on how to improve the way we work."
"I can see smiles on the faces of the Group Chairmen, who are pleased to hear that confirmed."
"I ask you, fellow-Members, to start work and to present us with its results as soon as you possibly can."
"This House is efficiently run, and I should like to thank Secretary-General Julian Priestley, who will be leaving office on 1 March after ten years, most warmly and sincerely for the great dedication he has shown!"
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt about the fact that, from time to time, and perhaps more frequently than that, there is cause to criticise the administration; we positively welcome such criticism."
"Those, though, who have worked closely with Mr Priestley and his staff come to recognise just how aware of their responsibilities they are and how great their commitment is, and I have never known any of them to act contrary to the President's intentions."
"I do of course hope that things will go on like that throughout my term of office, and, in order that we may all go in the same direction, I shall maintain close contact."
"My warm thanks, then, go to Mr Julian Priestley, and let me say that the only yardstick by which the administration should be judged is the way that it serves our European convictions - without party political bias, fairly and objectively."
"I can tell this House that Europe's future is largely dependent on successful coexistence between the cultures and religions within the European Union and between the European Union and our neighbours, first and foremost in the Arab and Islamic world."
"We must therefore do our part to ensure that dialogue among cultures and religions is the hallmark of Europe."
"We live in the continent of the three great cultures and religions - the Christian, the Jewish and the Islamic, and we have fellow citizens who come from one of the world's other great cultures and who are adherents of the world's other religions."
"We, in this European Parliament, must encourage and support examples of European civil society that are dedicated to dialogue between cultures."
"In Seville I made the acquaintance of the work of the 'Tres Culturas' organisation, and I say to you - not only to honour my Spanish predecessor, Mr Josep Borrell - that we must actively support every example of coexistence in Europe of Christians, Muslims and Jews - and also, of course, of those who do not belong to any of these religions."
"This is a crucial investment in our intellectual development."
"At the same time, it is the best contribution we can make to encouraging dialogue between cultures across the Mediterranean and beyond, to the Middle East and North Africa."
"We do not want the 'clash of civilisations', we want peace in freedom and justice among all nations and beliefs."
"This means building an intellectual and cultural bridge across the Mediterranean."
"This dialogue must be grounded in tolerance and truth."
"Tolerance does not mean accepting anything and everything."
"Tolerance means peaceful coexistence through respecting the convictions of the other while maintaining one's own."
"On one of my many visits to Arab countries, I was asked by a senior Islamic dignitary how Muslims live in Europe."
"My answer was that they are often not sufficiently integrated, but that they can live out their own beliefs and have their own mosques and places of prayer."
"I went on to ask him if it was true that in his country a Muslim man or woman could be put to death for converting to Christianity."
"The fact that I received no answer was an answer in itself."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am firmly convinced that the Dialogue of Cultures can only succeed if it is based on truth and mutual tolerance."
"(Applause)"
"It is my intention to visit the European Union's neighbouring Arab states and, when visiting European Union countries, to try to have talks with ethnic minorities, particularly their younger members."
"We have an important parliamentary institution for dialogue with the Middle East, including Israel and the Arab world, in the shape of the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly."
"We must use this institution effectively for peace, partnership and, if possible, friendship."
"Last weekend, the four presidents who govern the Europe-Mediterranean Assembly, namely the presidents of the parliaments of Egypt, Tunisia - which is currently presiding - of Greece, and I myself, met in Tunis and agreed that the dialogue between cultures and the problem of unemployment in the countries around the Mediterranean would be the theme of the forthcoming dialogue in March, and that we wanted, in June, to give particular attention to the Middle East and to the peace process there, which we hoped would actually be up and running at the time."
"As soon as circumstances permit, I shall visit Israel, Palestine and Lebanon."
"I am grateful for the invitation I have received to address the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset."
"When inviting speakers to address the European Parliament, we should place the emphasis on the Dialogue of Cultures."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is the task of us all to strengthen democracy and the European parliamentary system, and so we intend to collaborate with the national parliaments in constructive partnership for the good of our nations and of the whole European Union."
"Helmut Kohl, honorary citizen of the European Union, once said, 'We do not have much time."
"The world we live in is not prepared to wait for us to solve our internal problems'."
"He was right."
"To this I would add that failure to act, indifference, would be the greatest wrong we could commit."
"At the end of my term of office a new European Parliament will be elected."
"If we do convincing work and if good things are said about Europe in the national capitals as well, then the turnout for the European Parliament elections will go up again."
"It should be our ambition to achieve this."
"Our work is often unglamorous, it can be stressful and not particularly spectacular, but our goals are great, and so much is expected of us."
"We seek to live up to that."
"In this task I would like to represent you all in such a way that the dignity of the European Parliament, the unity of our continent of Europe and the effectiveness of the European Union are strengthened."
"I ask you for your help, thank you for your confidence and hope that together we can achieve our goals."
"(Sustained applause)"
"Mr President, Mr Poettering, former Presidents and present Members of the European Parliament, Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, you, Mr President, are one of the Members of your House who witnessed its first hours; it could, I think, be said that you have helped shape this House in its remarkable growth from its earliest infancy to becoming what is now a very emancipated parliament with confident Members, clear party structures and parliamentary groups, and hence a demanding partner in European debate, and one we cannot imagine ourselves having to do without."
"The development of this Parliament is one of the European Union's success stories, and we now know that without the work of the European Parliament, much of what we have achieved for Europe's citizens would have taken another form."
"I would like to call to mind, from recent history, the work on the chemicals legislation REACH, the elaboration of the services directive and the debates on the financial perspective, in which we constantly strove to set forward-looking priorities and managed to push them through, in tough negotiations with the Council and the Commission in some cases."
"In your speech today, you drew our attention to the next European Parliament elections in 2009."
"We will face the citizens of Europe together - we as representatives of the nation states and you as representatives of the European Parliament - and will have to give an account to almost 500 million people of what concerns us, in what way this Europe of ours benefits them and why it matters."
"It has to do with peacekeeping, with solidarity within the European Union and with prosperity and social security in a global world in which competition has become much tougher for all of us."
"It is for this reason that we must not lose sight of the whole picture in the midst of all the specific routine parliamentary work."
"With your work programme you have emphasised the role which you envisage for the European Parliament as well as for the European Union in the world."
"We agree that the issue of the constitutional treaty will be the crucial issue for the 2009 elections - both in connection with our self-perception and our relationship to our citizens, and, secondly, also in terms of a 27-member European Union's capacity for action."
"It is for that reason that the German EU Presidency, together with the Commission, Parliament and the Member States, will do everything in its power to set a timetable for completing this project so that people in 2009 know what kind of Europe they are voting for and how this Europe will be able to act in future."
"(Applause)"
"My plea is that we should continue our discussion on how we can further clarify the structure of the respective relations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council, even though it still sparks controversy in some areas."
"For that reason too, as I mentioned in my opening speech, I have put the issue of discontinuity on the agenda, because I believe this topic will be important in the longer term."
"How does a newly elected Parliament - or, for that matter, a newly-elected Commission - perceive itself?"
"What has to be achieved, and how?"
"Even the Constitutional Treaty does not fully answer these questions, and that is why I believe the debate must go on."
"(Muted applause)"
"Turning to the problems of substance, it is clear that the subject of energy will play a quite central role at the Spring Council on 8 and 9 March."
"I would like, today, to tell you about our efforts to organise this Council meeting, but not before expressing my sincere thanks to the Commission, which has given us ambitious packages of directives and findings on energy and climate protection for the agenda."
"In the upcoming councils to prepare for the Spring Council - the Competition Council and the Environment Council - we now have to establish the decisive conditions for a fruitful debate within the Council."
"I support the goal of the Commission to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2020 as long as we find international partners."
"I believe that our international travels give us all encouragement to draw attention to the fact that Europe generates 15% of CO2 emissions, while 85% are generated outside the European Union."
"Europe must be a pioneer - a goal to which I think we should commit ourselves - but Europe must also make clear that no problem illustrates more visibly than this one how this world interacts and that the action of one continent is not sufficient to dispel the threat posed to the whole of humanity."
"(Applause)"
"We will have to hold discussions on developing a competitive internal market; we can already sense that these will be very difficult, but that will come as no surprise to anyone who has studied the subject."
"We will not shy away from these debates, for a functioning internal market within the energy market is essential."
"We intend to put the issue of energy efficiency on the agenda, and we will talk about renewable energies. The German EU Presidency will appeal for the adoption of specific figures and reduction approaches which are binding."
"I want to make it absolutely clear that no Member State can evade this responsibility."
"For this reason the Federal Republic of Germany, if I may say so as Chancellor, has already had to make compromises with the Commission, and we did not find that easy."
"We did this quite deliberately because I believe that each Member State must do its part."
"It would be foolish to believe that climate protection works without anyone noticing, and that is why that erroneous belief must be abandoned."
"(Applause)"
"We will have to give our attention to the topic of external energy policy, particularly in the negotiations on a cooperation agreement with Russia."
"Here, too, I have to say that we hope and are working to ensure that these negotiations can commence."
"We have not, alas, got that far yet, but I am optimistic that we will have taken a positive step forward by the time we meet for the EU-Russia Summit in May, and we will put the issue of 'better regulation' on the European Council agenda; here, too, I would ask for your House's support in order to ensure that we do not become bogged down in vague assurances, but that we commit ourselves to quantitative reduction objectives."
"I am aware of the concerns and the fears that less regulation may also entail less protection."
"That is not what we want, but there is room for improvement in the way in which we organise bureaucracy today, and I would add that, from the perspective of Europe's citizens, improvements are needed on that front."
"That does not mean that a regulation is not valid if we do not use the most complicated form to verify it."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, our consultations in connection with the declaration on the Europe of the future on 24 and 25 March are going well."
"We intend that they should continue to do so."
"In your comments you emphasised very clearly what people expect from the European Union with regard to its external relations and its security and defence policy, and I share your commitment to human rights, of which your House has a great tradition, and I am pleased to note your desire to make dialogue between cultures one of your priorities."
"During my recent trip to the Middle East I was made aware of the great expectations which people have placed in the European Union and all its institutions."
"One can, in the Middle East, almost physically feel the yearning for peace and the concern about Iran's nuclear programme."
"In this area we have a great responsibility to do everything we can - with the players in the region as well as the United States of America and Russia, of course - to set in motion the peace process which people await with such longing."
"I have said before, and will say again, that the end of the Cold War brought something unexpected into the lives of Europeans such as ourselves."
"We have seen that today, now with twenty-seven Member States, we can again work and contend for peace and freedom in a democratic process with almost all European countries, even though it is not always easy."
"This, the wonder of our age, should encourage us to strive for miracles and opportunities in other regions of the world."
"That which Palestinians and Israelis have not experienced for decades - a life in peace, a life in two neighbouring countries which are not at war, a life with the prospect of prosperity - must also be our goal, because we have simply seen firsthand that peace and friendship can emerge from seemingly insurmountable differences."
"This experience brings with it an obligation for us as Europeans to become involved in this process."
"That is why I am very grateful that you, together with all your colleagues in the European Parliament, have set this as one of your priorities."
"Mr President, you quoted Mr Helmut Kohl and said that we must hurry and cannot afford to constantly focus on ourselves. For people in the European Union expect us to continue to shape this successful continent successfully in the age of globalisation in the interests of its citizens."
"Millions, indeed billions, of people in the world expect the European Union, with its experience and prosperity, to do its part in enabling the world to enjoy more peace and more freedom."
"Let us work together to that end."
"Thank you for your speech; I look forward to good cooperation with your House."
"(Applause)"
"My warm thanks to you, too, Chancellor Merkel, for that encouraging speech."
"We will do everything in our power to ensure that the Council, the Commission and this House work together successfully for our continent, for the European Union."
"President of the Commission."
"Mr President, Chancellor Merkel, former Presidents of the European Parliament, Presidents of the European institutions, honourable Members, this year we celebrate what the European Union has achieved over the last 50 years: a history which has seen the European Parliament increasingly come to embody European democracy."
"I salute the presence here today of the former Presidents of the European Parliament."
"On my own behalf and on behalf of the Commission, I thank you all for your individual contributions to Europe."
"I want to congratulate you, Mr President, for this initiative."
"It is indeed important."
"Some politicians believe the world did not exist before they were born."
"I think that it is important that we who are serving our citizens through institutions keep this institutional memory."
"A decent and civilised society pays homage to its history and respects the institutions."
"I want to thank you for your speech, which had both vision and substance."
"I share the views and commend the commitment."
"Honourable Members, you have elected a President whose experience and commitment to our common European project is second to none."
"Our European values underline the essence of the Europe we want and treasure: a Europe of peace, freedom, democracy, prosperity and justice."
"The enlargement and integration of Europe to include 27 countries, free of war and free of totalitarianism, underlines the strength of these values and the lessons we have drawn from history: only through a shared undertaking are we able to provide the answers to our citizens in the global world of the 21st century."
"Cultural and religious pluralism is a strong European value."
"In this sense, I particularly welcome the emphasis by President Poettering on intercultural and religious dialogue."
"The European Union is well placed to promote this dialogue."
"We are steeped in diversity: diversity of traditions, of cultures, of language, of nations."
"It is one of our precious gifts as Europeans."
"We are to some extent a success in globalisation."
"We, better than anyone, can shape this globalised world."
"Dialogue is the way to ensure that diversity, far from causing division, enriches our unity."
"I strongly believe that cultural diversity is a source of Europe's strength and of its ability to promote its values and interests in the world."
"This dialogue has to be nurtured properly."
"We intend to make next year's Year of Intercultural Dialogue the platform for this dialogue."
"The Commission has long pursued a dialogue with religions, churches and communities of conviction, including those who do not have a religion."
"I would like to take this forward in partnership with the European Parliament, as a visible demonstration of how European institutions, working together, take European integration forward."
"To signal the importance of this dimension, last year I invited the President of the European Council to participate in a meeting with religious and church leaders."
"I welcome the agreement to hold a summit in May this year, with the three Presidents of the European political institutions and leaders of the main religions and churches, which I will be honoured to host."
"On 25 March, we have the opportunity to celebrate both our achievements and our values."
"I am delighted that the European Parliament and the European Commission are playing a full part in the preparations for the Declaration on the future of Europe, following my proposal last May."
"This Declaration, to be signed in Berlin, represents a real common point of reference - a confirmation of what the European Union is for and a mission statement for what we want to achieve in the 21st century."
"Last month, in this House, I made proposals I would like to see in the Berlin Declaration."
"I did not do it for the sake of making proposals."
"They correspond to results that European citizens want us to achieve."
"And I believe that it is by focusing on the goals of our common project that we will be able to reach a strong and enlarged consensus, including a consensus for an institutional settlement."
"I am convinced that if Europeans see the European Union addressing globalisation, promoting economic growth and jobs, showing social solidarity, tackling climate change, increasing democratic legitimacy, bringing security to its citizens, defending our values and interests worldwide, then they will trust the European Union to reform itself to meet tomorrow's challenges and to deliver practical results."
"We are all here to serve European citizens."
"If we are to enjoy public consent, we need to target our activities on citizens' priorities and we need to work in a way that justifies their confidence, particularly respecting the principles of subsidiarity and transparency."
"We set out exactly this approach in our Citizens' Agenda Communication of last May."
"In order to achieve results, we need to preserve and develop institutional partnership; a partnership founded on the separation of competences, but also on the idea of institutional interdependence."
"While respecting the autonomy of each institution, we need to stress the commonality of our European principles."
"Despite some natural political and ideological differences, those who are committed to these principles should build a truly European partnership."
"I believe that cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission is working well."
"It has proved itself against some stern tests."
"Over the past year we have seen difficult dossiers resolved on services, chemicals, REACH and the financial perspectives, to name but a few."
"This was a result of the three institutions working together with this spirit of partnership."
"I am committed to working closely with you, Mr President, as well as with Chancellor Merkel and her successors at the helm of the Council."
"I am convinced this is the best way to deliver the results our citizens demand."
"The resolution of the debate on the future of Europe is not a sideshow: a more efficient and democratic European Union goes to the heart of our ability to deliver policies and results."
"We all know this is what the constitutional treaty would have achieved, and there are limits to what we can achieve without it."
"As I often say, we cannot build tomorrow's Europe with yesterday's tools."
"The Nice Treaty is not enough."
"(Applause)"
"I know that the European Parliament shares the commitment of the European Commission to give full support to the work of the German Presidency to find the right way forward."
"The energy and commitment of Chancellor Merkel gives us real hope that we can find a consensus and make a compelling case for reform and progress to European citizens."
"But the Presidency of the Council can only achieve results if it is supported by all the Member States."
"Today, where all the European institutions are here reunited, I wish to repeat my call on Member States to find a solution as regards the constitutional treaty."
"I know, after the 'no' votes in two Member States, that it is difficult, if not impossible, to ratify exactly the same text."
"But let us not forget that all the governments signed the treaty."
"This has at least a double implication."
"First, Member States recognised that the Union needed to solve common problems and common challenges."
"And we have not solved them yet."
"Second, the act of signing a Treaty also implies a responsibility towards the other Member States, towards European institutions and towards European citizens."
"It is the duty of all European governments to be constructive and active in the search to find a common solution."
"And I would like to stress the word 'common'."
"At a historical moment like this, when we celebrate the peaceful unity of Europe, we do not have the right to divide it again."
"Regarding their positions about Europe, sometimes some politicians remind me of James Mill, the father of John Stuart Mill."
"John Stuart Mill once said that his father loved mankind in general, but hated each person in particular."
"(Laughter)"
"We also see many politicians in Europe that profess their love for Europe in general, but then resist European solutions to energy, climate change, immigration and, of course, the institutional settlement."
"Let us be frank: we do not need declarations of intent; what we need is commitment."
"(Applause)"
"And we face decisive tests in the near future, starting with the energy and climate change package in the European Council in March."
"I very much welcome the statement Chancellor Merkel made just now."
"Let us be honest with ourselves."
"Coherence is a requisite for credibility."
"We are not credible when we say that we want to speak with one voice to the outside world on energy and we keep speaking among ourselves with 27 voices and 27 markets."
"We are not credible when we set the fight against climate change as one of the most important priorities for Europe and afterwards we are not able to agree on specific goals for our policies."
"So, we need to be coherent and credible."
"Mr President, Madam Chancellor, honourable Members, I have high hopes for the period between now and the end of this parliamentary term."
"I believe we have established the right priorities, and the right foundation of partnership to make them work."
"I look forward to working closely with President Poettering and with this Parliament, and with colleagues in the European Council, to deliver real reform in Europe and real change for Europe's citizens to the end of this decade."
"I believe we can build a Europe that will be able to shape the future of our world around the values of freedom and justice that are so important for us."
"(Applause)"
"President Barroso, I should like to thank you for your statement and especially for your commitment to partnership with the European Parliament, which is most welcome."
"I should like to thank you on my own behalf as well."
"We look forward to the continuation of our good cooperation."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to offer my wholehearted congratulations to you, my dear Hans-Gert, on your brilliant speech on how Europe needs to regroup and once again join forces."
"Addressing, on the one hand, the speakers from high office who took the floor before you and whom I take this opportunity to greet, and, on the other, representatives of all Europe's institutions, you expressed your vision of the future of the EU."
"It is a vision of a united, integrated Europe, but also a Europe that is open to the world and aware of its international responsibilities, a Europe with which the citizens will more readily identify and to which they will feel closer."
"It is a vision that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats shares deeply."
"I appreciate the proactive, positive and constructive tone of your proposals."
"The time has come to stop talking negatively about Europe and to stop asking what we will become. Rather, we must channel our efforts into doing what we have to do."
"The European Project is a success."
"Not only has it led to the development and prosperity of our countries, it has also guaranteed peace on our continent."
"We have changed the course of history thanks to this project and those who feel that this is not enough should take a look around them in their daily lives, and they will see that the benefits of Europe are to be found everywhere."
"It would be churlish not to acknowledge this, but it is certainly true that we need to state more strongly the convictions that we have in our deeds and must learn to accord them their due worth."
"This applies to the euro, which has been a success, and also, on a broader level, to our work as lawmakers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have every reason to be confident in our future within the EU."
"We will face the challenges ahead as a united and determined Europe, and certainly not as a morose, inward-looking Europe obsessed with its past."
"Mr President, our group shares your priorities, which we believe address both the major challenges posed by the modern world, and our citizens' day-to-day concerns."
"The two are interlinked."
"What do European citizens want?"
"They want more freedom - true in particular of young people - and more security and protection against the threats we face."
"They want to be able to work and to enjoy the fruits of their work."
"They also want Europe to defend and promote the values of our civilisation and our culture."
"They are in favour of environmental protection and the fight against climate deterioration at European level."
"They are in favour of a common energy policy guaranteeing safe, affordable supplies, and do not rule out any energy source that may guarantee our independence."
"They want a fair agriculture and food policy offering prospects for the countryside and guaranteeing food safety, whilst remaining at the forefront of technological developments."
"They also want a research and development policy that places Europe at the cutting edge of innovation on the world stage, as we proposed in the Lisbon objectives."
"Personally, I wish to emphasise today the importance of being close to the citizens and of the need to marry this objective with that of dialogue between cultures and religions, which is the positive side of the fight against racism and intolerance and against exclusion and xenophobia."
"It is not enough to speak out against these wrongs or to fight against these scourges."
"What we need to do is to demonstrate, in a positive way, the advantages of exchanging knowledge, the benefits of social mixing, the nobleness of hospitality, the greatness of tolerance and the mutual enrichment of the meeting of cultures."
"At the same time, the EU must be very clear about its geographical limits, about its borders and about a common immigration policy."
"The EU must also define its strategy on globalisation."
"This strategy must not be based on the survival of the fittest, but on a mix of competitiveness, high employment levels and social protection."
"What we need is controlled globalisation."
"I should once again like to commend the German Presidency, and in particular Mrs Merkel, on pursuing all these issues with such determination."
"These challenges are not only for the next six months, but for the next ten or 20 years."
"The 25 March Declaration, on the occasion of the Union's 50th anniversary could be an opportunity to propose the rebirth of political ambition for Europe."
"In accordance with the long-term project of the founding fathers, that ambition involves a relaunch of the institutions."
"I am aware, Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, the extent to which you set great store by this objective."
"We trust the Commission and its President, Mr Barroso, to be up to the task of addressing the issue of the institutions."
"The Commission is both Guardian of the Treaties and guardian of the Community's general interests."
"We will always stand foursquare behind the Commission as it carries out this dual role responsibly."
"It is by joining forces and sharing our convictions that we will be able to pull the EU out of its rut."
"To finish, I could have quoted Mr Pierre Pflimlin, former President of the European Parliament, whose hundredth birthday would have been this year, who dearly wanted to see a Europe of the values of the spirit."
"I shall instead turn to that most Europhile of our 20th century writers, Stefan Zweig, who in his superb biography of Erasmus, handed a key to the builders of the Europe of the past and the future: 'There will always be a need for those who show people what unites them over what divides them, and who renew in the hearts of men the belief in a higher form of humanity.'"
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, former Presidents of this honourable House, ladies and gentlemen, it is in order to avoid the impression that we are at a European People's Party congress that I, a social democrat, have now taken the floor, and what I am now putting myself through is a difficult exercise."
"You will be aware that I take the view that the speech of this House's President must do justice to everyone in it - or at least approximate to doing so - and that it should not become the subject of partisan political debate, for that is the sort of speech to be delivered, not by the one who convenes all, but by one who puts forward an individual's view for the purposes of debate."
"I want to acknowledge, Mr President, that you have delivered a speech behind which the whole House can unite, one in which you have described the essential tasks that lie ahead of us, and that your term of office falls in a decisive period for European politics."
"There is no way of putting it other than to say that the reforms will either succeed or fail, and if they fail, if the Constitution does not come to pass, if we are thrown back onto the incomplete Treaty of Nice, then - as you brought out very well in your speech - it will be not only a Treaty that will have been brought low, but also an ideal."
"In your speech, you gave a description of what the European ideal is, explaining that it is in cooperation between cultures that we find solutions, that religious intolerance is to be overcome by dialogue between religions, that it is on economic and social integration that peace and peaceful coexistence are founded, and that the surrendering of territorial claims can be accomplished through territorial integration."
"If we set this ideal against the challenges we face, then the nature of those challenges becomes clear; they are hatred between races and peoples, which we find everywhere throughout the world, religious intolerance, which is everywhere on the other side of our borders, and, alas indeed, renewed claims to power over territory."
"If you want peace throughout the world, with peace established within Europe and between it and its neighbours, you need more than ever the ideal of Europe to counteract such cause of warfare as hatred, intolerance, exclusion and oppression."
"To these things we respond with integration - both social and cultural - with solutions arrived at between religions and across ethnic divides, and these you described well; my group can do no other than give them its full support."
"At the same time, though, we face the challenge - as you so rightly said - of dealing with day-to-day conflicts."
"People want more than just formal sittings, although I congratulate you on this one, for which we have all been preparing for a long time, and, however sceptical I might be, I will concede that it has gone well."
"It is not every day, though, that we assemble in formal session."
"The public want us to come up with solutions to day-to-day conflicts."
"When the echo of what is said in formal session has died away, everyday life wastes no time in catching us up."
"There are three things that people want from us: First, they want us to say what is what; secondly, they want us to come up with suggested solutions to it; and, thirdly, they want us to be decisive and to act - together in so far as that is possible, but, if it is not, to do so by a majority decision of the kind that is customary in a democracy."
"That, too, must be possible, and - by the way - in the Council as well."
"Turning to you, Madam Federal Chancellor, before you tell us more about discontinuity, I have no objection to us discussing that, but the greatest generator of discontinuity is the Council over which you preside."
"That is the problem!"
"(Applause)"
"We are, of course, caught out by our own problems, the ones that we all have to address - us here in this House, you in the Council and the Commission with its own."
"On New Year's Day this year, Mrs Merkel, the magazine 'Cicero' published a marvellous interview with you, which I read with a great deal of attention."
"One tremendous thing you said in it was this: 'Another thing I aim to do in 2007 is to make more progress on dealing with climate change. [...]"
"With that in mind, I will be giving particular attention, within the international context, to environment issues'."
"And quite right too!"
"You said the same thing today."
"Let me now quote what you said elsewhere, something that - if I remember correctly - you said in the German Bundestag, to the effect that you would be vigorous in preventing a single threshold value for the emission of CO2 from new cars with effect from 2012."
"VoilÃ  - the grim reality of everyday life has caught up with us again."
"(Interruption by Mr Cohn-Bendit: 'Discontinuity!')"
"That, too, is indeed, discontinuity."
"We must ..."
"(Interruption by Mr Ferber)"
"Mr President, you can see that what I feared is coming to pass; this formal sitting could become a lively debate, but Mr Ferber's CSU has so much of its own stuff to deal with that we will allow him an interruption."
"Mrs Merkel, Mr Poettering, we must try to meet both demands. We must not only organise formal sittings characterised by high-flying rhetoric, but must also make things happen from day to day."
"That is what we are calling for."
"In every speech I have heard today, I have heard reference to the social Europe being the core and basis that holds our society together."
"Two and a half years ago, when I said that in my first speech as chairman of my group, what I got for it was mocking laughter from certain quarters in this House."
"Our having made that sort of progress in two and a half years, with all of us now agreed on it, gives me the hope that we will, by the end of your two and a half years in office - and that is how long you have said you will stay there - have moved on even further."
"I should like to make just two brief closing comments."
"I do not, Mr President, share your view that it was the United States of America that defeated Communism or helped to overcome it in Eastern Europe; it was not the United States that did that, but the courageous men and women in Poland; it was they, the Hungarians, and the people in the Baltic States, who defeated Communism, not the Americans, and that, more than ever, needs to be said in this House, with gratitude to the Members from those countries, who represent the new democracies."
"(Applause)"
"My last comment I shall address to you, Mr President, for, since you have turned your attention to the issues of our future, and delivered a speech that is, to my mind, one of the best in this House for many years, it is to you that I will say that I also have the confidence that you will put that into practice."
"As President of this institution, you will have a weighty task, particularly as regards the Constitutional Treaty, and if you can help to find common ground between the highly divergent views of the Heads of State or Government, in the same way as you managed, as chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats) to hold the conflicting interests of that group together, then I am confident that your Presidency will be a good one."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Schulz, It is not for me to judge your speech, but I would like to say that, for one who did not actually want to speak, you managed to do so with a great deal of conviction."
"Thank you very much for doing so."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, your experience in this House since direct elections in 1979 has qualified you well and has given you a rare sense of perspective for the post you occupy."
"I congratulate you on your speech this morning."
"You have seen the European Union grow from 9 countries in the 1970s to 12 in the 1980s, 15 in the 1990s, 25 and then 27 in this decade, with a queue of countries waiting to join."
"You have seen the Treaty of Rome supplemented by the Single European Act, the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice, and now the draft constitutional treaty, as the common market has been enhanced with a single market, a single currency and policies in justice and home affairs, foreign and security arrangements and now energy."
"You have also seen - as have some others of us of more recent vintage - a profound change in what the European Union is all about."
"It is no longer a Union to guarantee peace and security of food supply, but a Union which has to be capable of meeting the three big challenges we face: rapid world population growth and migration, energy resources and climate change, and internationally organised crime linked to terrorism."
"Hitherto, the drive for the building of this Union has come from within."
"Increasingly, it comes from beyond our borders and the response of our institutions has been uncertain."
"There is a malaise affecting our Union which has led to squabbling between the Member States, who, in the name of preserving national sovereignty, are too often giving free rein to global anarchy; and squabbling between our institutions, which turns our citizens cold, like different denominations of the church, arguing about substantiation rather than asking why nobody comes to church any more."
"Mr Poettering, you have the opportunity to lead this House at a time when it is increasingly becoming the dynamo of European integration."
"It is increasingly to the European Parliament that Europeans must look: a House resurgent and outspoken, holding the Council and the Member States to account when their action against terrorism rides roughshod over the rights we cherish; forging consensus - which escapes the Commission - on the single market in services or on consumer protection measures; working with national parliaments to scrutinise the executive, ensuring the law is respected."
"In short, this House is coming of age."
"Ideology has surpassed nationality as the main determinant of voting behaviour."
"It is true that this House does not yet possess a right of initiative or the right to propose the President of the Commission, but neither is now unthinkable and increasingly people believe that both would enhance our Union's culture of democracy."
"Therefore, Mr Poettering, I hope that you will use your two and a half years to grasp the need for reform of this House; to give us a Parliament better equipped to provide such leadership; a House that meets in full session every week; a House that concentrates on profound political choices rather than voting on hundreds of amendments to move semi-colons; a House that uses its new powers of scrutiny to the full to recall and re-examine our laws."
"When you were first elected, this Parliament was a consultative assembly, designed to give a pro forma cover to decisions taken by bureaucrats and diplomats."
"Now it is a cornerstone of our European home."
"In 13 years of codecision, that one function has developed the organs of this body, and transparency has given oxygen to our bloodstreams."
"I should like to say to Chancellor Merkel that codecision is now needed in all areas of policy-making if the checks and balances of democracy are to work at European level."
"The fact is that the Union makes decisions that are binding on Member States without proper democratic or judicial control, exposing us to censure by the Court of Human Rights or the constitutional courts."
"We had a close shave when the German Constitutional Court examined the framework decision on the European arrest warrant and came very close to contesting its legitimacy."
"If the German Government, which blocked the use of the passerelle clause in Article 42 just a few months ago, really wants to promote democracy in Europe, you will recognise the imperative of qualified majority voting in the Council and codecision with the European Parliament as a basis for all law-making, otherwise in your time at the helm you risk looking like the mime artist, Marcel Marceau, appearing to climb a wall but actually going nowhere."
"Mr President, the years 1914 to 1989 on our continent were a 75-year rage of self-mutilation."
"This year, with Bulgaria and Romania in our Union, we can put to rest the ghosts of that period."
"However, the roots of freedom lie in courage."
"I believe there is a German word 'Zivilcourage': you, Chancellor Merkel and President Barroso need to muster the collective courage to take our Union forward as a true democracy, to create what Winston Churchill called in 1945 'a wider patriotism' and a common citizenship for the distraught people of this turbulent and powerful continent."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Watson."
"When you spoke about the vast numbers of amendments I saw smiles on the faces of many of the former Presidents!"
"I think this is a problem which the former Presidents also faced."
"The worst, however, was when it started in 1979 - as President Simone Veil will remember - when in some cases we had more than a thousand amendments, but we did not have the electronic machinery in place to deal with them."
"thar ceann GhrÃºpa UEN. - A UachtarÃ¡in, tÃ¡ tÃº i do bhall den teach seo le fada anois agus tÃ¡ tÃº ar dhuine de na baill is mÃ³ a bhfuil taithÃ­ aige ar obair an tÃ­ seo."
"Thug tÃº riamh, agus tabharfaidh, tacaÃ­ocht lÃ¡idir d'InstitiÃºid na Parlaiminte ag leibhÃ©al na hEorpa agus ar an stÃ¡itse idirnÃ¡isiÃºnta."
"Chuir tÃº polasaÃ­ polaitiÃºil uaillmhianach don dÃ¡ bhliain go leith atÃ¡ romhainn amach os Ã¡r gcomhair anseo inniu."
"TÃ¡ tacaÃ­ocht iomlÃ¡n tugtha ag mo ghrÃºpa polaitÃ­ochta don iarracht pholaitiÃºil riamh agus is mar sin a bheidh amach anseo."
"Mr President, today is a day that we should reflect on where we have come from, but also give a vision for the future."
"I think that in your speech to us today, you presented not only a report card of the past, but also a clear pathway to the future."
"You raised a number of points in your speech that so far none of my colleagues has touched on."
"The first, which is in one sense the most impressive of all, is the fact that the President of the Council, Chancellor Merkel, and the President of the Commission, President Barroso, have shown you and this House the respect to be here today to share in this occasion."
"It reflects well on you obviously as a German to have your leader here, but reflects still more so on this House that Angela Merkel has taken the time to be here with us, despite all the work and efforts that she is soon to take on as President of the Council."
"I think it behoves us to respond to that, not just because of the presence of the office holders, but most importantly of all because of the responsibility which the voters of the European Union have placed on us as their advocates and their voices."
"Sometimes that brings us into conflict with the ideals of the technicians of the establishment of a new European Union."
"Sometimes it brings us into conflict with the demands of Member State governments."
"But our one sacred duty as a Parliament is to be that voice, to be the voice of reason, to be the voice of peace, to be the voice of vision, but most importantly of all, to be the voice for the voices."
"We must remember those who have been lost or forgotten by our societies and ensure that they can be brought forward towards that new future and given that new opportunity."
"In your speech today, Mr President, the one thing I thought was fantastic - and it is the first time that I have heard it from anybody in this House with such real sincerity - was what you said about the role of young people within Europe: your idea of having a new programme for young people, a prize for young people, to allow the new generation to appreciate and understand what we already can understand from our own history."
"As my colleagues rightly said, we speak about America's defeat of communism and Nazism."
"They played a role."
"Let us not deny that Europe would have died without American assistance in the 1940s."
"Let us not forget that Europe would have died without American assistance in 1918."
"Let us not forget that, without the assistance of the US in the 1960s and 70s, we would have been under constant and immediate threat from further war and violence."
"But, let us not also forget that those men and women of vision - whether it was in Solidarity in Poland, the Hungarian uprising, the Spring Revolution, the Velvet Revolution or Pope John-Paul II - all brought a belief in the dignity of human beings, the dignity of difference and the right for people to speak up and to be free in all walks of life."
"That not only defeats totalitarianism, it defeats all ills which face humankind today and that is why your idea of a cultural dialogue, of an understanding of different faiths and traditions is so important for the future development of Europe."
"If you read about us, Europe does not present a threat to anybody, of any faith or of none."
"Indeed, in a lot of ways we tend to become so liberal that we forget about pluralism."
"We forget about understanding some people who have strongly-held beliefs of a non-violent nature and tend to hound them out of office or out of positions, but at the same time, we can show accommodation to those that have a fairly radical viewpoint in life and give them a space for themselves."
"The last two points I would like to make are in relation to the comments made by some colleagues and by the Presidents of both the Commission and the Council in relation to the development of European policy in the future."
"Maybe I am misinterpreting what the people are saying, but European citizens are fed up with the nitty-gritty talk about institutional change and reforms."
"What European citizens want to see is action; what European citizens want to see is a positive response to the problems that face us."
"We have had some progress towards tackling climate change, social policy and other issues of importance in the single market, but citizens want to see action being taken on a real level that affects their lives in real ways, rather than mere reaction to problems when they arise."
"Too often in this Parliament we look back and say 'that was done wrong in 1979' or 'this was done wrong in 1992' or something else was done wrong in 1997 or 'we missed an opportunity'."
"Let us not forget that politics is an art, whereas economics is a science and you get the right result every time if you use the right formula."
"Politics is an art because it must respond to the needs of society, to the wants and desires of people and, more importantly of all, to the volatility of society as a whole."
"Lastly, the most pressing task that we have before us in creating a fairer area of peace and understanding is in the Middle East."
"I applaud your desire to visit Lebanon, Palestine and Israel and to start to build that process."
"Europe must be re-involved at a central level in finding the solution to peace in the Middle East."
"I would just like to say to you, Mr President, for the next two and a half years, despite the travails that we have brought against you and even though rough winds will blow on your face, you should always realise that you have the support of this House at your back."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you Mr Crowley."
"You spoke for longer than the time allotted to you."
"I would not say that you got more time because you said many nice things, but subsequent speakers will have to stick to the time allotted to them even if they do not always share your position."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we certainly recognise and respect the seriousness and depth of your European commitment, and your speech, today, sets out some priorities with which - even though they remain a little vague - the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is substantially in agreement."
"You rightly recalled this Parliament's history, and I am very grateful to you for having brought into the Chamber today past presidents of our Parliament."
"I was able to meet some of them when I arrived in Parliament, as a young and enthusiastic federalist, and to collaborate with many of them on their work: I am therefore truly happy to see them here today."
"Despite this, Mr President, we await concrete evidence, and this evidence confronts us with very specific choices, which cannot remain vague. Our Parliament will have to decide whether to remain silent and disciplined or whether to be the forum where action is taken in the name of European interests and values, today almost lost behind diplomatic manoeuvring and national interests."
"This is our institution's responsibility: to be a platform for European debate and for proposals for a democratic Europe."
"In this context, Mr President, the contribution of our institution to resolving the constitutional deadlock must not simply be - as you said, repeating word for word, and surely not by coincidence, what Mrs Merkel said to us - 'saving the substance of the Constitution'."
"We cannot be content to 'save the substance of the Constitution' in a purely rhetorical fashion."
"As a matter of urgency, we must do two things which in the past, under the presidency of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and under the presidency of Mr Schulz, this Parliament has not been able to achieve - no, I refer to the two presidents of the majority groups - and that is, firstly, to find a consensus on what to do exactly, as Parliament, in a fully autonomous way, with regard to the Constitution and, secondly - more importantly - to fight for the European Parliament to retain the constitutional role won for it by the Convention."
"If there is to be debate on a timetable or on a proposal, we wish to act, Mrs Merkel, Mr Poettering, as codecision-makers and not observers."
"Mr Poettering, I want to see you fight for this right of Parliament's."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, you spoke of values and cited specific cases relating to the defence of human rights, which is a subject of the utmost importance for our institution."
"You also spoke of tolerance, a word of which you are very fond."
"I must tell you, speaking personally, that sometimes this word worries me, because behind the word 'tolerance' crimes are committed and individuals' rights are infringed - crimes and infringements that are, precisely, 'tolerated' - and this is something that we absolutely must not forget."
"This is why we prefer to speak of 'rights common to all men and all women', which are equal for everybody and must remain so."
"To speak of relations with Russia means bringing up the subject of Chechnya and, responsibly, opening a debate on decreasing energy dependency, which involves strong criticism of those countries - and there are many of them - that are running in a disorganised fashion to the court of 'Czar' Putin."
"In our dialogue with the United States we must not forget the death penalty in force in that country, CIA flights, the issue of passenger data, and pre-emptive war."
"Finally, with regard to the defence of human rights we must not forget, by means of small emergency resolutions, to defend those individuals who by themselves, forgotten in some prison or some forest, are defending those rights."
"Merely speaking of security, Mr President - and you spoke at length of it, in the name of our Parliament - cannot make the resolutions that have been adopted in favour of disarmament and a code of conduct on arms progress to the second stage."
"Mr President, we will be very active in the work on internal reform."
"There are two subjects that you did not mention and that seem to me to be fundamental: the first is the debate on Parliament's seat."
"I hope that you, personally, and the parliamentary groups will have the courage to hold a debate in this Chamber on the European Parliament's seat."
"Perhaps the home of European history may best be located here, in this very beautiful building."
"Who knows? I think, however, that it is important for you to truly take the initiative in tackling the problem of where Parliament should meet."
"The second subject - and I know very well that I will have to work hard here to convince you - is making this institution greener, not from a political point of view but in terms of its environmental sustainability."
"I will succeed in convincing you, I am absolutely certain of it, since every day the resources wasted even by this Assembly in terms of water, light and official cars is something that, if we want to be true to our commitments on climate change, we cannot tolerate."
"In conclusion, I would briefly like to address Mrs Merkel."
"Your proposals on bureaucracy, on discontinuity and on better regulation leave us rather cold and concerned."
"The problem of bureaucracy is national rather than European: how many people are there in the delegation accompanying you today?"
"It is certainly more substantial than that accompanying President Barroso, and those complaining of excessive regulations are the multinationals, not the citizens, who say - going by successive Eurobarometer surveys - that they want more laws to protect them, not fewer!"
"Finally, the proposal on discontinuity in fact brings in an opportunity for your institution to boycott and delay all the laws that you do not like."
"Mr President, I wish you success in your work and I believe that we will have fun over the next two years."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mrs Frassoni."
"With regard to human rights, we have always agreed with each other."
"As for the issue of where Parliament should sit, I have indeed given thought to whether I should talk about that, but came to the conclusion that I should not."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, former Presidents who remind me of many times spent together, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, it is not often that we have a chance to take a step back and enjoy the opportunity that is given us today, however briefly, to exchange views on the entire period between now and the next European elections."
"True, it is no secret that my group does not share the political options of the majority of this Parliament."
"I will nevertheless deliberately use some of the key points of your speech to make several specific proposals."
"They are limited measures with nothing revolutionary about them, and I sincerely think you do not necessarily have to sympathise with the European United Left/Nordic Green Left to identify with them."
"If the President of the European Parliament simply took them into account that would send a positive signal to important sections of our public opinion; it would say that you have heard them."
"Thus, referring to the aspirations of Europe's citizens, Mr President, you stressed and I quote: 'we must preserve the European social model' and, more importantly, you went on to say 'our acts must be convincing'."
"That is in fact essential if we are to dispel a deep malaise that is being fed by the idea that instead of protecting the citizens from the effects of today's globalisation the European Union is too often helping to make everyone's existence increasingly insecure."
"A significant act to begin to dispel this feeling of inevitability would be welcome."
"I suggest, Mr President, that you call on the Council, Commission and Parliament to abandon a proposal for a directive that affects the entire population of the European Union and that seems so dogmatic, so unjustified and so devastating for the future of public services that it is likely to provoke a new Bolkestein effect if nothing changes in the next few months;"
"I am speaking of the proposal to liberalise postal services on 1 January 2009, six months before the next elections."
"More generally, you stressed another idea which I consider very right and very important."
"You say we need 'a new pact between the citizens and the institutions of the European Union', then, about the future European treaty, you say: 'we need a thoroughgoing reform of the European Union'."
"Everyone agrees this is necessary, but opinions on the substance of the future European basic law differ."
"Mr Barroso has just addressed the Netherlands, saying to them: please help us, everyone has to move."
"I am suggesting to you a method that will allow everyone to move, to help relaunch Europe."
"Let the process which is starting be an opportunity for a real public debate across the Union, a candid debate, as close to the citizens as possible, on the meaning of Europe 50 years after the Treaty of Rome, on the purpose of our common policies, on the commitments we are prepared to assume together in the future."
"If the President of Parliament sets himself the task of bringing such an initiative to fruition, he will instantly have fulfilled his mandate."
"Finally, Mr President, you made some apt remarks about intercultural dialogue and more particularly the Middle East, where you hope to go as soon as possible, you said."
"That does not surprise me, and I thank you for it."
"With this in mind, of all the initiatives I would like the President of Parliament to take, the most symbolic in my view, following the almost unhoped-for Mecca agreement, in which the whole of Hamas promises to comply with the international resolutions and the agreements signed between the PLO and Israel, would be to solemnly call on the European Union to lift the blockade on the Palestinian Government and to give a new chance to the hope for a just peace in a region that has been bruised by occupation and war for several generations."
"I know that none of these initiatives will be easy to take, Mr President, but if you do, they are such that history will remember them."
"Thank you, Mr Wurtz. I am grateful for the respect that we have always shown each other."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, Chancellor Merkel, Mr Barroso, esteemed former Presidents of this Chamber, whom I remember with pleasure from the Conference of the Presidents, we now have Mr Poettering as President, and he is eager for a bigger dose of the EU, even though he also cleverly talks about subsidiarity."
"He should allow himself a referendum in which he might convince his fellow Germans that they too should vote in favour of a Constitution with more laws and regulations made in Brussels."
"Three thousand regulations are not enough."
"It is not enough that 86% of the laws ratified in the German Bundestag are now enacted in Brussels."
"Listen to the warning from the former German President, Roman Herzog, who headed our Charter Convention."
"Note the results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands."
"The French and the Dutch had a chance to vote in favour of the Constitution, and they threw it away."
"The lesson now drawn from this is that we should never again have a referendum."
"The former President of the Bundestag's Europe Committee, JÃ¼rgen Meier, also stated in the Constitutional Convention that a voluntary referendum could be agreed in the Bundestag, with an ordinary majority sought."
"Why not allow the Germans to express their opinion on the Constitution that the President and the German Presidency of the Council are so keen to see adopted?"
"Officials in Brussels and the judges in Luxembourg have a pathological attachment to supersizing and have a fear of democracy."
"They have not understood the modern trend towards slimmed-down organisations, decentralised accountability and outsourcing."
"What is good enough for businesses is not good enough for the EU."
"Nothing is to be farmed out from Brussels to the Member States or to the citizens."
"Laws are much better for having been drawn up by 3 000 secret working parties in the Commission and adopted by 300 secret working parties in the Council of Ministers, as well as by 15 000 professional lobbyists."
"Long live technocracy in a corporate EU!"
"Mrs Mussolini can spare a friendly thought for her grandfather's dedication to corporatism."
"The voters can be allowed to go to the polls every five years and vote in favour of someone who can neither propose nor adopt laws."
"Elected representatives can only advise the Commission by tabling amendments."
"That is what it all comes down to at present, and a similar mindset is also at the heart of the Constitution - only in many more areas."
"If something cannot be adopted by Council ministers and officials, there is always the possibility of going to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg with proposals that neither the electorate, national parliaments nor governments will know anything about."
"Unanimously adopted penalties in connection with environmental issues are deemed unlawful because the judges want to see such penalties adopted by majority decision-making and well within their own control."
"Enshrined as it is in treaties and draft constitutions alike, property law is clearly a matter for the Member States."
"However, the obligation incumbent on farmers to reside on their own farms is judged to be unlawful, despite the unanimous verdict of the Danish Parliament to the contrary."
"Voters and their parliaments are regarded as incapable, and family holdings are seen as being out of date. Let us, rather, have a bunch of jumped-up Prussian-style Junkers running agriculture everywhere in the EU."
"Farmers are not good enough, and nor are employees' and employers' collective agreements, penal legislation, national judges or the voters."
"The EU grandees know far better."
"We have won many small victories for openness, and the Bundestag in Berlin has introduced the best rules yet for scrutinising the EU."
"The time has now come when the threefold division of power into openness, proximity and democracy needs to govern the whole of the EU."
"There must be no more laws that cannot be amended by elected representatives."
"There must be no more laws that cannot be amended by the voters at the next election."
"There must be no more treaties and constitutions that have not been adopted by the voters in referendums held throughout the EU, and preferably on the same day."
"The President mentioned our electronic voting equipment."
"I fondly recall the time when the new system from Olivetti was introduced."
"It is a system I should like to have back again, for then my proposals could actually be adopted."
"Ladies and gentlemen, those who are less familiar with the details - particularly our guests in the galleries - may perhaps not be aware that elections in Denmark are held on Thursdays rather than on Sundays, and Mr Bonde always takes that to mean that he has been a Member of this House for longer, even though that is wrong in legal terms, since he and I both became Members of it on 17 July 1979."
"His constant insistence on this does, however, give me hope that he cannot be that lacking in affection for the European Union and for this House if he so readily asserts that he - as he understands it - has been in this House for longer than anyone else."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, former Presidents, Mrs Merkel, Mr Barroso, the President of Parliament has just done a skilful job of describing the kind of political programme that one might perhaps have expected to hear from a President of the European Council or, indeed, of the Commission than from a President of Parliament in his role as arbiter."
"In view of the group dynamics that often prevail in institutions, your speech, Mr President, concerning the will of the peoples no doubt reflects the opinion of the majority of this House."
"You will allow me, however, to express what lawyers in the English-speaking world call a dissenting opinion."
"You spoke of the 'temporary' hitch - the word 'temporary' was yours - involving the draft European Constitution as it was received in France and the Netherlands. The impression you gave was that this was merely a hiccup limited to two Member States."
"However, everyone knows, or ought to know, that if this project had been submitted directly to the people of the Member States and not merely to members of the national parliaments, the document concerned would, in all probability, have been rejected much more widely."
"We need, then, to know once and for all why, when nations express themselves freely in opposition to the dominant way of thinking, they go on being presented with the same menu that they have rejected."
"When, however, they come out in agreement with the dominant trend, it is emphasised that their commitment is apparently definitive, irrevocable and perpetual and that they will not be entitled to backtrack."
"In your speech, you mentioned several important features of our European tradition, and four in particular: Greek philosophy, Roman law, Judaeo-Christian spirituality and the Enlightenment."
"That, however, is a crucial element of the problem: how faithful is the European Union to these components of its intellectual, moral and spiritual heritage?"
"Is the European Union now inspired by Christian values or by a general hedonism that is out to destroy these same values in the name of a human rights ideology that brooks no resistance but of which variable geometry is always a feature?"
"Are the structure and operation of the EU governed by Greek philosophy's demand for clarity and simplicity and by the Greek political tradition of citizens' direct participation in the affairs of the city state; or are we instead seeing the implementation of a heavy, centralised and shortly to be outmoded structure that is ostensibly designed for governing almost 500 million Europeans but that, in practice, disregards their differences?"
"Is European legislation inspired by the precision and concision of Roman law or is it a concoction of thousands of obscure and wordy texts involving detailed restrictions?"
"Are we genuinely respectful of the tradition of public debate handed down to us by the Greeks and Romans?"
"As for the Enlightenment, I would not conceal from you the concern we felt last month on hearing Chancellor Merkel quote freely from Voltaire in this House but then say to us - not literally, admittedly, but in essence - that there should be no tolerance for the enemies of tolerance - a statement that recalls the words of the French revolutionary Saint-Just, spoken before the revolutionary court that instigated the Terror: 'no liberty for the enemies of liberty'."
"To conclude, Europe is the only region in the history of humanity to have invented the liberty and equality of nations."
"It is the region in which the people have always risen up against putative dictatorships - a fact that explains their current distrust of the wayward direction taken by the EU."
"We do not need a Eurocratic superstate to guarantee the mutual security of our nations and borders, to launch detailed industrial, cultural and research cooperation projects and to protect us properly against migratory flows or against imports of products that have been manufactured for next to nothing and that are ruining our industries."
"The instruments of international law are more than adequate to this task."
"We have to rediscover the true genius of Europe and the law appropriate to Europeans."
"(SK) Mr President, may I begin by offering my sincere congratulations on your election to the position of president of the European Parliament, which is the most democratic and, at the same time, one of the most important of European institutions."
"You have become the first president of the European Parliament after the adoption and implementation of the Treaty of Nice."
"Currently, the European Union comprises 27 Member States."
"I have not referred to this fact by chance, as political experience demonstrates that the implementation of one treaty is followed by preparations for another."
"Two years of wavering and marking time with regard to the Constitutional Treaty have harmed the idea of a united Europe."
"You are assuming office at a time when Germany, one of the founding Member States, holds the presidency of the European Union, and I therefore expect you to decide on what needs to be done next concerning the Constitutional Treaty."
"Most Member States have opted for supporting the Constitutional Treaty and are willing to carry on implementing the vision of a united Europe, and their wishes cannot be overlooked because of the negative stance adopted by two of the Member States."
"I would appreciate it if, following the election of its president, the European Parliament would now give some thought to introducing new rules or revising the existing Rules of Procedure."
"I have respected the 'gentleman's agreement' made in the past by the two big political groups with regard to the election of the president of the European Parliament."
"However, a democratic system should also allow a candidate from a smaller political group to be elected."
"I am quite sure that in this House there are many distinguished and capable people in smaller political groups as well."
"Mr President, I sincerely hope that during your term in office you will advocate greater involvement by the twelve new Member States in the shaping of European policies."
"Looking at how the new Member States are currently represented on the committees of the European Parliament, I cannot help feeling dejected."
"Similar discrimination against the new Member States can be seen from the number of their nationals employed by the European Parliament."
"What is important here is not only the mere numbers but the positions these people fill."
"There are nationals from our countries who often have two university degrees, foreign work experience and a good command of three of the EU 15 languages, and yet are in secretarial positions and therefore assisting superiors whose academic and language skills may be significantly inferior to their own."
"By way of an example, let me refer to the procedure known as internal tendering to fill secretarial positions, which was carried out last year and served as the basis for assigning about 50 employees from the new Member States to secretarial jobs."
"All of these people are university graduates and are currently performing at grade B and A levels but collecting secretarial pay."
"The European Union is generating savings, as skilled work is carried out for low pay, but I am wondering whether this represents fairness and non-discrimination."
"Non-discrimination also includes gender equality, a topic so often debated here."
"We even have a dedicated committee to deal with this issue, but we are lagging behind in enforcement."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to wish you every success in your role as president of the European Parliament."
"I have great esteem for you personally as well as for your rich track record and experience in European politics, and I believe that you will make a good and just administrator of public affairs."
"I should like to thank Mrs BelohorskÃ¡ very much for her very kind personal remarks."
"That brings to a close the part of the sitting including the President's inaugural address."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"I greatly welcome the remarks of both President Poettering and Chancellor Merkel."
"Quoting Robert Schuman, we can say: 'the story of European integration is fundamentally a success story'."
"A failure of the constitutional process would put at risk the continuation of this success story."
"If we do not succeed in creating a more efficient and more democratic Union, one that is closer to the citizens, this would seriously affect the success of the Lisbon Strategy, the creation of a more competitive Europe that nonetheless preserves its social values."
"I consider an important element of this to be the creation of a more transparent, more unified legislation, which can promote the development of small and medium-sized enterprises at the European level, and thereby help create jobs as well."
"Increasing competitiveness is also indispensable in order for Europe not to be forced to play the role of 'economic giant - political dwarf' in world politics."
"Today it may be more important than ever for European values, human rights, democracy, the rule of law and equal opportunities to be represented globally."
"This is especially true in the year of equal opportunities, when both at European and at national levels we must make efforts to help those who suffer disadvantages."
"While welcoming the importance given to the integration of migrants, I would like to add with regard to their situation: we should not forget the largest and perhaps more disadvantaged minority in Europe, the Roma."
"In this regard as well, we need to tear down the imaginary economic and social Berlin Wall."
"I would note especially the protection of women and children, who are the most vulnerable and suffer from a dual discrimination."
"With regard to the rule of law, I wish to recall that the Union is fundamentally based on legal principles, and its functioning presupposes that every citizen respects its laws."
"Members of the European Parliament must lead the way in respecting our laws - otherwise we shall set a bad example to all of Europe's citizens."

"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should just like to bring to the attention of the House a technical amendment that we should make pursuant to Rule 155."
"In the Commission's proposal there was a technical omission under Article 2, dealing with the transposition of the proposal."
"The exact date for the transposition in the Member States is missing."
"Therefore I propose under Rule 155 to add '[18 months after the date of publication]' as the date for transposition."
"This should be specified."
"I should like to propose that to Members as a technical amendment."

"Community action programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the Community's financial interests (Hercule II programme) (vote)"
"After the vote"
"Mr President, it is not much use me speaking once the vote has happened, so all I want to say is that you need to keep more of an eye out in future."
"I would like to thank both the German Presidency and its Finnish predecessor."
"We have wrapped up this topic in just one reading, and we will be spending some EUR 100 million on fighting fraud over the coming years."
"That is what I wanted to tell the House."
"4."
"Rules for the implementation of the Financial Regulation (vote)"
"Before the vote"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why I have asked for the floor is that I have to make the House aware of an alarming situation in the negotiations between the Council and the Commission."
"What you have before you is one of the last chances for the Barroso Commission to make headway towards an unreservedly positive statement of assurance."
"We have made so bold as to pick up the Commission's own proposals and include them in this report."
"The Commission now seeks to reject it without proposing anything else to put in its place."
"If, today, by doing nothing, you prevent simplification, improved recovery of wrongly disbursed funds and more efficient monitoring, you are ensuring that the Commission's management will have a black mark against it in April 2009."
"We will then, in the discharge procedure, have an especially fault-ridden budget for 2007 to deal with - the first of the new Financial Perspective and only two months before the European elections."
"If our proposals are not accepted, the Commission and the Council will be putting the brakes on and throwing the Euro-sceptics a juicy issue for 2009."
"It is regrettably the case that the Council has been on a collision course particularly since the German Presidency began; instead of organising on a joint basis the publication of grants in aid and their recipients - which has already been agreed to - the Council has surprised everyone by saying, bluntly and without explanation, 'no', both to it and to research and development subsidies, that is to say, to the direct international joint administration as a whole."
"In so doing, it is sowing dissent in Europe, for, without standardisation, everyone can do or fail to do whatever they please, and we are stuck with a loss of trust on the part of the European taxpayer."
"The Council is robbing this Commission of transparency, which was its most visible success in the Budget sphere, and is of no value if it is not given tangible form."
"I appeal to the Commission and the Presidency of the Council, as a matter of urgency, to face up to their responsibility for this legal draft, and to join us in making things simpler and cutting back bureaucracy."
"The proposals are on the table before you, and I ask - I beg - you to give your assent to them."
"(Applause)"

"Voting time"
"Explanations of vote"
"Our aim is not to issue an opinion on the validity or otherwise of this decision to repeal Directive 68/89/EEC, although, as a rule, we have our reservations as regards the Commission's harmonising tendencies. Our view is indeed shared by most businesses and Member States in stating that they do not apply this Directive."
"It is important, on the other hand, to issue an opinion on the process of which this forms part, namely the 'better lawmaking' initiative, which, under the guise of simplification, is in practice a policy of market deregulation at national and Community level."
"The Commission's justification leaves no room for doubt: 'better lawmaking is vital to improving the competitiveness of European businesses and to achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda'."
"In other words, the purpose of 'better lawmaking' is to benefit business rather than to protect the consumer's labour, social and environmental rights."
"This is what we object to."
"We do not want this process to lead to the repeal of any legislation that undermines the notion that competition and the profits of business are of prime importance, above all other considerations."
"in writing. (PL) I am voting in favour of the report on Decision No 804/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 establishing a Community action programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the Community's financial interests (Hercule II programme)."
"Mr BÃ¶sch has tabled a good report."
"The changes in the preamble are a better reflection of the criteria and purpose of this regulation."
"The proposed change provides improved tools for implementing the action programme and strengthens supervision of its correct implementation."
"Allocating an additional EUR 67 million to the Hercule II programme annually will have a significant effect on combating smuggling and fraud."
"in writing. I support the Hercule II programme and the work it is carrying out for the prevention, detection and combating of activities damaging the Community's financial interests."
"The type of fraud combated under the programme must be tackled in order to retain the tax base of Member States."
"in writing. (PL) I am voting for the report on the proposal on the Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) amending Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities."
"Mrs GrÃ¤Ãle and Mr Pahor, the rapporteurs, have compiled an excellent report which includes a number of amendments."
"Implementing the regulation will provide greater flexibility and transparency in the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities."
"It will better secure the Community's financial interests, while at the same time giving the Committee on Budgetary Control more transparent opportunities to assess the proper implementation of the Community budget in the relevant section."
"in writing. I support the amendments put forward by this report as the European Parliament's budgetary function is vital to maintaining democratic scrutiny at the European level."
"I especially support the amendments aimed at improving the comparison between the political will expressed in Parliament's remarks on the budget and the actual implementation."
"(DE) Mr President, the INSPIRE data system is a considerable gain for us in Europe, since, for every policy, particularly in the environmental sphere, we need mutually comparable data on space, and so I would like to thank Mrs Brepoels, the rapporteur, for negotiating an outstandingly good compromise, which is the only way in which we can enable the public to inform themselves on the environmental hazards in store for them and to participate in the systems that we are setting up in Europe."
"INSPIRE is making an essential contribution to this."
"in writing. I voted in favour of this report as it will create a waste management policy that will help us meet our objective of reducing waste and protecting our environment."
"We need to protect the environment at an EU level and this report represents an attempt to do this."
"The report meets the priorities I feel we should have for our environment of reducing the production of non-reusable or non-recyclable waste, making producers and importers responsible for waste, avoiding the reclassification of energy recovery incinerators for waste disposal and introducing a requirement to develop national waste prevention programmes."
"(DE) Mr President, two things were of particular importance to us Austrians when it came to the revision of this framework directive on waste."
"One was the special rule for organic waste, since both we and Germany have systems for dealing with this, which work very well and need to be maintained."
"At the same time, though, we urge the Commission to keep working on this in order to establish a Europe-wide system for it."
"The second thing we were concerned about was catering waste and waste from guesthouses, which can, after appropriate treatment, be reused in the husbandry of pigs."
"That is quite essential if those and similar food flows are to be properly reprocessed."
"(DE) Mr President, slowly, but surely, society is rethinking its approach to waste, but, since more and more countries want to reprocess old waste and the owners of plant want to spare them overload, the consequence is that waste is transported from one end of Europe to the other."
"Even if we are now paying attention to the environment, we become aware from time to time of black sheep quietly or blatantly disposing of waste in an illegal manner or claiming money for costly reprocessing that they have not actually carried out."
"Not only does that do harm to the living space we all share, but it also costs the state and municipalities a lot of money, and we need to be more vigorous in dealing with this."
"We also need to do more work on informing people, since some members of the public, out of ignorance, dispose of such things as medicines in the wrong way."
"It also goes without saying that we have to do more about recycling, and that the EU and its Member States need to set us a good example in this respect."
"Over and above that, too, we must not forget that the issue of the storage of nuclear waste has still not yet been resolved, and that is yet another reason to refrain from building more nuclear power stations."
"in writing. We and the Fianna Fail Delegation in the EP have voted in favour of a stronger Commission proposal on waste favouring the five-stage hierarchy with the essential emphasis on Prevention and Reduction of waste, followed by reuse, recycling, recovery and then the safe and environmentally sound disposal of waste in this order of priority."
"We have voted in favour of calling for binding targets for Member States to stabilise waste production at anticipated 2008 levels by 2012 and support the EP call for greater reuse and recycling to reduce pressure on landfill sites, for Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that, where practicable, all waste undergoes recovery operations, to take measures to promote recycling and to set up collection schemes of different streams, to move towards a Recycling Society by 2020 where 50 % of our municipal solid waste should be recycled in addition to biowaste and industrial waste."
"The issue of the distinction between Recovery and Disposal is a very important one."
"We have voted in favour of amendments that clearly distinguish between recovery and disposal and have voted against amendments that would reclassify units from disposal to recovery."
"in writing. - (FR) I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the excellent work that they have done."
"We do indeed need to take action, as waste management policies do not always advance the cause of recycling and composting. Unfortunately, dumping and incineration are still the most widespread ways of dealing with waste."
"I am in favour of the five-level hierarchy applicable to waste management (prevention, re-use, recycling, recovery and dumping) as, in my view, the objective of reducing waste must be given priority, and precedence must therefore be given to a policy of waste prevention."
"I am in favour, for example, of introducing product labelling designed to develop eco-consumption."
"I am pleased that, for purposes of simplification, excavated land has been excluded from the list of forms of waste."
"However, I think it necessary to make a clear distinction between recycling and recovery, and to manage incineration practices, with a view to creating genuine energy recovery, which must not constitute a risk to human health and the environment."
"I support the proposal whereby, in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle, those who produce waste would, as a matter of general practice, be held responsible for it."
"This report raises a number of points that are, in some cases, inconsistent."
"The report proposes priorities regarding, on the one hand, waste management, with the emphasis on prevention, reuse, recycling and other recovery operations, and, on the other, regarding waste disposal."
"This is something we welcome, and we hope that the final text will eventually reflect this proposal."
"Unfortunately, however, some of the positive amendments that were tabled - aimed at removing incineration from classification as a recovery process, and at ensuring that using this method would automatically be null and void - were not adopted, whereas others, much more limited in scope, were adopted. Therein lie some of the inconsistencies."
"Consequently, at the forthcoming negotiation stage, all our attention must be focused on the process, in order to monitor the development of the definitions and the content thereof."
"Hence at this first reading we have prioritised the aspects that improved on the Commission's original proposal."
"The final vote at second reading, however, will depend on clarification of the existing inconsistencies."
"in writing. I will be voting in favour of the Jackson report on waste."
"It is important that we avoid burying ourselves under the proliferation of packaging consumer society imposes on us."
"I am in favour of recycling to the maximum practical level, but that is not enough."
"We must limit the amount of waste generated before recycling."
"However much we try, there will be material requiring disposal."
"Provided that it is kept to the minimum practical level, I have no problem if some of that material is burnt."
"I have visited in Germany CHP schemes based on waste incineration which are to be commended."
"We will help our planet and our future by utilising a variety of measures and not by making one scheme fit all."
"in writing. I supported the Jackson report today because it encompassed the thrust of the Environment Committee's progressive stance on waste prevention and management."
"I am particularly satisfied that the European Parliament has rejected the Commission's proposal to re-brand municipal waste incinerators based on certain criteria."
"Sinn FÃ©in supports those communities in Ireland fighting against the imposition of dangerous incinerators onto their communities."
"The Jackson report sends out a clear signal that the European Parliament supports the principles of a recycling society - Member States should do so too."
"The inclusion of the five-step waste hierarchy plan and the insistence on obliging Member States to provide waste prevention plans are also welcome."
"I regret that clearer and more ambitious targets were not included, however."
"The debate should focus on the idea that the excesses of those championing the environment will result in unrealistic, unworkable legislation. Such legislative inadequacy will in turn lead to environmental negligence and to an avoidable legacy for future generations."
"One must, on the other hand, be mindful of the fact that, for all our good intentions on reducing pollution, the truth is that the ongoing increase in standards of living in the EU, and indeed throughout the world, will always lead to higher consumption and inevitably to more waste."
"We must therefore be realistic and, more importantly, seek to obtain a positive return, as suggested here, on waste treatment, in terms of energy."
"in writing. - (FR) Prevention is better than cure."
"This adage, which ringingly endorses the desire to tackle the root causes of problems, applies perfectly to European waste policy."
"What, then, are the facts?"
"Between 1995 and 2003, global waste production has increased by 19% an average of 3.5 tonnes per person per year."
"If we add to this the fact that less than 20% of waste is recycled, that - in 50% of cases end-of-life materials are not recycled and end up scattered throughout the countryside and that, moreover, allowing incinerators and waste that is dangerous to the environment and to public health to proliferate is not a tenable policy, what we have is a whole waste management philosophy that needs to be re-thought, and to be re-thought along three main axes: eco-design as a priority of waste prevention policy, given that 80% of the environmental impact occurs at the time that a product is manufactured and processed; the implementation of green taxation, which is intended to have a deterrent effect and which discourages excess packaging and energy-guzzling products; and the closure of Europe's 10 000 illicit rubbish dumps or the modification of these dumps to bring them into line with the 2001 EU Landfill Directive."
"in writing. I welcome this report in tackling the EU waste problem."
"I am pleased that a legally binding stabilisation target has been introduced for waste prevention."
"I am also pleased that there has been no weakening of the principle of the five-stage 'hierarchy of waste': prevention and reduction of waste, re-use of waste, recycling of waste (less than a third of waste is recycled today), other recovery operations and, finally, the safe and environmentally sound disposal of waste."
"As we know, one of the problems of modern society is waste production."
"We therefore endorse the adoption of this document, which places the accent on the primary objective of waste management, namely the protection of the environment and human health."
"We would also highlight the adoption of what is referred to as the 'waste hierarchy', that is to say, the establishment of the following action priorities, in order: prevention, reuse, recycling, other recovery operations such as energy recovery and lastly disposal."
"With the higher importance attached to the issue of prevention, the intention is to reduce as far as possible the waste created."
"Let us not forget, however, that given the enormous amount of waste currently produced, measures aimed at reuse, recycling and disposal that could be implemented remain inadequate and incapable of meeting our needs."
"Waste reduction is therefore a crucial issue. To achieve this, however, entails a change in standards of production and consumption."
"It also involves clarifying the problem and raising awareness among the entire population."
"Consequently, it must be clarified how waste management is to be paid for, and guarantees must be put in place to ensure that it is not the 'weakest link in the chain', namely the consumers, who have to carry the can."
"We therefore feel that reference to the application of the 'polluter pays' principle is dangerous."
"in writing. - (EL) In Greece, there are now 3 500 uncontrolled dumps."
"About half incinerate, with serious repercussions on the environment and public health."
"The volume of waste is increasing and most of it is dumped in landfills."
"On the other hand, the re-use and recycling of waste are still at excessively low levels and illegal cross-border transportation of waste is increasing."
"All this applies to most of the Member States and is rightly pointed out in the report entitled 'Thematic Strategy on the recycling of waste'""."
"Unfortunately, instead of finding solutions to these social problems, the Commission is using confusing targets and phoney definitions and a lack of qualitative and quantitative targets to promote the interests of the manufacturers and operators of incineration plants, which are major economic interests, at a time when we know that incineration produces gaseous pollution, dangerous solids and toxic liquid waste which contribute to the greenhouse effect."
"At the same time, incineration acts as a counterincentive to recycling."
"This confirms that the capitalist ÎU cannot by its very nature apply a waste management policy based on the criterion of environmental protection and public health, because this is incompatible with unhampered action by capital to generate profits."
"We also express our disagreement with the principle of 'the polluter pays' and the principle of the 'waste generator's responsibility', as they are tools for shifting blame from the polluter, who can basically pollute with impunity and just pay a financial price."
"in writing. I voted in favour of this report as I believe we should create a waste management policy that will reduce waste and protect our environment."
"I believe the basis of the EU waste policy should be the protection of the environment and not to facilitate the trade of waste."
"The 'polluter pays' principle, the principle of producer responsibility in the EU waste legislation as well as the implementation of concrete targets for prevention are important aspects of this report that I favour."
"in writing. The proposal for a separate directive on sewage sludge, a revision of the waste incinerator directive and proposals on waste prevention should be welcomed."
"(NL) Mr President, I voted against the Bozkurt report."
"Whilst a number of necessary conclusions have been drawn, we in this House are passing up an opportunity to bring real pressure to bear on the Turkish Government."
"The accession negotiations with Turkey could be used as a lever to make progress in the area of human rights, in this case women's rights, but it would appear that we have made a conscious decision not to do this."
"In this House, there is a majority that assumes that Turkey must be able to join the European Union at all costs."
"The official line is, of course, that negotiations with Turkey can be suspended at any time if it transpires that that country is clearly flouting the human rights conditions."
"It has, though, become evident to us, time and time again, that the negotiations will never be suspended."
"It is a stipulation that serves one purpose and one purpose only: to pacify the majority of the voting public in Europe who are opposed to Turkey joining."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by Mrs Bozkurt on women's role in social, economic and political life in Turkey."
"Although the legal framework for women's rights appears to be generally satisfactory, its actual implementation is still deficient, in my opinion: violence against women - and, in particular, honour crimes and forced marriages - must be systematically condemned."
"I welcome the proposal in the report inviting Turkish institutions to build alliances with all groupings - civil and social - in society so as to initiate campaigns to spread awareness of violence committed against women and children."
"I am also delighted by the adoption of the recommendation addressed to the Turkish political parties to include more female candidates on election lists as from the next elections in 2007."
"Finally, I am very pleased about the request to the Turkish Government to make it mandatory for girls prevented by their families from attending school to have access to knowledge."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Bozkurt because it reinforces the idea that the Turkish Government must adopt measures enabling women to play a more prominent role in Turkey's social, economic and political life, despite progress that has already been made."
"This report illustrates that there is a long way to go when it comes to protecting Turkish women against domestic violence and honour crimes. It also calls on the Turkish Government to build more shelters for women who are victims of violence."
"By voting for this report we only wanted to endorse protection of the rights of all Turkish women, including in accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU, high on the agenda of which is the crucial issue of respect for human rights, including women's rights."
"Yet we do not consider this to be the only issue to take into account in the negotiations with Turkey."
"Our opposition to accession negotiations while Turkey continues its unacceptable occupation of Northern Cyprus is well known."
"We therefore object to a number of points in the report before us."
"As the adopted report says, although the new Criminal Code, which entered into force in June 2005, has substantially improved the fundamental rights of Turkish women, the European Directives on gender equality have yet to be transposed in full."
"We also deplore the fact that, in some parts of South-East Turkey, girls are not registered when they are born, which hampers the fight against forced marriages and honour crimes, as the victims have no official identity."
"We also join in calling on the Turkish Government to guarantee women from the Kurdish minority equal involvement in women's rights programmes."
"in writing. (SV) We fully share the view that Turkey, like other candidate countries, must establish a democratic constitutional state with full human rights and gender equality."
"However, we are critical of quite a few individual points in the report."
"For example, it is absurd for the European Parliament to propose that a mandatory quota system be adopted, ensuring fair representation of women on election lists (paragraph 41), that the Turkish political parties adopt internal rules guaranteeing the presence of women in their management bodies at all levels (paragraph 43) and that the political parties in Turkey include more female candidates on election lists (paragraph 44)."
"The EU does not impose this type of requirement on other candidate countries or on existing Member States."
"It is self-evidently absurd for a candidate country to be treated differently through the formulation of special requirements."
"Moreover, it is, in the end, for individual countries to decide what type of measures are to be taken to strengthen the role of women in society."
"On the basis of the above reasoning, we have each chosen to abstain in the final vote."
"in writing. I and my British Conservative colleagues support the accession of Turkey to the European Union."
"We also believe it is important that Turkey, as with all other candidate countries, must fulfil the Copenhagen criteria."
"However, this report seems to set the barrier of membership of Turkey at a higher level than other states."
"We cannot support treating Turkey differently and less favourably than other candidate states."
"Of course, Turkey must also ensure it will abide by the Copenhagen criteria with regard to the rights of women and girls."
"We have decided to abstain on this report as we are concerned that the long list of demands in it will be used politically by those opposed to Turkey's membership of the EU."
"By the same token, we want to make clear that we are supportive of genuine attempts to improve the position of women in Turkey."
"We MEPs of the New Democracy party voted in favour of the Bozkurt report, which refers not only to the problematic situation of women in Turkey in all sectors, but also to the measures that need to be taken in order for the acquis communautaire to be adopted and applied in the candidate country."
"Constant, multilateral efforts by Turkey must continue in order to defend women's human rights, by eliminating violence, crimes of honour and polygamy, and in order to eliminate discrimination in the family, in economic and social life and in general."
"We abstained from Amendment 15."
"We believe that this amendment gives no added value to the resolution."
"It is a fact that the dimension of equality forms part of the acquis communautaire, which must be adopted and applied by the candidate country."
"Thus, freezing negotiations, as called for in the amendment in question, would delay the application of equality between the two sexes."
"We should not forget that there is already leverage in this direction at the current stage of negotiations."
"We would remind the House that opening negotiations on Chapter 19 on social policy and employment, which relates directly to discrimination against women, requires compulsory developments in and compliance by Turkey, with specific targets to promote equality."
"in writing. I have voted in favour of this report as it seeks to evaluate and suggest measures to evolve women's rights in Turkey."
"Cooperation with Turkish authorities and civil society is needed in order to improve women's rights and the report suggests this."
"In particular, in light of the country's candidacy for EU membership, respecting human rights, including women's rights must be made a priority."
"There are persistent problems with women's rights such as: Violence against women, including honour crimes; lack of education for women and girls; the decrease in women's participation in the labour market."
"I am pleased to support a report which recognises the need to address these issues and gives concrete suggestions for how we can achieve this."
"Forced marriages, domestic violence, honour crimes, illiteracy, etc: the situation of women in Turkey is not a bed of roses."
"According to Unicef, 700 000 girls are prevented from attending school by their families every year."
"The employment rate among women is less than 25%, way below the 55% in the European Union."
"These are worrying figures when Turkey's accession to the EU is arousing controversy."
"That is why Parliament is proposing constructive measures: an assessment of Turkey's progress according to benchmarks; the creation of refuges for women who are victims of violence; the obligation to register all girls at birth in order to prevent forced marriage; training the police and judiciary in the prevention of honour crimes, to encourage the systematic opening of inquiries and the necessary sentences; a mandatory quota system for the involvement of women in political life."
"I am not a fundamentalist when it comes to positive discrimination, but I am convinced that temporary measures will be useful in Turkey."
"The country is crying out for women in positions of power, who will serve as models and bring about a change in traditional ways of thinking."
"in writing. (SV) In the vote on Mrs Bozkurt's report on women's role in social, economic and political life in Turkey, I chose to vote in favour of the amendment designed to delete paragraph 41 on the subject of a quota system."
"I think it a great problem that there are not more women in Turkish politics, but, for me, a quota system is not the right solution to this problem."
"in writing. The start of talks with Turkey on EU accession should be welcomed."
"However, the rights of women need to be closely monitored."
"The case of girls in south-east Turkey not being registered at birth needs to be challenged."
"All births should be officially registered regardless of gender."
"As for women in politics, more work could be done to encourage, nurture and help women into elected office."
"However, we should remember that in the EU there are still countries whose female representation in national politics falls short of the mark."
"In the UK, it will take 200 years before women are equally represented in the House of Commons."
"We must do all that we can to address gender inequalities where they occur."
"in writing. (SV) Present circumstances show that the membership negotiations with Turkey have been embarked on too early."
"The report highlights a number of serious problems, especially the occurrence of honour killings and violence against women."
"Quite apart from whether or not it becomes a Member State, Turkey is on the EU's doorstep and will constitute an important trading partner for the EU."
"It is therefore important for the EU to continue to put political pressure on Turkey with a view to the country's constructive development."
"However, it would be extremely unfortunate if the European Parliament were to go so far as to propose a mandatory quota system for the representation of women on various election lists."
"The EU does not have the power to interfere in nomination proceedings that comply with democratic ground rules."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved.)"
"Preparations for the European Council (8-9 March 2007) (debate)"
"The next item is a statement by the Council and the Commission on the preparations for the European Council on 8 and 9 March."
"Mr President, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, ladies and gentlemen, this spring summit of Heads of State or Government will, as in previous years, be primarily devoted to economic issues, the Lisbon Strategy in particular."
"We are of course delighted that this year's spring summit is being held at a time when the economy is in a good state and good things are happening on the labour markets."
"From this we arrive at the cautious conclusion that the Lisbon Strategy's first-fruits are appearing, but we are also persuaded that it would be quite inappropriate to rest on our laurels."
"Far from doing that, we want to put the overall favourable trends and the incipient mood of optimism to work in the interests of further structural reforms, to join together in undertaking further efforts at securing for the long term, and building on, the successes of recent months, for it is important that we get Europe in top form ready for global competition."
"Following intensive preparatory work, which was characterised by very close and very fruitful cooperation with the Commission, the meeting of the European Council on 8 and 9 March is ready to be hammered into shape."
"The General Affairs and External Relations Council yesterday discussed the annotated agenda for the Council that the presidency had drafted, and I am glad to be able to tell you that the Member States wholeheartedly endorse the list of topics proposed by the presidency."
"Over the coming weeks, COREPER will coordinate the contributions of the various sectoral Council formations and do further work on the draft conclusions for the Council in the light of their essential comments."
"Perhaps I might remind the House at this point of the dates on which the various specialist Council will finalise their contributions. The Energy Council will be meeting the day after tomorrow in order to discuss the Energy Action Plan, which is one of the really big issues for the European Council; the Education and Youth Council meets on 16 February, followed by the Competitiveness Council on 19 February and the Environmental Council on 20 February."
"This round is concluded by the Council responsible for employment and social issues and the ECOFIN Council, which meet on 22 and 27 February respectively."
"Although your House is not directly involved in these preparatory activities, I am able to assure you that the Presidency will be taking account of the opinions you have adopted in connection with the themes of the Summit."
"Perhaps I might now go into rather more detail about the Presidency's plans for this year's spring summit."
"I will also refer back to what the President of the Council said in this Chamber this morning."
"We will endeavour to ensure that the European Council performs its essential role, which involves it in concentrating on core issues, setting general directions, taking decisions about the future and issuing policy guidelines to the responsible entities at European and national level."
"Today's exchange of views and, of course the in-depth dialogue with the President of your House in the course of the session are, of course, important elements in performing this function."
"With these general considerations in mind, we have tried to focus the European Council's deliberations on topics in respect of which action is generally recognised as being necessary and areas in which further efforts need to be made."
"Our specific concern is with supporting the structural reforms embarked on in the Member States and moving them forward by integrating recommendations specific to the country in question."
"Within the area of the internal market, we want to strengthen the shared desire to close loopholes, identify weak points, and make the EU more competitive against third countries, while at the same time pushing for the relaunch of the Doha Round."
"We are no less keen to encourage innovation, research and education than to promote job creation and the further development of the European social model, central to all of which are 'flexicurity' and demographic change."
"As the Federal Chancellor said this morning, better regulation is important to all of us, for there is, in it, considerable potential for making the European economy more competitive, and so the reduction of bureaucracy is a priority issue for the German Presidency."
"We have set ourselves the goal of sending out ambitious messages from the meeting of the European Council; in practical terms, our main concern is with the simplification of existing laws and consideration of how the impact of new ones might be better assessed."
"As the lawmaking authority, the Council and Parliament have a particular responsibility for ensuring that proposals from the Commission for the simplification of legislation are both thoroughly scrutinised and promptly processed."
"Our main concern is that the reduction of bureaucracy be driven forward, particularly through clear quantitative targets being laid down."
"Finally, the European Council, as decided last year, will give its attention to the EU's comprehensive plan for energy, which is committed to the EU's three fundamental goals in this area - security of supply, competitiveness, and environmental compatibility, the latter of which is always to be emphasised."
"It is evident from the Strategic Energy Report, which the Commission presented in January, that only an energy policy that addresses all three points of this triangular objective will be equal to the challenges that face the EU, and that is why we are pushing for a bundle of measures without which - being taken together - the desired effect will not be forthcoming."
"This package includes measures that reinforce competition on the internal energy market, that attach greater importance to renewable energies and help to develop better energy technologies and greater energy efficiency, and it is of great significance in this respect that greater weight is being given to the foreign policy components of energy policy."
"I would like to make it clear that Europe must increasingly speak with one voice where energy issues are concerned."
"The issue of climate protection is inseparable from that of energy."
"Since climate change presents us with the challenge of the century, we are firmly determined to bring about ambitious and forward-looking resolutions, including quantitative targets, in this area too, and the proposals put forward by the Commission for full coordination on energy matters provide us with a good basis for this."
"The European Council must work towards sending out a strong signal in favour of the further development of the international climate protection regime after 2012."
"Only if the industrialised countries, led by the European Union, take the lead with commitment to demanding targets and measures will it be possible to expect the emerging countries to show the willingness to accept undertakings appropriate to their own circumstances to limit their own rapidly increasing emissions."
"Many thanks, Mr President-in-Office, not only for what you said, but also for having used up only half the time available to you in saying it."
"That is something we should take as an example when considering the reform of the way our House works; the Council, too, is capable of imposing limits on itself and nevertheless saying something worth hearing."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, March offers a real opportunity for the European Union."
"Firstly, it gives us a chance to show citizens a European Union taking ambitious, clear decisions on subjects that they care deeply about."
"Secondly, we will be called upon to agree a declaration that will not only celebrate our achievements over these 50 years, but set out what we can do in the future."
"So, the two are closely linked."
"A successful spring Council would provide the perfect springboard for an ambitious Berlin declaration."
"Europe has to take action."
"It has to be political, effective and play a key role when it comes to addressing the major challenges of today's globalised world."
"Growth and jobs, climate change, energy: these are subjects on the minds of Europeans every day."
"We have a real opportunity to show what the European Union can offer, of course, in full compliance with our renewed commitment to better regulation."
"I should like to focus on climate change, energy and the growth and jobs agenda."
"Two weeks ago the UN Panel on Climate Change set out clearly, calmly and irrefutably the facts on climate change."
"The goal of limiting temperature gains to 2Â°C is still achievable - just!"
"The next decade or so will determine whether we manage to bring the situation under control."
"Our international partners, investors and citizens are all looking to the European Union for clear, determined action."
"The scale of the problem is huge."
"A bold response is the only one that makes sense and that means practical policy proposals and binding targets."
"That is why we proposed that developed countries accept a 30% emission reduction target by 2020 compared to 1990 levels."
"At the same time, nobody questions the need to bring developing countries into the global efforts to cut emissions, and they can realistically be put on track to limit the growth in their emissions, to start with, and to start cutting by 2020."
"I expect the spring European Council to send a convincing and strong signal on the need for determined action on climate change."
"The resolution on climate change, which this House will adopt tomorrow and which is both encouraging and stunning, contains an important and urgent message, which the Commission will pass on to the Heads of State and Government when climate issues are being discussed at the spring Council."
"However, we must also show both inside and outside the EU that we are prepared to act ourselves today."
"That is why the spring Council should agree a firm, independent EU commitment to achieving at least a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020."
"This will be a real demonstration of our commitment."
"Energy is key to cutting emissions."
"However, it is more than that: secure supply, fairer prices and more choice are all issues that are central to citizens' daily concerns for themselves, their families and future generations and, of course, to European industry."
"There is also an instinctive sense that these issues can only be tackled effectively at European level."
"Therefore, this is also a stern test for the European Union itself."
"Last month, the Commission set out its vision of how to put European energy policy on track and I very much welcome the supportive stance of this Parliament."
"Whenever we face a long-term challenge, it is essential that Europeans can look to their democratically-elected representatives to explain why reform is essential, to put short-term change in the context of long-term purpose, to convince us that every one of us can play a part, for example through doing what we can on energy efficiency."
"The comprehensive resolution that you adopted on 14 December last year reflects the essential role that Parliament plays in this context."
"So the ambition and conviction of the European Council are critical."
"We cannot put off decisions any longer."
"Europe needs to send the clearest of messages that it is committed to transforming the shape of European energy over the next few decades."
"Investors are ready to step in on a massive scale, but they need a clearer signal."
"That means decisive action in the internal market."
"It means real steps to ensure solidarity between Member States."
"It means making research in this area our top priority, for example as the first target for the European Institute of Technology."
"It means a precise, ambitious and, in particular, binding target of bringing renewable energy into the mainstream by 2020."
"With a clear green light from the European Council, the Commission is ready to bring forward a wide range of precise legislative measures this year."
"Climate change and energy are integral parts of the broader issue on which the spring Council will focus, the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs."
"Real steps are being taken to invest more in innovation, to make life easier for new and growing businesses, to help citizens prepare for change."
"The economic situation, as you know, is improving and Europe has shown that it is facing up to the challenge of globalisation, but these first steps now need to accelerate."
"The consensus for change needs to be translated into action in all parts of Europe and in all sectors."
"Modernising our economies and societies is essential if our values and quality of life are to flourish in this rapidly changing world."
"The spring Council needs to give a clear message that we will press ahead with reform at all levels as set out in the Commission's annual progress report on the Lisbon Strategy, including the country-specific recommendations."
"The Commission strongly welcomes Parliament's support on this point."
"Your resolution gives a timely reminder of some of the key benchmarks by which the credibility of action will be assessed."
"For example, reducing start-up time for new businesses to no more than one week, or cheaper protection of intellectual property rights."
"Time is running out if we are to avoid the worst effects of climate change, tackle the global imbalance between energy supply and demand, and secure real modernisation."
"It is time to put our best wisdom at the service of these objectives."
"George Bernard Shaw said that we grow wise not by remembering the past, but by being responsible for the future."
"At a time when we are celebrating 50 years of the European Union, this is a wise thing to remember."
"Bold, ambitious and long-term decisions from the spring Council in March will put the European Union on the road to finding real answers to these most urgent questions."
"Thank you very much, Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m, especially because you did not use all the time allocated to you."
"This is a very good example from the Presidency and from the Commission."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, each generation has a duty and responsibility to do its bit for progress."
"Ours too is facing a challenge, namely that of globalisation."
"We are living in a world that is changing fast and is opening up."
"In the European Union, we need to face up to worldwide, sometimes aggressive, competition with an ageing population and against the backdrop of global warming."
"This competition is becoming more cut-throat not only on the supply side of our market, but also on the demand side of the market of raw materials and energy."
"We could ignore it, we could passively submit to it, or we could prepare for it."
"If, however, we want to give today's children any prospect of a quality life and a good job, then there is only one answer: to ensure that we are competitive."
"Being competitive does not mean yielding blindly to the pressures of globalisation."
"It does mean, though, that we must equip ourselves with the right instruments that will guarantee us a future for what is dear to us, namely our European social model and the values on which our way of living and society are founded."
"In order to be competitive, we need a bold vision, strategy and people, as well as resources."
"We have the vision."
"We have the Lisbon Strategy with the partnership for growth and jobs and this is something to which we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have always been 100% committed."
"We are also enormously grateful that the Barroso Commission is putting in so much effort, as is the German Presidency, with its desire to focus more on the weak areas that need improving and on a serious energy plan."
"In the last Commission report, we read that the economic prospects had improved over the last year."
"Let us seize this momentum to achieve our goals with all the more force, because there is a great deal left to be done, not least by the Member States of which the Commission reports sometimes show in too rosy a light."
"With the spring summit in mind, we will be voting on a resolution tomorrow."
"We have been able to verify it against the view of the national MPs, with whom we had a good meeting last week."
"This resolution also voices our priorities that will be further highlighted by our shadow rapporteur, Mr Lehne."
"The completion of the internal market, not least for both the consumer and the SME, administrative simplification, a study into the effect of the practice of goldplating, more research and innovation, a renewed approach to energy policy and to fighting climate change, with due attention to energy supply, affordability, less dependence, more renewable energy sources and lower greenhouse gas emissions."
"These are all measures that need to be taken if we want to achieve our objective of more growth and jobs."
"For the majority of our group, there is room for nuclear energy as well, even though we fully respect the principle of subsidiarity in this respect."
"Lisbon is, of course, more than the sum total I listed so far."
"What matters most of all is caring about the well-being and dignity of the people and of their position and share in society."
"This is also why all our attention is focused on training, education, lifelong learning, the fight against exclusion and sound migration policy and indeed, gender equality, for the fact that talented women opt out is also a form of brain drain."
"As for labour market reform, we are looking forward to the discussion of the Commission document on flex-security."
"Since Lisbon is about people, the process must also be supported by people."
"As long as the European strategy for growth and jobs is seen by the public more as part of the problem than as the way to a solution, there is cause for concern."
"The involvement of both the people and civil society must increase."
"In previous major projects, such as Europe '92' at the time and also when the euro was introduced, we were successful thanks to a huge, broad-based communication initiative."
"We, and certainly the Member States, missed opportunities during the enlargement process."
"Without a proper communication strategy, Lisbon will not be understood properly, supported or carried out adequately, something that is probably attributable to a lack of political courage."
"Hence, I would like to make a passionate plea to the three institutions to pledge their funds for this cause and also, if possible, to make some room for this in the important Berlin declaration that is being compiled."
"I should like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteur for the resolution we will be endorsing tomorrow and which we prepared in the working party with the 33 under Mr Daul's presidency."
"The resolution turned out to be rather long, but as it is one that enjoys broad support and that is also positive, it allows us to send out a broad message about where we want to take this strategy."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when global problems are piling up, a number of EU Member States are tempted by nationalism."
"The fact is that the indisputable lesson of the globalisation under way is that even Germany, France, Great Britain or, indeed, Poland are relatively helpless faced with the foreseeable rise of certain large nations."
"Everyone concedes that the Treaty of Nice is no longer enough to ensure the effective governance of the EU-27."
"However, the Constitutional Treaty has collapsed, and not only because of the French and Dutch 'no' votes but also because certain Heads of State or Government refuse to honour their signatures."
"The vision of Europe cannot be summarised solely in terms of the internal market."
"Our fellow citizens want to see a more social dimension and joint action that is more effective."
"European integration began with the European Coal and Steel Community."
"Last year, China became the world's top steel manufacturer."
"In January, China and Russia signed 15 energy cooperation agreements, one of them relating to the construction of two gas pipelines, each with a capacity of 40 billion cubic metres."
"This month, India, China and Russia are to take part in a tripartite forum with a view to promoting trade with each other."
"The United States and Russia have just signed a joint nuclear research agreement."
"The Chinese, Japanese, Indians, Russians and Americans are cooperating in the development of new technologies designed to combat climate change."
"Where, then, is Europe in all this?"
"We are far from the solidarity of the now defunct CECA."
"We are struggling to define an energy policy characterised by solidarity and therefore of a joint character, and this at a time when our energy dependence is increasing."
"Admittedly, we are giving priority to ambitious objectives, but with deadlines in 2020, 2030 or 2050, that is to say beyond the foreseeable future."
"Chancellor Merkel reminded us this morning that the EU was responsible for 15% of total CO2 emissions."
"According to Commissioner Dimas, our share fell to 14% in 2006 - a figure indicative not of greater efficiency on the part of Europeans but of an increase in the emissions of other industrialised nations."
"If it is obvious that Europe must set an example, it is no less obvious that we are not going to be able to overcome global problems on our own. Europe has some aces up its sleeve when it comes to making its presence felt in the global debate."
"We remain the biggest economic power, generating 30% of gross world product."
"More than a third of the two thousand largest companies in the world are European."
"We still lead the world in practically all sectors, with the exceptions of digital technology and biotechnology, and the Lisbon Summit has defined a strategy for remedying these deficiencies."
"This strategy is still a live one, even if progress is desperately slow, particularly where research and innovation are concerned."
"The forthcoming summit will provide the opportunity for a new departure."
"All the analyses have been carried out, and all the problems are known."
"The time for practical decisions has come. The political relaunch of Europe must take place by June at the latest."
"That, at least, is the ambition of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, EU growth in 2006 hit 2.7 % - the highest in six years."
"Unemployment is at its lowest since 1998, at 7.9 %."
"One is tempted to say, 'well done!', but that 2.7 % growth has to be measured against 9.5 % in China and India, and our 7.9 % unemployment rate against under 5 % in the United States and 4.1 % in Japan."
"In this light, the Lisbon goal of making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 sounds not only ambitious but unrealistic."
"We have already dropped the target date."
"Can we maintain the target?"
"Well, we hold this debate annually; some Member States perennially ignore our exhortations."
"The Kok Report told us two years ago that the objectives of Lisbon have become muddled and the results are unconvincing."
"It is because some Member States have tried to muddle through instead of reforming their ways."
"Lisbon will only work if reform is made Europe-wide."
"Solidarity cannot mean those governments who have gone through the tough process of reform now having to bail out those who have not."
"In some countries, even the opposition does not see the need for reform; it makes promises to citizens which cannot be kept and, I am tempted to say:"
"(FR) It might be said that there is a dire need in this case for a reality check."
"A knowledge-based economy needs a willingness to learn."
"We in Europe can learn from each other."
"Economic growth and low unemployment, a dynamic business environment and high social standards are not mutually exclusive - look at Denmark or Finland."
"The way to modernise social protection and benefit systems is to bring in more flexibility."
"Youth unemployment is far too high, but protecting our citizens does not mean that we have to protect uncompetitive jobs."
"The social safety net should not prop up failing businesses, but help those affected to reintegrate into new business opportunities."
"My group believes, too, that investing in green technologies is key to containing climate change and catering for energy security in Europe."
"Energy is literally the driving force of our economy, and, as our Energy Ministers meet this week in Brussels, they must rise to the challenge and have the courage to open up the energy sector to greater competition and flexibility, not just separating infrastructure from supply."
"Building a true European energy market is important but not sufficient: we also need to cut energy consumption, and I hope the Commission will be even more ambitious in future than it has been."
"We have got to create incentives for individuals to change their habits and make thoughtful purchases and investments through using the tax system."
"We also have to deliver proper implementation of European legislation, letting our citizens know what needs to be done, and Member States have to live up to their promises of economic reform so that we can give the green light to Lisbon."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, Mr Gloser, ladies and gentlemen, one of the things that irritates the general public most of all is the European Union's excessive regulations."
"Rules that are not just too numerous but also hard to understand and complex: this trend must be halted."
"Establishing the curvature of bananas or the diameter of peas or the length of contraceptives and believing that this means you are regulating the market is a sign that you are a thousand miles away from the daily lives of the citizens."
"Rules like this are the product of pressure exerted by powerful interest groups to protect personal business affairs, and are not passed in the interests of the citizens."
"Where there are too many rules, bureaucracy reigns in the place of politics or the economy, and the EU may even die of bureaucracy."
"Making better laws must become an imperative for the institutions, and on this point Parliament must act as the catalyst."
"We are pleased that the Presidency of the Council is paying attention to this issue, too."
"As demonstrated by the speeches made in the Chamber this morning, there is a certain European left-wing tendency that continues to demand new legislation, but shows little interest in how much it is actually applied or applicable."
"We believe that a free and cohesive society is based on stable, clear, shared rules and not on elephantine bureaucracy."
"For growth and development, we invite the Council to adopt with greater determination a policy that is attentive to the problems of the African continent, and vigilant with regard to human rights and workers' rights, in the countries with which we trade as well as inside the Union itself."
"Without a common energy policy, there will be no recovery or growth."
"We endorse the Commission's new Green Paper with regard to renewable energy sources and the improvement of natural gas infrastructure, focusing on LNG terminals, a position that is also backed by the Presidency of the Council."
"All obstacles should therefore be removed, including those posed by the Italian Minister for the Environment, Pecoraro Scanio, who on this issue continues to ignore European positions and is therefore delaying progress."
"Development and the environment are the challenges to which we must respond, including by ratifying a new treaty that defines the new and differing areas of responsibility of our institutions within the 27-member Europe."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Council and the Commission, I would like to start by congratulating the Commission on having stood firm in the argument over the national allocation plans for CO2 trading, and on having at least confounded expectations by correcting Germany's national allocation plan."
"I am disconcerted to see that the deal done over the reduction targets for CO2 from cars, evidently as part of a bigger deal, did not come out the way the Commission had wanted it to, and would like to take this opportunity to point out that one thing that is ignored in such CO2 deals - of the kind that are currently being struck between the Member States, the Commission and the Council - is the fact that the targets we have set ourselves are not set by man; rather, the goal of stopping the earth getting more than 2 degrees warmer is set by Nature."
"If we, in these trade-offs between various national and industrial interests, keep on disregarding a target set at Kyoto, then we will, I think, in the foreseeable future no longer actually be able to assert that we are pursuing an ambitious climate protection policy."
"As we Greens see it, the energy package and the goal of 20% CO2 reduction across Europe may well be ambitious, but they no longer bear any relation to the overarching objective of doing something to counteract global warming."
"If we really do remain stuck on this 20%, we can once and for all say goodbye to the idea of being able to have a positive influence on global warming, that is to say, of being able to reduce it."
"We have just heard that, if we were to stick at 20%, the earth would get warmer by 4 or 5 degrees, in other words, that the adverse predictions of climate change would then turn out to be much worse."
"All I can do as I stand here is to appeal once more to the Brussels Energy Summit to stop cutting deals around reduction percentages and at last put into effect what the Commission has put on the table."
"In my view, the most important part of this energy package has to do with energy efficiency and savings, and I would again ask the Commission to get back to what was put before this House last autumn - which is not that long ago - in the shape of the energy action plan."
"Here, too, there must be less discontinuity."
"At the time, it was taken for granted that the right target for Europe was to reduce energy consumption."
"Today, the idea is firmly enshrined in the energy package that Europe's consumption of energy will continuously increase."
"It follows that there are many corrections to be made."
"I want to add something about nuclear policy, for I know that there are many countries in which great hopes are placed in it."
"I think that Europe-wide checks are overdue as a means of ascertaining whether the scandalous security culture of which we get repeated reports from the Swedish nuclear power station at Forsmark is a uniquely Swedish problem or whether it might be the case that, over the course of decades in which atomic energy has been being used, this decay in the security culture has become a universal problem as a consequence of such things as reductions in staffing."
"This is now the third time that I have risen to protest that Forsmark has as yet not been discussed at the European level, and the reason why I am being so forceful about it here and now is that I gather that Euratom is going to lend the money for the building of a new nuclear power station in Belene, concerning which negotiations are proceeding behind the scenes."
"That would be a first, with Atomstroyexport funding a power station in the European Union with European money, which will enable people to act as if there were a renaissance in nuclear power."
"I do believe, though, that the fact of the matter is that this industry is in a very bad state, not only from the point of view of security, but also in economic terms."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m has remarked that the Spring Summit will have to do a good job of preparing for the Berlin meeting, which is to be held a few days later, and, whilst I can agree with that, I can do so only subject to two conditions, the first being that it would be necessary for there to be very in-depth discussion of the Berlin statement at the Spring Summit, yet, instead, even the dogs in the street know that a thorough debate on the possible content of the statement carries the inherent risk of differences of opinion becoming manifest."
"Is there, then, to be no public debate, no debate among the Heads of State?"
"If that is the case, then I wonder who is meant to be working on the Berlin Declaration, so important a statement that the EU is to carry it with it into its future."
"Secondly, there is a need for more questions to be put on the agenda for the Summit, one, for example, being that of how a consistent fight against poverty, unemployment and social exclusion can be waged in tandem with an effective fight against global warming."
"What does that mean, in particular in terms of an employment-intensive and forward-looking transformation of energy and transport, and what would need to happen in order for a really sustainable solution to work-related, social, environmental and global problems to be set in motion?"
"The fact is, though, that these questions are not being asked."
"We are talking about better regulation and about energy and climate change, but not in any way about the now long overdue beginning of a socio-environmental reconstruction that really would counteract the social division and climate-related catastrophe about the latter of which everyone is currently talking."
"We saw only a few days ago just how difficult the German Presidency of the Council is finding this, and Mrs Harms has mentioned it already."
"That 'better regulation' means, above all, more opening up to the market, is something that Mr Barroso made unmistakeably plain last week, as did the Commission with its communication on the implementation of the renewed strategy for growth and employment."
"It is the opening up of the market that is supposed to benefit both enterprises and consumers, but more of it means more competition, consequently always benefiting the strong and with the weak being always doomed to lose out."
"The opening up of markets does not go together with the sort of structural change that we want and about which we always talk, although I have to say that the question is always to do with who wants what at what point in time."
"On 1 February, Mr Solana, addressing the conference of the European Defence Agency - an entity whose creation pre-empts the entry into force of a European Constitution - called for planning and a deliberate demand-led policy for the armaments industry."
"I do not see that as being in any way compatible with the purposes of a summit at which the question should be put as to what can be done to create jobs on a sustainable basis, to combat climate change on a sustainable basis, and - this too on a sustainable basis - to give the citizens of the European Union working and living conditions of equally high quality."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, so often in politics it is not what is said in public but what is going on in secret behind the scenes that really matters, and so it is here with this forthcoming European Summit."
"The German Minister for European Affairs, Mr Gloser, may talk about sustainability and energy policy - although I have to say that how he keeps a straight face when he talks about the already failed Lisbon Agenda is quite beyond me."
"However, what he does not talk about, of course, is the fact that this summit will discuss the European Constitution."
"Chancellor Merkel has made it clear that she is determined to press on and, in fact, this very week in Berlin discussions about the Constitution are going on in secret."
"Once again, a great deception is being attempted."
"You are trying to cobble together a mini-treaty, getting rid of the 'C' word and thereby denying the peoples of Europe the opportunity to vote on their own future."
"It is as if you all have some higher calling and know what is good for the ordinary plebs of Europe."
"You might think I am making it all up, but just last week President Barroso said: 'As a prime minister I was in favour of a referendum [on the Constitution]'."
"Since then he has come to Brussels and they have clearly spiked his drinks, because now he is saying: 'If there had been a referendum on the founding of the European Community or the implementation of the euro, do you think these would have existed?'"
"I think we know the answer and the answer is 'no'."
"In daring even to say that, what Mr Barroso does is to expose the European project."
"He shows absolute contempt for the people of France and Holland who voted 'no' but, more seriously, he shows absolute contempt for the very process of democracy itself."
"If you push on relentlessly with this Constitution, if you go on denying the peoples of Europe a say in their future, you are storing up very serious problems for our children."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Mr President, perhaps I might be permitted, with the European Council in the offing, to make a number of basic observations in relation to liberalisation and energy policy."
"It seems to me that, in order to fulfil the Maastricht criteria and meet the demands of the Lisbon Strategy, the state is flogging off the family silver, while the public have to fasten their belts ever more tightly, with those in the public service being pensioned off early all too often and left unemployed and trembling with fear lest they lose their social security."
"Promises have been made to the effect that everything will be better value, more efficient and more flexible, but this sort of liberalisation is no way to keep them."
"In public infrastructures, the name of the game is now long depreciation periods and low revenues."
"Private investors, though, are mainly interested in ready money, and we are all familiar with the consequences, with, for example, the poor punctuality of the railways and the abandoned stretches of track obliging us to go back to the car."
"Thanks to the privatisation of the post, we can now invest in new letter boxes and make lengthy pilgrimages to post offices, where we find a world of indecent working practices that belong in the Stone Age."
"Speculations in shares are making electricity more expensive, and we may well end up at some point being unable to afford our own water when higher prices are offered for it abroad, but what is even more dangerous is the prospect of foreign workers and asylum seekers being seen as an answer to the low birth rate and as a means of securing our social provision, to do which is to light the fuse on a powder keg, and the first explosions can already be heard getting closer and closer."
"We must, then, have a rethink; we must pursue a competent policy on family life and births, invest more in education and use a reasonable amount of protectionism to promote our business sectors and our own agricultural production, in order to protect our people from the business relocations that the EU encourages."
"Nor, I think, can it be intended that nuclear-generated electricity be used to produce environmentally sound energy, or that biofuel should lead to food shortages in the way in which it has done in Mexico."
"What is needed in such situations is the active promotion of research into new technologies or the use of other types of energy production that really are more environmentally friendly."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the true cost of the trade war which is raging under the guise of 'global warming' will soon become apparent."
"The Council is clearly about to embrace the fashionable pseudo-scientific claims that we will only save the planet if we significantly reduce CO2 emissions."
"If we allow ourselves to be talked into believing that we can influence our planet's natural climatic cycles by sacrificing the competitiveness of European industry, we will not be doing the right thing for the planet."
"We will be simply pandering to the economic interests of those investors and countries that pay no regard to oxides and protocols."
"The pollution that we avoid by means of our sacrifices is more than made up for by their CO2 production."
"I am therefore most disappointed that the starting point of the Council's negotiations on energy is the fight against climate change."
"I feel that both our citizens and our businesses are more interested in the price of energy, and especially in its safe, uninterrupted supply."
"I should therefore like focus on the liberalisation of the energy market, which will prevent massive price increases."
"The Presidency should come up with a proper proposal on how to guarantee uninterrupted supplies from Russia to the whole of the EU and not just to Germany."
"Lastly, we must invest in developing new sources of energy, and in particular nuclear energy."
"If we do not do this, the high costs of energy will do irreparable damage to the competitiveness of European business."
"How can the unemployed cope with the astronomical cost of electricity?"
"I could send them to the headquarters of the Council in Brussels, but I doubt that would help."
"Thank you."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just start by giving you a brief summary of what we have achieved."
"I would remind you that it was about two and a half years ago that the Commission kicked off a new initiative, having come to the conclusion, following the Kok report, that the Lisbon Strategy needed to be got back on its feet again."
"We want this strategy, which, in the first half of the decade was in essence no more than a political objective without the least chance of becoming reality, to come at least closer to its objective in the decade's second half."
"I would claim that it has done that."
"'Lisbon' does not yet, admittedly, have quite the same ring to it as 'Kyoto', but every Member State is now coming up with its national plans."
"We in this House have come up with a structure for getting to grips with the Lisbon Strategy and trying to move it forward."
"The Commission, too, has set new priorities for it."
"We have held inter-parliamentary conferences here in this House, with an ever-increasing number of participants from the parliaments."
"All this shows that we are going in the right direction and that the attempt at resuscitating the strategy has been successful."
"Secondly, we have succeeded in making it clear that, although there may well be three pillars to the Lisbon Strategy, our ability to pursue a proper environmental and social policy is dependent on growth and job creation."
"We have also to make it plain that the Lisbon Strategy is also Europe's response to globalisation."
"In the resolution - the subject-matter of which will obviously be different from what it was in former years - we will make it clear that there are a number of deficiencies in the internal market that have to be alleviated."
"There are many of them, but I would just like to point out two."
"One is that the further development of European patent law has still not been forthcoming, and on this front we expect the Commission to take some initiatives, such as it has already produced on the liberalisation of goods traffic in the internal market, which is an equally crucial matter."
"It is energy policy, though, on which the summit and the Commission's - and this House's - activities will primarily focus."
"Let me remind you of what happened last year, when the Heads of State or Government were not to be persuaded that energy policy really had claims on Europe's concern and that a European approach to the subject was needed, when the view still prevailed that these things could be sorted out at the national level."
"That has changed."
"This time round, if energy policy is discussed at the summit, everyone will be working on the assumption that this is a task for Europe."
"In this resolution, we have said that renewable energies must, of course, be promoted in so far as possible, but we have also highlighted the continuing importance of nuclear power, which will be made inevitable in future by the problem of CO2 emissions, a problem addressed as a whole in this resolution as well, and also, of course, discussed in much greater depth in the parallel resolution on climate change."
"We have set ourselves very ambitious targets in respect of energy efficiency, and I do in fact think that - as the figures have already shown - a share of 30% in the world's economic product combined with a share of only 15% in emissions is already an indication that Europe is leading the way where energy efficiency is concerned, but we can achieve far more and be an example to the world."
"Something else to which reference has been made was the remaining need for us to make the internal market in energy a reality."
"We know that an oligarchic and monopolistic structure continues to exist and that there is only one part of the European Union in which one can speak of a real internal market, while there are real deficits in large areas of the EU."
"I would also like to address the aspect of 'better regulation'."
"Here, too, much has been achieved."
"Thinking back to the interinstitutional agreement of December 2003, that was certainly a breakthrough, but all that glisters is not gold."
"The Commission has still not yet complied with Parliament's request - as articulated in over half a dozen resolutions - for an independent assessment of the impact of laws, yet this is something on which we insist."
"If the Commission does not swing into action soon, we will have to think up other ways and means whereby we can do it ourselves."
"What really is important now, as I see it, is proper benchmarking that makes it possible for us to review the reports from the Member States and say what we think is necessary in order that, through this benchmarking, the Lisbon Strategy goals be achieved even more effectively than they have been in the past."
"(DE) Mr President, frequent reference has been made already to the Constitution, under which Europe gets more powers as regards energy policy."
"Since, though, the Constitution is not yet in place, we will have to endeavour to find another way of getting these greater energy policy powers, in particular - as Mr Gloser mentioned - in respect of external policy."
"How are we and Russia supposed to have a proper relationship as equals if the European Union cannot, on these matters, speak firmly and with a single voice?"
"Russia would much rather negotiate with the individual countries and play them off against one another, but what we are calling for - at this summit specifically - is for us to make it clear that, in this relationship with Russia, there is only one European voice, and if Russia complains that it does not have full access to the market, just what are we, in Europe, supposed to do about it?"
"That is why an equal relationship with Russia matters so much."
"Secondly, we have to diversify."
"We have to get access to other sources, but where?"
"I am talking in particular about the Caucasus and Central Asia."
"When one sees how the United States of America - committed to the free market though it may be - has managed to get an oil pipeline built from Baku to Ceyhan in Turkey via Tblisi, with private investors being encouraged to support what was considered an important political project, as against how feebly and with what difficulty this sort of thing gets done in the European Union - one can take the Nabucco pipeline for Europe's supply of gas as an example - then it is clear that we have to demand that this European Union of ours stands up for itself and speaks with one voice."
"Since Mr Goebbels has already mentioned many of these things, I really would like to see all these things spelled out at the summit."
"If we believe that we have to diversify; if we believe that we need new and additional pipelines, then we have to say so, loud and clear, and then along will come Russia and will try to get involved or to do business with us."
"If we do not, on international markets, have an unmistakeable European profile, then we will not be able to do those things that we have to do for our own people, that is to say, to ensure the security of Europe's energy supply."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, this House will be adopting a resolution in which we make a number of demands of the Council."
"In my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to take this opportunity of thanking my co-rapporteur, Mr Hughes from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, for his cooperation, which has invariably been constructive, good and fair."
"He will shortly be presenting to you those parts of the resolution that have to do with employment and the objectives of better regulation, so I will concentrate on what our House expects of the Council as regards energy policy."
"The most important thing that this House expects of the Council is plain for all to see; we want a strong single energy policy for Europe."
"It is the most urgent task for the Heads of State or Government to achieve real results at the Spring Summit, for it is by that that its success or failure will be measured."
"A working single market in energy is not an end in itself."
"For a start, a single energy market is one of the great European projects."
"We want a European Union that produces results."
"If we can tell the public that it is European policy that has brought their constantly increasing gas and electricity bills back to a tolerable level, then that is good for Europe."
"The latest studies on the European energy market have again brought out the fact that we are miles away from a working internal market in energy, as Mr Lehne has already pointed out."
"Almost a decade after the first steps towards the liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets, a result like that is disappointing to say the least."
"First of all, then, it is in the interests of the public that we need the single energy market."
"The second reason why a working single energy market is important is the competitiveness of our enterprises, particularly on the production side."
"No business should pay more than is fair and appropriate for the quantity of energy that it uses; we owe that to our enterprises and to the people who work for them."
"That is a means towards the end of increasing our competitiveness at home and abroad, which is one of the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, so the second reason why we need the single energy market is that Europe's competitiveness requires one."
"The third reason is that, in a market with functioning price signals, energy is used effectively, alternatives are developed, and savings are made."
"It is true to say that sometimes things have to be required as a matter of policy to get new paths opened up, and that is what we are doing with this report, in order - or so we hope - to achieve the climate protection goals using a European energy policy; about that, there is consensus in this House."
"Thirdly, then, we need the single energy policy for the sake of a Europe that faces up to its global responsibilities."
"It is for that reason that, tomorrow, this House will be adopting a resolution, and I shall now read out to you a selection of the most important points one by one."
"Firstly, the electricity and gas distribution networks need to be managed and administered economically independently of the energy production process if the long-lasting failure of the electricity and gas market is to be brought to an end."
"Secondly, as renewable energy helps to improve the security of energy supply, we urge that the proportion of renewable energy sources be increased to 50% by 2040."
"The European Parliament is committed to ambitious targets in energy research, and in all areas, whether conventional, renewable or nuclear."
"Europe is a front-runner in many areas of this field, and this role needs to be consolidated and built upon if we are to have a knowledge-based economic order."
"This House is in agreement with the Commission's proposals on energy efficiency and the target of saving 20% by 2020."
"We want to see a timetable for the 30% reduction of CO2 emissions by 2020, and we are also committed to the reform of the emissions trading system, while also calling for greater solidarity between the Member States in times of energy crisis."
"Members have agreed across all party boundaries on the need for a single energy foreign policy, for energy issues must become a permanent feature of the European Union's foreign relationships."
"I was delighted to hear the President-in-Office say that this is where Europe needs to speak with one voice, for that is precisely how we see it too."
"As Mr Barroso put it this morning, our credibility in the eyes of the public is conditional upon Europe holding together, and on that we agree with him."
"The Commission, the Council, and the Members of this House must all, equally face up to these European challenges; that is the only way in which we will be able to discharge our responsibility to the European public, to give them results, or, as the President of this House put it this morning, to be successful for the sake of our continent and serve the European Union's people."
"I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
"(LV) The agenda for the European Council's spring summit is at the moment definitely the most important issue in the European Union as a whole and in each Member State."
"The tasks proposed relating to the Lisbon Strategy, and also to energy and climate change policy, are ambitious, but to put them into practice will require a sense of reality."
"We know most of what needs to be done in order to achieve the proposed goals, but the fact that the reforms to be carried out are mutually interconnected in the economic, social and environmental fields makes it significantly more complicated to implement the tasks."
"The mutual interdependence of the Member States in maintaining the tempo and quality of reform makes the situation even more complicated."
"We experienced this recently in the course of the difficult discussions on the services directive, which was intended to be one of the foundation stones in the Lisbon Strategy."
"On the agenda now are new tests of the Member States' readiness to maintain the tempo of reform, the liberalisation of Europe's energy market being one such."
"A liberalised European energy market is a prerequisite for the overall competitiveness of the market, energy independence, long-term stability and the integration of the new Member States into the single electricity and gas market."
"One of the central tasks of this European Council summit is to establish a consensus-based approach in the Member States' understanding of the single European energy policy."
"Energy policy must become a component of the European Union's security policy as soon as possible."
"The Member States ought to be able to agree on a common strategy in the sphere of supply and transit routes."
"Nor should we defer the creation of a permanent dialogue between energy-consuming states and energy-supplying states, to prevent an increase in global imbalance and the development of instability."
"In relation to Europe's main gas supplier - Russia - we must ensure that it ratifies the Transit Protocol and the Energy Charter Treaty."
"Furthermore, on this issue the views of the Commission and the Member States must not be allowed to differ."
"I hope that this important issue in the European Council's spring summit will help to boost a common understanding of mutual interdependence regarding both tasks and achievements in each Member State individually and in the European Union as a whole."
"Thank you."
"(FR) Mr President, to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is quite clear that, as my colleague Mrs Harms pointed out, the March European Council will mainly be devoted to energy and that we have some demands to make in this connection."
"I should like, for my part, to address another point affecting the development of the labour market and taxation in Europe."
"Allow me to offer two examples."
"In Belgium, instead of losing 4 000 jobs, the Volkswagen-Forest factory will lose 3 000 and the employees will work a 38- rather than 35-hour week for the same salary, as well as being required to be more flexible."
"The group's management believes that, under these conditions, the factory will be one of the most efficient in Europe and will fulfil the criteria of a successful Lisbon Strategy."
"My second example concerns French private sector employees, half of whom have salaries lower than EUR 1 400 per month, as Mrs Royal reminded us this Sunday."
"These are facts that shed a harsh light on the European social model."
"In the view of many economists, this change in working and salary conditions is structural, linked as it is to technological innovations and an increased globalisation of activities."
"Over the next few years, the majority of European workers are thus going to be under ever increasing pressure."
"How are we to respond to this situation?"
"I think that the European Union can help."
"It can help by putting an end to the absolute scandal whereby somebody who is well-off can just take a trip from Monaco to Belgium via Lichtenstein in order to escape the tax system and the progressive dimension of tax."
"I also think that the European Union should undertake, as it did at the G8 and within the OECD, to opt for a firm policy of abolishing the tax havens that are to be found all over the world and that enable financial capitalism to operate."
"I also think that if Mrs Merkel and Mrs Royal want to give some practical content to the social protocol that they are announcing with a view to amending the draft Constitutional Treaty, the European Union should provide itself with the resources finally to establish a minimum corporation tax in the European Union, which means that, if there is a desire to maintain the unanimity rule, one group of countries will have to resolve to take the lead."
"(PT) In this debate on the contribution to the forthcoming Spring Council, which is set to assess the implementation of the so-called 'Lisbon Agenda' adopted in 2000, we should be mindful of what has actually happened over the course of these seven years in terms of the targets and challenges set at the time, with regard, on the one hand, to full employment, reducing poverty, infrastructure and equipment to support childhood and equal opportunities for women, and, on the other, to the much-vaunted objective of having the most advanced knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010."
"The truth of the matter is that since 2000, the EU has been affected by slow economic and employment growth, by the workers' productivity gains increasingly being passed on to employers and by the corresponding deepening of social inequality."
"Hence the continued high levels of unemployment, with poverty and social exclusion affecting 72 million people, the manifold increase in unstable work with fewer and fewer rights, and increased problems with the intake of new Member States, without adequate financial responses from the Community budgets."
"This demonstrates that our criticisms of the strategy have been amply justified."
"The implementation of the Lisbon Agenda has done nothing but deepen liberalisation and privatisations in sectors as diverse as transport, energy, the post office, telecommunications and services, thereby jeopardising essential public services, to which one might now add the flexibility of work and the much-trumpeted flexicurity making it even easier to lay off workers."
"This is why we are in favour of a sea change in the policies being pursued, namely the Lisbon Strategy, the Stability and Growth Pact, the main economic and employment guidelines and the Community budget."
"Consequently, in the alternative resolution to this debate tabled by our group, we have opted to give prominence to a genuine pact for economic progress and social development, and a European strategy for solidarity and sustainable development based on greater solidarity on the part of the most developed countries with better and further-reaching distribution of Community funds."
"The purpose of this is economic and social cohesion, improved living conditions for most people, including immigrants, dignity for workers and the implementation of human rights, in particular in the areas of education, health, housing, social security and research and development."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Moscovici has just written a very interesting book, declaring the ConstitutionalTtreaty dead."
"It shows very clearly that no one can reintroduce a mini-Treaty on the sly now that the people have spoken."
"We cannot act in contravention of Treaty law."
"The number is not enough here - all that counts is the sovereignty of a State."
"The farce in Madrid was an impasse, and an insult to diplomatic rules."
"I should tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that MEPs, myself included as it happens, did not have access to the debating chamber, while any old civil servant had free access."
"The solution for the EU is not to recreate Madrid, but to breathe new life into the spirit of the Treaty of Rome, in other words to rediscover the sense of free cooperation between sovereign nations, to re-establish the Community preference and to give up on the vague imperialism of a supranational State, a State that would suffocate our peoples and hinder their rights."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in setting its economic objectives, the German Presidency of the European Council is relying on a report claiming that unemployment has fallen in Europe."
"However, this reduction is in fact the consequence of a fall in the number of people of working age due to the aging of the population, rather than the result of a prosperous economy."
"With an annual growth rate of just 2.6%, compared with 3.6% in the United States and 10% in China, the Europe of Brussels is still lagging behind the world's great economic powers."
"On top of that, some Member States falsify the official employment statistics."
"In France, for example, if we add to the 2 million or more official unemployed people those people who have been forced into retirement or early retirement, the unemployed people in training, and those on subsidised contracts, unemployment actually affects almost 4.5 million people in France, or 18% of the working-age population."
"With growth at half mast, a population growing at below replacement rate, and businesses relocating their activities, the European Union is, unfortunately, continuing to decline economically."
"If, then, the diagnosis is incorrect, the treatments prescribed, inspired by the Malthusian and antisocial policy of the last 20 years, are harmful: our trade borders have been destroyed, opening up our industry to unfair competition from the Asiatic economies, bureaucratic restrictions have multiplied, more than a million immigrants arrive quite legally from outside the Community every year, our public services have been dismantled, we are overtaxed, and our agriculture, subjected to the Caudine forks of the World Trade Organisation, has been laid fallow."
"In order to restore our economies to prosperity and to give our descendents the economic and social security to which they are entitled, we need to construct a different Europe and a different trade model, based on secure borders to protect our businesses from social dumping, on implementing the Community preference, and on respect for the values that made our civilisation so great: fatherland, freedom, work, family, and security in all its forms, including economic and social security."
"(SK) Two days before the European Commission officially adopted the Strategic Energy Review and other reports on the energy sector in January 2007, Eurobarometer published the findings of an energy sector survey."
"The survey clearly shows that energy issues, be it climate change or future shortages of energy, are not considered a priority by European Union citizens."
"Energy issues were ranked twelfth in a list of the most serious issues that Europe should now confront."
"Energy issues lag far behind unemployment, crime, healthcare or the economic situation."
"It is disconcerting that the citizens of Europe are convinced that the root causes of energy problems are to be found on continents and in countries other than the European Union."
"Almost a quarter of European citizens admitted that they do nothing to decrease their energy consumption."
"The public has only a vague awareness of the fact that energy prices will continue to rise in the long run."
"We stand at the threshold of a new industrial revolution that will have to address energy-related issues and climate change, presenting us with pragmatic objectives that are at the same time utterly political in nature."
"If our efforts are to succeed, we need to secure the broadest possible support from EU citizens in implementing these objectives, and Member State governments should stop beating around the bush and instead address the outstanding issues."
"Mr President, the meeting with the European Council in Berlin is an outstanding opportunity to send the message of what we have achieved together and what we need to achieve together in the coming years, the first step until 2009."
"I think it is important that in the Berlin Declaration we make it clear that the problems and the challenges we are facing are there because of our success, not because of failure."
"We have new countries applying for membership because of this success - because they have seen what the European Union could contribute regarding peace, the rule of law and stability."
"We have the whole discussion about globalisation, where the European economy is the leading global actor and gives us opportunities to meet up and to contribute to globalisation."
"We have the issue of security and stability in the Balkans, where, although the European Union could not do very much at the beginning of the 1990s, today we can, and that is why we have the responsibility."
"If we had failed, if we had not been able to develop the European Union, no one would have asked us to solve the problem, but now we are able to do it and so we have the responsibility."
"That also goes for the discussion about climate change because we are, from an economic point of view and also from an environmental point of view, one of the leading global actors."
"We can contribute to the discussion about reducing the greenhouse effect more than anyone else and that is why we need to do it, but we need to do it wisely, securing the opportunities for growth and investment and high-tech, because otherwise we will not be able to meet the challenges of climate change when it comes."
"It is a challenge that is double-sided."
"We need to reduce greenhouse gases, but at the same time to secure a stable and prosperous economy which makes us able to meet future challenges."
"Mr President, I have only a short time, so, as both joint rapporteur on this subject and a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I should like to do something we do not do often enough: focus on some of the social, social cohesion and employment aspects of Lisbon."
"Under the heading 'Creating employment and opportunity', our resolution underlines the need for a balanced approach to flexicurity."
"We agree with flexibility for enterprises, but also with the necessary degree of security for working people."
"For too many millions of our fellow citizens, flexicurity is seen as a threat."
"We have to make it an opportunity."
"We urge those Member States so far lacking effort to cooperate with social partners and do much more to create employment and raise the labour market participation rate of the young, female and older workers."
"Specifically, we ask them to ensure that every school-leaver is offered a job, training or other employability measure within six months; to provide wider access to training for the unemployed, particularly for the least-qualified; to raise investment in comprehensive and affordable childcare, to further reduce the tax burden on employment; to combat social exclusion and discrimination; to invest further in education, professional training and lifelong learning so as to boost the Union's skills base; to improve the match between the educational system and the needs of the new labour markets, including entrepreneurship in educational curricula; and, finally, to allow older workers to remain in the labour force on a voluntary basis and modify tax and social security systems to encourage a longer active working life."
"These ideas are as old as the Lisbon Strategy itself."
"All we need is for Member States to act on them."
"Finally, I would also underline the need for both the Council and the Commission to break the current deadlock in employment and social policy."
"The current Lisbon policy mix is seriously unbalanced."
"If we are to reconnect with our citizens, we need to restore that balance in favour of social and employment policy."
"(LT) Economists established quite a while ago that European development has a positive effect on national economies, particularly on the economies of larger countries."
"This positive effect derives mostly from trade, mutual trade."
"It seems to me, unfortunately, that we now have a process of centralisation going on, and decisions, whether in the field of energy policy or the Lisbon Strategy, are encouraging this centralisation process."
"This could result in there being nothing for mutual trade as there will be several global trade centres."
"I think that one of the most important and essential things, while endeavouring to keep the European economic motor running and trying to implement policies to make our countries more efficient and competitive on the world scene, would, first of all, be the necessity to foment the uniform development of all EU Member Countries, making use of the development of scientific research centres and energy centres in various countries."
"Once the national economies are synchronised, our economic motor will not sputter out."
"(PL) Mr President, political differences between the economic strategies of Member States have hampered the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"This is having a knock-on effect on the Union."
"If we want the strategy to achieve its aims, we need to design a new political equilibrium."
"Countries which do not want costly and complex regulations, such as Poland, the United Kingdom and the Baltic States, must be allowed to retain some degree of ability to control the legislative process."
"This is not guaranteed in the Constitutional Treaty, which is why I am making a personal appeal to the German Presidency not to adopt the credo that is so fashionable in this House, of 'the Constitutional Treaty or death'."
"This credo will do a lot of harm to the European Union, particular as regards regulatory and economic policy."
"The same applies with regard to better-quality European regulation."
"If we want to achieve the aims of better regulation, we should not dodge questions about the distribution of power or the political balance within the European Union."
"Treaty reform must be subjected to truly pragmatic assessment in terms of costs which legislation based on a new remit for the Council will incur."
"The Constitutional Treaty does not promote these aims."
"Mr President, according to the Lisbon Strategy, we have to build a welfare state all around the European Union that has to be a model in our globalised world."
"We should appeal to a social Europeanism to make Europe attractive for citizens, because life here should be better than in other parts of the world."
"A good standard of living is not achieved only by economic growth but also by high educational standards, lifelong learning, cultural consumption and so on."
"On the other hand, we have to reduce global warming without damaging development in developing countries."
"We can do this in our part of the world by improving research."
"In developing countries, it can be done by spreading education and development aid, always related to improved educational standards."
"I think that a good combination of development aid and higher standards of education is the key to building a better globalised world."
"(EL) Mr President, energy means three things: nuclear, oil and gas."
"Nuclear energy is not possible in all the countries of Europe and is, moreover, 'vivere pericolosamente'."
"Oil is controlled by the United States of America: in one way in Iraq, in another way in Saudi Arabia, in another way in Libya and in another way in Venezuela."
"Which of these countries that has oil is close to Europe?"
"Not one."
"The game is controlled by the Americans."
"What does that leave?"
"Gas."
"Basically, in our neck of the woods, Russia has the gas."
"What are our relations with Russia?"
"Our relations with Russia are disappointing, precisely because that is what the Americans want."
"Did you see what happened with Putin the other day?"
"There is a pipeline ready for signing which does not pass through Asia, which does not pass through Belarus or Ukraine, so that we do not have these vicissitudes and blackmail."
"It is the Burgas - Alexandroupolis pipeline through Bulgaria and Thrace."
"Here too the Americans will not let Bulgaria sign."
"So if we, as Europe, want our energy, if we want gas directly from Russia, why do we not turn on the pressure for this pipeline?"
"If we want our own oil, there is a great deal in the Aegean."
"Enough to relieve Europe."
"Then here too there is the bug called Turkey, controlled by America, which does not allow the oil from the Aegean to be exported."
"- (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, The Lisbon Strategy is our regular topic of discussion in the run-up to the Spring Summit every year, and we would do well to take more seriously the goals that we - in the Council, in the Commission, in Parliament - set ourselves."
"The only thing I would urge is that we should do what has been agreed, to convince by our actions rather than just making announcements, and that I would sum up briefly as 'better lawmaking'."
"Better lawmaking calls for more transparency, and more transparency will be achieved if all laws are enacted through the codecision procedure."
"Already today, we have heard talk of 'pre-examination', of how every European law must be subject to prior scrutiny in relation to subsidiarity, in order to allow its added value to European legislation, its effects on growth and job creation, to become visible."
"We have heard about cost-benefit analyses, about shorter legislative processes; five years are enough to make a law, not ten at least."
"We must improve the instruments whereby the how and when of our laws' implementation is monitored."
"Secondly, we have appointed people with responsibility at the national level."
"What are they doing?"
"Do the national parliaments give an account every six months of how things stand as regards the Lisbon process, of what they plan to do and when?"
"Where is the report from the Commission and the national monitors to this House every year?"
"Thirdly, it is making the single market a reality that is the work we have to take home with us, strengthening innovation through the efficient use of resources, taking action to save energy, creating the research area, strengthening the SMEs, and that means making it easier to establish new ones, promoting settlement and development in rural areas and encouraging handovers, and at last actively addressing the consequences of demographic change, so that they do not become a hindrance for our continent."
"We have enough goals to aim at; it is actions that build credibility and confidence."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, many speakers have emphasised the many opportunities that lie before us, and they are of course right to do so, for not for some time have we had such an opportunity as we have right now to make a start on new things."
"The great post-Lisbon problem was, of course, that growth rates caved in, not least because the Member States had not done enough."
"Growth has now returned to the European Union, but what are we going to do with it?"
"Growth does not happen on its own; long-term satisfactory growth will not be there unless we act."
"Yes, of course, the single market is a powerful instrument; 90% of what we manufacture we - our companies and the members of the public - buy back within the European Union, and that is a good thing, for it makes us a strong international player, but - as Mr Hughes has pointed out - we have now reached the point at which we have to get people back to work, and not by exerting pressure, nor by excluding anyone, but by means of better education and training, and by providing new opportunities."
"That is what the debate has to be about; it has to be about how we have to move that forward together, take it seriously and put it into practice back home in the Member States, but if we are to do that we need better coordination."
"Coordination, when applied to economic policy, must not be a dirty word in these halls."
"If we cannot even bring in a unitary tax base, we have no business sounding off so much about other things, and that is the sort of debate we have to have back home as well."
"Mr Lehne tells us that we have to do something for business in order then to be able to do something for the environment; well, I do not agree."
"That is old thinking of a kind that is not equal to coping with the efficiency revolution that lies in store for our businesses."
"It is that old thinking that got many of us into the dead end of nuclear energy, a dead end from which we need to escape, and that is why we need to argue and debate more with one another."
"(FI) Mr President, Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke fine words here at the meeting in January about energy and climate change."
"Now it is time for action."
"I hope that the Chancellor and Germany will risk power and prestige to ensure that the EU takes the initiative and becomes a pioneer in the issue of climate change and its control."
"The prevention of climate change is reliant on two important factors: carbon dioxide emissions need to be reduced at a far greater rate than is currently the case, and the EU must be a lot more energy-efficient."
"It has been estimated that a response to climate change will eat into global GNP to the tune of roughly 1%; in other words, it will be expensive."
"The same calculations show, however, that indolence and just doing nothing will cost even more; in fact, a lot more."
"If the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy is to go ahead, then, we also need to take climate change into account and work to do something about it."
"(PL) Mr President, in 2005 the Lisbon Strategy, which was once described as a load of wishful thinking, was adapted to reflect the real priorities of the societies of Member States of the Union."
"From the verbiage contained in the mountain of documents on this subject, we can glean some challenges which we now have to face urgently."
"These are, firstly, to ensure security of energy supplies for the whole of Europe, rather than just for selected countries."
"Encouraging the use of renewable sources of energy comes under the same heading."
"Secondly, to remove the barriers that still exist concerning the free movement of labour within the European Union and to constantly monitor implementation of this principle by individual Member States."
"This will help prevent workers from countries other than the employer's from being treated unfairly, or even as slaves."
"Finally, the European Union must also reject the completely outdated idea of trying to compete against the United States, and replace it with close and sound partnership."
"(PL) Mr President, in general, the citizens of Europe do not understand what the Lisbon Strategy is about."
"I fear that as politicians we often make mistakes and fail to get to the bottom of the issue."
"We amend laws and issue directives, but these have no impact on the essence of the matter."
"Essentially, the European Union's competitiveness will be ensured by entrepreneurs implementing new technologies, and introducing new production and organisational methods."
"These entrepreneurs also need to be able to convince both large and small and medium-sized enterprises of their ideas."
"It seems that what we lack in Europe is the spirit of enterprise and a business culture, especially if we compare ourselves to the United States."
"We attach too little importance to the idea of freedom, which entails not just freedom of action, but also responsibility."
"SMEs are the basis of a civil society and responsible civic self-government."
"This is something we should learn from our first year of primary school."
"We must teach our young citizens respect for fair entrepreneurship."
"These values must also be disseminated by Europe's public media, and we should conduct EU-funded campaigns promoting past and present Europeans who have contributed most to our competitiveness."
"We might then be able to stop worrying about the millions of unemployed, many of whom will set up their own businesses. We might then be able to stop worrying that our enterprises and industry are not innovative and are failing to benefit from the results of scientific research, something which Europe is actually very good at."
"I wish the Commissioner and the European Commission success in this action, and also in the area of information."
"Let us hope it will be a success for the entire Union."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Lehne and Mr Lambsdorff, and in particular my colleagues, Mr Hughes and Mr Goebbels, for all the work of coordination and cooperation required for this exercise, which, in this second year, is now finding a place in the political consciences and wills of the Member States and our Institutions."
"This is happening in a very particular way, on the basis of the preparatory meetings between the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"It was at the latest meeting last week that, in a still timid, but firm, manner, the recovery of European transport, logistics and infrastructures were raised as crucial policies if the European economy is to meet the challenges of globalisation with guarantees."
"This globalisation reaches Europe's ports by boat, our airports by plane, or via our roads, and, though not yet sufficiently, by train and by inland waterway."
"We are tackling this globalisation by means of instruments such as Galileo, SESAR - the air traffic control system - RTMS, E-Safetynet, etc. We must also deal with the challenges that it brings with it in the environmental, social and security fields."
"The German Presidency's initiative facilitated the Transport Council's commitment in this regard, with the initiative of including transport, with its four essential priorities, in this spring's proposal for the Lisbon Strategy."
"Furthermore, Mr Harbour agreed to include it as the third paragraph of the conclusions of the Working Group on the internal market and innovation at last week's meeting."
"I would therefore ask especially that the authors and coordinators of the Resolution include Amendment 10, which brings in this extremely important sector - transport, logistics and trans-European networks - as a basis for the Lisbon Strategy."
"Mr President, I am glad we accept in this resolution that the Lisbon Agenda is not only based on economics but has a social dimension as well."
"With that in mind, it is important that we bring those excluded from the labour market into employment by making sure the 2000 Employment Framework Directive is implemented equally across all Member States."
"It is just as important that we continue to call for specific directives on age and disability, because if people cannot get to work, then they cannot even take the employment if they are offered it."
"I also welcome the section on better regulation, but I would have liked to have seen it include a reference to sunset clauses on all legislation."
"Finally, proposed health and safety legislation should be based on up-to-date scientific and medical evidence."
"I call also for everyone to vote for my amendment on the Interinstitutional Agreement on better lawmaking."
"Mr President, I have three points to make on the European Council."
"It is a pity that there are not more people here, but nevertheless I will make the three points."
"The first one is on the Lisbon Agenda."
"We are going to sign the Berlin Declaration at the end of March."
"One of the key points there has to do with the Lisbon Agenda, and that is the free movement of goods, services, people and money."
"It needs to be included simply because it is one of the founding principles of the whole European Union."
"We are unfortunately living right now in a time of protectionism."
"That protectionism needs to end and we need to see a message in the Lisbon Agenda and the Berlin Declaration on that point."
"My second point is that, in my view, the European Union has been missing its red menace ever since the end of the Cold War."
"Indeed, we had the euro in the 1990s and enlargement in this decade, but ever since we have been looking for something and I think the debate today shows that that something has been found: climate change."
"In many ways we should actually thank President Putin for bringing energy policy onto the European agenda, because had he not done what he did in Ukraine, I do not think we would be as excited about discussing energy sufficiency and the energy mix as we are today."
"I am really happy with the direction in which the Commission is taking the energy debate, the environmental debate and the debate on climate change."
"The final point I wanted to make is on my favourite subject: the constitution."
"I know that it is not on the agenda of the European Council in the beginning of March, but I would just really like to urge the German Presidency to continue the good work it has done so far in keeping it going."
"We need that constitution and we need it badly for three reasons: one, it makes the Union more efficient; two, it makes the Union more democratic; and three, it makes the Union easier to understand."
"I hope that that Treaty will get a roadmap at the end of the German Presidency so that it can enter into force in 2009."
"(ES) With a view to the Spring Summit, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that the speech this morning by Chancellor Merkel also relates fully to the March agenda."
"Following the Madrid meeting of the eighteen 'Friends of the Constitution', with the two who have said that they are going to ratify it and those who have yet to speak - their silence is deafening - I believe that it is important to support what the President-in-Office of the Council has said."
"I would like to make one comment however, and that is that if we have to do anything, we must use the pen more than the scissors, because to defend the substance alone is dangerous, particularly if we start pruning."
"I would like to say, from the point of view of democracy and of political action in the energy sector, with a view to the policies that we have to implement, that there is a significant danger attached to reducing, because, from a democratic point of view - and Parliament has a great interest here - we will move on from having thirty-five legal bases to acting with eighty-five, and that is of immense and decisive importance."
"Secondly, with regard to the Lisbon Strategy, I would like to introduce an element that has not been mentioned here, which is the successful conclusion of the Doha Round."
"We can talk about climate change, we can talk about energy and the social model, but if we do not achieve a positive conclusion in the Doha Round - which clearly cannot include these elements directly, elements that must be taken into account and placed on the agenda in our international relations - I believe that alone we will not be able to resolve problems that have a global dimension in the world."
"I believe that the European Union must implement an active policy that includes these elements, bearing in mind the importance of concluding the Doha Round, which is on the German Presidency's agenda, but about which I believe too little is said."
"(LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my comments on the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, I would like to stress one of four priorities - the energy."
"It is especially in this field, with minimal competitiveness in market and network services, that the EU still lags behind."
"The Baltic countries are still isolated from an energy standpoint - both in terms of electricity and especially natural gas."
"The North European Gas Pipeline, which is being constructed as a result of an agreement by just two countries - Germany and Russia, will not solve the natural gas marketing and distribution network problems."
"The Russian President's speech in Munich showed that an imperial mindset is resurgent in Russia, and it appears that the intention remains unchanged - to continue to use energy policy for political purposes."
"A common EU energy market would be a security guarantee in relation to third countries, and it would help to solve energy crises which can arise within the EU or can be provoked from outside the EU."
"In negotiations with Russia it is essential to have safeguards in place to protect against attempted monopolistic dictates from third parties."
"In order for us all to feel safer, I invite the Council and the Commission to promptly initiate an independent expert assessment of the likely effects of the North European Gas Pipeline."
"The Baltic Sea does not belong to just two countries but the whole of the Union."
"Mr President, I do not think you will be surprised to hear that, as the coordinator for my group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I want to address in particular the issues concerning the future strategy for the single market."
"I know, Mr President-in-Office, that you will be receiving a strategy paper from the Commission to discuss."
"We have not had a chance to see that yet, but all I can say is that I hope it is a bold paper because we have a lot of work to do."
"I particularly address you as President-in-Office of the Council because I want to draw your attention to the heading of a whole section in this resolution: 'Removal of persisting internal market deficits'."
"That is aimed squarely at members of the Council."
"The Commission is working very hard to do that, but the fact remains that the internal market is a shared responsibility."
"We can do so much in this House and we have done a lot on the services directive, the prime example recently, but a lot more is needed as well."
"We are about to consider, under the leadership of my colleague Mr Stubb, the whole question of free movement of goods in non-harmonised areas."
"That will be an important proposal as well, but we must have your engagement and commitment to work on it."
"I had the privilege a few weeks ago - Mrs Ayala Sender is also a member of the committee and she mentioned it just now - of being rapporteur for our interparliamentary meeting, where we had parliamentarians from across the Member States talking about the internal market."
"What was interesting was the primacy that they placed on the four freedoms that Mr Stubb just mentioned and how they need help to be able to defend those in their parliaments against their own governments."
"There is a suggestion sometimes that it is all too easy to blame the internal market for job losses or for encouraging more competition that is bad for consumers and for economies, but in fact the single market is absolutely at the centre of our response to global pressures."
"As somebody from one of the national parliaments said at our meeting, the internal market is crucial because it gives strength in depth to the whole of the Lisbon Strategy."
"I ask you as President-in-Office of the Council to put that on your agenda, to get your fellow ministers to really start taking the internal market and its transposition seriously, and to engage your citizens and your parliamentarians with that challenge."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know whether it was deliberate or accidental, but the day chosen to open the European Council, 8 March, is International Women's Day."
"It was a good choice on Mrs Merkel's part, and I expect that she will be able to make the most of the day."
"I would like to put the European Council back in its historical context: 2007-2010 will, I think, be decisive years, rather like 1954-1957, between the failure of the Defence Community and the relaunch of the European budget by the Treaty of Rome, the 50th anniversary of which we are now celebrating."
"We have many meetings ahead of us: institutional, budgetary, electoral, with the European elections and perhaps referendums, a review of the Lisbon Strategy, and even meetings on agricultural policy."
"Therefore, we all need to make a commitment to convince the people and to bring them with us when the time comes."
"The people will hear us talk about competition, and they are not opposed to it."
"They will hear us talk about flexibility in business, and they are not opposed to it as long as workers have security."
"That said, there is another word I would suggest to you: harmonisation."
"It seems to have disappeared from our language, although it features in the Treaty of Rome."
"Environmental harmonisation is getting there - it is making progress."
"Tax harmonisation has rather ground to a halt with regard to company tax."
"Social harmonisation is too weak."
"Be that as it may, I think that we need to send the beautiful music of harmonisation floating to the ears of our fellow citizens."
"Equally, and like many others, I would like the Council to encourage the Commission to submit a text, a framework directive, on public services."
"It is certainly necessary to rebalance the market, even though it is true that nobody here is opposed to it."
"It would simply be a translation of the meaning that Jacques Delors gave to European integration, or at least of one of his phrases: competition stimulates, cooperation strengthens, but solidarity unites."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to pick up on a number of things that have been mentioned, of which the cutting back of bureaucracy is but one."
"Today, at midday in this plenary, we annulled two directives, but I do, even so, think we all need to make a bit more of an effort, and I also believe that there is a need for a mechanism with the aid of which we can together work out which directives really are superfluous."
"This laborious procedure, whereby the Commission prepares something, the Council's assent is then required and then at length we in this House have a say in the matter, is one that I do not regard as efficient."
"I think that we would, together, be able to annul superfluous directives much more quickly if a proper system were in place for it, and I would also be glad of participation in this subject on the part of the Commissioner with responsibility for this matter."
"There is a second matter that I would like briefly to address."
"This year, we will have to come to a decision on a piece of legislation liberalising the market in postal services, something that is of great importance in relation to the internal market."
"The proposals made by the Commission are indicative of its great commitment to this."
"We in this House will endeavour to get through first reading as quickly as possible, and I hope that the Council will take those things that are going to be enacted at the March European Council - splendid headings, flowery language and all - and put them into practical effect in the legislation on the opening up of the markets in postal services, that being an area in which that really is urgently necessary, since, if we want to achieve growth, create jobs, and foster social security, we will not find a solution in the monopoly model that has hitherto held sway in Europe."
"I await the Council's proposals with eagerness and am particularly keen to see the government of the Federal Republic of Germany pursue the path to which it has committed itself rather than fall to its knees."
"I have heard many interesting things said today about energy policy, and will permit myself one final comment on that subject."
"What I will say to Mrs Harms is that I find it quite shameful that the energy policy of the Social Democrats and the Greens will have contributed to an increase in the amount of CO2 emitted in Germany, so I would ask her not to lecture this House on what is to be done about it."
"In the seven years in which you had responsibility for these things, you - Mrs Harms - did the precise opposite of what you are preaching to us."
"Mr President, I think it would be very difficult to underestimate the importance of this Spring Summit, because it comes before the Berlin Declaration, which is going to explain how and why the European Union is relevant to the world, in essence relaunching the European Union."
"It comes before further reflection on future reform of the European Union itself."
"So I would like to echo what Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m said, i.e. that this Spring Council has got to show how the European Union can deliver for its citizens, because before you talk about fine institutional matters you have got to talk about how you deliver."
"I think if we fail to deliver action at this summit, this is going to undermine all the plans of the German Presidency."
"I think we need to deliver action, as has been said, on completing the internal market."
"There are simply too many gaps which affect ordinary citizens who want to travel and to work in other Member States - even things like registering a motor vehicle in a number of Member States."
"We have to deliver on the subject of better regulation in order to improve the rights of consumers and improve the business atmosphere."
"We have to carry through a commitment to cut the cost of red tape by 25%."
"In particular we have got to follow through on the ten fast-track practical proposals presented by the Commission."
"On action and energy, we have to fulfil existing agreements on energy liberalisation."
"We have to have a competitive energy market and that involves unbundling and strengthening the power of regulators."
"I would hope the German Government, as opposed to the German Presidency, will be taking a lead in this area."
"We need to take action on climate change."
"We have to take a global lead but we can only do that if we have action to reduce our own emissions, to cut our use of carbon and to make the emissions trading scheme much more effective and much more watertight."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Lisbon Strategy is Europe's answer to the challenges of globalisation."
"The efforts made by the Commission and the Member States to relaunch and clarify the strategy now need to bear fruit in terms of growth and jobs."
"The European Council must reaffirm that the solution to our economic difficulties rests largely in improving the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, including productive public spending on investment, research and development, energy and the environment."
"The combination of economic, social and environmental reforms at national and European level is the only way for us to achieve our joint objectives of improving competitiveness and creating more and better jobs."
"The European Council will also adopt the energy action plan, with the aim of guaranteeing security of supply, competitiveness and respect for the environment."
"I would like to draw your attention to the potential impact of the really ambitious targets that the Commission has set for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, because, whilst the aim is entirely laudable, we must ensure that we maintain a balance between ecological principles and the competitiveness of business."
"I support the German Presidency and the Commission in their backing for the 'better regulation' initiative."
"Europe has often had a tendency to produce too many regulations, sometimes on any old subject, but it is not the role of the Union to interfere in everything."
"Instead, it must do better in the policies that do require decision-making at at least European level and that represent true European added value: energy, climate, security and immigration, to name but a few."
"It is now time for the EU to concentrate on the basics, with respect for the subsidiarity principle and in line with the people's expectations."
"(PT) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in the year in which the EU is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, in the year of equal opportunities for all, in the year, too, in which my country, Portugal, is to take the EU Presidency, I feel it important to point out that on Sunday the Portuguese people voted 'yes' in a referendum to decriminalise abortion up to ten weeks of pregnancy."
"I feel it is right to highlight the importance of this vote here in this Chamber and in this context for two further reasons: firstly, because the clear victory for the 'yes' vote corresponds to the recommendations adopted by Parliament calling for abortion to be legal and safe in all Member States, and secondly because, by happy coincidence, as mentioned by Mr Poignant, the Spring Council is due to take place on 8 March."
"As Portuguese Prime Minister Mr Socrates said, with this result Portugal has taken a further firm step forward in building a more open, more tolerant and fairer society."
"As regards the Lisbon Strategy, it is also necessary to strengthen the social element throughout the Member States, in order to enhance the work-life balance for European men and women. This involves, for example, creating and developing high quality, affordable care infrastructures for children and other dependents."
"What is needed is more and better jobs for women as well, and equal pay for the same work. We feel that without the involvement of women the ambitious objectives of the Lisbon Strategy cannot be attained."
"(ES) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, the Lisbon Strategy represents the launch of a great European project, now that we have achieved the euro, aimed at achieving greater well-being and especially levels of employment and participation by Europeans in the workplace, women in particular."
"It sets the path towards opening up - opening up Europe - a path towards liberalising strategic sectors, communications, transport, energy, financial services. Also towards modernising labour relations, with a view to ensuring, by means of social agreements, that the labour market is modernised in such a way as to increase access to jobs, especially for young people and for the long-term unemployed."
"We are now seeing a recovery of economic growth and this Summit, to be held in March, which will revise that Lisbon Strategy, must confirm to the Europeans that economic growth in 2006 is not a passing event, but that it can be reinforced within the framework of the global economy and of that recovery."
"In order to do that, we are going to need a lot of political initiative, a lot of political capacity in order to carry out the reforms that cannot be left any longer - and this afternoon energy and the environment have been mentioned in this House. In short, all of the reforms needed to restore the Europeans' confidence in their own project."
"There will be no confidence without employment."
"What is slowing down the great European Project is our inability to grow, as Mrs WallstrÃ¶m said."
"It is low growth with insufficient job creation."
"Those of us who feel profoundly European believe that there is still time to restore that process and not to let it die by itself."
"(PL) Mr President, once again we are debating a programme for Europe that needs to be far-reaching, clear and able to meet global challenges."
"This time we have to pay particular attention to the problem of the common energy policy, which is currently a very important political and social issue."
"We must remember that the recent increases in energy prices will in future become an ever-increasing problem both for world energy markets and for economic development."
"We do not yet have a clear European energy strategy."
"The Member States continue to focus on their own strategic interests, which are then reflected in their domestic political decisions."
"That is why there is still so little scope for cooperation at European level."
"A European energy policy, on the other hand, means acting in harmony and solidarity."
"Mr Barroso, the President of the European Commission, rightly said this morning that if we want to be treated as a partner to be reckoned with in energy policy, we need to speak with one voice instead of 27. Solidarity is particularly important in obtaining secure energy supplies."
"The European Union must speak with one voice when negotiating with its main energy suppliers in order to achieve a sound, long-term partnership and agreements on energy cooperation."
"Furthermore, energy policy is also indirectly linked to the priorities of the new Lisbon Strategy, which are to increase growth and jobs."
"On this strategy, the Council rightly proposes that we focus on four areas, namely an economic policy based on stability and growth, development of the internal market, innovation, research and education, and increasing jobs and developing of the European social model."
"The Lisbon Strategy does, however, still require greater commitment by the governments of the Member States as regards implementation."
"In order to maintain balanced growth, we must also bolster the strategy's environmental and social aspects, particularly as regards job creation."
"(PT) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, today is the right time to say that, thanks to the 2004 reform, the Lisbon Strategy is more than just a series of unattainable targets - the priorities are clearer and the responsibilities better defined."
"I wish to use this speech to talk about social policy within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Firstly, it is abundantly clear that the Lisbon Strategy is not, as some would have it, some kind of liberal attempt at undermining the foundations and values of the European social model."
"Far from it, in fact. The Lisbon Strategy represents a vision that, very much in a spirit of reform, seeks to preserve the values that lie at the heart of the European social model."
"The Lisbon Strategy therefore lays down political guidelines on the need to modernise social protection systems, which is a necessary response to what is happening in Europe and around the world."
"This broad guideline clearly expresses the idea that social policy should be seen not as a burden but rather as a factor that can have a positive influence on economic growth, by increasing productivity and competitiveness and by delivering higher levels of social cohesion and access to fundamental rights."
"It thus becomes a significant instrument in guaranteeing social peace and political stability, without which there can be no lasting economic progress."
"Because of the 2004 reform, I now feel more optimistic than before as regards the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The EU has entered a period of economic acceleration and may outstrip the United States of America in terms of growth."
"In the first half of 2006 alone, investment rose by 6%, exports should rise by more than 5%, and the unemployment rate has fallen to 1998 levels."
"These figures confirm that the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy are having a cumulative effect on the ground, whereby sustained economic growth leads to more and better jobs, to continued improvement in the living standards of EU citizens without any loss of competitiveness and to the values of the European social model being upheld."
"I therefore wish to congratulate Mr Barroso and the Commission on the reform that, in timely fashion, they chose to introduce into the Lisbon Strategy."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a great deal has been said about the successful implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, or at any rate about the endeavours to achieve it."
"Before you leave, I should like to ask you to speak out, at the next meeting, in favour of clear outlines and clear boundaries, for which the individual will be responsible, 'individual' meaning the Member State and the European Union."
"It became apparent from last week's inter-parliamentary meeting in Brussels that our counterparts in the various Member States had brought with them all their criticisms and demands in relation to education, employment, social security, climate protection and so on, and insisted on getting solutions to them, yet it is in the hands of the Member States that most of these powers and responsibilities lie."
"More transparency and more information are needed if people are to know where, at the end of the day, responsibility lies, which responsibility lies with the EU and which with the Member State."
"Education is at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The Commission's most recent progress report showed that the Member States are still making considerable efforts to achieve the five targets by 2010, and that will require, as a matter of urgency, more investment in education and the specification of explicit rights and obligations in that area and in that of lifelong learning."
"If people are to be more mobile, their qualifications will also have to be recognised."
"Those that we have acquired within the European Union are still of too little practical use to us."
"I would ask you to take account of that in your work."
"Last week, I had a very interesting meeting with the European Young Socialists, who asked me to pass on to you the message that education is also an end in itself, that it does not always have the sole purpose of helping people to become workers adapted to the labour market, but also has a great influence on the development of personal self-awareness, of social skills and of cultural understanding."
"It is that that I see as a great education task for all of us."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my particular thanks for the many suggestions that have been put forward, which are also summarised in the parliamentary resolution that has yet to be adopted."
"We have focused on a number of important issues, namely those inherent to the Lisbon Strategy: growth, jobs - and also sustainability, which was added in Gothenburg."
"The last speech, in particular - by Mrs Prets - highlighted the issue of who bears responsibility with regard to Lisbon - and my personal experience over recent years validates this point."
"It has been clear that, in many fields, things are being coordinated that subsequently need to be implemented at national level."
"Nevertheless - and this is related to the other point raised by several Members today - there are issues where all Member States agree that measures are not affordable at national level alone, and that help from the European level is needed."
"This, in turn, is related to the issue of lawmaking: does it have to be carried out at European level or could it be done at national level?"
"One important related issue is energy - which, in turn, overlaps with the field of growth."
"We shall be dealing with this at the Spring European Council, too, as the development of renewable energy is on the agenda."
"This will represent the first important contribution to environmental protection, too - a contribution that will at the same time present new job opportunities."
"After all, this field has proved to be a source of new jobs - and these, in turn, will offer opportunities for exporting products outside the EU."
"It is not sufficient that Europe leads the way in energy conservation and combating climate change; it must convince others to take this course too."
"We can only convince others if we set a good example ourselves, however."
"I should like to emphasise another important point, even though it will not be such a central topic at the European Council."
"There have already been repeated calls for energy solidarity, and there have also been calls for talks with Russia - and rightly so."
"To achieve this security, however, negotiations with Russia are needed as well as a mandate to breathe life into the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia at long last, so that the very aspects that also play a role in the issue of energy security can be included in the negotiations."
"I should like to mention another aspect in this connection, namely the reason for the importance of this dialogue with Russia."
"If we all bear in mind today how the pipelines in Russia are laid, where they are laid and the fact that - partly as a result of global warming - the condition of these pipelines may soon deteriorate, we see that it is important to enter into close contact with Russia in this particular regard - rather than just with the other producing countries and/or the relevant transit countries."
"I should like to mention a field already referred to by several Members, including Mr Goebbels - namely the social dimension, the European social model."
"The occasional criticism has been made that this dimension is not really central."
"I should just like to remind the House that, just a few days ago, this Presidency held an impetus conference in Nuremberg under the leadership of Franz MÃ¼ntefering, German Federal Minister for Labour and Social Affairs and President of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, on issues such as the following. How can we respond to the challenge of globalisation?"
"What can the EU do?"
"What should be retained and what changed in response to these challenges?"
"The Council President has also made it his objective to continue this during Germany's Presidency of the G8."
"Nevertheless, we must consider how to allay the fears that this changing world holds for many citizens."
"It is very important to bear in mind that people need security in change."
"Returning to the subject of Lisbon, many associate this word with the beautiful capital of Portugal, whilst for others it holds no associations."
"The task of remedying this falls not only to the Commission."
"It is our duty to repeatedly emphasise the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy - growth, jobs and sustainability - and coordinate these with new issues and challenges, such as research, education and training."
"In so doing, however, we must show at national level that this impetus and this coordination have come from Europe."
"I should like to make one last comment on the subject of the Constitutional Treaty, even though it is not on the agenda of the Spring European Council."
"It is unsatisfactory to make comments such as 'Why not just dispense with the Constitutional Treaty: the people do not want it?'"
"Statements such as this are incorrect, as some Member States, such as Spain and Luxembourg, have accepted this Constitutional Treaty - be it in their parliaments or by means of referendums."
"It is true that two other Member States have voted against it, but, at the same time - as the German Chancellor said in her speech on the German Presidency here a few weeks ago - many people who reject this Constitutional Treaty also want the European Union to have more powers and responsibilities, for example in the field of energy."
"This is exactly what the Constitutional Treaty envisages."
"Individuals have to decide what it is they want, therefore: they cannot always just select the parts they like."
"Those calling for parliamentary rights, for example the early-warning mechanism via better lawmaking, have to be able to decide on the level - national or European - at which they believe regulations are needed and should be adopted."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, I should like to thank all the Members for staying until the very end."
"It is always a challenge to create a real debate and not just to have monologues."
"I should like to make three comments."
"Firstly, I should like to follow up on something to which many of you referred: the deadlock over the Constitutional Treaty and what many of you have pointed to as a lack of commitment from our political leaders in Europe today."
"The Commission, of course, fully backs what we could call a courageous and ambitious commitment from the German Presidency to ensure that this whole issue is moved from a stage of reflection to one of action."
"We know it will not be easy to find solutions, but we will help as much as we can."
"We must overcome this deadlock as soon as possible."
"The outcome of the spring Council will be very important in this respect, as will its capacity to deliver on the crucial issues on the agenda, including climate change."
"I should like to comment on what some of you have said about the ambitions of the Commission and the European Union."
"It is important to say that there is a longer-term objective and target for what we have to do in order to fight climate change."
"The 30% cut in developed countries' emissions by 2020 is a necessary step towards the longer-term objective of reducing them by as much as 50% below 1990 levels by 2050."
"It is necessary to see that this is a step in that direction."
"This reduction is essential if we are to meet the 2Â°C objective, which we know, in turn, should prevent massive and irreversible disruption of the global climate system."
"It is the developed countries that should continue to shoulder most of this global effort to reduce emissions over the next decade or so, as they are already doing under the Kyoto Protocol, so as both to be credible and motivate those poorer countries in the world that will have to follow suit."
"We asked the group of developed countries to reduce by 30%."
"Let us ask ourselves whether this is ambitious."
"Compared to 1990, US emissions are currently up by 15%, those of the EU-25 are down by 5% and those of Russia are down by 30%."
"It will not be easy, and you cannot see it individually, but it represents a huge challenge."
"Let me also mention the costs, because many of you have referred to the costs for industry."
"The Commission has made impact assessments that show that taking action to limit climate change is fully compatible with sustaining global growth."
"Investment in a low-carbon economy will require around half a percent of global GDP over the period from 2013 to 2030 and would reduce global GDP growth by 0.19% per year, which is a fraction of the expected annual GDP growth rate of 2.8%."
"This is without associated health benefits, greater energy security and reduced damage from avoided climate change being taken into account."
"This is a small insurance premium to pay for significantly reducing the risk of irreversible damage to our economy and to our planet, and especially if you compare it with the Stern Review's estimate that uncontrolled climate change will cost between 5 and 20% of GDP in the longer term."
"So we must consider the cost of inaction!"
"Climate change is already costing us - just ask insurance companies all over the world."
"Finally, the spring Council is about the Lisbon Strategy."
"You are absolutely right that, if we want to communicate, we have to mention that it is about jobs and growth."
"Lisbon is also about the courage of reform."
"I fully agree with Mr Watson that there is ample evidence that reforms work."
"However, we also have evidence that societies dominated by fears and insecurity are not easy to reform: they are afraid of change."
"That is also what we see in Europe and that is why we have to build confidence and remember that the Lisbon Strategy - the jobs and growth strategy - is also about fighting social exclusion and poverty; fighting poverty in Europe as well, improving quality of work, investing in education, building civic competence and investing in people."
"That is the only way to overcome the fears."
"Listening to all these interesting speeches, I am reminded of the intimate link between the growth and jobs strategy and sustainable development, because we have heard all the arguments for why we as Europeans would like to see economic growth, coupled with social security and maintenance of a high level of environmental protection, while continuing to be ambitious."
"I think that sustainable development is an objective which is gaining ground more and more as the vision for Europe and for the world."
"To conclude the debate, I have received five motions for resolutions on the Lisbon Strategy pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.20 p.m. while awaiting Questions to the Commission and resumed at 5.35 p.m.)"
"Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"(SK) We all certainly agree that innovation plays or should play a dominant role in how we respond to the risks and opportunities presented by the global economy."
"It is common knowledge that the biggest problem concerning the development of innovation is insufficient implementation within the various Member States."
"The main aim of the Lisbon Strategy is to create the conditions for strengthening the internal competitive environment in each Member State."
"The EU economy can only be as competitive and innovation-savvy as the smallest and remotest businesses in its regions."
"Innovation programmes must therefore be directly implemented at a regional level, where they can create a sufficiently competitive environment for local SMEs."
"The centrally managed implementation of innovation development is doomed from the very beginning."
"The way to proceed is through building up a regional technical infrastructure for innovation, including technology incubators and high-tech centres where there will be opportunities to make use of all of the available knowledge potential, as well as every viable innovative idea."
"This must go hand in hand with a flexible approach to all forms of financing, in particular venture capital, taking into account the level of development of a given innovative company or project."
"The financing must also be available at a regional level."
"This is the only way for us to sustain, motivate, develop and tap the knowledge potential of our regions in the interests of long-term sustainable growth."
"Therefore, I would like to call on the EC to consider the above-mentioned aspects of innovation development when assessing national strategic reference frameworks."
"Announcement by the President: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Common organisation of the market in wine (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Batzeli, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine."
"Madam President, as you said, today's debate in the European Parliament on the reform of the COM in wine introduces a cycle of speculation on the future of one of the most important productive, economic and commercial sectors in the European Union."
"What we need to focus on today in this review is the objective of keeping the European sector at the top of the world league, the simplification of Community legislation, compatibility with other European development policies, product recognition, the proportionality of products and the cohesion of all wine-growing areas."
"This was also the message from discussions in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and from the opinions of the Committees on International Trade and Regional Development and from our consultations with operators in the sector at national and European level."
"The reform of the sector must take account of the specific characteristics of wine production at regional and national level, the structure and organisation of the sector, its export capacity and the fact that it may be the only product to which Community legislation applies with a high degree of subsidiarity."
"The arrangements under present policies and funding for the current COM, which have often distorted the market and the competitiveness of the product, should be converted so that the Community budget of EUR 1.3 billion under the first pillar is allocated to policies which will aim in the long term at:"
"maintaining and strengthening European vineyards;"
"reinforcing and improving the competitiveness of the sector at European and international level;"
"a territorial approach that takes account of environmental protection and protection of natural resources by financing agricultural cultivation practices;"
"balancing supply and demand by controlling production with the by-product and potable alcohol distillation mechanism and by modernising the vineyard register;"
"the compatibility or adaptation of COM policies with CAP policies;"
"maintaining the recognition at international and cross-regional level of quality European wines and wines with geographical indication and designation of origin, the classification of which must be decided in principle by the Council, with scientific opinions from the International Organisation of Vine and Wine;"
"strengthening cooperation between all wine agencies from the level of production to the level of movement through operational programmes;"
"strengthening rural and regional wine-growing with additional structural interventions."
"In order to achieve these strategic targets, the Committee on Agriculture proposes certain measures, which include:"
"firstly, having a transitional reform, so as to give a chance for producers to adjust, so that they can abandon market support measures and move towards structural measures, cultivation practices and commercial action;"
"secondly, standard Community policies need to be integrated into national development and support programmes for the sector, depending on the priorities and orientations set by each Member State following consultations with operators at national and regional level."
"The funding for these programmes, by which I mean the national envelopes, will need to be decided at Community level on the basis of standard objective criteria so that there are no distortions or inequalities between the Member States and the regions."
"Commissioner, the market is at its most vulnerable and sensitive stage."
"It is at a dangerous turning point."
"However, with your proposals, you have spun your car off the road."
"You are ousting European wine and vintners from the market."
"The Wine Spectator has published a study showing that, in 2010, the USA will be the biggest consumer of quality and expensive wines."
"However, with your aggressive financial interventions in grubbing up, distillation and enrichment, all the measures on the basis of which you are saving EUR 760 million euros, you would measure much smaller quantities in figures, but we would be driving European wine out of the market, even though this is not warranted by its development."
"In essence, there would be a radical redistribution of Community resources for the benefit of rich, high-yield wine areas to the detriment of regional and mountain areas, to the detriment of the diversity of European wine, and a redistribution of the market for the benefit of imported wines."
"However, I should like to state my position on the amendments tabled in plenary."
"The views of my fellow Members are understandable and I am sure that they wish to express local and national interests and demands."
"This report, as passed by the Committee on Agriculture, is a balanced and integrated report and can go as it stands to the negotiating table for the preparation of the legislative text."
"Watering down the positions expressed in this report would mean watering down the position and the credibility of the European Parliament."
"We cannot call in a loud voice for a radical reform and, in essence, propose a radical status quo."
"We cannot condemn the Commission for liberalising views and respond with nationalisation."
"Finally, our proposals should aim to organise the future, not de-organise everything achieved in the past."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, I am very grateful to the European Parliament and in particular to the rapporteur, Mrs Batzeli, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Regional Development for their work in preparing an own-initiative report on the Commission's communication 'Towards a sustainable European wine sector'."
"I knew before I started the reform process that it would be difficult and complex."
"These last few months have certainly confirmed this impression."
"My debates in the Committee on Agriculture and with a number of Members in the Intergroup on Wine here and in their constituencies have shown me that we are dealing with difficult and sensitive issues."
"I therefore welcome the report."
"It is an ambitious report that covers the whole range of aspects addressed in the communication."
"I believe that I am not saying too much by noting that Mrs Batzeli has grasped the many conflicting concerns that we need to reconcile in the course of the reform."
"It has been a valiant effort and we will now study the report carefully."
"I shall make a few initial observations tonight based on our first reading of the report. Firstly, I should like to express a little regret."
"The report initially states that the Commission, by advocating the need for the reform within the European Union, is not paying sufficient homage to the image of European wines."
"Let me, therefore, be completely clear."
"The European Union's wine sector is second to none: it delivers the best quality wine in the world, it is extremely diverse and it is an important part of our cultural heritage."
"However, some parts of the sector are struggling."
"Millions of hectolitres go into crisis distillation every year."
"That is hardly a sign of a sector that is in good shape, which is what I want it to be."
"I want the sector to be able to compete so that Europe will continue to be the world's leading producer of wine."
"That is why the current regime simply has to be changed."
"It is no longer sustainable."
"I think we can agree that it has resulted in a structural imbalance."
"Stocks are high and, as a result, prices for many wines are low and income for wine-growers has been reduced."
"These developments, combined with falling consumption, changing lifestyles and increasing imports from third countries, have forced changes upon us."
"I think this is widely accepted."
"The direction we all want to take is described in recital K of your report. It suggests that the principal aims of the reform should be to strengthen the dynamism and competitiveness of the sector without losing its market share in international markets, but, equally, to take account of the interests of producers and consumers, while respecting the objectives of maintaining tradition, quality and authenticity."
"It goes without saying that you are critical of certain elements of the communication, including matters such as the consumption forecast and the alerts, and the contradiction between the policies of grubbing-up and competitiveness."
"The Commission agrees that one of the main challenges is to revive demand, but profitability is even more vital and the pattern of structural surplus leading to lower prices and negative incomes needs to be stopped first."
"Profitability is not a question of concentrating production in a few hands and then standardising the wine."
"There are small producers who make wine of a wonderful quality and who are also very profitable and I see no reason why this should not still be the case in future."
"However, grubbing-up allows those wine producers who are never going to be able to be competitive and who are not able to respond to consumer demand to leave with dignity and compensation."
"Surely no one here wants to force those producers who have no profitable, predictable future in the sector just to remain because they cannot afford to leave."
"I fully understand that grubbing-up is a sensitive question."
"I therefore particularly appreciate the constructiveness that the European Parliament has already shown on this issue."
"I welcome your recognition that the decision to grub up must lie with the grower and, having said this, I have also studied your different suggestions very attentively."
"You also state very clearly that the decision to grub up cannot, and should not, be taken in a vacuum."
"I completely agree."
"You have put forward suggestions on how to ensure that grubbing-up complies with a certain number of social and environmental aspects and I can assure you that these will serve as a useful inspiration when we consider how better to frame grubbing-up within our legislative proposal."
"I have also noted that you propose to operate a reform in two stages."
"We will have plenty of time to discuss the timing and how to calibrate the various instruments at the different stages, but I agree on the concept that we need initially to address the structural imbalances that weigh heavily on our sector today."
"One issue that you come back to in the report, and which was also a key factor in our earlier debates, is your strong preference for maintaining the wine budget within the first pillar."
"First of all, I believe that this is at odds with the Community position that rural development measures can make a substantial contribution to the required improvements in the wine-growing regions."
"Let us not forget that we can ring-fence funds for wine regions in the rural development budget."
"But I also believe that your position on this issue rests on a false perception that I want to shift considerable funds away from the first pillar, and this is not the case."
"I have said on several occasions, and will repeat tonight that in the future the majority of funding to the sector will continue to come through the first pillar, but this should not prevent us from drawing on the obvious benefits of also having recourse to the second pillar."
"I know that in this Parliament there is a strong push for more Community efforts on promotion."
"It is indeed important that we improve information about the advantages of moderate and responsible wine consumption and that we promote opportunities in third countries more aggressively."
"I think that you will agree with me that we need a more progressive and a more modern approach."
"This is something to which I will certainly give due attention in the legal proposal."
"Finally, I would like to say that I have worked with this Parliament for two and a half years."
"You have clearly demonstrated your ability to be progressive and creative, even on sensitive matters such as the sugar reform, in the pursuit of balanced reform solutions that properly prepare the European Union's agriculture to face up to its present and future challenges."
"But when I look at many of your positions, notably on enrichment, distillation, and private storage, I must admit that I find you to be a little more timid than usual in your zeal for reform."
"I do not expect us to agree on these issues now, but these are areas where I believe we will need to be innovative and creative."
"Much difficult work therefore lies ahead of us, but I look forward to your continued and very valuable input."
"I welcome this opportunity for a debate here tonight."
"My apologies to the Chair for being more lengthy than usual, but this is a very important issue which is the focus of huge attention in all the regions of Europe and that is why I took the liberty of speaking for a little longer than usual."
"In its opinion, the Committee on International Trade emphasised that in the course of reforming the wine sector, the most important thing is for us to make European wine more competitive on international markets as well as on internal markets."
"This is by no means a simple task, since regulating the wine market is exceptionally complex, and European wineries are struggling with numerous difficulties."
"One of the very important points in the recommendation by the Committee on International Trade is that support for grubbing up cannot be the central element of the reform."
"A much more complex regulation is needed than this."
"In my view, insofar as support is to be given to grubbing up, this must be concentrated on those regions where surplus is currently being produced."
"For it can be seen that in those regions where production is in deficit - in other words, where they consume more than they produce - or where it is in equilibrium, the growth of imports comes not primarily from wines of other European Union Member States, but from wines of third countries."
"Therefore, if grubbing up is carried out in those areas which until now have been able to produce enough for their own consumption, but which from now on will no longer be able to do so, it is not at all certain that this will lead to a decrease in the surplus produced within the European Union."
"It is much more likely that it will lead to an increase in imports from third countries."
"In addition to these considerations, it is the opinion of the Committee on International Trade that we need to act forcefully in international forums, within the framework of the WTO, that is, in bilateral trade agreements, in the interests of securing protection of geographical indications."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (ES) In our opinion, we in the Committee on Regional Development have wished to stress certain issues that we believe to be important from the point of view of territorial cohesion, when it comes to implementing a reform that will have a significant impact on certain European regions."
"Vineyards and wine production play a crucial structural role in certain regions as a motor for rural development and, therefore, when it comes to adapting the rules regulating the wine sector, aspects such as the increasing depopulation that is threatening many European regions must be taken into account."
"We therefore wish to draw attention to the system of grubbing-up proposed by the Commission, which would seriously prejudice the economic and social situation of certain regions in which the wine sector is the main source of employment and prosperity."
"We believe that the Commission must propose measures to modernise wine-production techniques and marketing methods."
"Finally, this reform must be applied gradually and include transitional periods and a constant assessment of the effects of the reform on the economic and social situation of the regions of the European Union."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by emphasising once more that what we are discussing here is an own-initiative report that represents the response of the European Parliament to the Commission Communication regarding the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine."
"In my capacity as rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I can say that the Commission is right to regard strengthening the innovative capacity and competitiveness of the wine sector in Europe and worldwide as the primary objective of this reform."
"Promotional and information campaigns to encourage responsible consumption of wine form part of this."
"We consider it indispensable for the intensive pursuit of these objectives that the entire funding of the wine sector remain under the first pillar."
"In this connection, we warmly welcome the fact that the new rules will be applied according to the principle of subsidiarity by transposing them into national programmes approved by the Commission."
"Grubbing-up and permanent abandonment of vineyards may form part of this reform, but they must not be the central part."
"Likewise, before assigning new planting rights, the situation in the individual wine-growing regions with regard to illegal plantings should be examined."
"If we are to achieve an ambitious, forward-looking trade policy for wines, we must take a tailored approach in thinking about the present funding."
"The present distillation, representing EUR 600 million out of a total of EUR 1.4 billion, is certainly not an option for the future."
"Nevertheless, we believe that support for the distillation of wine by-products and potable-alcohol distillation should be retained."
"The compromise on the wine-growing traditions of the individual Member States consists in respect for the various traditions - and enrichment with sucrose also ranks among traditional oenological practices."
"In addition to its economic value, wine-growing forms part of the cultural heritage of the various regions of the EU."
"The new challenges necessitate rules that enable sustainability and also sustainable competitiveness."
"We should make these things our objective."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Batzeli, on the immense amount of work she has done."
"Secondly, I would like to say to the Commissioner that, according to her own analysis, consumption of wine is falling in the European Union, our trade balance with third countries is deteriorating and we have a production surplus that the Commission puts at 15% of the total for 2011."
"Nevertheless, while I agree with the Commissioner that this reform is necessary, I hope that she has understood this Parliament's message, which is that grubbing-up cannot be the central element on which the reform pivots, but rather one more instrument of structural adjustment, subject to control by the Member States."
"We need a reform that preserves the best of what we are."
"It should not be a question of producing less in order to leave room for third countries, but of making the changes necessary to improve our own production and processing structures and above all, as the sector is demanding, our marketing structures."
"With regard to funding, this Parliament unequivocally supports the maintenance of the current budget, within the first pillar of the CAP."
"Its a priori distribution amongst producing States, according to the historical data, by means of the so-called 'national packages', will promote a more appropriate application of the reform."
"With regard to the liberalisation of planting rights, I believe that it must be carried out prudently and at all times under the supervision and control of the Member States."
"I would also like openly to express my support for the amendment by Mrs Fraga, who recommends that, for enrichment, musts produced within the European Union should be used."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Commissioner, Mrs Batzeli, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union's wine-growing sector represents an extremely important economic activity, particularly in terms of exports."
"The European Union is the world's premier vineyard."
"Global wine consumption is on the increase, and yet the European wine sector is in crisis: it is a very paradoxical situation."
"We here in Parliament have been working passionately on the outline of a reform of the common organisation of the market in wine."
"Wine producers are using their know-how to keep traditions going in modern viticulture."
"These men and women are passionate about their work, and it is our responsibility to be passionate in defending them, in helping them to face economic realities and in showing them our support."
"The Commission's response to passion, however, is a cold 'large-scale grubbing up, liberalisation of planting rights and abolition of distillation mechanisms'."
"In my opinion, this report on which we will be voting on Thursday shows that Parliament is responding with a proposal for reforms, admittedly, but progressive reforms."
"I think we need to leave the Member States, and particularly the regions, considerable room for manoeuvre in this matter: no one can deny that, in some regions, nothing grows except grapevines; nor can anyone deny the contribution that wine producers have made to the structure of the countryside."
"Through their competences in town and country planning, the Member States and the regions therefore have the necessary capabilities to assess plantation or grubbing-up policies, in close cooperation with producers and representatives of the sector."
"It is true that some of the instruments in the current common market organisation are now inappropriate, or are not being used properly, but I nevertheless expect the Commission to take the time to work with the Member States to analyse the consequences of the abolition or replacement of those instruments, particularly distillation mechanisms."
"I expect the Commission to propose instruments to regulate the market and to manage potential crises."
"The recipe is simple: quality wine, and promotion."
"Global wine consumption is on the increase, and the economic and cultural boom in certain countries is being accompanied by an interest in drinking wine."
"It is important for the Community's wine sector to be made more competitive, by means of actions instituted at all stages of production and marketing."
"In terms of Ånological practices, the new wine-producing countries have more flexible regulations."
"I think we need to be careful to avoid the character of our wines becoming globalised."
"We certainly need to relax the restrictions imposed on European producers and enable them to adapt to demand and improved competitiveness."
"I support a ban on the vinification of imported grape must, and on mixing it with Community must."
"I would like, by way of conclusion, to remind you, Commissioner, that wines have a flavour of the land on which they are grown, the colour of the seasons and the spirit of the wine producers."
"They have the flavour of the country, of the European Union."
"It reminds me of an anonymous quotation: 'to make a great wine, you need a passionate fool to grow the vines, a wise man to regulate them, a lucid artist to make the wine, a lover to drink it and a poet to sing of its glory'."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Madam President, Mrs Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, above and beyond its role as an agricultural and economic product, wine represents our history, culture and traditions."
"Thus, we cannot accept a reform primarily aimed at resizing a sector that currently uses only 3% of budget funds, as compared with added-value production of 7%."
"The Commission is proposing to reduce production and to grub up approximately 400 000 hectares of vines over five years, on the grounds of the need to reduce management costs on production surpluses and to improve European competitiveness through the principle that 'only the strongest will remain on the market'."
"It is strange to observe that, while Europe favours a policy of grubbing up vines, other countries, such as those in South America and southern Africa, support planting them."
"In view of the fact that worldwide demand is not falling but increasing, it seems that the Commission intends to restore a balance in the European Union's internal market without taking into consideration worldwide demand and the balance of the world market, and without considering that in the hasty reduction of European wine production there is a risk of eliminating some vines which, while not producing products that are extremely strong on the market, are regional holdings of quality, with strongly-rooted historical traditions that still today act as the social fabric for entire regional areas."
"The truth is that the new world wines are gaining market share thanks to a growing improvement in product quality, together with the competitiveness of their prices."
"The new intervention methods ought to make it possible for the whole sector to meet the new challenges imposed by an increasingly globalised market."
"The winning formula is still to invest in the quality and individual characteristics of European wines, in cost reduction, in the promotion of wine in order to enlarge its market, and we fear that the spread of new oenological practices may lead to a deterioration in the image of wine and therefore compromise the relationship of trust between the consumer and the product, with very serious consequences for consumption."
"Mrs Fischer Boel, the wine sector needs a reform that promotes greater competitiveness in European wine, by continuing with the restructuring of vines to make them more competitive and by promoting the maintenance of viticulture to act as protection for the land and the environment."
"Geographical labels and designations of origin should be understood to be vital tools in guaranteeing and protecting European producers."
"To conclude, Mrs Fischer Boel, what we ask of a new EU wine policy is the recovery and development of the sector on the world market."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the rapporteur really is a staunch champion of European wine."
"I disagree with her in many regards, but one really has to give her credit for her commitment."
"Even though I am inclined to welcome the Commission's proposals, I must point out that many regions perceive the liberalisation carefully implemented by these proposals as a rather unfeeling policy from Brussels."
"This is something that should be taken seriously - the rapporteur also points it out."
"When she invited us to a Greek wine evening, I fully agreed with her - and I hope I was not alone in this - that it would not occur to anyone to make the wine proffered to us there into pure spirit."
"That is exactly the problem."
"We must market wine as a quality product, and we must also give vintners the opportunity to do so."
"On the subject of grubbing-up - which, it must be emphasised time and again, should not be compulsory, but should instead consist in offering vintners the chance of ceasing operations if they see no future in the wine market - the Commission should take measures to shape a better future for the market."
"That is, vintners should first be made an offer, and then told that, if nothing can be done, they may leave viniculture with the help of public funds."
"Then there is the matter of the regions."
"Commissioner, this is a question of money."
"The regions have been receiving money, and to discontinue a given measure now will deprive them of this money."
"The fight is for purely material things, therefore."
"The regions should be assured here, too, that these funds will remain at their disposal - according to specific social and environmental criteria and with regard to the market - so that these regions can continue to be wine-producing regions."
"Taking this course would remove a great deal of the tension and also enable agreement with the rapporteur."
"Madam President, the last reform of the CAP set as an objective faster cutbacks in the agricultural sector and support for it, so as to save resources for other anti-grassroots policies."
"At the same time, the elimination of small and medium-sized farms is being promoted so as to concentrate land, production and trade in a few hands."
"Wine is not exempt from this objective."
"What if Europe is first in production, consumption and exports in the world thanks to the good quality wines that it produces?"
"For Europe, the main thing is competition and the liberalisation of wine and must imports to the detriment of European production, thereby also undermining quality."
"That is why mass grubbing up is being imposed, with strong incentives and sales of the rights of small and medium-sized vineyards to companies in the sector, thereby fostering the creation of cartels, using as their pretext the structural surpluses and the need to balance supply and demand on the Community market in order to safeguard better prices."
"This pretext is a joke, because the liberalisation of imports from third countries of must and wine and the legalisation of the practice of mixing them with Community must and wine, together with the recognition of wine-making practices which use foreign materials in vinification, thereby converting wine from an agricultural to an industrial product, mean that imports of cheap wines are facilitated and quality is undermined."
"What is certain is that European vineyards will shrink, small and medium-sized wine-growers will be wiped out and imports will triumph."
"Moreover, the grubbing-up measure has been applied in the past, a decade ago."
"In Greece, over 200 000 decares were grubbed up."
"Surpluses were reduced temporarily, but the problem reappeared with mass imports and in fact resulted in the distillation of even high-class wines."
"However, thousands of small and medium-sized vineyards were wiped out."
"That is why the Commission proposal cannot constitute a basis for discussion, because it does not address the problem of wine-growing."
"Nor can I agree with today's report, because in essence it proposes a longer transitional period for the application of the new regulation, with certain amendments to the proposed measures in order to blunt the consequences."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, producers in other parts of the world have succeeded in making wines that are to the taste of European consumers as well as being cheaper than European wine."
"According to the rapporteur, we must counteract this state of affairs by pumping more money into agricultural policy, at the same time as implementing various types of campaign."
"There is no doubt that Europe produces some terrific wines."
"The interesting question in terms of principle is that of whether poorer countries are to be allowed to be squeezed out in order to favour European wine production."
"Certainly, the New World consists not only of economic giants such as the United States and Australia but also of recently industrialised countries such as South Africa, Chile and Argentina, where the wines are often produced in poor, neglected areas."
"The social safety nets to be found in the EU Member States do not exist in the same way in the aforesaid countries."
"If wine production in these areas were to be impeded, there would be major repercussions for the populations."
"It is important to take an overall view, and thus also to adopt a public health perspective, when debating this issue."
"In the long run, the protectionist features of this report would be to the disadvantage of both the EU's and the New World's wine producers."
"When all is said and done, wine is an alcoholic drink, and the EU should not, therefore, sponsor campaigns that encourage more wine drinking."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, since 22 July 1993, the date of the first draft reforms of the wine sector, we have been told that we need to grub up our vines, with figures to support it."
"In 1993, for example, we were told that consumption in 2000 would fall to 115 million hectolitres, but in fact it was 127 million - the Commission was out by 12 million."
"We are also told that there is overproduction, but where?"
"On the global market in potable alcohol. there was a shortage of 9 million hectolitres in 2002 and 11 million in 2003."
"And we know full well that the time has come for wine producers in China, in particular, where Chairman Mao said 'let the people drink wine'."
"So what is lurking behind these reforms on free plantation, the addition of sugar, distillation, infusions of wood chippings, imports of grape must and, of course, grubbing up?"
"In reality, the Commission is pursuing two aims with this grubbing up of 400 000 hectares, the most violent episode in the global history of wine, because we have to go back to the Emperor Domitian in 92 to find an equivalent: first of all, abandoning our exports of wine to the southern hemisphere by 2015, in exchange for its services market; and secondly for the pensioners of northern Europe to settle gradually in southern Europe."
"Europe therefore needs a land reserve, and that reserve can be found in the 400 000 hectares that will be grubbed up and replaced by houses - four million houses on four billion square metres, with a turnover of a thousand billion euro."
"It is this, this land grabbing, that is the true tragedy, because wine is not just a common market organisation: it is more than agriculture, and even more than culture, despite the painters, the 275 poets of wine, and the structures of the 5 000 wine-producing villages of Europe - wine is the interface with the divine."
"At the wedding in Cana, Jesus' first miracle was to turn water not into whisky and coke, or into Nokia mobile phones, but into wine."
"Abandoning that, therefore, is not like abandoning New Zealand's sheep or Brazil's chickens - it is abandoning Europe's identity."
"That, Commissioner, is why you must hold fast to wine, which the Argentinean Jorge Luis Borges called the deep patriarchal river that flows through the history of the world."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my fellow Member, Mrs Batzeli, for the work she has done, as well as Commissioner Fischer Boel, for the listening abilities that she displayed during the communication."
"We hope that the legislative proposal to be put before us will be consistent with the many wishes expressed both by Parliament and by European producers. The challenge is a very important one: to place European viticulture in a position to renew the vigour of the market, to regain competitiveness and, above all, to allow our wines to compete with non-EU countries, by reconquering old markets and also acquiring new ones."
"Some proposals do not convince us at all, Mrs Fischer Boel, and, above all, the keystone of the reform cannot be definitive grubbing-up."
"This step would translate into a wholesale and uncontrolled abandon of difficult holdings which, as well as having a productive function, also play a part in protecting the environment and the countryside."
"Grubbing up, then, just as new producer states are planting, would mean handing over large new slices of the market to them."
"It is a question of making a choice of spheres, and our choice can only be that of high-quality wine, not a so-so beverage."
"In promoting our wines we must promote our traditions, our land, our culture, our added value, and the expression of a great historical and cultural heritage."
"For this reason, I am not at all convinced by the proposal to allow the use of imported musts to enrich our wines or blending them with the wines of non-EU countries. Even less am I convinced by the idea of indicating on the label the vintage of the species in the wines without any geographical indication, making it possible to use varieties linked to the territory and, above all, running a major risk of misleading consumers."
"On the subject of liberalisation we should, instead, protect the efforts and the investments made by the winemakers, promote our geographical designations internationally and prevent them from being devalued economically."
"There are two words that we should remember: flexibility and market-orientation."
"'Flexibility', though, does not mean sudden, total and indiscriminate abolition of all the current management measures."
"In addition, Mrs Fischer Boel, I believe that resources should be distributed on the basis of historical criteria, namely in line with the same criterion used for all the other reforms adopted to date."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Batzeli report on the CMO in wine is a preparatory stage in a dialogue that will lead us to the legislative report, and therefore to final decisions within the course of this year."
"I do, however, think that it would be a good idea for Parliament to take decisions on some of the proposal's main conclusions, and this should certainly include grubbing-up."
"Like others of my fellow Members, I disagree with this proposal if seen as the only and exclusive option for rebalancing the market."
"We must compete with each other on the world market, and the strength of European wine lies in emphasising quality and traditional practices, and also in its connection to the land and age-old practices that are used in this sphere."
"To this end, I am also opposed to the importation of musts: as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we have tabled an amendment on this point."
"I think that dialogue, including today's exchanges, will lead to positive results - including during transitional periods - against measures that, like distillation, if abolished immediately would pull away the safety net for many winemakers."
"I think that if we listen to each other we will be able to retain European wine production on the world stage."
"(FR) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a few months ago now since we were taken by surprise by the agreement on wine concluded with the United States, on which we had to call for an urgent debate and which already contained some of the bad ingredients of the reform you are proposing today: weakening of the European criteria for wine quality, confusion over geographical indications and designations of origin, acceptance of highly questionable oenological practices, greater opening of the market, which will benefit standardised products that are thought to be to the taste of the equally standardised world consumer."
"Undoubtedly merchants and exporters will benefit, but the development of products with intimate cultural links to their local area certainly will not; neither will the diversity and the very rich flavours of European wines, nor the consumer, who will soon be forced to swill concoctions that hardly deserve to be called wine, and certainly not the winegrowers who work hard, sometimes in difficult regions and on small areas, to maintain a high quality of wine and the pleasure of drinking it."
"Alright, let us put an end to the most absurd mechanisms that encourage overproduction and have too many perverse effects, but please, Commissioner, fight with us and put in place the resources to promote quality wines, to make the most of the variety of flavours and territories, to preserve the soil and biodiversity and to tell the whole world about the wonderful alchemy of European wine that has existed for over 2 000 years."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the figures speak for themselves: in recent years Europe has seen its production decrease, while other countries outside Europe are witnessing a constant increase in their production shares."
"Today, in launching a reform of the CMO in wine, Europe must take account of the fact that approximately 3 400 000 hectares and 3 000 000 workers are involved."
"Looking to grubbing-up as a tool for market balance means going along the route of previous changes to the CMOs in tobacco and sugar."
"We cannot continue along this path, which results in falls in employment levels and the abandonment of entire agricultural territories, often located in fragile areas from the viewpoint of hydrogeological capacity."
"Any reform must thus take account, above all, of businesses, workers and environmental conditions, and it is only by protecting and maintaining a European agricultural system of production that we will be able to ensure quality and security for consumers."
"Of course, the efforts made by the rapporteur, Mrs Batzeli, have brought about an improvement with respect to the Commissioner's positions."
"Despite this, I believe that there are still points of concern."
"Above all, we must abandon the grubbing-up scenario and use the crop reconversion levy for those holdings with market difficulties, to achieve high-quality production."
"As the latest European export data show, we need to place the accent on quality and, as a result, production that should identify itself with the land and with our traditions."
"This is the road that we need to go down, not that of changing wine into an ordinary industrial product."
"It follows from this that we should not add sugar as a way of enriching wine, and that we need to lay down precise rules on vinification."
"On this point, the use of musts of European origin for enrichment should not be penalised, since this is a traditional practice in European winemaking and is not detrimental to the quality of the wine itself."
"For this reason, it is important to retain support for funding musts."
"In the final analysis, it is essential for any reform to take into account the climate changes currently occurring, which will have dramatic consequences in some areas in southern Europe, throwing their agricultural systems into confusion."
"Now is the time for Europe to defend its land, its civilisation and its traditions."
"(ES) Wine is not manufactured, it is developed and nurtured."
"There is a subtle difference, but an important one, because it says a lot about the person who is talking and about their point of view and their sensitivity towards the sector."
"The European wine-making sector has problems."
"The fundamental problem that it is facing at the moment is the difficulty created by the increase in internal demand, because consumption is still increasing at international level."
"That problem must be resolved, however, and in resolving it, account must be taken of its many implications, because the European sector is facing increasing imports."
"The problem is not therefore what we produce, but the price at which we sell it."
"Why do we sell at different prices?"
"Essentially because European producers do not have to meet the same requirements as third-country producers, but rather they have to face many more, and they are not therefore competing under equal conditions."
"We must make the sector competitive, not by tearing up 400 000 hectares of vines, but by controlling; not by liberalising indiscriminately, but rather by controlling, promoting and safeguarding the culture, tradition and quality of European wines, because wine is not manufactured, it is nurtured and developed."
"We must therefore support that culture and promote knowledge amongst consumers about which wine they are consuming and when a wine is a vino de crianza or a vino de reserva, a gran reserva, a table wine, a vino de la tierra, a vino de aÃ±ada or however we wish to describe it."
"We must improve and supplement all of the qualities of wine, controlling wine-making practices, promoting responsible consumption and above all researching, developing and innovating."
"Not by manufacturing, but rather by developing the wine within a culture, a tradition and a quality which represents European wines, respecting our traditions and, above all, increasing demands in order to harmonise quality upwards, and never downwards."
"We therefore hope that the Commission's proposal will at least show leadership and imagination and genuinely guarantee that the sector is competitive."
"(PT) I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Batzeli on her outstanding work in difficult circumstances and to thank Mrs Fischer Boel once again for being here in the Chamber."
"All of the political debates, the hearings, the meetings with representatives from the sector, the visits we have made to the winemaking areas of various Member States and the hundreds of amendments are ample evidence of the interest that the Members have in analysing this important issue for European agriculture."
"There is consensus on the need for reform and it is right to point out that no alternatives to the Commission's original model have been put forward."
"There are, however, major differences between Parliament and the Commission as regards the timetable, the intensity and the manner of the implementation of the main measures."
"It is certainly necessary to grub up poor-quality vines, but this must happen with illegal vines first. Furthermore, it is vital that the final decision on grubbing up should rest with the Member States."
"It is certainly necessary to put an end to subsidised distillation, but it is essential to safeguard support for potable alcohol distillation; fortified wines, which are so important to European exports, need such support."
"It makes no sense to promote the authenticity and tradition of European wines whilst at the same time advocating the free entry of concentrated must from third countries."
"This report is indicative of Parliament's good faith and commitment."
"I trust that the Commission will welcome our proposals so that we can implement satisfactory reforms in the sector."
"(PT) As Mrs Fischer Boel's speech confirmed, the main purpose of her intended reform of the common organisation of the market in wine is to use the grubbing up of vines as a means of balancing the winemaking market."
"This means that the least developed regions and in particular family farms and farmers on low incomes would be worst affected, which would have a disastrous social environmental effect and would lead to the increased desertification and, in turn, abandonment of rural areas."
"For vast areas of countries of the South, in countries such as Portugal, the consequences could be disastrous, on a par with the tragedy of the summer forest fires."
"We therefore place the emphasis on protecting vine and wine cultivation, which has played a central role in European, and in particular Mediterranean, civilisation."
"We want to see our farmers producing better and better wine and maintaining potable alcohol distillation."
"We are opposed to the downplaying of producing wine from grapes, replacing it with industrial wine resulting from the import of must from third countries."
"Commissioner, our high-quality wines must be defended."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, as our Council President, Angela Merkel, said in her speech in this House on 17 January, 'what distinguishes Europe, that which constitutes its soul, is the way we handle our diversity' and 'Europe's soul is tolerance'."
"In recent weeks and months, we have held many discussions on the proposals for reforming the market in wine."
"North and south, the individual wine-growing regions - a wide variety of opinions and interests have been represented."
"Each of us believes that, if we could have written the Batzeli report ourselves, we would have done it differently, made it more specific, more succinct."
"Nevertheless, we have managed to moderate all interests so that everyone can support them."
"It is a compromise, then, which not only tolerates but also respects the diversity of the European wine sector, and develops it further - albeit in small steps."
"The Commissioner has taken the trouble to visit many wine-producing regions in recent months, and for that I am obliged to her."
"She has seen how different the regions are."
"In the field of wine, in particular, we need more scope to determine things at national and regional level. We also need national budgets under the first pillar, on the basis of which the appropriate measures can be selected from an EU catalogue of measures for wine in the regions and subsequently implemented."
"We agree that we do not want to give up, we do not want to grub up 400 000 hectares."
"We want to fight for market shares, for our jobs, our cultural landscape, the European lifestyle."
"Wine is part of Europe and we must maintain its traditions and thus also long-established oenological practices."
"Our competitors around the world are waiting in the wings to supply what we no longer produce."
"There is one thing the discussion has made clear, and that is that Rome was not built in a day: we need staying power."
"Our policies need to be reliable."
"In the long term, however, our measures must be adapted in response to the market."
"(FR) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our work has not been in vain."
"I would like first of all to thank Mrs Batzeli for her report, which makes far-reaching and very positive amendments to the excessively liberal proposals the Commission presented last summer."
"Indeed, we need to send a strong message to the entire wine sector, which is in serious crisis."
"We know that the drop in consumption in Europe combined with increasing imports from third countries has resulted in falling prices and falling incomes for wine growers and that only a policy of proactive regulation, not all-out liberalisation, will get us out of the crisis."
"We want to promote quality winegrowing that respects the nature and traditions of our winegrowing areas and the diversity of holdings, especially family holdings."
"The massive indiscriminate grubbing-up of 400 000 hectares, seen as a structural solution, must be clearly ruled out."
"Planting rights must be preserved, but at the same time controls must be stepped up to prevent illegal planting."
"The assignment of new rights recorded in the adjusted vineyard register must benefit young producers of quality wines most of all."
"Trade organisations play a major part in the sector's competitiveness and they should be strengthened through national operational programmes."
"Finally, the promotion of sensible wine consumption together with a dynamic export policy, including simplified labelling, will require a real allocation of substantial budget resources."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, we are on the point of approving the report on the Commission communication on the common organisation of the market in wine together with a series of amendments."
"What is the basic message we want to give the Commission:"
"firstly, no to uncontrolled grubbing up which can wipe out valuable production areas producing valuable quality wines;"
"secondly, certain intervention measures - and I refer here to distillation - designed to balance the market and indirectly support producers' incomes should be maintained;"
"thirdly, national envelopes should be created containing various actions from which the Member States can choose."
"However, in order for these envelopes to be effective, they must have adequate funding;"
"fourthly, we will of course need to avoid transferring resources from the first to the second pillar as this would, in essence, weaken the COM."
"We need to turn our attention to drastic solutions, of which I would mention two:"
"firstly, above all we must seek to maintain high quality Community wine production."
"This we can rely on;"
"secondly and more seriously, we need to aim for more intensive promotion of Community wines."
"Market shares do not increase by wishful thinking."
"Only an aggressive policy can achieve an increase in consumption inside and outside the European Union."
"Clearly there are different opinions on various issues in the communication, such as, for example, wine enrichment."
"For us - for me - wine produced by adding sugar and water does not qualify as wine."
"Wine is a grape product, not a sugar beet product."
"I know that the addition of sugar will be decided."
"If the addition of sugar is decided, then it must be stated on the label."
"We must be honest and protect both consumers and producers."
"(PL) Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate you on your election and on chairing this debate, and to thank you on behalf of all of us for your great patience in allowing us to exceed the time limit, which was necessary for all our sakes."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Batzeli, for all the work she had done in recent months preparing her report on reform of the wine sector and the excellent way in which work on this document was coordinated in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I agree with the need for fundamental reform of the common organisation of the market in wine, and for adjustment of the structure of wine production to ensure the European wine sector is competitive and balanced."
"Action must be taken to encourage a balance on the market as soon as possible, because lack of such a balance will swallow up increasing amounts of EU budget resources."
"I would like to draw your attention to the need to support the development of rural areas in regions where wine-making, although insignificant in the context of the Community as a whole, is important for local tourism and diversification of farming in rural areas."
"These areas will all be equally affected by the reforms."
"We therefore need to adopt solutions to reform the market in wine which will not put undue economic restrictions on wine-growing at a local scale."
"Local innovation in wine-growing in rural areas of the new Member States, furthermore, is not directly related to the European wine market, and therefore does not need regulation on strict market principles."
"These regions have never created costly wine lakes, and any actions aiming to limit future over-production should not therefore apply to areas with a low level of wine production."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, the lack of an agreed compromise before this report was adopted has led to a series of errors and contradictions which I hope will be resolved in the vote in this plenary."
"Of these errors, I would like to point to the one contained in paragraph 18, relating to the distillation of by-products, which requests that the alcohol obtained by means of this kind of distillation be directed, at least in part, to the potable alcohol market."
"This demonstrates a lack of knowledge of the different kinds of distillation and of alcohols produced by them, since potable alcohol, intended exclusively for the production of brandies, ports and liqueurs, is a high-quality product, something that can in no way be achieved by means of alcohol from the distillation of by-products."
"For all of these reasons, I believe that we must vote against this paragraph in order to prevent any more confusion in relation to types of distillation and the alcohols produced by them."
"Secondly, I would like to stress something that is crucial to any COM reform: the budgetary aspects."
"To date, all COM reforms have employed a distribution of funds based on an historical criterion."
"Surprisingly, in the case of the wine reform, the intention is to change to other formulae, which are not yet very clear, but which are creating great uncertainty in the sector."
"In order to provide Mrs Batzeli's report with more clarity, therefore, I also propose that we vote for the amendments on employing the historical criterion for the distribution of the funds."
"(HU) Dear Mrs Fischer Boel, believe me, we also want reform: thoroughgoing and radical reform, and in this regard the Commission and the European Parliament should be allies."
"Where we disagree with the Commissioner is that we do not wish to give as much weight to grubbing-up, as all parties are in agreement that changes in structure and modernisation are at least as important as grubbing-up."
"I would like to draw the attention of the Commissioner that there is great danger for the new Member States that poor winegrowers will grub up too much, thereby only adding to the problems of the new Member States."
"That is why all payments must be made into the national envelope, and I wish to congratulate the Commissioner for this, because a national envelope can mean the future not only for wine but for the entire common agricultural policy: let us define the limits and then put it into the national envelope, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"This is an excellent solution, but our grounds for determining the national envelopes is problematic, Commissioner, if it is true that we are to base them 20% on territorial and 80% on historical references."
"This would be serious discrimination against new Member States."
"Consequently, for the new Member States only a distribution of the national envelope on the basis of territory would be acceptable, if this information is correct - I hope it is not."
"On the fifth aspect, that of distillation, you are right: it has to be stopped completely."
"Finally, in connection with rural development, we should make it possible to use additional rural development funds for the development of wine regions, beyond those budgeted for the winemaking sector."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, it gives me great satisfaction to note that the women are setting the tone for this debate."
"Unfortunately, this report has been ill-fated from the outset."
"It is true that it has improved a little. Nevertheless, in my view, it is still much too confusing to send the desired clear signal to the Commission and make this institution, too, realise that things are not as bad as they seem in its Communication."
"I shall be supporting those parts of the report that continue to regard a specific market organisation for wine as indispensable."
"In my view, however, it is nothing short of a provocation that the Commission is now devoting its attention superficially to proposals for a single market organisation for all agricultural products, whilst here we have been racking our brains for months over the reform of the common organisation of the markets in wine, fruit and vegetables."
"How seriously does the Commission really take us?"
"What does it have at the back of its mind?"
"Regarding the organisation of the CMO for wine, we need the funding to be under the first pillar."
"We need better use of funds to enable us to maintain and improve our production potential, regain old markets and conquer new ones, and promote moderate, healthy wine consumption."
"We need more subsidiarity and greater responsibility for the profession, so that funds can be spent more selectively at regional level."
"Nevertheless, when it comes to allocating national funding, the regions that have made the least effort to produce and market good-quality wine should not be rewarded once more, on the basis of 'historical criteria', for ploughing hundreds of millions of euro into the distillation of unmarketable wine."
"That is unacceptable."
"It is also unthinkable that northern regions, which have marketed their quality wines without European funding, should be forbidden from producing their wines according to traditional methods."
"This is no solution to the structural problems in the regions that have slept through structural reforms on a bed of their distillation millions."
"Europe does not in fact have a structural surplus of wine, but instead has a surplus corresponding exactly to the quantities planted illegally."
"If vintners want to give up their business early, they should be able to do so and the social effects should be cushioned, but they should do so without causing irreparable environmental damage by grubbing-up within the boundaries of quality-wine production."
"It must be possible to compete for markets worldwide on fair competitive terms."
"European wines should not be produced using water from Europe, or must imported from third countries."
"Blending European and imported wines is also out of the question."
"What was the Commission thinking?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(NL) Madam President, I would like to try a different approach."
"It would be short-sighted to think that, in this age of globalisation, European policy only impacted on our own citizens."
"If Europe changes policy with regard to its wine sector, then this will affect very many other people outside of Europe, people whose incomes will suffer as a result of unfair competition from the European wine sector."
"This is why it is necessary to integrate policy in different areas."
"The Commission proposals to reform the wine sector are a step in the right direction."
"As the Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Development and as a Social-Democrat, I am deeply disappointed that the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has overlooked European development policy and fair trade."
"According to the report, it is necessary to keep the wine sector out of the negotiations in the world trade round."
"After all, according to the report, the difficulties in the wine sector are caused by ever greater imports from third countries."
"Meanwhile, the Commission has to take all kinds of measures to protect our wine sector."
"Why would we in developing countries take away with one hand what we give them with European development policy?"
"Why would we want to shut our markets to fair competition?"
"Why not let the customer decide what wine they want to drink, whether this is a French Bordeaux, a South African Chardonnay or a Chilean Merlot?"
"Fair trade with other countries does not rule out a competitive European wine sector, but protectionist wine policy does, however, exclude tens of thousands of people who depend on a fair wine trade with Europe for their daily crust."
"This is why I am happy to drink a glass of South African 'Groot geluk' when I say 'To consistent European policy; the Commission receives my support."
"Cheers!'"
"(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, The market in wine has in recent years struggled with surpluses, which the current policy on the common market in wine has been unable to resolve satisfactorily."
"The support for wine distillation, for example, is in my view a pointless waste of limited resources."
"The reformed market in wine today does not encourage producers of inferior quality table wines to move towards producing higher quality wine."
"This is why it is so important to reform the market."
"What is needed is a substantial boost to the competitiveness of the European wine sector."
"In this context, Mrs Batzeli's report offers many suggestions, and I, for one, feel it is a very well balanced report."
"The key area on which we must focus our attention is budgetary reform."
"Support must be proportionate to the area of land being used for wine cultivation, and to the value of wine production."
"Funding should not be provided for the grubbing up of vineyards found to be in breach of the acquis."
"The export payments for table wine are completely unsystematic and certainly do not help enhance the good name of European wine."
"Ladies and gentlemen, last but not least, we must understand that if we care about supporting the competitiveness of European products, we cannot persecute European producers."
"The geographical conditions in countries of the north are diametrically opposed to those in the south."
"Sweetening sugar beet is as much of a tradition in northern countries, as is acidifying wine in southern countries."
"Banning it would spell the end for many good families of winemakers in our countries, disrupting traditions and consequently also disrupting the solutions to problems of rural production."
"Thank you for your attention."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, European winegrowing needs an ambitious reform."
"As you will have gathered, we want that reform to respect the European winegrowing tradition and to respect the men and women who work in that sector."
"I would however like to draw your attention to the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, which is included in Mrs Batzeli's report."
"The reform of the common organisation of the market in wine must in fact take account of the commercial stakes."
"Europe remains the world's largest exporter of wine and while it is necessary to make it more competitive in the face of growing competition from New World wines, the vitality of this sector's exports rests above all on a quality and authenticity that are acknowledged the world over."
"We therefore need an offensive commercial policy to promote the quality of European wines."
"It would therefore be absurd, and counterproductive, for example, to authorise the vinification of imported must and the blending of European wines with wines from elsewhere."
"The European Parliament's report is therefore strongly against that."
"Likewise, it is necessary to secure better protection of protected geographical indications (PGI) and protected designations of origin (PDO) within the framework of the WTO negotiations and bilateral agreements."
"We want to defend wine production linked to local areas against wines that are largely unregulated."
"I hope, Commissioner, that the European Commission will respect the opinions which appear in Mrs Batzeli's report, and I pay tribute to her and congratulate her this evening."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we know that the reform that we are seeking to implement must be an appropriate response to the challenge of the competitiveness of the European wine market worldwide."
"We agree that Europe can only meet this challenge if it preserves and improves the quality of its wine, by enhancing its individuality."
"Not all the answers that we have found, however, fully correspond to this final aim."
"So we can say that the text adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is the best possible text, but it nonetheless requires further modifications."
"It is therefore right to carry out prudent reform, in stages, that is properly managed, based on the principle of subsidiarity with a view to respecting individual national and regional features."
"For all these reasons, agricultural funding should be kept under the first pillar: we need to implement educational campaigns to promote responsible consumption; to retain distillation measures, at least for now, as a security net for producers; to permit the Member States to restrict the grubbing-up of vines on the basis of rigid environmental and social criteria, giving preference to the protection of small, high-quality production."
"As for retaining the rules in force on practices permitted for vinification, sugar enrichment and musts, I would say that the strenuous defence of these practices by some national delegations raises the problem of national interests as compared with those of the Union as a whole and points to the need to strengthen the concept of a united Europe, avoiding the market distortions involved in excessive nationalism."
"If what is at stake is improving the competitiveness of European wines, the proposal to support the practice of adding saccharose and of using musts runs counter to this, because the use of such additives lowers quality and reduces differences, whereas these are, in fact, the best expressions of wine cultivation."
"Perhaps we might have made a better effort on this aspect, by posing the question of Community interests and by asking, as I am doing, for all the EU countries - without exception - to agree that it is inappropriate and politically incorrect to place national interests before European interests and that it is vital to find a fair balance between these requirements."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like first of all to congratulate Mrs Batzeli, the rapporteur, who, as we have heard, expresses a point of view widely shared in this Chamber."
"Let us say it one more time, the Commission's proposals are not acceptable as they stand."
"Far be it from us to deny there is a problem;"
"European consumption is falling, our exports are stagnant, but at the same time our wine imports are rising."
"The Commission's response to this is to propose a massive grubbing-up plan that really means the scrap heap for our winegrowers."
"We are told there is overproduction; alright, but refusing to act on imports is to use European production as the market 'safety valve'."
"That is unacceptable."
"We can only agree to grubbing-up vines if it is based on a voluntary approach, which means substantial financial compensation, and if we introduce the idea of temporary grubbing-up."
"My second point is that the reduction in the budget for the common organisation of the market in wine is not acceptable either."
"The Commission mentions the possibility of transferring some of the budget to rural development."
"But without wishing to call into question the very principle of a specific common market organisation for wine, I find it hard to see how the already low level of credits can be reduced, especially when we have just welcomed two new States, which are themselves producers."
"As several of us have said, we are therefore against a transfer, any transfer, of credits from the first to the second pillar of the CAP."
"My third point, with which I shall conclude, is that, for our part, we really believe that European winegrowing has a future."
"We do not believe that the time of the winegrowers is passed."
"The future does not lie in the concentration of holdings as the massive grubbing-up plan suggests."
"We must build that future by making our wines more competitive, especially abroad."
"That is why we think that the first priority for a reform of the common organisation of the market in wine should be to make our wines more attractive through a major plan to promote and market them in the world."
"I was glad to hear you say as much just now, Commissioner; we now want to see action."
"(EL) Madam President, I should like to warmly congratulate my honourable friend Mrs Batzeli on her excellent work and express my satisfaction, because this report was undertaken by our honourable Member from Greece, which has a history of wine-growing going back centuries."
"Wine, as an agricultural product, has always held centre stage in our life, in our customs, in our traditions, in our history, in our joy and in our sadness."
"In other words, it is an integral part of our civilisation."
"It is therefore a very positive thing that this report reflects to a large degree the views of the Greek wine-growing sector."
"At the same time, Mrs Batzeli's report constitutes a clear stand by the European Parliament in light of the new common organisation of the wine market planned by the Commission and sets caution and logic against what are in my view the Commission's hasty and simplified initial thoughts."
"I would ask that we vote for the report as it stands."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join in thanking the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs for their work."
"This is the third reform of the wine sector in 12 years, and I am glad that a Commission Communication has now made it possible to reconcile the very different positions and objectives."
"The reason our points of view started out so divergent is that wine is a very emotional subject. I always say that wine is among the most elegant of agricultural products."
"This divergence is also evidenced by the tabling of almost 600 amendments."
"In my opinion, a great deal of this report can be seen in a very positive light."
"It contains many compromises."
"I should like to emphasise in particular that traditional oenological practices really have been taken into account."
"It must be made quite clear, however, that there is no option whatsoever for duplicate compensation or support for the regions, as we could not justify that to the European taxpayer."
"One problem remains that is of significance to Austria."
"Proper account has yet to be taken of the issue of the labelling of table wines."
"At all events, we want to see table wines labelled differently from quality wines."
"There must be a clear distinction for consumers."
"Finally, I would ask the Commissioner to read this own-initiative report carefully."
"I am convinced that she and all her staff will do so."
"It contains some good proposals, which the Commission will hopefully incorporate into its proposal on the new common organisation of the market in wine that it is due to present to us in the summer."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I would just like to touch on some of the major issues that have been raised by many of you in this very important debate."
"Grubbing-up was mentioned by almost all of you."
"I am not quite sure that you listened carefully to what I said in my introduction, namely that we need to ensure that grubbing-up does not disrupt important and legitimate social and environmental concerns."
"Listen carefully, and I will take this into consideration when we make the legal proposals."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said very clearly that grubbing-up should not be forced upon our winegrowers."
"Exactly."
"It should not be, because the decision on grubbing-up is one for winegrowers and winegrowers alone to take."
"It is not a decision for the Member States or for the Commission, but exclusively for the winegrowers."
"But we should not force those growers that are today struggling to be successful in winegrowing to remain in a business where they cannot make money year after year."
"So let us give them a possibility to leave the sector in a decent way."
"On distillation, I have yet to meet anyone willing to tell me, off the record, that crisis distillation could ever make good sense."
"On the contrary, I think it gives our citizens an excuse to portray the common agricultural policy in the most negative way, referring to the old-fashioned methods and tools that we used in previous times."
"We cannot defend spending half a billion euros every year on getting rid of wine that nobody wants to drink."
"This does not work and I hope you will support me on this."
"Therefore, we need promotion."
"It is something that the European Parliament has stressed over and again and I am prepared to make a push on this."
"But promotion at European level must not be a cushion for the wine sector."
"The wine sector itself also needs to be much more aggressive."
"In Ireland we have seen the consumption of wine increasing."
"And today 70% of the wine consumed in Ireland is imported from outside the European Union."
"Therefore, I simply did not understand why at the recent World Ploughing Championships in Ireland, which attracted 250 000 visitors, only two wine producers were present, neither of them from Europe. I can only ask why."
"On imported must for vinification, I have said clearly from the beginning that we have to put everything on the table and I have taken note of the reactions from the European Parliament, from different Member States and from stakeholders."
"Christa KlaÃ mentioned that there are huge differences within the different regions."
"I have been able to see this for myself and therefore I think we have to stress the importance of the idea of national envelopes in the Commission communication."
"I think it is an excellent possibility for Member States and for regions to allocate the different tools and the money as part of a national envelope completely tailor-made for the different regions."
"I think this is crucial."
"Quite a lot of you stressed that we need to base our future in the wine sector on quality, quality and quality, and I can totally endorse that."
"I am looking forward to holding discussions with you in the future on the wine reform that I will present to the Council, hopefully just before the summer break, and then I will be happy to come here to the European Parliament to present it at the same time, as the basis for our future discussions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (SK) The EU wine sector produces some of the world's finest wines and has enormous potential which must be further developed in a sustainable manner."
"The constant growth of the market in China, which is now beginning to actively produce wine, together with increasing production in other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, the USA, Canada and South Africa, has resulted in wines from the 'New World' gaining a considerable market share at the expense of European wines."
"I agree with the Commission that supply and demand imbalances in the wine sector, and increasing challenges on European and international wine markets point to the need for reform in this sector as well."
"However, I completely disagree with some of the solutions proposed in the Commission's communication of 22 June 2006."
"The plans for a massive and indiscriminate grubbing-up of vineyards pose a particular threat to the environment, and constitute in my view an unjustified attack on Europe's wine heritage."
"Winegrowing, which primarily relies on natural resources, has a positive effect in terms of protecting soil against erosion."
"As the driving force of rural development, viniculture also holds out the promise of longed-for prosperity for many European regions."
"With their tradition of viticulture, Slovakia's regions have focused on promoting enotourism by tapping the potential of the Lesser Carpathian, KamenÃ­nska, HontianskÃ¡ and Tokaj Wine Routes, and they are now expecting CMO reform in the wine sector to secure the dynamic growth and competitiveness of the European wine sector by allocating adequate financial resources and, above all, through fostering innovation."
"I agree with the Commission on the importance of simplifying and harmonising the legislative measures and of making the European wine sector more competitive, at the same time as guaranteeing environmental sustainability."
"However, while, on the one hand, the support given to European farmers and the heavyweight agricultural budget need to be reduced gradually in favour of other policies, on the other hand, the EU needs to protect the fundamental sectors of its economy."
"The wine sector certainly counts among those, with an output that in 2005 yielded almost EUR 2 million, and which in Italy alone involves more than 2 500 000 businesses."
"It must not be totally abandoned to the rules of the free market: free competition could have a harmful effect on the quality and diversity of our production, which is mainly based on the activities of small businesses, which are unable to compete internationally."
"I also regret the attempt - which has sadly been carried through - by the countries of northern Europe to alter the conditions of competition within the EU by offering aid to those who use sucrose as a means of increasing the alcohol content of wine, without maintaining aid for the production of must, which is a common practice in Italy and in other Mediterranean countries and which guarantees that our production is of a better quality."
"Radio Spectrum (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Hall, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, entitled 'Towards a European policy on the radio spectrum'."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, firstly I would like to thank all the people who shared their knowledge and expertise with me when I was preparing this report."
"I would particularly like to thank the Commission for its generous help, as well as my colleagues, the shadows from the other groups, for their very constructive and cooperative suggestions."
"The basic theme of the report is that the current method of managing radio spectrum is no longer adequate in the face of constantly emerging new technologies."
"These new technologies need to make use of radio spectrum, but the quantity of radio spectrum will always be limited simply by the laws of physics, so we have to find ways of making sure that this precious resource is used as efficiently as possible."
"Policy on radio spectrum may sound like an obscure matter of no interest to the citizen on the street, but the end result of that policy is of fundamental interest because it is a question of jobs and economic growth."
"If we fail to reform our approach to radio spectrum, we are failing European industry, which is poised to become a global leader in communications technology."
"All the innovation that the industry is coming forward with will fail to develop properly if no spectrum is available and if the industry is blocked from operating across the European market of 500 million people."
"The Lisbon Agenda is the driving force behind the new approach to spectrum."
"But there is also the need for Europe to be forward looking in the way it makes services of public and general interest available."
"I will come back to that in a minute."
"First, I should like to say a few words about the changes proposed."
"At present, spectrum is managed on an administrative command and control model whereby certain frequencies are allocated to certain specific uses."
"The report argues that this administrative model needs to be supplemented now by a more flexible approach which would include more unlicensed use of spectrum and the tool of spectrum trading."
"An essential element of this more flexible approach is that spectrum should be made available without conditions being attached as to the service to be provided or the technology to be used."
"In other words, the market-based element of spectrum management would be service- and technology-neutral."
"This freeing-up of spectrum would clearly raise issues for existing users, such as the question of potential interference."
"It is therefore very important that the changes take place within a clear legal framework and with pre-established dispute resolution mechanisms."
"In several places, paragraphs 11, 13 and so on, the report emphasises the importance of maintaining services of public and general interest and supporting cultural and linguistic diversity."
"It is important not to get this political commitment mixed up with the technical issue of how such services ought to be delivered."
"I believe it would be a big mistake to ring-fence the frequencies currently used by broadcasting services by insisting on their exclusion from any new approach to spectrum management."
"That is because we would actually be damaging our ability to support a broad range of socially useful services if we insisted that the delivery mechanism for providing those services remained exactly the same, frozen in time at the very period when all other uses of spectrum are evolving very rapidly."
"To take one example, we face the challenge in the EU of stopping a rift opening up between the internet haves and the internet have-nots."
"One easy way to roll out internet access to the poorest regions of our poorest countries would be by way of wireless broadband, taking advantage of some of the broadcasting frequencies freed up by the switch from analogue to digital broadcasting, the digital dividend."
"I use this as just one example of why we need to affirm our commitment to services of public and general interest, but also as an example of why we must not treat the frequencies currently used by broadcasting as somehow untouchable."
"We need to make the most of opportunities to provide services in new ways by new technologies and to more people than at present."
"And it is vital to support the growth of a knowledge-based economy in Europe."
"So, it is important to open up the possibility of more flexible use across the whole of the radio spectrum without ruling out certain frequencies."
"Finally, I welcome the amendment tabled by the PSE Group, which serves as a balanced summary of the key issues at stake."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, I have to compliment the European Parliament, in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Hall, for realising the importance of the choices Europe is about to make with regard to radio spectrum policy."
"This is an area where political decisions have a direct impact on the quality of jobs and growth in the European economy."
"Services dependent on radio spectrum represent around 2 to 3% of Europe's GDP."
"There have been studies for the World Bank and for the OECD which clearly link the development of electronic communication services to economic growth."
"An econometric study made for the Commission tentatively associated better spectrum break relation with 0.1% of extra GDP growth per year."
"This would quickly cumulate to deliver real benefits."
"The urgency of the matter can be summed up in the word 'convergence'."
"Practically all communications are quickly becoming digital and there is an increasing number of infrastructures competing to carry services."
"The old categories are disappearing and we need to respond with a regulation that permits the spectrum users to choose the mix of services and technologies that they prefer and that in many cases permits them to buy and sell spectrum rights to each other."
"The reasons for regulation are still strong."
"We have to manage interference."
"We need to ensure that the rights to use spectrum are clearly defined and we need to ensure a level playing field."
"The report that we are debating tonight is in most aspects in line with this policy vision and I want to thank the rapporteur for her efforts."
"One area of divergence concerns including spectrum for terrestrial broadcasting distribution in the planned reforms."
"We are not questioning the importance of the television companies' public service function, nor their contribution to cultural and linguistic diversity."
"We should, however, think very carefully before we privilege one specific form of broadcasting distribution without regard to the costs to our society in terms of opportunity."
"A case in point: the report quite rightly highlights wireless broadband as a tool for rural development and for breaching the digital divide."
"This requires tough choices about the balance between broadcasting and other services."
"There are necessary decisions to be made to safeguard the resources and functioning of public service broadcasting, but we should not use spectrum policy as a substitute for real debate."
"The amendment gives a more balanced approach by mentioning the need to secure stability and security for media services and the importance of a level playing field for new entrants and new technologies."
"I have one final point to make: on the basis of the full analysis, the choice of the national regulators is to award spectrum to broadcasters."
"These users must also have the same obligation as any other users to be good stewards of a public resource and use it as effectively as possible."
"We think that our reform proposal would help to implement this principle."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Technological innovation opens up tangible new opportunities for Europe."
"Switching to digital technology leads to a surplus in what has till now been a scarcity in frequencies available."
"It is therefore appropriate and necessary to make it possible for a part of that surplus to be used for new technologies, thereby opening up a dynamic territory for the European information and communications industry."
"The regulation required for this purpose needs to be created in such a way that the traditional system, unlicensed use and frequency trading be part of an effective spectrum management."
"Clear rules are needed, which indicate what and how much we allow in the area of frequency trading."
"The opinion of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is that we need very soon to make spectrum trading itself, as well as its guiding conditions, perfectly clear."
"In this regard we must handle broadcast frequencies with particular care."
"It must be ensured that frequencies cannot be accumulated, and that there be no monopolies."
"We have to promote the spread of new technologies to less developed regions and rural areas, but in such a way that they not be made to bear the costs of this."
"It is the firm opinion of the Group of the European People's Party that in the process of regulating this area, we need to bear in mind social, cultural and political considerations, in order to advance the expression of cultural and linguistic diversity."
"In the process of drafting the report, I mentioned time and again the various specialties of the new Member States, which will have to be taken into account when regulations are drawn up."
"I was therefore pleased with Mrs Trautmann's initiative in this matter, and I support it."
"Finally, Member States need to open up frequencies for the purpose of Europe-wide technological harmonisation, and this must be done on the basis of a consensual agreement."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Hall, ladies and gentlemen, we are being asked to express an opinion on the reallocation of radio frequencies."
"This is a very important dossier and the Commission's reasons for wanting a proposal that seeks to optimise or maximise the benefits of this resource of course stem from changing technologies, the existence of the digital dividend and the desire, clearly expressed in the Lisbon objectives, to give everyone access to new services, be it the Internet, mobile telephony or many others besides."
"We have just spoken of broadband in particular, which could help to reduce the digital divide from which the European Union suffers, especially in rural and thinly populated areas."
"We must therefore seek to ensure a rational use of frequencies that will guarantee universal coverage in the 27 countries of the Union with a view to sustainable development of all areas."
"Frequencies are in fact a resource, a public good, common to us all and strategic for the Union, and we must ensure that the spectrum is used efficiently in the long term."
"Just as we speak of energy efficiency, I believe we can also speak of radio spectrum efficiency."
"I would like to welcome the Commission's attempts to give a new European dimension to the use of this digital dividend and avoid a repetition of the very real problem we had, and which the companies concerned saw as such, when the UMTS networks were put up for sale."
"It proposes the creation of a market."
"We have to be able to find a way of providing greater flexibility, avoiding speculation and monopolies and making frequencies accessible to new services and new entrants."
"I believe it is right to want to do so."
"We must find new opportunities for innovation there, but we must be careful how they are marketed, whether it be by licences, auctions or assignments, in particular of public or free-access services, even if on a temporary basis."
"These different approaches remain to be defined."
"In our committee we had a debate on the place of broadcasters and I would like to say here most emphatically that for my part I have always defended the special nature of the information programmes, the cultural programmes provided by broadcasters, especially public broadcasters, who do not have the private capital necessary to pay for access to the market on the same terms as, let us say, ordinary companies."
"Therefore, if we are to take account of this situation while being fair and impartial, that is why the Socialist Group has tabled an amendment seeking to take account of radio spectrum efficiency, the balance between respect for public broadcasts and respect for State broadcasts on safety, also the role of regulators and the role of business."
"Madam President, I shall be brief."
"From the point of view of my group, which welcomes the Commission's approach in principle, there are five important points."
"We want to ensure that the new approach proposed by the Commission does not result in the formation of oligopolies."
"Germany has had bad experiences with the auctioning of UMTS licences."
"Our group wants services ensuring diversity to take priority at all times."
"I agree with Mrs Trautmann that broadcasters should always enjoy particular respect for the job they do, for our societies and the public."
"We want to see technical neutrality and interoperability."
"We want to really see blanket coverage."
"This is important to the Commissioner, too, since she bears co-responsibility for rural affairs."
"We in rural areas do not want to be disadvantaged any more, and we, too, want access to high-speed Internet connections."
"In addition, the procedures for auctions should be fully transparent and comprehensible in future."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, I presume an answer would be expected from the Commission, but I promise I shall keep it short."
"I share the appreciation of Parliament regarding the vital role played by public service television and other media for democracy, diversity and for the encouragement for a public debate."
"It is necessary that future regulations continue to ensure that this programming can be distributed to the citizens in accordance with the public service obligations assumed by those broadcasters."
"However, assuming that these goals can be satisfied and keeping in mind the reality of convergence, we should carefully assess the need for the spectrum required to offer a public broadcasting service and to ensure its efficient use."
"In consequence, we need to provide broadcasters with the means and the flexibility to continue to develop their offer to the benefit of our society."
"We have listened carefully and your comments will be taken into account during the revision of the telecommunication regulation, which will be proposed by the second half of 2007."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."

"(The sitting was opened at 9 a.m.)"
"1."
"Transportation and illegal detention of prisoners (vote)"
"- Before the vote"
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, I should just like to inform the services that, due to an inconsistency with the report voted on in committee, points 114, 127 and 128 must be brought into line with the rest of the equivalent paragraphs."
"Therefore, if Amendment 228 is adopted, Amendments 234 and 235 must also be adopted."
"(FR) I quite understand that the House has decided to vote on the whole package of amendments."
"However, can someone explain to me what my group should do, in the case of a collective vote, to endorse some of the amendments and not to endorse others, or even to reject them?"
"What must we do in that case, Mr President?"
"Because, in the case in point, we want to endorse some of the amendments and vote against others."
"What do you propose, Mr President?"
"That is why the groups were asked in due course to submit requests for separate votes, which the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in particular, did do."
"The amendments that caused the most problems and on which the groups wanted to vote more precisely will thus be withdrawn from the collective vote and will be submitted to you a little later on."
"If your group has not requested separate votes on certain packages of amendments, that means, in principle, that they do not pose any problems."
"I do not want to re-open the debate on this subject."
"(Mr Guardans CambÃ³ insisted)"
"Everyone understood your position, and I hope that I have given you the most neutral technical explanation possible."
"You do not have the floor, Mr Guardans CambÃ³; you have already spoken twice."
"(Mr Guardans CambÃ³ continued to insist)"
"If you wish to request an additional separate vote, specify which one, and I will incorporate it."
"I would like a separate vote on Amendment 38."
"- Before the vote on paragraph 60"
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, the oral amendment aims at replacing a singular with a plural: the word 'document', relating to Italian cooperation, would become 'documents', and the rest of the paragraph would agree in the plural."
"(The oral amendment was accepted)"
"(IT) Mr President, I should just like to say that, following the adoption of this oral amendment, our group is withdrawing Amendment 261."
"- After the vote on paragraph 66"
"(FR) Mr President, I believe that it is in everybody's interest for the groups to vote as they have decided to do."
"The fact that the amendments of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group have been withdrawn from the voting list is currently causing confusion amongst many Members; they think that they are voting on the Union for Europe of the Nations Group's amendments when in fact the vote relates to the original paragraphs."
"I would therefore ask you to carry out an electronic verification of the vote on the original paragraph 66, and I would ask the honourable Members always to check whether the vote relates to the original or to the amendment."
"(NL) Mr President, what is making voting more than usually difficult is the fact that my headset is telling me that we are voting on 66, the screen is saying the same thing, and you are saying 68."
"We ought, I think, to be hearing the same thing from you as we are told by the screen and over the sound system."
"(Voting time was suspended at 12 noon to make way for the formal sitting, and resumed at 12.30 p.m.)"
"Voting time"
"The next item is voting time."
"(For details of the outcome of the votes, see Minutes)"
"Before starting the vote, I am going to give you some important information in this regard, particularly in relation to the vote on the Fava report."
"As you know, the Fava report, which we debated on Monday evening, is a report for which there are many amendments."
"I am used to chairing the vote, but I have never seen such a thick dossier for a single report."
"However, we might be able to speed things up."
"This has nothing to do with any foreign power intervening; the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is simply proposing that some collective votes be held in order to enable us to save at least half an hour."
"The problem is that this proposal arrived very late in the day and that your voting lists could not be adapted to incorporate it."
"Therefore, if you agree to some collective votes being held, you are going to have to pay very close attention to your voting lists."
"The layout itself of the list has not changed, we will follow the same order, but we will go a little bit quicker."
"I should like to know whether the House agrees with this proposal, which is going to save us some time."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Pirilli, I believe that you are going to present this proposal, on behalf of the UEN Group."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am making this proposal on behalf of my group and under Rule 155(6) of the Rules of Procedure: I propose a block vote on 122 amendments that are complementary to each other, in order to simplify procedure."
"In any case, these amendments are workable in relation to those that I propose should be put to the vote individually."
"Each of these in fact makes its own main point: from violation of State secrecy, to the security of European citizens and States, to the faked kidnapping of Abu Omar, a CIA spy, who was picked up to save him from certain death and not deported to GuantÃ¡namo, but sent back to his own country, where he lives under suitable protection and gives interviews."
"The amendments to be put to the vote separately are therefore the following: 71, 73, 113, 114, 115, 121, 122, 124, 210, 212, 213, 214 and 216."
"I also propose individual votes, amendment by amendment, from 38 to 69 and from 245 to 256."
"All the other 122 amendments can be put to the vote as a block."
"(DE) Mr President, much as I would like to make the vote a shorter business, I do have to point out that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has submitted to the Tabling Office a list of the votes that we want to split, and this list - which has also been endorsed by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group - must be followed in the voting process."
"Everything else can be voted on en bloc."
"We can agree to things being handled in this way, but, if they are not, we will have to take everything one thing at a time."
"I can confirm that the request by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has been passed on and that we will in fact hold some collective votes, except for the separate votes that you have requested and that have been incorporated in the announcements that I just made."
"Mr Guardans CambÃ³, you have the floor to speak on procedural issues only."
"(FR) As regards the procedure, I cannot accept the principle of collective votes on certain amendments without having first received the list in writing and without having a break so that I can study it."
"So, I am sorry, but there are blocks in which we want to keep some things and reject others."
"Every sentence in this report counts, Mr President."
"If we had known about this proposal beforehand, we could have gone ahead with it."
"However, we have a list of votes that is calibrated virtually to the last centimetre, and our group is not going to risk an erroneous vote just for the sake of saving five or ten minutes."
"I am sorry."
"The comment made by our fellow Member is entirely valid."
"That is why it is the House that is going to decide."
"I am therefore going to give you a first option to vote on: to accept the Union for Europe of the Nations Group's proposal, which would enable us to hold collective votes while keeping the separate votes that were requested by certain groups."
"(The House indicated its agreement to the proposal)"
"I would also point out that we will be taking a break at around midday in order to welcome a prestigious guest, the President of the Italian Republic."
"In view of the thickness of the dossier, we will probably break during the vote on the Fava report."
"I would ask you right now to kindly excuse the services, but we have no other option."
"(IT) Mr President, so as not to interrupt the vote on the Fava report, which as we all know will be a complex vote, I should like to ask whether it might be possible, if the House agrees, to invert the order of business and thus vote first on the simpler and briefer reports and go on to vote on the Fava report after President Napolitano's speech."
"It is clear, Mrs Muscardini, that if we do not start with the Fava report, we will not conclude it today, which means having to interrupt the vote on the Fava report in order to conclude it the day after, which I believe would be even more disastrous."
"You will understand why I cannot act on your request."
"Let us try to proceed allegro vivace, ma non troppo."
"Formal sitting - Italy"
"President of the Italian Republic. - (IT) Mr President, I am sincerely grateful for your kind words of friendship towards me and towards Italy."
"They reflect the feelings and the efforts that we shared during the period when we worked most closely together."
"Above all, we collaborated in our respective roles in producing the Constitutional Treaty, for which you now reiterate your staunch support."
"Allow me, then, to offer you my sincere compliments in return, and my very best wishes at the start of your important mandate."
"Mr Poettering, Vice-President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on coming back to this Chamber I have the same feeling of belonging that inspired me throughout the years that I spent in the European Parliament: belonging to Parliament as an institution and belonging to Europe."
"I had been a member of my own country's national parliament for decades, but I at once felt at ease in taking up my duties as an elected Member of this House when I was called upon to join it."
"I felt no awkwardness, because the European Parliament, at least since 1979, has had the same dignity, authority and democratic legitimacy as any other freely elected parliament."
"I felt no contradiction, either, because I have always believed that there should be no misunderstanding or antagonism between national parliaments and the European Parliament, but just mutual respect and fruitful cooperation."
"Most of all, I have always been convinced that one can represent the views and interests of one's own country just as well in the European Parliament as in one's national parliament: here, in the Chambers of Strasbourg and Brussels, one takes a broader view of problems and choices that have to be understood in a European dimension, yet also in the interest of our national communities."
"What unites us all is precisely the sense of belonging to Europe, seen as a common heritage of values and ideas, traditions and hopes, and as the prototype of a new political and institutional entity capable of rising to the challenges of the times in which we are living and of the foreseeable future."
"That explains the special kind of experience that one gains in the European Parliament."
"The political representatives acting here are not bound by restricted, divergent national outlooks and, even though they may well differ on certain issues, including important ones, and on votes that are certainly significant, they largely agree in their view of the basic objectives that must be pursued in order to further the integration of a united Europe."
"When - as has happened so many times over the course of the decades - there has been a choice between pushing forward to broaden and strengthen European unity and just marking time or even pulling back, the European Parliament has always played a dynamic role: it has sent out a clear message, backed by a huge majority, to push ahead with developing the Community and broadening its horizons and ambitions."
"Indeed, with the first elections to the European Parliament by universal suffrage in 1979 - an important event - it had seemed that consolidating the parliamentarian and constitutional nature of the European Union would inevitably follow, in order to strengthen the democratic bases of the integration process, to guarantee the citizens their rights and the chance to participate."
"The European Parliament moved in that direction when, on 14 February 1984 - exactly 23 years ago today - it approved the draft Treaty establishing the European Union."
"The draft, which had been drawn up and debated at the instigation of Altiero Spinelli, unfortunately never became a Treaty and, despite the long and far from fruitless journey that followed, often inspired by the proposals of Spinelli's draft, a number of issues remained unresolved and were to surface again."
"When, on signing the disappointing Treaty of Nice, the governments agreed on the need to address the major themes for the future of Europe and to launch a genuine constitutional process, Parliament committed itself wholeheartedly to making its contribution by helping to seek adequate solutions to the questions raised in the Laeken Declaration of December 2001."
"Parliament can indeed feel proud of the dynamic role that it played more than ever at that time, especially in the Brussels Convention - in its working groups, its plenary sessions and its Praesidium."
"Ladies and gentlemen, 2001, 2002 and 2003 did not see a pause; rather, it was a time of serious, genuine and profound reflection."
"The material that was then put forward to the Intergovernmental Conference for final decision was a text packed with analysis that had been considered and discussed at length."
"The outcome was undoubtedly a compromise, but not a poor one: a middle ground was found between diverse viewpoints; each side, including Parliament, had to sacrifice its demands and proposals to some extent in order to arrive at an agreement that could actually advance the cause of European unity and integration."
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, can we perhaps now blithely say that that Treaty - it is no accident that it is called 'Constitutional' - is dead?"
"Is that extraordinary, prolonged political and cultural effort destined to end up in oblivion?"
"Are the signatures of 27 Heads of State or Government at the foot of that text now worthless?"
"Of course, we are all too aware of the traumatic effects of the votes against ratifying the Constitutional Treaty in the referendums held in two of the six founding countries of the European Community."
"We are equally well aware of the issues raised by the spread, in other countries as well, of doubts and scepticism about the path that Europe should take and about the European Union's current situation and future prospects."
"In reality, we are paying the price for having made little effort to involve the citizens in the major decisions about European integration and unification, or to inform public opinion in every country about the extraordinary results and progress that we have achieved in 50 years and the new, ever more pressing needs to strengthen the EU in terms of its cohesion and its ability to act."
"All of that, however, must not lead people to underestimate the reasons for the Constitutional Treaty signed in Rome in October 2004, or the solutions that it contains."
"These are practical, albeit partial, responses - which we need to ensure are better understood and appreciated - to the citizens' own demands, including their demand for more transparency and democracy in the Union."
"While the Constitutional Treaty represented a happy middle ground overall, it must be remembered that a good compromise means accepting certain ideas and giving up others."
"People should not forget that when they say they are going to rework the 2004 text: nobody should think of shifting the balance of the established compromise to the benefit of his or her own views."
"Starting new negotiations may be like opening Pandora's box, with the risk of having to start again from scratch and begin a debate when nobody knows what the outcome will be or how long it will take."
"Eighteen of the 27 Member States, representing 275 million European citizens, have ratified the Treaty: they deserve our respect for having upheld the commitment signed in Rome."
"It is quite clear, mind you, that the majorities that voted against it in the French and Dutch referendums must also be treated with respect, and that every effort must therefore be made to clarify the concerns that led to those rejections."
"The time has come, however, for Europe to find a way out of the impasse."
"No one can seriously claim that, after its huge enlargement, the EU does not need to redefine the overall framework of its values and objectives or to reform its institutional structure."
"Working on a draft Constitution for Europe was not a formalistic exercise, nor was it a whim or a luxury: rather, it was a response to a profound need in Europe at this moment in its history."
"Nor can the Europe of projects or results be put forward today as an alternative vision and strategy."
"Admittedly, Europe has certainly not stood still for the last two years."
"It gave the most telling proof of what it can achieve on the international stage when it succeeded in speaking with a single voice on the war in Lebanon, thus launching a dynamic new mission for peace in that region and throughout the Middle East."
"Alongside this renewed political initiative, some further items to write down on the credit side of the balance sheet for this period are the drawing-up of some important directives and the agreement on an albeit limited increase in the meagre financial perspective for 2007-2013. This was achieved with substantial input from the European Parliament through the powers it gained under the codecision procedure."
"Nonetheless, ladies and gentlemen, the EU cannot go very far down the path of results with its current institutional framework."
"It is certainly important to sketch out and propose new Community policies, as the Commission did recently on the environment and energy issues, which have now become major, critical problems because of climate change and the tensions over oil and gas supplies."
"We know from long experience, however, that Commission documents, communications and even legislative proposals may produce scant results or only very slow progress."
"That is shown, for example, by the long, hard road towards a European immigration policy, which has already taken many years."
"We also remember how the introduction of the single currency was not followed up with the economic governance that would have been necessary, not least to ensure that the objectives of that great project, the Lisbon Strategy, were effectively met."
"What, then, are the decisive factors in making projects thrive and in making a Europe of results really grow?"
"The strength of the institutions and of their political commitment is decisive."
"It is decisive that the Union should have institutions that are stronger than the resistance put up by those Member States that are still closed in on themselves, defending anachronistic prerogatives and vain national pretensions."
"The Constitutional Treaty cleared away any fear or suspicion of a swing towards a centralised superstate by more clearly enshrining the distribution of powers and guaranteeing respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"It could be claimed instead that it did not go far enough in adapting its operating rules and decision-making procedures to the challenge posed by the enlarged EU or in introducing the new Community policies that are needed."
"The most decisive steps forward in the Constitutional Treaty were towards a common foreign and security policy, an effective European area of freedom, security and justice, structured cooperation in the defence field, and enhanced cooperation in other fields."
"If, however, talks were started all over again and some party began to question those innovations, starting with the appointment of a European foreign affairs minister and a European department for external action, you can be sure that somebody else would demand instead that the 2004 Treaty be supplemented or expanded with bolder and more consistent new measures to push the integration process along."
"For example, the proposal to extend the scope of majority decision-making within the Council might understandably be tabled again, not least because getting rid of the unanimity rule and the veto does not prevent but rather encourages people to seek broad understandings and to reach acceptable agreements quickly."
"Similarly, another point that would be put forward again if talks were restarted would be to get rid of the need for unanimity regarding future reviews of the Treaties and their entry into force."
"All parties therefore need to have a good sense of realism: realism together with a determination to keep in check the tendency - which has resurfaced again - to weaken and water down the choice that was made more than 50 years ago now."
"What was chosen then was the prospect of a Europe that was able to integrate, a single yet plural entity enriched by its diversity, aware of its common heritage of civilisation, and strong through combining cooperation among national governments with a new supranational dimension."
"We are about to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, and it is important to use the occasion to reaffirm that prospect and that choice, while clearly setting out our new rationales and our new ambitions."
"The Community idea was born in Paris back in 1950, however, when the very distant goal of a European Federation or a United States of Europe was first sketched out."
"Today, we confidently expect Paris to make a reliable contribution to overcoming the crisis that began with the failure to ratify the Treaty in 2004."
"Our partner, France, has such a keen sense of its role in Europe and the world that it will not fail to provide us with its now decisive input."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have drawn your attention to a few of the essential points forming the backdrop to the decisions that have to be made in the near future, without going into detail about the manifold legal, technical and political ideas that have recently been advanced in the search for a way out of the institutional impasse."
"Italy has every confidence in the German Presidency's commitment, both to the principles and values that the Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, referred to in her speech in this Chamber, and to reaffirming Europe's objective of adopting the Constitutional Treaty."
"Whatever form the roadmap that is now being mentioned may take, it is important to agree that the citizens need to see the Constitutional Treaty already in force, together with its message and programme, before the elections are held in 2009."
"On that basis, my own message and programme is to appeal to the sense of responsibility and the political commitment of all those in positions of leadership in our countries."
"No one can deny the extent of the new threats, challenges and opportunities facing us."
"Europe will only be able to influence international relations and global development, recover its drive and dynamism, and count for something in the world if it strengthens its own cohesion and unity, by swiftly equipping itself - as a Union - with the institutions and resources that it needs."
"The alternative - as we must realise - is a dramatic decline in the role of all our countries, indeed, in the historical role of our continent."
"Allow me to repeat the words with which Jean Monnet ended his memoirs in 1976: 'We cannot stop when all around us the whole world is on the move.'"
"Thirty years later, those words are even more true: they buzz in our ears like an insect from which we can no longer escape."
"The leaders of all our countries must therefore show that they are equal to this awareness and this responsibility, and they must be able to release a new European political will."
"The European Parliament must shout louder than ever in calling for consistency and courage, as in the past."
"Italy will play its part, Mr President; it will make its contribution as it has done ever since the integration process began."
"This contribution is symbolised by the figures of a far-sighted statesman, Alcide De Gasperi, and of a passionate prophet and fighter for the European idea, Altiero Spinelli, the centenary of whose birth we are celebrating this year."
"In referring to their example and in reaffirming Italy's European commitment, I know I can speak for my country as represented by all of its political groups together and by its citizens' heartfelt beliefs."
"At the same time, I have tried to address you, ladies and gentlemen, on a more personal note, as dictated by my strong feelings."
"Sitting on these benches and working in this Parliament taught me more and more clearly that one can only serve the cause of our peoples, our nations and our joint future by working for a united Europe."
"President Napolitano, thank you very much for such an important speech."
"We have every confidence in Italy."
"Mr President, we thank you most warmly for the great speech you have just delivered."
"You stand in the tradition of the great Italian figures who contended for the unity of our continent, something that you do not only when addressing parliaments, but also when you go out and talk to young people, as you did at the University of TÃ¼bingen in Germany a few days ago."
"For this great dedication you have our heartfelt thanks, and we wish you strength and health for the future, so that we may continue to work together with the same dedication for the unity of our continent."
"We thank the President of the Italian Republic."
"Thank you, Giorgio Napolitano."

"It concerns the following addition to the end of paragraph 110:"
"'takes note of the decision by the Spanish authorities to declassify secret documents held by the intelligence services concerning the use by CIA-operated aircraft of Spanish airports;'."
"This is an update."
"(ES) Mr President, in order to respond positively to Mr Guardans CambÃ³'s proposal and try to save his oral amendment, I would like to propose to the House - and my group could approve this - that we simply add 'at the request of the Judge of the High Court'."
"If that is possible, we will be able to accept it, Mr President."
"If it is not possible, Mr President, my group will be opposed."
"(The amended oral amendment was accepted)"
"(ES) In fact I am taking the floor to say that, in agreement with the rapporteur -who is also going to present an oral amendment later on following Article 184 - we have agreed to withdraw this amendment from this paragraph so that we can then support the rapporteur's amendment in 184."
"We are therefore withdrawing our amendment from this paragraph."
"(IT) Mr President, for the same reasons given earlier by Mr Romeva i Rueda, myself and my colleague, Mr Meyer Pleite, who tabled the amendment in question, are also withdrawing our amendment."
"- Before the vote on Amendments 234 and 235"
"On this point, too, I need clarification from our rapporteur."
"In your view, Mr Fava, have Amendments 234 and 235 lapsed following the vote that has just taken place?"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, they are compatible."
"A point of order, Mr President."
"There is a PPE-DE amendment on paragraph 125 that I have tabled."
"It is amendment 258 and you seem to have skipped over it."
"I would appreciate it if we could take a vote on that amendment."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 258"
"(DE) Mr President, I would just like to point out to my group that there is an error in the voting list."

"Vice-President of the Commission. (IT) I shall, of course, report back to the College of Commissioners on the outcome of today's vote."
"Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Mr President, I do not think that the Commission has cleared it up terribly well, but I think it is not withdrawing its proposal, and so we need to clarify the legal situation."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has presented the second report on voluntary modulation after the referral of the first report back to committee in November 2006, under Rule 52(3) of the Rules of Procedure."
"As no agreement was possible with the Commission, the committee has had to reiterate its position, so we are dealing here not with a new report, where Rule 52(3) may be applied again, but with the confirmation of the first report."
"The Legal Service of the European Parliament, with which I have consulted on this issue, has informed me that, in our specific case, the last sentence of Rule 52(4) has to be applied mutatis mutandis, which means that we have the vote on this legislative resolution and that a second referral to committee according to Rule 52(3) is not appropriate, so we are not referring it back to committee."
"I propose, therefore, that the House should vote in favour of Parliament's legislative resolution because we have already rejected the Commission's legislative proposal."
"Therefore, the ball is now firmly in the Commission and Council's court."
"We await a new proposal with great interest."
"(Applause)"
"I am going to try to summarise this clearly."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is proposing that, instead of referring the report back to committee, we take the exceptional step of proceeding directly to a roll-call vote on the draft legislative resolution, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure."

"I should like to ask that Amendment 9 be voted on in addition to Amendment 21, which stipulates 20% as a basis for sustainable energy and in our amendment, that of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we advocate 25% by way of gradual increase."
"This could therefore be seen as an addition."
"If it is voted on additionally, I should like to ask our group to vote in favour of Amendment 21."

"Explanations of vote"
"(DE) Mr President, I rejoiced to learn that the report made it unequivocally clear that neither the Austrian Government nor any official entity or authority in Austria had any kind of improper part in this."
"I have nevertheless voted against the report on the grounds that the assertions in it are made without the backing of any kind of proof, yet they have not been removed from it, and, above all that the factual error concerning Europol has not been deleted either."
"What that means is that the report continues to contain a misrepresentation of the facts in which it is insinuated that Europol had employed members of the American secret services, something that is without any substance whatever and the very opposite of the truth."
"A report containing errors such as these does damage to Parliament's credibility and is a contributory factor in so many of its Members having voted against the report as a whole."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fava report is worth little more than a collage of press cuttings; while it pretends to uphold human rights, it is in fact an attempt to demolish the power and effectiveness of anti-terrorism activities."
"The demand to see the full names of Italian military secret service personnel published on the European Parliament website just shows the level of irresponsibility of someone who hypocritically says he supports the fight against terrorism and then, in fact, takes every suitable opportunity to prevent it from being put into practice."
"Parliament cannot and must not grant itself the power to strip EU national governments and Member States of their full sovereignty in matters of protecting their citizens' security, which is and must remain the inviolable province of the nations and Member States."
"Mr President, the British Conservative delegation voted against the Fava report."
"We regarded this report as an expensive exercise duplicating the work of Senator Marty in the Council of Europe."
"It is full of unproven allegations, makes unreasonable demands of the Council, criticising Mr de Vries, Mr Solana and NATO arrangements, which allow cooperation with the United States of America as our ally in the fight against international terrorism."
"The report calls for unacceptable Articles 6 and 7 sanctions against EU Member States, demands consular protection for UK residents, undermining the concept of British citizenship, and does not accept diplomatic assurances against torture in extraditing suspected terrorists to third countries."
"Our case rests."
"in writing. I voted against this report, not because I am unconcerned about allegations of international wrong-doing, but because this report builds its case largely on unsubstantiated speculation."
"Even before this report was written there was a virulent anti-American political agenda driving it towards its conclusions of today."
"Hence, its preference for press cuttings, rather than hard evidence."
"In consequence it exudes imbalance to the point that it will bring comfort to terrorist and anti-democratic forces."
"in writing. (SV) We have abstained in the vote on the report on the CIA's alleged use of European countries for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners."
"There is no doubt that, in the fight against terrorism, human rights violations have been committed - a state of affairs that is substantiated with examples in the report. We Swedish Conservatives condemn these acts of cruelty."
"By mixing facts with assumptions and unconfirmed rumours, the report is in danger, however, of weakening, rather than strengthening, the justified criticism."
"We opposed the setting up of the special committee because we believe that suspected crimes should be investigated by the judiciary."
"Responsibility for investigations has, in the first place, been exercised at national level."
"For example, the Swedish constitutional committee has examined - and passed judgment on - the Swedish Government's conduct."
"The issues mainly dealt with by the report are those coming within the competence not of the EU but of the Member States."
"On these issues, the governments of the Member States are responsible not to the European Parliament but solely and exclusively to their national parliaments as long as no European legal rules have been broken."
"If Member States have failed to comply with commitments at European level, it is the Commission's responsibility to investigate such violations and to go to court in connection with them."
"in writing. The Irish members of the Fine Gael delegation voted in favour of the report as a whole, as we support the general thrust of the report and its strong stance against the process of extraordinary rendition and the involvement of EU countries or airports in that process."
"However, I would like it noted that we do not agree in full with the wording of paragraph 125 of the report."
"I attempted to delete paragraph 125, but was unsuccessful in doing so (the vote was narrowly lost)."
"That being said, the majority of the report is worth supporting, as a strong statement against the process of extraordinary rendition, as a breach of international law."
"Therefore, we have voted in favour of the report as a whole."
"I abstained from the final vote for the following reasons:"
"1."
"This report is ill-timed and ineffective;"
"2."
"A decision that reconciles the need for commitment to protect human rights with support for the fight against terrorism and its causes is only acceptable if it engenders broad consensus;"
"3."
"This report has not engendered such consensus and has not produced the political analysis of this issue that is required;"
"4."
"The document focuses too much on the investigation into what has happened in the Member States, and fails to draw the salient conclusion that the citizens' inalienable right to protection and the integrity of the Member States needs to be upheld within a framework of respect for individual human rights;"
"5."
"Lastly, a report on this sensitive issue should be coordinated with the intervention of the European Council and should take account of any decisions made by the Council of Europe."
"in writing. I am voting for this report by my colleague Mr Fava on the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners."
"Let us be clear that I do not agree with everything in the report."
"There are a number of highly contentious elements, including gratuitous references to the former Secretary of State for Defence in the UK, which we have rejected here this morning."
"It has been claimed that much of the argumentation is not evidence-based."
"One could say the same thing about the case for intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan."
"To paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld: there are things we know, things we don't know and things we don't know we don't know."
"Well, here I know that our Temporary Committee and its rapporteur Mr Fava have identified a serious abuse of human rights in breach of international law in the Union."
"My vote is to endorse that clear overall finding and not the associated detail, which, inevitably in the absence of clear cooperation by the authorities, is speculation, which, while often right, is from time to time wrong."
"The argument used by the German Presidency to shrug off the problems and shirk its political responsibilities regarding the 'use of European countries by the CIA for the illegal transportation and detention of prisoners' comes as a surprise."
"Believe it or not, the Council claims that the affair lies outside its remit, even though it adopts one political position after another on whatever it considers to be of interest, and even though it is abundantly clear that these issues have been addressed as part of EU-NATO and EU-US relations."
"It has once again been demonstrated that such attitudes are, at the very least, indicative either of an attempt to provide a smokescreen for this unacceptable violation of international law and the most basic human rights, or of connivance with, and even subservience towards, the USA."
"The report drawn up by the temporary committee - which provided many of the victims with an identity and a voice - represents a further contribution towards the emergence of the whole truth and will help the national parliaments, the bodies actually charged with carrying out checks and balances on the behaviour of governments, to do their duty. This is something that the Portuguese Communist Party has long been calling for and proposing in the Portuguese Assembly."
"in writing. I voted for the Fava report, despite the changes made by nervous colleagues."
"The so-called 'war' on terror has been used by some to rework international law and defy international conventions on human rights and the treatment of those detained (on suspicion, not proof) without trial or any due process."
"Human rights are universal and indivisible: the EU is committed to upholding these rights."
"This report confronts us with an uncomfortable reality and we urge Member State Parliaments and Governments to investigate fully what may have been happening on their territory."
"This committee did not have full investigative powers, but we do have the power to make political recommendations."
"They should be acted upon if we really want to uphold our values."
"in writing. I support this report investigating the alleged secret CIA 'rendition' flights."
"As human rights form a core value of the European Union and by extension the activities of the European Parliament, it is right and proper that the European Parliament as an institution discusses and investigates possible human rights violations within its borders."
"in writing. Today's report by Mr Fava raises some critical issues which are about the core fundamental rights of everybody in Europe and across the world."
"The report paints a shocking picture of human rights abuse and illegal activity, all of which was tolerated by Member States including Ireland."
"The Irish Government's hear-no-evil, see-no-evil approach to illegal renditions is unconvincing and unacceptable."
"The report points out that at least 147 CIA-operated flights made stopovers in Irish airports including by aircraft involved in 'extraordinary renditions' or kidnappings as we would normally call them."
"Now all of us who seek the truth about these kidnappings must take this issue to our national parliaments and directly challenge the national governments at home in our countries."
"The real pressure must be applied at home where the people who permitted and tolerated these actions will feel it."
"To this end, I am calling on the Government to launch a full parliamentary inquiry in the DÃ¡il immediately into the use of Irish territory as part of the CIA rendition circuit."
"Sinn FÃ©in supported the report to lend our weight in the European Parliament to this call."
"in writing. The European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP) voted for the Fava report because we believe that it is important for the European Parliament to have investigated the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners."
"MEPs are directly elected and answerable to our constituents."
"We investigate all manner of issues on behalf of them and we could not ignore calls that Member States may have breached their treaty obligations under Article 6 of the EU Treaty which outlines the basic principles of democracy, human rights, and respect of law."
"The EPLP voted for amendments which moved the focus of the report away from personalities and party politics to the substance of the rendition allegations."
"The EPLP have voted for a more balanced and fair report in Plenary than the report which emerged from Committee stage."
"in writing. The European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP) voted for the FAVA report because we believe that it is important for the European Parliament to have investigated the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners."
"MEPs are directly elected and answerable to our constituents."
"We investigate all manner of issues on behalf of them and we could not ignore calls that Member States may have breached their treaty obligations under Article 6 of the EU Treaty, which outlines the basic principles of democracy, human rights, and respect for the law."
"The EPLP voted for amendments which moved the focus of the report away from personalities and party politics to the substance of the rendition allegations."
"It is for this reason that the EPLP voted against amendment 29."
"The EPLP have voted for a more balanced and fair report in Plenary than the report which emerged from the committee stage."
"The report describes and - up to a point - confirms the disclosures and facts which have come to light on abductions, secret flights, illegal detentions in secret prisons, torturing and so on by the CIA on European soil."
"The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party abstained from the vote because they consider the stand of the grassroots and socialist party previously in government which backed and backs the so-called anti-terrorist strategy of the USA and agrees with all these actions to be hypocritical."
"Today, under the weight of the grassroots outcry about these disclosures, they are trying to appear as champions of the 'terrorist policy' and as protectors of human rights in order to rescue the 'lost honour' of the ÎU."
"We radically disagree and have no intention of helping to delude the peoples as to the nature of the policy to 'combat terrorism'."
"It is the imperialists' pretext to construct a gigantic repressive mechanism throughout the world with the basic objective of establishing their supremacy and hitting the grassroots movements and opposition."
"At a time when the European Parliament is doing its utmost about violations of human rights, autocratic laws for striking the movement and restricting demonstrations are being promoted throughout the ÎU."
"Personal files on all and sundry and the signature of new agreements with the USA are being promoted."
"I voted in favour of the Fava report because it is an historic step in the fight against a criminal international parastate."
"Apart from the huge responsibilities of the European Council, there are also clear responsibilities for the governments of several Member States."
"On completion of this complicated investigation by the European Parliament, it is vital that examining committees be set up now in the national parliaments of the Member States - which unfortunately include Greece - which appear to be involved in the CIA's illegal activities."
"The baton in the fight against the international parastate is now in their hands."
"The German Federal Government bears a great deal of shared responsibility for the CIA's torture flights; such is the verdict of the report of the committee investigating the CIA's activities, which was adopted in the European Parliament today."
"The German Federal Government - a coalition composed of conservatives and social democrats - can no longer avoid facing up to the consequences, even though it is obvious that it has been in response to pressure from it that the Social Democrats in the European Parliament have watered down some of the report's language."
"The European Parliament has come to the conclusion that, 'according to information given by Murat Kurnaz's lawyer and information provided by the German authorities, there was a prospect of the release of Murat Kurnaz from GuantÃ¡namo in 2002 but this was not accepted by the German authorities' and that 'Murat Kurnaz's lawyer was told by the German Government that it was impossible to open negotiations with the US Government on his release because Murat Kurnaz was a Turkish citizen' even though 'all investigations had established, by as early as at the end of October 2002, that Murat Kurnaz posed no terrorist threat'."
"My colleagues and I are agreed that this gross misconduct on the part of the representatives of the former Social Democrat/Green Federal Government needs to be investigated."
"The foreign minister, Mr Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who formerly coordinated Germany's secret services, should desist from deceiving the public and at last face up to his responsibility for what happened back then."
"I voted against the Fava report, otherwise known as the CIA report, for four reasons."
"Staunch defence of human rights, the rule of law and democracy, which I advocate, cannot be delivered by political action underpinned more by naÃ¯ve left-wing anti-Americanism than by the actual defence of these values."
"It is not for Parliament to monitor the Member States."
"This is the duty, first and foremost of national parliaments and any violation of this principle is inherently a political error and a legal anomaly."
"The report makes the unforgivable mistake of drawing definitive conclusions from unproven, controversial statements, turning opinions into truths and insinuations into facts."
"As regards Portugal, even with the adopted amendments, there is still a degree of imbalance between what has been proven (or even declared by the alleged victims) and what has been concluded, or, worse, presumed to be true."
"Lastly, I should like to praise Mr Coelho for his tireless work in promoting balance, reason and the defence of our key principles and values."
"I take the view that had he been the rapporteur rather than the chairman of the committee the report would have been substantially better balanced."
"in writing. - (FR) The European Parliament has just given its verdict on the work done by its Temporary Committee concerning the use of European airspace by the CIA for the illegal transportation of prisoners."
"The verdict was unsurprising: condemnation of the many Member States that have effectively given their support to the CIA."
"Mr Fava's report has one great quality, which is to point out a common basis of fundamental values: respect for human rights, the condemnation of torture and respect for the legal framework in the fight against terrorism."
"It also has one great failing: it totally overlooks the fact that the only thing restricting our governments' efforts is reason, reason that allows them to reject the impossible: the secret services will never be welcoming and transparent!"
"Let us not confuse humanism with naÃ¯ve optimism."
"As the philosopher, Alain, put it: 'there can be no freedom without security; security is worth nothing without freedom'."
"This concern for security in the context of freedom justified my abstention."
"I am convinced that my friend, Antoine Duquesne, the former Minister for the Interior of the Kingdom of Belgium, would have delivered the same message, if he could have voted today."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners."
"Since January 2006, a great deal of work has been carried out by Parliament's Temporary Committee, which is responsible for conducting investigations into the allegations made in the press on this sensitive issue."
"I should like to point out that, if its work is to be legitimate, it is important for the Committee to rely on tangible and verifiable evidence, so as to remain somewhat impartial."
"The MEPs are vested with a duty of transparency and information towards the citizens; this information must therefore be guided by a concern to provide the most accurate feedback possible."
"While the final report does not fulfil this demand as well as it might, I decided to vote in favour, convinced that, through these committees, Parliament is required to play a decisive role in terms of helping to ensure that the human rights and fundamental values to which the Union fully adheres in its Treaties are respected."
"Thus, the fight against terrorism must be waged in compliance with the international law in force, and no human rights violations can be justified."
"I voted against the adoption of the aforementioned final report because it contained references to Poland that did not reflect the findings of the work of the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners."
"The committee found no evidence, other than press reports, to confirm the existence of secret CIA prisons in my country."
"Mere supposition, unsupported by evidence, cannot be used as the basis of a final report on such a serious issue."
"in writing. Mr Fava should be commended for steering through our House this difficult and sensitive report on rendition allegations."
"Abuses of human rights, torture and illegal deportation must be condemned in today's Europe."
"(DE) I reject the CIA report on the grounds that it does not do even the most basic of the things that I expect of a report from a committee of inquiry, whether in terms of its methodology or of its analytical processes."
"The conclusions differ in no way from those reached by the Council of Europe's investigator Dick Marty, some of whose former witnesses have since changed their minds."
"Although this should not be taken to mean that I approve of what the USA has done, I have to say that, in this report, truth, facts and honesty have given way to suppositions and accusations."
"in writing. (SV) Many unfortunate incidents in the fight against terrorism have been noted."
"However, these issues have already been dealt with by the United Nations Human Rights Council and by the Council of Europe."
"The Swedish Government has taken the criticism concerned on board."
"There is therefore no reason for discussing this issue in the European Parliament too."
"I have therefore voted in favour of many of the proposals but abstained in the vote on the report as such."
"(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of adopting the report on granting European Union financial aid to Moldova, aimed at supporting the balance of payments and foreign currency reserves."
"I did so because I am convinced that these resources will allow one of the poorest countries in Europe to overcome its current financial difficulties."
"Additional exceptional support should prove very useful in facilitating and supporting the implementation of the Government of Moldova's economic reforms."
"Bearing in mind the positive social and economic changes in Moldova, including the recent abolition of the death penalty, I believe it is appropriate to strengthen bilateral links with Moldova and deepen its relationship with the European Union."
"A grant of up to EUR 45 million will send out a strong signal from the European Union, especially in the context of the Russian ban on the import of wine from Moldova and the higher prices demanded for energy."
"in writing. I am in support of this financial assistance to one of the poorest countries in Europe, which has been economically hard hit by events in its region."
"I particularly welcome the amendments which seek to increase the role of the Parliament."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council decision on providing Community macro-financial assistance to Moldova."
"Indeed, despite making definite economic progress, Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe."
"Since 1 January, Moldova, which shares a border with Romania, has actually bordered the European Union, and the Council wants to help it cope with its commercial and financial difficulties."
"I should like, nevertheless, to emphasise that this solidarity, valued at EUR 45 million, is of an exceptional and limited nature and requires certain conditions."
"The granting of aid must be made subject to the fulfilment of objectives such as the increased transparency of public finances and respect for human rights."
"Finally, I believe, above all, that, in the wake of the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, the European Union's spirit of solidarity must now extend to the countries of the southern Mediterranean."
"Thus, through its neighbourhood policy and its Euro-Mediterranean partnership, the EU must ensure that its financial instruments remain effective and that its trade with the countries of the southern Mediterranean increases."
"in writing. A total ban on drift nets and its effective implementation needs to be prioritised by Member States."
"Too many dolphins, porpoises and seals die needlessly due to the use of these nets."
"A standard definition should be welcomed in order that there can be no loop-hole in the use of these destructive nets."
"in writing. (SV) Because the June List does not believe that the EU should have a common fisheries policy, we have voted against this report."
"We would also take the liberty of referring to earlier explanations of vote concerning fisheries policy."
"This purpose of this regulation is to clarify the fishing gear that can be classified as drift nets by harmonising a common definition for all regulation in this area."
"Drift nets have a major impact on fisheries resources and on marine ecosystems, and an economic impact - in terms of competition and loss of income - on fishermen using more traditional gear."
"Against this backdrop, the EU has adopted United Nations Resolution 44/225 introducing a moratorium on the use of drift nets as part of the Community acquis (Regulation No 354/1992), despite some regional exceptions at Community level."
"As such we support the content of this report, which will help improve control and reduce the impact of drift nets in Portuguese waters, in particular in the Exclusive Economic Areas of the Azores and Madeira, as these waters are visited by fleets from other Member States, which use this gear in fishing for tuna and other marine species, either due to a loophole in the law or illegally."
"in writing. (SV) The report contains quite a few constructive proposals for preventing overfishing."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this proposal for pragmatic reasons."
"The EU's fisheries policy has, in general, militated against long-term sustainable exploitation of the sea's resources by subsidising fishermen's purchases of efficient boats."
"Fisheries policy is also prejudicial to the populations of poor countries inasmuch as the EU purchases rights to fish in these countries' waters from weak governments."
"The EU should therefore return fisheries policy to the Member States and see to it only that the Member States do not overfish species that move in more than one country's territorial waters."
"I mistakenly voted in favour of the proposed resolution, when I had meant to vote against, as I did on the legislative proposal."
"I therefore request that my vote on the legislative resolution be amended (to a vote against)."
"in writing. The reason I did not vote for the Agriculture Committee's proposal to reject the Commission's proposal on voluntary modulation is that doing so would further delay the start of the new rural development programmes and their funding."
"This would have a negative affect on farmers and rural communities in my constituency, who badly need these funds."
"The lack of funding for rural development is a problem for Wales. This has been caused by a combination of the UK not getting a fair share of the EU funding, the UK Government's defence of its budget rebate and the UK Presidency's financial perspectives deal."
"As a result of this failure by government, Ministers will look to modulation to top up this fund."
"Subsidiarity must be ensured so that the decision to apply voluntary modulation or not and at what level is taken at the appropriate level."
"In my constituency that would mean the National Assembly for Wales rather than at Member State level."
"There are wide differences in approach and distinctive rural communities across the UK and it would be totally unacceptable to have a single level."
"There must also be full and additional matching funding from central government funds."
"As we have said before, the key issue here is that the Commission's proposal is not a proposal for genuine modulation. Such a proposal would increase aid to those who receive the least, or receive nothing, and reduce aid to those who receive a large amount, so as to ensure greater fairness in the distribution of aid among producers, countries and crops and to support small and medium farmers and family farming."
"We feel that the Commission should table a fresh proposal in order to create genuine, compulsory modulation, which would guarantee greater fairness and release financial resources by introducing a maximum limit to aid per holding (capping) and a percentage increase in aid for farmers who receive the least from the CAP (modulation), for example, by proposing a 15% to 20% increase for small or medium-sized farmers who receive less than EUR 5 000 in aid, and taking various circumstances into account even when they receive more than that."
"Without this, there is a risk that existing inequalities will be exacerbated."
"We therefore urge the Commission to recast the proposal in order to ensure that a decision on this issue does not ultimately lead to the renationalisation of the costs of the CAP."
"The Commission has so far not done this, however."
"Hence our decision to abstain."
"Parliament has already rejected the Commission's proposal for voluntary modulation of direct payments under the CAP of up to 20%."
"According to this proposal, funds earmarked for farmers would be provided under the second pillar of the CAP, namely rural development; that is to say, they would pass to the national budgets of the Member States that decide to employ this modulation."
"The removal of aid for farmers would raise issues of competition between farmers from countries that do not employ modulation and those from countries that do, and between farmers in the latter category depending on the level of modulation decided upon."
"For this reason I share the view of the rapporteur, Mr Goepel, that we should once again reject the Commission's proposal."
"in writing. (SV) The June List believes that the European Union's common agricultural policy should be phased out."
"We also oppose the new subsidies under the designation, 'rural development'."
"We wonder why the EU believes that the Member States cannot manage to develop their rural areas themselves."
"We are faced with two alternatives in this vote: the Commission's proposal and the proposal by the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"In this situation, we have chosen to vote in favour of the Commission's proposal, since it is better than the proposal by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is quite absurd."
"The report's explanatory statement contains a whole range of views. For example, it criticises possible abandonment or renationalisation of the common agricultural policy - a development that the June List would find desirable - and complains that it is contrary to the European Parliament's right of participation, a view that the June List does not share."
"In addition, the explanatory statement maintains that the health check on the long-term budget should only form the basis of proposals for the financing period after 2013."
"The June List completely rejects that view."
"We believe that the mid-term review should lead to cuts in the agriculture/rural development budget as early as in the current budget period of 2007-2013."
"The June List observes that, in this situation, it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision regarding the EU's agricultural policy. Otherwise, the EU would fall into the trap of protectionism and of heavy subsidies to all the various groups within the agricultural industry."
"in writing. I voted for the proposal to introduce voluntary modulation of the CAP as it has been used more effectively in the UK than in any other Member State."
"It has been used as an essential source to fund rural development schemes throughout the country."
"in writing. - (FR) In addition to decoupling aid and production, the CAP reform has introduced a new tool: modulation."
"In practice, this is the option to transfer part of the appropriations, the direct payments to farmers, to rural development appropriations."
"It is called a 'transfer from the first pillar to the second pillar'."
"As much as twenty per cent of the funds may be transferred under voluntary modulation."
"The Member States may choose this modulation from an abridged menu, rather than from one imposed on them, which serves up 'direct aid' as a main course and 'rural development' as a dessert."
"In reality, modulation amounts to robbing Paul the farmer to feed Peter the landscape gardener."
"This is a budgetary technique that is meant to disguise the shortage of appropriations with the impression that one can choose how these scarce appropriations are managed."
"in writing. (DE) The EU's appearance of taking up the cause of agriculture does nothing to change the fact that we are constantly losing farmers and that more and more farms are now being run only as a sideline."
"In a situation in which big business and royalty benefit from our subsidies and we cannot manage to get our organic farmers' case heard by the WTO, one can hardly be surprised that this is the way things are going."
"Comprehensible indicators of quality and health benefits would be desirable as means of guaranteeing fair prices for healthy products, but the most vital thing of all is that the EU's subsidy jungle be simplified, if need be by returning agriculture to national jurisdiction."
"It is for that reason that I have voted against the Goepel report."
"in writing. The British Conservative Delegation recognises the vital importance of agri-environment schemes."
"However, for three major reasons, Conservatives voted in favour of rejecting the Commission's proposal on voluntary modulation."
"Firstly, for British farmers, voluntary modulation would be anything but voluntary - they would be forced to accept a cut of up to 20 % of the value of their single farm payment, while the rest of Europe's farmers would not."
"Had Tony Blair negotiated a better EU Budget deal for the UK on rural development monies, our farmers would not be facing this bleak prospect."
"Secondly, the proposal that we are called to vote on is, in any case, unacceptable to the British Government itself because it does not allow for regionalisation, it restricts the Government's freedom in deciding spending priorities and it maintains a franchise unsuitable to the UK's farming structure."
"Labour MEPs did not move a single amendment to bring the proposal more into line with their Government's wishes!"
"Finally, Commissioner Fischer Boel's most recent statements suggest that Parliament's overwhelming opposition to the proposal cannot be totally ignored and that some form of compromise may emerge."
"We sincerely hope that this is to the benefit of British farmers."
"in writing. (DA) We are voting against Parliament's proposal that the Commission should withdraw its own proposal and in favour of the Commission's proposal."
"We think that Parliament is trying to blackmail the Commission with the threat of withholding 20% of rural development resources."
"Instead of affecting the Commission, this would hit the farmers, who would not see their money paid out, and, especially, the EU as a whole, the reputation of which would scarcely be enhanced if shameless blackmail between the institutions were in future to become the norm."
"On behalf of the Danish delegation of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"in writing. The proposed CAP reforms should be supported."
"It is disappointing that for the second time Parliament has rejected these reforms which provide a sustainable approach to rural development."
"The vote today will again delay payments to farmers in Scotland and the UK."
"MEPs cannot demand reform of the CAP on the one hand and then not support reform in practice."
"Our constituents time and time again ask for reform of the CAP."
"It is worrying that the national and vested interests of a few are being allowed to distort the urgent reform of the CAP."
"The Trans-European Networks for Transport (TEN-T) represent an investment in guaranteeing accessibility within the European area, and form a key part of the Lisbon Strategy, both as investment in innovation and in job creation, and via the creation of structures that help speed up cohesion and socio-economic development."
"Consequently, the meagre increase in the financial resources earmarked for the TEN-T and the slowness in implementing the TEN-T priority projects are major causes for concern."
"It is therefore vital that the Member States attach maximum priority to realising these projects and do not shy away from adopting all the measures needed to complete them."
"In addition to the priority of cross-border links, there needs to be better coordination and transparency in the procedures if we are finally to see the fruits of over a decade of work."
"These projects are of vital importance to cohesion on the European continent, to intermodality, to interoperability and, lastly, to easing traffic congestion."
"Decisions must now be taken to enhance the leverage effect of Community funding. Today, we must have no hesitation in correcting mistakes, effecting the necessary changes and ensuring that these projects move forward as quickly as possible."
"(DE) Mr President, while I would like to make it clear that the delegation of the Austrian People's Party has always been forthright in its advocacy of pro-active action to address climate change, we have nevertheless voted against this resolution on the grounds that it attempts to bring in nuclear power through the back door."
"We have always been equally forthright in rejecting this form of energy, which, in our view, has no future."
"It has been a cause of great surprise to me that so few of the self-proclaimed opponents of nuclear power - in particular those belonging to the Socialist Group and the Group of the Greens - have nevertheless voted to endorse this report."
"(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on climate change, because I firmly believe there is an urgent need to define a European Union strategy on this issue, which is of such importance to humanity."
"It seems very important for the European Parliament to make its voice heard on the matter."
"The Member States of the Union and the European Commission are facing a tremendous challenge."
"How can economic development be supported whilst at the same time protecting the natural environment?"
"Experts are calling for emissions of gases containing CO2 to be limited, and for research and innovation in the area of renewable energy and energy saving technologies to be supported."
"It is also important to cooperate with countries outside the European Union and, in particular, to make citizens aware of the dangers resulting from climate change."
"We are all responsible for protecting the Earth."
"We must understand, however, that reducing emissions and pollution will involve additional costs for European enterprises and citizens in the short term."
"If we consider that countries such as China, Brazil and India are producing more and more carbon dioxide and other noxious substances every year, the Union should help them to change over to cleaner and more energy-efficient production methods."
"Trade in so-called green technology and the development of renewable sources of energy should be promoted."
"We need to take this action for our own sakes and for the sake of future generations."
"(FI) Mr President, in point 34 of the resolution on climate change, which we have just voted on, the Commission was asked to assess the risks to nuclear institutions posed by floods and tsunamis that are caused by climate change."
"There is a Finnish campaign behind this idea which is based on a fictional novel, and for which there is no scientific basis."
"In the story, a tsunami, brought about by climate change, causes an accident that results in massive damage to a nuclear power plant."
"I am in favour of exercising great caution and assessing the risks, but this initiative was annoying and downright embarrassing for the reputation of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"First of all, climate change does not cause tsunamis."
"That idea is considered absurd by serious researchers."
"My colleagues behind the initiative are right to say that an assessment of the risks of power stations is always necessary, but wrong to let it be understood that this had not already been done."
"No power plant is built without ensuring that it is flood-resistant."
"That is why I am also forced to ask the Commission to assess the political risks arising from parliamentary initiatives based on pure fiction."
"I am happy that this time the problem was avoided."
"in writing. (SV) We voted in favour of Amendments 3 and 8 because we think it would be a good thing if the EU Member States could agree unanimously on taxes that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"However, we do not support decisions on tax taken on a majority basis at EU level, because we Swedish Social Democrats believe that tax decisions should be taken at national level."
"We broadly welcome the adoption of this document, yet another on climate change."
"It is a document that asserts, or confirms, our undertakings as regards reducing emissions and promoting alternative energies."
"It does not, however, deal with other equally important points such as promoting energy efficiency and the use of high-quality public transport; these alternatives are covered either fleetingly or in watered-down form."
"It also emphasises the proposal to commercialise emissions rights, or to put it more aptly, the 'right to pollute'. As we have been saying, this would run counter to the stated objectives, on account of its commercial nature, as those who can pay will still be able to pollute."
"This will affect in particular countries with weaker economies that do not have the money to buy these emissions rights."
"Whilst there are some welcome proposals in the areas of emissions reductions and renewable energy, there are other proposals that would be difficult to implement given the stringent requirements placed on the different countries, especially given the opposition to them."
"In any event, we shall carefully monitor the implementation of some of the ideas in the report, whilst fighting to ensure that they are not exploited for the purpose of further concentrating energy in the hands of the wealthiest countries or in such a way that it is the consumer who has to carry the can for the pollution costs of the polluting companies."
"The results of the Paris session are a slap in the face for everyone who believed that opposition and interests would be overcome in light of the serious danger of the planet's overheating and of the catastrophic medium- and long-term repercussions for the peoples of this earth."
"However, the resolution on climate change, which is a fighting text, does not propose material and specific solutions."
"To a large extent it expresses wishful thinking and maintains a reliance on the same methodology responsible for today's acute problems, favouring market mechanisms, imposing taxes and contributions on the workers and exempting the multinationals."
"It clearly states that the reduction in emissions will contribute towards competition and towards achieving the Lisbon and Kyoto objectives."
"It is precisely this policy of capital that is responsible for contaminating the environment and for emissions and it cannot be a criterion for protecting it."
"Moreover, all those who ratified the Kyoto protocol are showing on balance significant deviations, while the USA continues to increase greenhouse gases, together with China and India."
"Consequently, Kyoto has little to do in practice with reducing emissions."
"The conclusion is that the EU of capital and its political spokesmen are destroying the planet on the pretext of environmental changes and their only concern is how to make more profitable use of the Kyoto 'market mechanisms'."
"in writing. I agree with the general aims of the Council resolution."
"While I agree with the content of the Verts/ALE amendments and the commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2020, I believe that the amendment was too narrowly focused and I abstained from the vote on that particular amendment."
"in writing. Climate change is perhaps the most significant political challenge of our time."
"The type of steps called for in this resolution, and collective action at the multilateral level are essential if climate change is to be combated."
"in writing. While I supported the resolution, the EU needs to take additional initiatives to address climate change"
"Shop shelves are full of low value, perishable goods that have been transported tens of thousands of miles to satisfy consumer pricing expectations."
"The carbon footprint left behind by this form of global trading is colossal."
"I am therefore calling for the introduction of a ""Carbon Labellingâ system, which would give consumers the information to make responsible and wise choices."
"in writing. Moves to make the European Parliament a carbon neutral institution require to be pursued as a matter of urgency."
"Tackling climate change is the challenge of our time."
"We all need to play our part."
"Perhaps it will be the argument of our carbon footprint, rather than any other, which will finally end our Strasbourg sojourns every month."
"After all, we as MEPs should practice what we preach."
"in writing. (SV) The greenhouse effect is one of the great problems of our time."
"It is therefore important that considerable efforts be made to reduce carbon dioxide emissions."
"One of the best and most important methods of eliminating such emissions is to have nuclear energy replace energy produced through the burning of coal and oil."
"The IAEA has observed that nuclear energy is one of the keys to reducing carbon dioxide emissions."
"It is unfortunate that the resolution in question chooses to ignore this fact by insisting that emissions should not be reduced through the use of nuclear energy."
"It is for this reason that I am voting against this resolution."
"(DE) Mr President, we all know that fighting terrorism can only ever be a cooperative effort, and there is no doubt about the importance, to the European Union, of the USA as a partner in this, nor, indeed about the need, to this end, of the exchange of data and information, yet this must be done in accordance with rules accepted by both parties."
"Now that we have decided on those rules, which - ranging from the specified use to which data may be put to conversion to a push-system, by way of the non-storage of sensitive data - have gained broad majority support, and have, above all, managed to commit the authorities in the USA to informing their counterparts in the European Union of terrorist suspects, I am happy to give this resolution my support."
"I am persuaded that - should Commissioner Frattini be mandated to conduct negotiations - it will be possible to achieve a good outcome in the interests of the security of the EU's citizens."
"in writing. UK Conservatives are in full support of measures which highlight fraudulent financial transactions for the benefit of funding terrorism."
"However, this motion for a resolution fails to mention the results of investigations carried out by the Belgian authorities."
"Also the motion fails to recognise the importance of ensuring that access to such data should be limited to appropriate law enforcement agencies trusted with counter-terrorism action."
"In the case of the PNR agreement, Conservatives believe that it is the sovereign right of a country to ask for information on people entering its territory."
"Any agreement on data transfer should recognise this right."
"The more appropriate method to handle such agreements and ensure high standards of data protection is through a mechanism of intergovernmental cooperation."
"For these reasons British Conservatives voted against the resolution."
"The EU is fully committed to the fight against global terrorism, on the basis of its human values and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms."
"No motive, however laudable, can justify the absence of democratic legitimacy. Accordingly, the sharing of data must be subject to constant parliamentary and judicial monitoring."
"There are serious doubts regarding the processing of personal data by the US authorities, which indiscriminately hoard data, in breach of European data protection legislation."
"What is more, the arrangements are not reciprocal: US citizens are afforded must greater protection in Europe than Europeans in the United States."
"I therefore believe that a common framework must be set up with the United States with the aim of safeguarding guarantees regarding the sharing of sensitive information in the context of the fight against terrorism."
"Parliament will have to keep a close eye on the PNR agreement to be negotiated by the Commission."
"We have always expressed our opposition to the establishment of an agreement with the United States on the sharing of personal data, in relation either to PNR or to SWIFT."
"This is firstly because the agreement forms part of a broad context of securitarian measures - note the programme of illegal phone tapping in the United States - on the basis of the so-called 'fight against terrorism', which has been a pretext for unleashing interference and aggression on countries and peoples when US imperialist interests have been at stake."
"We are also opposed to this agreement because no valid guarantees are given that the citizens' legitimate rights will be safeguarded by the implementation of the agreed rules governing personal data protection, including those defined by the EU itself. Furthermore, the effective monitoring of these agreements on the part of the national parliaments is not guaranteed."
"There is no doubt that the seriousness of the current state of affairs would be minimised by the establishment of more specific measures, more effective methods of controlling the personal data to be transferred, limits on the use to which data can be put, information for the citizens, and the citizens being afforded access to their personal data."
"What is really needed, however, is an end to this securitarian onslaught, which, on the pretext of the so-called 'fight against terrorism', undermines the citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"in writing. Sinn FÃ©in believes the Passenger Name Record (PNR) Agreement should not be entered into lightly or behind closed doors."
"The PNR Agreement forms part of the so-called 'war on terror' and will infringe the civil liberties of Irish citizens."
"EU Member States should not allow themselves to be bullied into applying an Agreement which fails to guarantee the data protection rights of its citizens."
"Ireland should take the lead within the EU Council in demanding a more acceptable Agreement."
"I am calling on the government to amend the proposed Agreement before its adoption to ensure that at a minimum: the annual joint review includes a requirement for an evaluation of the Agreement covering both the detail of its operation and also its effectiveness against its stated objective of 'fighting terrorism'; and that any change in US, EU or Irish data protection provisions relevant to the operation of the Agreement would prompt an immediate and transparent renegotiation of the Agreement requiring further approval by both houses of the Oireachtas."""
"in writing. - (EL) The resolution by the European Parliament on the transmission of passengers' personal data by European airlines (PNR) and the scandal of the provision of information on financial transactions by SWIFT customers to the US security services reveals the true character of the pronouncements by the political forces behind the European one-way street and European subjugation."
"Their protests about the violation of the protection of personal data and of privacy in the resolution are converted to a belief that 'the ÎU and the USA are fundamental and loyal allies in the fight against terrorism'."
"That is why they also propose signing a new agreement on the transmission of passengers' personal data, with the same content as the previous one, and the removal of information on financial transactions for 'judicial investigative purposes', provided that the USA gives guarantees that it will be protected."
"The new agreements proposed add to the disclosures about the criminal activities of the CIÎ in Member States of the ÎU, with abductions, detentions in secret jails and torturing of 'terrorist suspects', thereby proving that, despite their hypocritical pronouncements, cooperation between the ÎU and the USA is deepening, in a bid to restrict fundamental rights and grassroots freedoms, on the pretext of fighting terrorism."
"- (SK) I have voted for the adoption of the resolution of European Parliament on the contribution to the Spring Council scheduled for 8 and 9 March."
"I have expressed my support for the amended wording of the resolution, because I consider the preservation of internal market competitiveness and the implementation of a strategic innovation policy focusing on energy efficiency to represent a clear and up-to-date response to the issue of how to achieve the Lisbon Strategy goals."
"In the interests of enhancing the transparency and clarity of the Strategy, I support the process of improving the drafting of consumer protection laws."
"An essential point in the resolution is the appeal to national parliaments to embrace national reform programmes, as success in meeting the ambitious Lisbon goals is dependent mainly on the initiative of each of the Member States."
"In this context, I would like to mention the Slovak example where, thanks to the structural reforms made by the government of MikulÃ¡Å¡ Dzurinda, we are already witnessing real results, for example almost 10 per cent economic growth and the creation of hundreds of new jobs."
"The Minerva Strategy, which involves mobilising innovation in support of the national economy and developing scientific and educational activities, constitutes an implementation of the Lisbon Strategy that aims to make Slovakia one of the most advanced, modern and prosperous societies worldwide, and thereby possibly also a source of ideas and inspiration to other Members States of the Union."
"in writing. (SV) We supported the resolution on the Lisbon Strategy."
"We believe that, in the future too, the Lisbon Strategy must be based on the need for social policy, economic policy and environmental policy mutually to support each other."
"In the ongoing work on the strategy, it is important to emphasise an overall perspective whereby it is efficient and open markets, education, an active and egalitarian welfare policy and a progressive environmental policy that together contribute to growth and job creation."
"We did not, however, support the demand that obstacles to job creation, including obstacles to the creation of relatively low-paid jobs, must be removed."
"This might be interpreted in terms of opening up a low-wage market, something to which we are absolutely opposed."
"On the contrary, we want any such development to be prevented."
"This can be done by allowing collective agreements and cooperation between the social partners to play a more significant role."
"We are also opposed to wordings that encourage the exploitation of 'clean energy' and carbon dioxide-neutral energy technology, because they might be interpreted in terms of our being in favour of the expansion of nuclear energy."
"We should prefer to see increased efforts to develop renewable energy with a view to promoting sustainable development."
"The resolution before us reveals the true nature of the 'Lisbon Strategy' - the European-level agenda of the employers and the large financial and economic groups - which was reinforced by the 2005 relaunch of the Strategy and the launch of national reform programmes in all Member States in order to push through so-called structural reforms, aimed at making labour relations more flexible, deregulating the markets, liberalising services, commercialising education and research and privatising social security."
"Now that the liberalisation of services has been achieved, the Strategy now has its sights set on labour relations with so-called 'flexicurity', total deregulation and the liberalisation of unfair dismissals."
"I wish to point out that social concerns and objectives, which had previously served to help disguise the true nature of the Lisbon Agenda, have now disappeared."
"The fact is that since 2000, in the EU of the Strategy and the eurozone era, there has been weak growth in the economy and in employment, an increase in job insecurity, poverty, social exclusion and income inequalities, and unemployment remains high."
"A sea change away from the EU's current policies is therefore needed."
"The ideas of the three main groups of this House are so similar where economic, trade, social and employment policy are concerned that they have straight away tabled a single resolution on the forthcoming European Council."
"That, in itself, is reason enough for me to reject it."
"Reflecting, as it does, a pathetic, exclusively pro-European way of thinking, this text contains everything that is responsible for Europeans' growing hostility to your system: the little piece, written in a roundabout way, about the unemployed being responsible for their unemployment - 'poor swines' as Gabin said in La TraversÃ©e de Paris - that about the benefits of immigration, which come at the cost of plundering of elites in the developing world and of pressure on wages in Europe; that about the necessary reform of our social protection system 'in the light of the development of global dynamics', which obviously means that they are doomed; the little piece about random acts of discrimination, when the most scandalous discrimination is directed at Europeans, on their own soil; that about growth, with no mention ever being made of purchasing power and consumption, of the explosion in the number of poor workers or of the responsibilities of the euro; and, finally, that about 'blessed globalisation', which is an oxymoron."
"Your eternal solution is to have yet more Europe."
"Really, you deserve to fail!"
"in writing. I and my British Conservative colleagues have supported this motion for a resolution as we have always been supportive of the aims of the Lisbon Strategy to enhance Europe's competitiveness and the development of a dynamic and innovative economy, improve labour market flexibility and promote deregulation in the EU."
"We also support the call for Member States to refrain from protectionism."
"We believe that this resolution broadly supports these aims."
"This does not mean that we endorse the entire list of detailed policy measures listed in the resolution."
"Rather we are supportive of the broad thrust of what we believe to be the liberalising effect of the text, which is absolutely overdue."
"in writing. I am particularly supportive of the amendment which calls for the promotion of ILO core labour standards and decent work agenda."
"Further, I support the avoidance of environmental dumping as a crucial element of fair competition."
"Social and environmental aspects must be built into trade development."
"in writing. The 2010 deadline of achieving the Lisbon goal of becoming the most dynamic and knowledge-based economy in the world is looming."
"Part of this goal is about getting more women back into the workplace."
"During the Barcelona Summit of 2002 agreement was reached by Member States that by 2010 a third of children under three and 90% of children aged three to six would be provided with childcare places."
"Apparently only five Member States have achieved this goal."
"If we want more women to enjoy the freedom of work we need to have the availability of quality and affordable childcare as a key political priority."
"I voted against the joint resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe presenting ideas for the 2007 spring Council in relation to the Lisbon Strategy."
"Indeed, two paragraphs that I considered crucial have been adopted by my fellow Members, even though I feel that they go against my European convictions."
"Firstly, the European Parliament has agreed to support the policy permitting the private funding of universities and to encourage the private sector to give its verdict on market needs regarding education and training."
"This measure may lead to a form of competition between universities, which could compromise equality in university education."
"Furthermore, the European Parliament has decided to ask the Member States to review the ineffective social models in the light of their long-term financial viability, of developing global dynamics and of demographic trends, with the aim of making these social models more sustainable."
"In my view, this amounts to nothing more and nothing less than a blatant threat to our social security systems."
"Merely because of these two options, I decided, contrary to my convictions, to vote against this resolution."
"The joint resolution on the Lisbon Strategy by the Group of the European People's Party (European Democrats) and Christian Democrats, social democrats and liberals adopted by the European Parliament proves once again the agreement between the political spokesmen of capital on promoting their strategic choices."
"The priority of euro-unifying capital is the effective and fast promotion of the guidelines of the Lisbon Strategy, which expresses its ambition to increase its profits, so that it can be imposed on monopoly competition through a barbaric attack on all the rights earned by the working classes."
"The objectives of the strategy of capital loyally applied by the New Democracy government, with the support of PASOK, are set out in the resolution; in other words, the advent of capital in the sectors of health, welfare and education, through public private partnerships, the position of research in serving the monopolies, the liberalisation and commercialisation of energy, the restructuring of employment relations and the abolition of the social insurance system."
"Particular importance is attached to adjusting the education system to the needs of the competitiveness of capital."
"The Greek Communist Party group in the European Parliament voted against the resolution and calls on the working classes to step up its fight against all the anti-grassroots policies of the ÎU and its 'centre right' and 'centre left' governments and to claim permanent, stable employment with rights, a national social insurance and health system and free state education."
"in writing. (SV) The proposal contains quite a few constructive proposals concerning the importance of increased competition and improved conditions for enterprise and innovation."
"However, the Lisbon process must be regarded primarily as a national matter, which is why it is unfortunate that Parliament is getting involved in a number of areas that it is for the individual Member States to decide on."
"For example, the report discusses how the Member States are to organise their social insurance and how they are to guarantee that everyone who leaves school is offered work or can take advantage of measures aimed at making them employable."
"I am therefore voting against this resolution."
"The text adopted today, which follows on from the Commission communication on the Community's policy on the radio spectrum, is rather contradictory in some areas as it creates the impression of bringing together ideologically opposed positions."
"The report contains proposals aimed, inter alia, at safeguarding public service(s); maintaining a certain, possibly high, level of national sovereignty when it comes to managing the spectrum; transferring some of the benefits arising from the new technologies to the least developed regions; recovering frequencies for the public domain where they are not used in accordance with the commitments made; protecting public interests and frequencies of strategic importance; and maintaining high levels of quality in 'services of public or general interest'."
"It also makes a point, however, of welcoming the Commission's proposal to introduce a market-based approach to the spectrum and to establish a clear legal framework providing for competition-based solutions."
"Ultimately, despite its good intentions, it gives the green light to pursuing neoliberal policies and to worshipping at the altar of the market, which will jeopardise the provision of public services."
"in writing. I voted in favour of this report as it argues for fair and non-discriminatory access to spectrum and maintains that all technologies should be treated the same."
"A combined approach to the management of the spectrum, in order to achieve greater flexibility and market reponsiveness, will contribute to social and economic benefits arising from its use."
"in writing. I would like to support the rapporteur in attempting to address the serious concerns over efforts to exclude broadcasting frequencies from the proposals, in particular regarding the digital dividend which will become available following switchovers to digital broadcasting."
"There is a need to push broadcasters to use spectrum efficiently."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"

"External dimension of the fight against terrorism (debate)"
"rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, international terrorism is the most dangerous threat to peace, security, human dignity and integrity."
"Being an invisible enemy, which is geographically diffuse, and which can be found inside and outside of our borders, it needs to be fought in a way that is different to the way the European Union has had to fight its enemies in the past."
"The European Union's anti-terrorist strategy must be global, multilateral and based on the United Nations system."
"Any unilateral and exclusively military response is doomed to failure."
"The fight against terrorism will be won in the field of values."
"It is therefore crucial, in order to defeat terrorism morally, to increase the awareness of it and mobilise our public opinion."
"We must at no point lower our guard."
"We must not just react following a massive attack, but rather we should act in a permanent and proactive manner."
"A strengthened CFSP is vital to our success."
"This means making improvements, providing better resources and better coordination amongst European intelligence and information services and more work on uncovering terrorism's funding channels."
"In its external actions, the Union must focus on stopping certain States providing support for terrorist groups, through coercive measures and sanctions, and it must help weak States to strengthen their institutions and their democracy in order to prevent them from harbouring terrorists."
"Madam President, preserving the rule of law and human rights in the fight against terrorism is not just absolutely crucial for moral reasons. It is the raison d'etre of our strategy, because that is precisely what the terrorists want to destroy: the values on which our co-existence is based."
"If we give ground in this area, as in the case of the Iraq War, GuantÃ¡namo, Abu Ghraib or the illegal CIA flights, we will be providing the terrorists with excuses, which they will try to use as justification, and we will be fuelling their activities."
"Restricting fundamental rights does not create more security, but rather more fear."
"We need free societies that feel secure in themselves."
"Fearful societies have already lost the fight against terrorism."
"The security/freedom dilemma is a false one."
"We will be safer if we are freer, more open and more inclusive."
"Prevention, which is so important and which failed both on 11 September in New York and on 11 March in Madrid, is crucial, as is greater efficiency in police and judicial action."
"Our CFSP must contribute to eradicating the fertile ground upon which international terrorism thrives."
"Terrorism is never justifiable."
"We must never talk about causes, but rather the circumstances that feed it, the first of which is the humiliation and disdain suffered by millions of Muslims, which they perceive as arrogance on the part of the West, and the exacerbation of endemic conflicts such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"Another is the disrespectful treatment of a religion that is followed peacefully by more than 1 300 million people throughout the world."
"We are dealing with fundamentalist fanatics, who are dogmatic, but not a particular religion or belief."
"We sometimes forget that there have been more Muslim victims of Islamist terrorism than Western victims."
"This explains the international success of initiatives such as the Alliance of Civilisations, adopted by the United Nations, in opposition to the clash of civilisations advocated by fundamentalists from one side or another."
"As well as better resources, international terrorism must be beaten by means of intelligence and tenacity, not by means of inflammatory speeches that only demonstrate fundamental weakness."
"Fascism, firstly, and then Stalinism, decades later, were defeated in the ideological field, without surrendering the principles that lie at the heart of our societies, including freedom of expression exercised in a responsible manner."
"My report places particular emphasis on recognising the victims as principal actors, to whom the public powers must listen."
"We therefore have four direct victims of the massive attack of 11 March in Madrid in the gallery. JesÃºs RamÃ­rez Castanedo, JesÃºs Abril Escusa, Isabel Casanova Ortega and Euclides Antonio RÃ­o Grajales."
"I would like to thank them very much for being here."
"Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I would like to thank your House's Committee on Foreign Affairs, and your rapporteur Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a, for the report on the external dimension of the fight against terrorism, which has been presented today."
"It is a comprehensive report and discusses a number of extremely important issues on which we are largely of one mind."
"The terrorist threat is now, more than ever, international in character, and the measures taken by the European Union to overcome it can, in fact, be successful only if they form part of a coordinated global effort at combating terrorism."
"At its meeting in December 2005, the European Council adopted an anti-terrorism strategy for the European Union in which the general outline of the European Union's anti-terrorist measures is marked out, and, at the same meeting, adopted the European Union's strategy for combating radicalisation and recruitment for terrorist purposes, in both of which documents the external dimension of anti-terrorist activity is exhaustively discussed."
"There are three important points that I would like to highlight as regards terrorism's external aspects, namely radicalisation and recruitment, cooperation with external partners and the international legal framework."
"Firstly, the principal object of the anti-terrorist strategy consists in preventing people from resorting to terrorism, and action must also be taken to deal with the factors that can help to radicalise people and make them susceptible to recruitment by terrorist organisations."
"In its foreign policy measures directed against terrorism, the EU has continued to endeavour to consider every possible issue connected with radicalisation and recruitment, and has shared with its external partners its experience and best practices in dealing with the problem."
"The European Union has also broken new ground in including anti-radicalisation measures in a special technical aid programme for combating terrorism."
"Meetings featuring dialogue between religions and cultures have been held as part of the ASEM process and the Barcelona process, and under the auspices of the Anna Lindh Foundation; the EU has also set up working parties to discuss in depth how it might improve its public diplomacy and its contacts with Islam both within the EU and outside it, and we want to continue to move this forward in a determined manner."
"Radicalisation and recruitment will also continue to be addressed in future programmes of technical support in combating terrorism and will remain an important feature of the dialogue with third countries."
"Secondly, there is cooperation with external partners, and, in pursuing its objectives in the field of anti-terrorism, we have continued to collaborate closely with partners outside the European Union."
"The political dialogue with partners is an essential component in the European Union's foreign policy action against terrorism, and the status of respect for the rule of law and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while at the same time combating terrorism as key issues in it reminds me of the debate we had this morning, in which there was a high degree of unanimity."
"A considerable amount of work has been done with a number of countries in order to improve cooperation in the fight against terrorism."
"The European Union and the Member States have agreed to provide technical anti-terrorist support to certain countries that are to be regarded as high-priority cases, and progress has been made in political consultations with others of their kind."
"The European Union has also helped to build up capacity at regional level, for example, at the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation (JCLEC) in Indonesia and the African Union's anti-terrorism centre in Algiers."
"We continue to attach high priority to anti-terrorist cooperation with the United States."
"Politicians and experts from the European Union and the USA have worked together on intensifying their dialogue, and the EU has extended its dialogue on anti-terrorism issues to include other partner countries such as Israel, Australia, Canada and Russia, as well as those that participate with it in the Europe-Mediterranean Partnership, in considering areas of common interest and options for cooperation, notably the provision of technical assistance to other countries."
"Thirdly, in the international legal framework, the European Union has continued to press for a key role to be given to the United Nations in the combating of terrorism."
"Since the adoption of a comprehensive agreement on international terrorism, including a clear and unambiguous definition of it in all its forms and manifestations, would indeed send an important signal and would show the international community taking determined action to counter the terrorist threat, the European Union will continue to make every effort to reach international consensus on one."
"The recent adoption of a United Nations strategy, with the aim of stepping up international cooperation with third countries in combating terrorism also represents an important advance, and the European Union is prepared to join with all other states belonging to the United Nations in implementing it; this is one of its priorities for the future, and it intends to make use of its dialogue with external partners to press for the implementation of this strategy across the board, as also for an exchange of ideas as to how this goal might best be achieved."
"I believe that your House would, by bringing this issue to the attention of your partners in dialogue in third countries, be making a supremely valuable contribution to achieving that goal."
"As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, the institutions of the European Union are largely agreed on the priorities for combating international terrorism."
"I can tell your rapporteur that his report and a long-term exchange of views such as that in which we are currently engaged help to deepen our shared understanding and help us to devise suitable measures to combat international terrorism."
"It would also send a message to those who have been the victims of terrorist atrocities."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, firstly I would like to commend the rapporteur, Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a, for his report."
"Let there be no doubt: terrorism is a threat to all states and to all peoples."
"It is criminal and it is unjustifiable under any circumstances."
"The Commission therefore fully shares the view of the report that terrorism constitutes an important threat to security, to peace, stability and the democratic values on which the European Union is founded."
"The Commission also shares the objective of combating terrorism globally while respecting human rights."
"All anti-terrorist measures must be consistent with both international humanitarian law and international human rights law."
"While largely agreeing with the report, I would like to comment on two points."
"Firstly, the report is calling for the adoption of a definition of terrorism."
"Since the UN has not yet agreed on a definition and since such an agreement still seems distant, although we are working towards that, I would like to recall that relevant universal conventions and protocols already provide a common legal understanding of what constitutes an act of terrorism."
"The Union also has a definition of terrorist acts in its framework decision on terrorism."
"These are solid legal foundations."
"Secondly, the report calls for the extension of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court to include acts of terrorism as crimes against humanity."
"I think we should be cautious, before altering the definition of crimes against humanity included in the ICC Statute."
"Such an endeavour might be counter-productive in the efforts to broaden support for the Court."
"The complex relationship between international humanitarian law and the definition of terrorism may lead to further complications."
"The Commission welcomes the interest of the Parliament on the external aspects of the fight against terrorism."
"In the current environment of open borders, efforts to fight against terrorism, internally and externally, are aspects that are closely linked."
"It goes without saying that Vice-President Frattini and I are working closely together in order to make these efforts mutually reinforcing."
"We strongly agree on the need to support the United Nations consistently with our policy of effective multilateralism."
"Equally, the emphasis put on prevention is very important for the Commission."
"Conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism need to be tackled."
"Tackling the root causes of terrorism lies at the heart of our external policies, and the report's recommendations for a more coherent and effective EU policy also largely go in the right direction."
"Let me highlight the important contribution that the Commission makes to the fight against terrorism."
"Firstly, with Member States, the Commission is implementing the 2005 EU counter-terrorism strategy, of which our colleague and President has talked."
"Terrorism also features regularly during meetings with our partners and in international organisations."
"For example, as I speak, a major meeting is under way with Commission participation in Berlin in order to prepare the Heiligendamm Summit of the G8 in the areas of terrorism and organised crime."
"Secondly, the Commission is an important provider of capacity-building assistance to some 80 third countries aimed at improving governance and administrative capacities in related areas."
"A number of priority fields mentioned in the report, such as border management and terrorist financing, are priorities for Community assistance."
"Thirdly, the Commission is working in new areas which should improve EU action in the fight against terrorism, such as the protection of critical infrastructure, the fight against violent radicalisation and terrorist recruitment, bioterrorism, radiological threats, explosive detection technologies, terrorist use of the internet, as well as terrorism in the context of crisis management, and there are obvious links to our efforts in fighting organised crime and drug trafficking."
"Afghanistan is, for instance, a serious case in point."
"Finally, and in reply to one of the requests of this report, the Commission wishes to confirm that it intends to produce a communication in the course of 2007 focusing on global and trans-regional security challenges."
"The focus will include key aspects relevant to human security and focus on counter-terrorism."
"You may be aware of my personal commitment to support the human security discourse."
"What better way could there be to address conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism than to promote both freedom from fear and freedom from want."
"Despite what is being done, I think we can all agree that we must work together and enhance our collective performance in fighting against terrorism."
"We will try to play our part, but we are certain that the collective effort with Parliament will be a more important one."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (FR) Madam President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Gloser, ladies and gentlemen, I have been given the task, on behalf of the Committee on Development, of drafting an opinion on this report on the external dimension of the fight against terrorism, which was drafted by my colleague, Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"We can only talk about this issue by adopting an approach that encompasses our development policies, for the benefit of the countries of the South, in particular."
"As uncompromising as it certainly is, this opinion highlights a series of crucial points, which have already been addressed in this House, concerning the very definition of terrorism, respect for human rights and relations with the various migrant populations of Europe, in particular."
"This opinion also deals with the issue of the difficult coexistence between the fight against terrorism and the need to safeguard respect for human rights in all circumstances, so that no one can justify the denial of the one for the sake of the other."
"Our report then goes on to raise the issue of the fight against terrorism from the perspective of the repercussions that its funding methods may have on the quality and effectiveness of European development cooperation."
"Thus, we highlight, for example, the fact that, currently, a large number of measures adopted by the Member States that do not come directly under a policy for reducing poverty in the countries of the South have sadly been included in official development aid."
"These include, for example, the funding of military investments, the repatriation of illegal immigrants, some immigration policy-related expenditure, and I could go on."
"The Committee on Development also wishes to draw our Parliament's attention to the fact that, by including in official development aid financial support for a range of activities connected with the fight against terrorism, we will merely be further compromising its main objective, which is to eradicate poverty."
"This opinion was adopted by nearly all of the members of the Committee on Development, on 6 November."
"However, the majority of the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs sadly did not think it worthwhile to adopt any of the paragraphs in this opinion."
"That is why we have decided to re-introduce the main thrusts of this text, in the form of amendments to the report, and I therefore call on all of the democratic groups to endorse them so that, alongside the necessary fight against terrorism, we can carry out effective development policies aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which represent the real long-term - even very long-term - solution to terrorism and to all the suffering that it leaves in its disastrous wake."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - (ES) The fight against terrorism is a priority that requires solidarity from all of the Member States and commitment from the democratic countries."
"Security is a genuine fundamental right that cannot be exercised at any expense, but in strict accordance with the law and respect for human rights."
"International terrorism threatens human rights and freedoms."
"The sinister distinction between murdering terrorists and political terrorists, between armed wings and political wings, only makes the whole thing even more criminal to the detriment of the law."
"To hold dialogue of any kind with terrorists is unfair, pointless and offensive to the victims."
"The Member States must pay particular attention to promoting intercultural relations and enhancing inter-religious dialogue amongst the members of civil society, with a view to improving co-existence, tolerance and mutual understanding."
"The Union must rationalise, coordinate and facilitate the actions of its instruments, Europol, Eurojust, Cepol and the Situation Centre, and others pursuing the same aims, in order to detect and prevent links between terrorism and other forms of crime."
"I would ask, Madam President, when drawing up prevention strategies, that the horrendous experiences of the victims be respected and taken into account in particular, as I say in my report."
"The victims must be acknowledged and protected."
"Terrorists begin to lose when the victims make the truth of their experiences known and society listens to them."
"With regard to prevention, Madam President, prevention cannot and must not be used as a missile amongst democratic countries and States."
"The last time prevention failed was on 30 December 2006 in Madrid."
"We do not criticise failures in prevention. We work hard to ensure that they never happen again."
"I shall draw to a close, Madam President."
"We will only be able to tackle terrorism with determination when all of the democratic countries, together, and the Union in the singular, have a clear view of the threat, and the threat is lethal, permanent and destined to remain with us."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating you, Madam President, on your office as Vice-President, in which capacity you represent the region of Eastern Westphalia-Lippe, from which we both come, and that is cause for pride."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and point out that terrorism is a cross-border phenomenon."
"We will succeed in countering it only if cross-border cooperation is in place within the European Union and with the states and organisations outside it."
"Putting this in place is often a slow business, particularly if we consider the internal policy aspect of our shared security problem, which is still arranged between the states, and that is why implementing the positions of the individual Member States can sometimes be very laborious."
"That is evidence of the fact that, if we want to be more secure against terrorism and organised crime, we need the European Constitution as a more effective means of making obligations in the common sphere more binding and improving the decision-making process."
"Along with close cooperation between the security bodies, it is also urgently necessary that the causes of terrorism be addressed."
"There may be no justification for terrorism, but it does have its causes, to which we have to give our attention, and I see political, economic and social issues as being of great significance here."
"There must also be no more token gestures of a certain kind."
"If it were to be possible, for a joint effort, for example by way of the Quartet, to resolve the Middle East issue, that would take much of the wind out of terrorism's sails."
"I cite that as only one example of the interconnections that exist in this area."
"Something that is apparent from the report, and that I find most especially important, is the need for us to make use of inter-cultural dialogue."
"We have to make it clear to people in the other regions of the world, too, that we value their culture, their religion, and their development as equal to our own, if such causes of dissension are not to arise from feelings of cultural inferiority."
"That is a particular duty."
"All these things have to be done in accordance with the rule of law and with respect for our values, for, if we surrender the latter, the other side will have won, and that is why we have to take our values and the rule of law as our shield."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, terrorist acts are always criminal, but terrorism is also always a political project."
"I think its current manifestation aims to subvert the humanitarian values of equality, whether it be between gender, religion or nationality."
"It also seeks to undermine civil rights - the civil rights of a plural democracy."
"But we have to be very careful in expressing those values."
"If we choose to call them 'our' values rather than treating them as universal values, I think we will fall into the trap of the 'clash of civilisations'."
"Our best defence of those values, therefore, has to be primarily political."
"We must demonstrate the strength of those values by ensuring freedom and quality of life for all in Europe and globally."
"Security measures certainly have to be applied: the collection of intelligence, the prosecution of lawbreakers and, indeed, the prevention and prosecution of incitement to hatred and violence."
"But the Fava report, which we spent a long time discussing this morning, indicates what can go badly wrong if we are not extremely careful."
"We have to avoid simplistic analysis."
"We have to avoid the assumption that every political or religious fundamentalist is a terrorist - that is simply not true, and I think it is important that we bear that in mind."
"I know lots of fundamentalist Catholics who would be appalled at the idea that anybody would commit a terrorist act in their name."
"I would appeal for deeper analysis than we are currently getting, and caution about the language we are using."
"I would argue that, if we are going to be successful, we have to deal with inequalities on our continent, but also inequalities globally as well."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against global manifestations of terrorism is a decisive test of democratic Europe's capacity to act."
"In order to pre-empt and prevent brutal acts of terrorism, the special services must be able to make use of the most effective preventive and repressive methods, and this is unthinkable without international cooperation."
"The report by Mr Fava contains a lot of criticism of the United States, but we must realise that we need even closer cooperation between the European Union and the USA as compared with that to date, that it is necessary for the USA and Europe to take united common action against the ideological causes of terrorism, and that we need a closer exchange of information, based on mutual trust."
"The European Parliament and the members of the national parliaments of the Member States also need to be involved in a more focused and professional way in the drafting and implementation of the general strategy on terrorism, and active cooperation between the Member States' services must be fostered."
"In carrying out parliamentary supervision, we must ensure greater professionalism and political responsibility, especially when monitoring the lawfulness of the methods used in counter-terrorism measures."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Firstly, I would like to welcome Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo's efforts to tackle an issue which is complex and which is often subject to debates that have more to do with party politics than the fundamental issues."
"But above all I would like to thank him for showing great sensitivity towards at least three of the issues that our group considers to be important."
"The first has also been mentioned by the Commissioner, and relates to the problem of the definition."
"The first significant problem facing us is the fact that it will be difficult for the European Union to combat terrorism in a consistent and credible fashion unless we have a definition."
"Although it is true that there are many, shall we say, differing opinions on this matter, we would like to make a concrete proposal, and that is to work on the basis of the proposal which was presented and approved within the United Nations on the proposal of the then Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in turn on the proposal of the High-Level Group."
"We therefore already have certain significant proposals on the table on which to base our work."
"The second element of concern to us, of course, relates to the fact that the supposed fight against terrorism is often used to justify wars, massacres and torture. We saw that this morning when we discussed the Fava report, and elsewhere."
"That is what cannot be allowed to happen."
"We therefore also applaud, welcome and support the proposal to include acts of terrorism as crimes against humanity within the context of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, so that that Court can deal with them as well."
"Finally, another issue that we believe to be important is that, with regard to the existence of anti-terrorist lists, which have often proven to be counterproductive for certain peace processes in the world, it is also necessary to bear in mind that the current situation, on the one hand, sometimes leads to arbitrary detentions, and on the other, it hinders the efforts being made by the European Union in situations such as the Middle East, Sri Lanka, etc."
"Therefore, the issue of anti-terrorist lists should also at least be revised and studied, on the basis of what has been approved by the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, I have to say, Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a, that your speech was markedly better than your report, a certain amount of material in which was, I am aware, whispered in your ear, and it is regrettable that the Committee on Development's opinion was not also adopted."
"Terrorism, of any kind, is utterly unacceptable, but it is unfortunate that the report provides us with no concrete definition of what terrorism is, although it always talks in terms of 'international terrorism'."
"There exists the widest possible variety of groups, which, for the most diverse reasons, believe that they have to commit terrorist acts."
"We have to consider each of them individually and establish just why they come to the erroneous conclusion that terrorist acts are necessary."
"It also appears to me that whole subjects have been left out completely - state-sponsored terrorism, for example."
"What about France's past attack on the Greenpeace ship?"
"As a number of Members have already said, we have to address the causes of terrorism."
"At the moment, the Western states are engaged in a war on terror - in Afghanistan and Iraq - that is proving to be completely counter-productive, for while this war is being waged, terrorism is on the increase rather than declining."
"We read in the report that measures are to be made more stringent in all manner of ways, and that fundamental rights are to be more and more eroded, and it is for that reason that we cannot endorse it."
"We have therefore submitted a minority report on the subject."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, the rapporteur is absolutely right to mention the medium of the high-speed and global Internet as being part of the phenomenon of international terrorism, but he does so in a paradoxical fashion."
"While paragraph 12 appeals to the European Union to fight the misuse of the Internet for terrorist purposes, in paragraph 17, the rapporteur highlights the scope the Internet offers to trace, and thus resist, this self-same evil."
"At the moment, the growing number of Islamic terror websites are already demanding our urgent attention, for these form the virtual recruitment and training grounds of young Jihadists in Europe."
"Allow me to quote the European intelligence service: 'these days, it is possible to become a terrorist simply by the information on the Internet'."
"Indeed, no more than a simple mouse-click is enough."
"This terrifying reality demands an intensive and cohesive European approach, and, mark my words, both internally and externally."
"Hence my request to the Commission and Council to provide this House with more factual information, given the intense threat emanating from terrorist websites, of which it is estimated that there are already some 4 500 Internet pages, in an attempt to trace them and indeed, to fight them in an effective manner and at European level."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Madam President, when this House discusses the fight against terrorism, there is the risk of us promptly falling back on politically correct commonplaces which hamper effective policy, or even make it impossible."
"As the report rightly suggests, international terrorism currently represents the biggest threat to peace and stability in open societies, and the most direct threat to freedom, security and human dignity."
"International terrorism has declared war on the whole of the western world, and that includes Europe."
"It is therefore of the utmost importance for us to clearly identify this threat."
"When I read in recital A of the report words such as 'international terrorism and the associated ideology', then I fear that we are going the wrong way."
"Terrorism is not an ideology in itself, and neither is it a goal in itself."
"As the chairman of the Arab television station al-Arabiya asserted a few years ago, it is a painful reality that these days, although not all Muslims are terrorists, all terrorists are Muslim."
"It is a witticism which, like all witticisms, contains a grain of truth."
"It is fashionable in Europe to say that we do not want a Clash of Civilisations, but whether we like it or not, this Clash of Civilisations is in full swing."
"We must continue to fight poverty, and, of course, give our support, but we should not be naÃ¯ve in thinking that this will also fully address terrorism."
"The perpetrators of the attacks in New York, London and Madrid were not poor; quite on the contrary, they were middle-class and highly educated."
"It would therefore be in the EU's interest to introduce democratic ideas, including the free expression of opinion, into the Islamic world."
"What should really be established over there on a big scale is a kind of Radio Freedom."
"Is this a plea to stigmatise all Muslims?"
"Not at all."
"What is important, though, is that within Islam, such things as self-criticism and introspection should be promoted."
"A few weeks ago, it turned out that the chairman of the Muslim Executive in Belgium - this is the official government body, funded and recognised by the government - had given money to a convicted terrorist who is held in a Belgian jail."
"This is bad enough as it is."
"What I find worse, though, is that there was no reaction whatsoever to this incident from the Muslim quarters in Belgium."
"Quite the reverse; the resulting silence gave the impression that, at the least, people in those quarters were not at all shocked that the Chairman of the Muslim Executive, who claims to speak on behalf of all Muslims in Belgium, should give indirect support to terrorism."
"This is disquieting and we should challenge it."
"Madam President, terrorism is irredeemably evil."
"Its wicked persona is not to be excused or ameliorated."
"Sadly, the GUE/NGL minority report tries to do exactly that, with its focus on the economic and social causes of terrorism, its attack on the war on terror and its diversionary reference to what it calls 'state terrorism'."
"I am not surprised, because embedded in GUE/NGL is Sinn FÃ©in, the long-term friend and political affiliate of terrorists."
"We have heard much talk of human rights, as if fighting terrorism and a belief in human rights were incompatible."
"Remember that terrorists are those who set out to destroy all tenets of liberal democracy, who refuse to live by our civilised laws, but who are adept at exploiting them when it suits their nefarious purposes."
"Coming from Northern Ireland, I have seen that at first hand."
"Sometimes, if society is to survive, it must fight back."
"Some, I fear, would so cloak themselves in an exaggerated human rights mantra that they would see society perish sooner than terror."
"This is a world of harsh choices."
"Rabid Islamic terrorism is a particular threat to every liberty that the Western world holds dear."
"It plays not by the rules, but embraces a perverted death culture that rejoices in mass murder."
"With such people we cannot be soft."
"If we are, they will win."
"Yes, there must be a winner between good and evil, between terror and order, and it is the duty of all of us to see that good triumphs and terror is vanquished."
"Madam President, This is a very important report with different emphases."
"One of the big problems seems to be that numerous states have not been willing to counter the terrorist threat efficiently."
"As you mentioned, Madam Commissioner, even several UN member states have not been able to agree on an international definition of terrorism."
"Against this background I think the main challenge for us is to strengthen and enhance the efficiency of transatlantic cooperation and coordination."
"That also means fully implementing the EU-US cooperation declarations."
"I wonder whether concentrating on suspicions and accusations might give the misleading impression that US intelligence is not our ally but the main adversary."
"At the same time, I would like to pay tribute to our own anti-terrorist efforts."
"They have succeeded in preventing many new terrorist attacks in the UK, Germany and the United States."
"But the urgent need is obviously for closer cooperation between the EU Member States and special agencies."
"I can only support the idea that the EU anti-terrorist coordinator be given a stronger mandate and more resources."
"I think paragraph 9 is especially relevant."
"It states that one of the EU's external actions should be aimed at preventing extremist groups and states from resorting to terrorism."
"I think this is a key to practical solutions."
"Without the support of such states as Iran, terrorist initiatives will be dramatically reduced."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I should like, if I may, to begin my speech by congratulating Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a on his outstanding report."
"The positive aspect of this report is, to my mind, the balance it achieves between the need, on the one hand, for a firm, uncompromising approach coupled with more effective international coordination in the fight against terrorism, and on the other hand, the need to maintain human and civil rights and the principle of the rule of law."
"The report also takes account of factors contributing to the radicalisation and recruitment of terrorists, be they outside or actually within Europe."
"Among these factors are extreme poverty, lack of access to education, social, economic, ethnic and religious discrimination and collective disenchantment."
"I firmly believe that the gradual elimination of these factors and causes is a vitally important prerequisite for successfully combating terrorism."
"I should also like, in conclusion, to urge, through the Council, those EU Member States that have not yet done so, to sign or ratify at the earliest opportunity the 16 United Nations universal instruments on combating terrorism. Thank you."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when debating the violated rights of our esteemed terrorists this morning, Parliament was packed full, with the Commission Presidency and all the European institutions' authorities."
"Now, however, when it is time to debate and take stock of the strategy for combating terrorism and, above all, for protecting Europe's citizens against the looming threat of terrorism, few of the people involved are present."
"One day, somebody will write the story of Europe's fight against terrorism and they will pick on this, together with the serious mistake we made this morning in adopting the Fava report, which is a huge gift to al-Qa'ida."
"The report rightly states that we need to examine the factors contributing to radicalisation."
"We know what these factors are: they are the mosques and Islamic centres."
"It is time we started to say that quite plainly here in Parliament."
"Madam President, this report starts from the false premise that international terrorism constitutes the greatest threat to the democratic international community."
"Likewise, President Bush's concept of a war on terror is mistaken."
"Violence and terrorism are only means to an end."
"The greatest threat to the free democratic world comes from an ideology. The ideology in question is that of the fundamentalist and extremist Islam, which by means of terror seeks first to impose its psychological, and then ultimately its physical dominion on the world."
"They believe that time and demography are on their side and they have declared war on us."
"Sun Tzu remarked that the first place to win a war is in the mind of the enemy."
"Islamic fundamentalists might conclude that they are well on the road to winning that war when its victims do not confront the fundamental cause of the problem."
"The solution is not for the European Union to concentrate more power in its hands, as is predictably recommended in this report."
"The solution is to recognise that fundamentalist, extremist and literal Islam is incompatible with Western liberal democracy and indeed any kind of civilisation."
"From that starting point we can begin to adopt concrete measures to combat its manifestations through the actions of nation states and international cooperation."
"Had I longer than 90 seconds to speak, I could have told you what some of those measures might be."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by extending my own solidarity to the victims of the Madrid bombings with us today."
"In debating international action to combat terrorism, let us recognise that such solidarity extends internationally and that the countries of the Middle East, Africa and Asia have suffered far more from terrorism over the past decade than we have in Europe or the West."
"It is right to seek international cooperation, as terrorists themselves exploit globalisation through the internet, mobile communications, the media and the covert movement of people and of funds."
"Europe should consistently use its foreign policies to encourage all third countries to sign, ratify and implement the 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism."
"However, we must be consistent too in insisting that we cannot protect the rights and liberties of our own citizens by denying those of others beyond our borders."
"Our commitment must be to address the underlying conditions that draw people into terrorism, by working to improve respect for human rights, to promote democracy and good governance, to resolve conflict and to tackle world poverty and to roundly reject those, like the last speaker, who falsely seek to equate terrorism with religion by upholding our commitment to promote mutual understanding and cultural awareness in Europe and throughout the world."
"Madam President, the reason why I omitted to congratulate you is that I was not in fact thinking of the great region of Westphalia-Lippe, which Mr Brok, too, calls home."
"Thank you, Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, for this exchange of views."
"In any debate of this kind, there will of course - how could it be otherwise? - be differences and divergent views, but there is also agreement, and many of you made reference to this morning's debate, in which, too, there were of course considerable differences of opinion, yet unanimity prevailed when it came to the question of how to combat international terrorism while also maintaining our common values."
"A society such as our own is pluralistic and open."
"The public's right to security is, of course, one of the fundamental freedoms, but how can that security be guaranteed?"
"Although this is an area that can, perhaps, be regulated only by the Member States, it is becoming more and more apparent - as a number of your Members have indicated - that there is a need for coordination, that is to say, for cooperation across borders, which also includes cross-border cooperation between Europe and the United States."
"If we are to talk today about the causes of terrorism, it might be said that there is a holistic and long-term approach to it."
"One of your Members warned that perhaps the wrong measures might be taken under the heading of 'prevention', which I see as a very important consideration."
"I would like to go back to the example of last November's Tripoli conference between the African Union and the European Union on the subject of migration."
"How we handle 'good governance' in these countries and give their peoples the prospect of education and work, are major issues."
"Do they actually have any prospects at all?"
"Or are they the potential victims of those whose promises to them ultimately result in their deaths?"
"This I see as something from which the European Union cannot avert its gaze."
"As in many other areas, there was vigorous debate among us a number of years ago concerning the European security strategy, when we came to agree that the fight against international terrorism is essential, but also that it called for a highly graduated range of instruments, one of which is prevention."
"None of these measures, however, can be activated at the press of a button, and they cannot be put into effect overnight."
"Doing so will demand staying power and proper coordination."
"I would now like to follow up a number of things that both the Commission and I - in my introductory remarks - mentioned, one of which has to do with the importance of establishing what role the United Nations is to play in this."
"What else can we do?"
"I think it is important that Members of your House - not alone, but with others - should continue a dialogue on this subject with your counterparts in other regions that may perhaps also be suffering from terrorism."
"In saying this, I am thinking back to the establishment of the Europe-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, where one important approach might be to discuss these issues and arrive at an agreement on how to institute coordination and cooperation."
"Let me, once more, sound a note of warning against simplistic answers and quick fixes."
"What is needed within the European Union is preparation for the long haul and a coordinated approach."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, I think this report and the debate on its adoption confirm the importance of the fight against terrorism not only for the Member States, but also for the European Union as a whole."
"It also demonstrates that respect for human rights has to remain the core of our counter-terrorism policies."
"I think our colleague is right: it has to be with patience, but also with persistence, that we fight against terrorism."
"I would like to make just a few comments."
"First, on the question of security and development, I said that I personally have always clung to the system of human security."
"Why?"
"Because I think there is no development without security and no security without development."
"Therefore, freedom from fear - i.e. security for citizens - and freedom from want - i.e. prosperity rather than poverty - have to be our goal and, therefore, this is as much as a development issue as it is a foreign policy issue."
"Second, I would also like to speak about the victims of terrorism."
"(ES) I welcome the victims of terrorism who are here with us."
"Victims of terrorism require our full attention, and the ways to assist them are under discussion in a number of international fora."
"The Commission will also follow these discussions with the greatest interest."
"Furthermore, assistance to victims of terrorism is provided through a number of financial programmes run by the services of Vice-President Frattini, and also by ourselves: for instance, in Colombia, where we are working hard on the reinsertion of former soldiers of the different terrorist organisations."
"Dialogue between cultures and civilisations is also highly important, and I cannot agree that this should be restricted to extremist and fundamentalist Islamists."
"They exist, but there are also other terrorists."
"Therefore, please let us not restrict the debate to this group alone: it is much broader, and it is very important that we not only respect different religions and civilisations, but also that we work with each other, talk to each other and have an ongoing dialogue."
"I should also like to say a word on the issue of the Internet, which is one of the important areas under discussion in the G8, in the Rome/Lyons Group."
"There are a lot of complexities, since important aspects - for instance, freedom of the press - are involved, not least in the United States."
"What is involved?"
"Sharing knowledge, helping to understand terrorists, the use of the Internet for radicalisation and recruitment, for propaganda and fund-raising, sharing best practices, how we can work against it on a voluntary basis, fine methodologies, etc. I just wanted to say to Mr Belder that there is quite a lot going on."
"Finally, it is in this spirit that the Commission will also examine the very important remarks and recommendations that have been made and are included in this report."
"The overall objective remains to improve the efficiency and coherence of our collective efforts, and I think cooperation between the three institutions will be key to success in the long run."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - International terrorism is like a deadly disease."
"We often see it as someone else's misfortune until it strikes home."
"Ultimately, however, in a direct or indirect way all countries, and even institutions, are drawn into the cauldron."
"Terrorism knows no borders and is indiscriminate."
"One has only to review the names of those who died in 9/11 to realise that the victims derived from so many different countries and adhered to all the major religions."
"Can we talk, however, of a war on terror?"
"In war your enemies are known."
"In terrorist scenarios these are unknown."
"A main topic of public international law is the Laws of War."
"This is completely alien when dealing with terrorists."
"However we have managed to produce some form of legal approach in combating terrorism."
"One of the more meaningful documents was adopted in Barcelona having regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Code of Conduct on Countering Terrorism."
"The participating countries made no less than 21 obligations to fight terrorism."
"Perhaps this should act as a blueprint and if these obligations are adhered to at least one region will be earnestly addressing this calamity."
"EC-Russia short-stay visa agreement - EC-Russia readmission agreement (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Mrs da AssunÃ§Ã£o Esteves, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation on the facilitation of issuance of short-stay visas - C6-0169/2006 -, and"
"the report by Mrs da AssunÃ§Ã£o Esteves, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation on readmission - C6-0168/2006 -."
"Mr President, on this occasion, I am speaking on behalf of both the Commission and the Council, both of which are entirely supportive of your House's concerns as regards respect for human rights in the Russian Federation, and confirm that respect for human rights is fundamental to the implementation of the agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation relating to visa facilitation and readmission."
"You will be able carefully to monitor compliance with this aspect of the readmission agreement and of the agreement on visa facilitation through the joint committees set up pursuant to them, and, under the second of the two, you will also be keeping an eye on the principle of mutuality in the implementation of the agreement, on equal treatment in the registration of citizens of the European Union and of the Russian Federation and on the free movement of persons within the territory of the latter."
"Respect for human rights and basic freedoms is fundamental to relations between the European Union and Russia as a whole, which are underpinned by the partnership and cooperation agreements and by the timetables for the shared areas."
"The European Union and the Russian Federation have also, in accordance with the timetable for the common area of freedom, security and justice, agreed to step up their cooperation through respect for the rights of individuals in the EU Member States and Russia, including those of immigrants and members of minorities, as well as respect for fundamental rights and freedoms as described in the Convention on Human Rights and Basic Freedoms and in the International Convention against all forms of racial discrimination."
"The same timetable also makes reference to the promotion of cooperation in protecting the rights of children, in connection with which soundings have been taken to consider the possibility of accession to international agreements on the subject."
"Another opportunity for putting general questions to Russia is afforded to the European Union by the human rights consultations between the two, which are held every six months."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Mrs Esteves, and the rapporteurs of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Pinior and Mr Vatanen, for their reports on visa facilitation and readmission agreements."
"They reflect the European Parliament's concerns and the advice to which the Commission will pay great attention in monitoring the implementation of the two agreements."
"I wish to confirm the joint Council-Commission statement that was just heard by you, that Vice-President Frattini and I have addressed to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs at the request of its chairman, Mr Cavada."
"I would not underestimate the concerns the European Union has over the human rights situation in Russia."
"We remain worried about the shortcomings regarding in particular the rule of law and media freedom in Russia."
"I understand and share the concerns raised by the European Parliament in this regard."
"The Commission has always looked to the European Parliament as an ally in its promotion of the principles of democracy and the universality of human rights in our relations with partner countries such as Russia."
"For their own sake, but also because they are cornerstones of peace and human development, they are indeed agreed common values and the foundations of the long-term strategic partnership which the European Union wants to have with Russia."
"Since the beginning, the Commission has been and will continue to emphasise to the Russian authorities that our strategic partnership is based on common values which underpin EU-Russia relations as enshrined in the partnership and cooperation agreement and in the four Common Spaces roadmaps."
"They explicitly foresee the strengthening of our cooperation through respect of individual rights in the EU Member States and Russia."
"The readmission agreement fully respects human rights and fundamental freedoms and is consistent with the EU's human rights policies."
"Article 18 of the agreement explicitly clarifies that it is without prejudice to the rights, obligations and responsibilities of the Community, the Member States and the Russian Federation arising from international law, in particular from the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention, the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights and the 1984 UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment."
"The practical implementation of the readmission agreement will fall under the exclusive competence of the Member States and Russia's national authorities."
"All of those authorities are directly bound by the above-mentioned international instruments and their individual return decisions are subject to judicial review before national courts."
"As far as asylum seekers are concerned, I would like to clarify that they are not included in the scope of the readmission agreement."
"They have for the duration of their asylum procedure a temporary right to stay in the territory of Member States."
"The agreement covers only illegal immigrants, that means people who do not or no longer fulfil the conditions in force for entry to, presence in, or residence in the territory."
"In the case of asylum applications at the border, the principle of non refoulement has in particular to be fully respected by Member States in accordance with Article 18 of the Agreement."
"Honourable Members, the extension of our common borders after the EU enlargement has of course broadened the scope of our cooperation with Russia."
"Russia is, and should be, a strategic partner and an important neighbour to the European Union."
"Now migration policy and movement of people have become strategic priorities for the EU's external relations in general and with Russia in particular."
"I firmly believe that only by engaging with Russia can we achieve real results in those areas of common concern."
"Through visa facilitation, we are decisively contributing to the common objective of building a new Europe without dividing lines and facilitating travel among our citizens."
"We are fostering trust and dialogue."
"People-to-people contacts are intensifying and our economic and societal interaction is increasing to the benefit of all our citizens."
"Through readmission we are effectively fighting illegal migration, contributing to joint migration management."
"Finally, the first agreement on visa facilitation ever negotiated by the Community and the first readmission agreement concluded with a major partner country are tangible signs of our practical cooperation within the aforementioned common space on freedom, security and justice."
"They are evidence of our resolve to successfully address common challenges with Russia."
"They will remain, I think, as landmark, sectoral agreements within the overall new architecture provided by the strategic agreement on which we hope to launch negotiations with Russia soon."
"As you had two reports, you were entitled to two times five minutes, making ten minutes, but you were concise and fulfilled your task very well."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we examine objectively the Agreement we have reached, there is no denying that it is a step in the right direction, albeit a very modest one."
"We have to remember that the original proposal was very modest in scope."
"One of the three main things that still cause difficulties for travellers in Russia is the registration requirement."
"How can travellers today still be required to register with the police at different places?"
"In practice, this completely prevents normal motoring in Russia."
"The Russian Federation recently introduced a law which prevents undesirable persons from entering Russia."
"What criteria are being used, though?"
"Is entry into Russia denied to those who have found fault with Russia, the Kremlin, Putin or his speech at Munich?"
"Are these the criteria used to make someone an undesirable person in Russia?"
"There are regions in Russia, such as Chechnya and other areas, where travellers cannot even go."
"What is hard to take in this whole situation is the fact that this reflects the relationship between the EU and Russia."
"It shows how we are unable to resolve problems on an equal footing."
"The Commission spoke fine words about common values, but where are they exactly?"
"If we had common values, we would also be able to conclude balanced agreements that served the interests of both sides and our common future."
"If we accept such one-sided agreements as this one, we will actually slow down Russia's transition to the rule of law."
"In this Agreement there are echoes of a time gone by, and if we take an honest look at our partnership and its development, we will need to start drawing up a new agreement immediately."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (PL) Mr President, I was the author of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the Council's decision concerning the conclusion of an agreement between the European Union and the Russian Federation on readmission."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs welcomed the conclusion of an agreement between the European Union and the Russian Federation on readmission, in parallel to the visa facilitation agreement."
"This represents a further step toward completing the creation of an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, within the framework of the strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs also believes that it is necessary to enhance the capacity of the Russian Federation in the field of migration management, in order for its authorities to be able to fulfil the obligations stipulated in the readmission agreement, as soon as this agreement enters into force."
"The committee was also concerned about the absence of regulatory framework provisions for implementing the Agreement."
"The European Commission should seek to provide the Russian authorities with the necessary expertise in order for the country to be in a position to meet its obligations according to accepted international standards."
"That is the most important matter to be dealt with at present."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (LT) I would like to talk about the readmission agreement between the European Union and Russia; although in fact, both agreements - on readmission and on simplification of the issuing procedures of short term visas - are being considered together."
"Relations between the European Union and Russia cover an increasing number of areas."
"If we want these relations to be truly successful, it is necessary for them to be dominated by values, not just technical aspects."
"Only in this way will we be able to achieve the goal of creating a more open Europe, which respects basic values and is able to change the world in a positive way."
"In my opinion, the basic problem relating to the readmission agreement between the European Union and Russia is that it is unclear whether the primary focus is human rights or whether priority is being given to a generalised approach to refoulement of individuals, that is, priority is given to security considerations rather than to humanitarian aspects."
"I fully understand that when readmission agreements are being drafted, the temptation to equate illegal migration with criminal activity must be resisted."
"Similarly, when such agreements are being drafted, there should not be an inclination to focus on the issue of refoulement as a cornerstone of migration policy."
"In our endeavours to obtain satisfactory statistical results, we must still pay particular attention to human rights, that is, practical considerations should not upstage moral considerations."
"It only takes a single case of non-respect for human rights to raise a concern."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think it is necessary to mention one major failing: the fact that there is no system of regulation by which the agreement could be implemented."
"I believe that in principle this agreement could be supported, but I would like to emphasise once more that it is imperative for the Russian Federation to strengthen its migration controls, so that its government bodies are able to respect the commitments that they will have to enter into from the day the readmission agreement becomes operational."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Gloser, I must say that the two international agreements with Russia that you are presenting to us today, one on the measures aimed at facilitating the issuance of visas and the other on readmission, have made us extremely worried."
"The European Union's cooperating with Russia must result in the protection of fundamental rights, including the rights of migrants and asylum seekers, being promoted more effectively."
"Admittedly, these agreements enable progress to be made, in particular on the price of visas and the simplification of the procedure, but several problems remain."
"Indeed, the events that took place recently in Russia show that freedom of the press and freedom of expression are not systematically guaranteed there."
"Europe must therefore keep issuing strong demands to ensure that human rights are protected."
"You responded to some of our concerns in your statement."
"The Commission has committed itself to guaranteeing reciprocity in the implementation of the agreement on visas, equal treatment regarding registration procedures and free movement within Russia."
"Obviously, I would have liked firmer commitments to have been made, particularly on the protection of migrants and the rights of children."
"I am particularly concerned by the accelerated procedure provided for by the readmission agreement."
"Will the Commission ensure, moreover, that this procedure complies with the principle of non-refoulement?"
"We also requested clearer commitments for visas, which, in the long run, would have meant putting a stop to the invitation and registration system and simplifying the procedure for bona fide travellers."
"Finally, I must once again reiterate our Parliament's dissatisfaction with the fact that we were simply consulted on these international agreements, and this, long after they had been concluded."
"Prior consultation of the European Parliament during the negotiations would also - it must be said - lead to greater democratic control."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the right to travel within Europe is an issue of absolutely fundamental importance to our lives."
"The fact that the EU is now discussing visa facilitation agreements with its eastern neighbour is, of course, a good thing."
"It cannot be emphasised enough how important visa rules, in particular, are for the way in which the European Union is perceived by the surrounding world and for the way in which the third country, in this case Russia, is perceived by EU citizens."
"For anyone who travels in the EU's border regions, this is often the first issue they encounter."
"We parliamentarians have a big responsibility."
"It is our responsibility to assess the agreement and its actual content."
"It is no secret that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has not been happy."
"In practice, European travellers to Russia encounter two problems if they are not on a group visit."
"They have to have an invitation from a Russian organisation or individual."
"What ordinary EU citizen has such contacts?"
"The second obstacle is that they have to register with a Russian local authority within three days of their arrival, and this can take several days."
"What are they to do if they are not in Moscow or St Petersburg?"
"None of these issues is addressed by the agreement."
"We must be clear that the agreement is a declaration and not a document with significant content."
"If I guess correctly, many people in this House too believe that the agreement involves visa facilitation for all young people and all students. That is not the case."
"Only those who already have study places would experience some limited relaxation of visa requirements, and, in such cases, visits could not, in any case, exceed 90 days."
"There are not many study programmes like that."
"In spite of all the shortcomings, Parliament has shown a constructive attitude."
"We understand the importance of sending out a political signal."
"However, it is important for all our citizens that the Commission and the Council should undertake single-mindedly to bring about an appreciable relaxation of visa requirements, beginning now and extending into the future."
"Without such a pledge, the ALDE Group will vote against the proposals."
"The Commission and the Council have put forward a declaration that is partially in keeping with Parliament's wishes."
"I do, however, have a question for Mrs Ferrero-Waldner: what is the next step that you now intend to take in order to abolish in practice the duty of registration and the system involving invitations?"
"Both issues are, of course, relevant to the general, overarching objective of the whole agreement, namely that of abolishing the visa system."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the agreements currently being debated are a very important step towards a closer relationship between the European Union and Russia, especially as their adoption will make it significantly easier for people to cross the border."
"That is the theory."
"However, in practice, the situation is not ideal in several respects."
"Travel to certain regions of the Russian Federation, notably to Chechnya, will still require additional permits, and the reasons for such decisions by the Russian authorities are surely obvious."
"The agreement on facilitation does not contain a reciprocal clause on human rights and democracy, which ought to appear in agreements between the Union and third countries as a matter of course."
"It is also difficult to understand why the Joint Readmission Committee is not authorised to monitor compliance with human rights and why individuals seeking political asylum are covered by the Agreement."
"It would appear that practical and technical matters were prioritised during work on the aforementioned documents, whilst issues relating to respect for the dignity of human beings were sidelined, although they ought to be at the heart of all agreements, especially those entered into with Russia."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur for her consistent work in preparing Parliament's opinion under consideration."
"As a shadow rapporteur, I am especially satisfied that, following a two-hour discussion with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, my proposal to mention the requirement to undergo a mandatory registration procedure as being a serious obstacle to travel within Russia and the EU has been taken into account."
"The requirement to undergo registration in Russia has become an enormous problem for those EU citizens applying for private short-stay visas to Russia."
"Latvian citizens and non-citizens know this problem from their own negative experience since many of us, especially Russian speakers, mainly go to Russia in order to visit our relatives and friends living there."
"The new law on migration registration of foreign nationals and stateless persons in the Russian Federation entered into force recently, on 15 January of this year."
"The law provides some facilitation of the registration procedure and abolishes registration fees but, nevertheless, the system as such is preserved."
"Unfortunately, such a system is reciprocal, since some EU Member States also demand the registration of certain categories of third-country nationals."
"Both the Russian and EU sides have to make immediate efforts to find a solution for essential facilitation of movement of people between our countries."
"Nevertheless, since some facilitation of the issuing of short-stay visas is better than none at all, our political group is supporting the agreement on this."
"On the other hand, we maintain our principal reservations with respect to the agreement on readmission."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, nationals of both the EU countries and Russia are required to have visas to travel."
"Russia has actively called for visa-free travel."
"To facilitate the granting of visas, we first have to have reciprocal agreements, examples of which are the proposals now before us."
"The reports by the parliamentary committees condemn the situation regarding the rule of law - its absence, in fact - in Russia."
"They voice the concern that visas may not be granted for free civil action."
"They also criticise the compulsory registration procedure and complain about the lack of any rules to implement the Agreement on readmission, human rights problems and so on."
"It would seem that the time is not yet ripe for visa-free travel."
"As long as visas are required, they need to be made easy and cheap for law-abiding citizens to acquire."
"We should be wary of making visas a political issue."
"(PL) Mr President, reciprocity and solidarity are two values that should be crucial to relations between the European Union and Russia."
"They are also essential conditions for such a relationship."
"Reciprocity underpins all international relations."
"I cannot conceive of agreements between states in which their mutual rights and responsibilities were not presented as being of equal value."
"Any imbalance would immediately cause an outcry."
"I am therefore quite certain that the principle of reciprocity must be observed in agreements between the Union and the Russian Federation."
"I believe there are two aspects that should be considered in relation to the second value, namely solidarity."
"Firstly, there is the solidarity between the Member States of the Union, who gave their consent for both agreements to be drafted."
"I am glad that my own country, Poland, took part in this process."
"We have been Russia's neighbour for centuries, and there have been ups and downs in our relationship, as is often the case with neighbours."
"These agreements prove that we wish to have a good and normal neighbourly relationship with Russia."
"The second aspect to consider is the solidarity between the citizens of the Union and the citizens of the Russian Federation."
"We will demonstrate this solidarity if we treat Russian citizens as people who are travelling around the Union in good faith, and facilitate their entry and stay amongst us."
"I should like to emphasise that the citizens of the new Member States are particularly aware of what a blessing freedom of travel is."
"We know what reducing border crossing formalities means and we value it a great deal."
"We wish to share those benefits with the Russian citizens, on the basis of the principle of reciprocity and respect for human rights."
"I think Parliament should support these agreements, because they create a good neighbour policy for the Union."
"(FI) Mr President, relations between the EU and Russia have not made any progress for a long time now."
"For this reason, the Agreements before us now are important, even though they are rather undemanding in terms of their content."
"It is very regrettable that the EU and Russia have not as yet got round to negotiating arrangements for the new agreement between them."
"There need to be continued efforts to commence talks."
"The delay in negotiations on this new agreement should not, however, be a reason for preventing both sides from developing their vital partnership."
"The new strategic partnership can and must also be structured within the framework of the current Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"(LV) Ladies and gentlemen, resolving the issue of visa facilitation and readmission is an important task that would promote the consolidation of common values."
"Both the debate and the answers given by the Commission and the Council show, however, that in truth nothing has been achieved in discussions with Russia - neither a registration procedure nor a simplification of the invitation system."
"That has been left to rely on Russia's goodwill."
"It is not clear why Russia has been given a transition period for the readmission of persons from third countries."
"Our report of May 2005 on relations between the European Union and Russia stressed that the European Parliament was repeating its call on Russia to ratify the border agreement with Estonia and to sign and ratify the border agreement with Latvia without delay."
"I believe that the demarcation of borders and the conclusion of a readmission agreement are preconditions for the signing of a visa facilitation agreement."
"In this respect Russia has not displayed any initiative, but has just dictated its conditions to both countries."
"Since Parliament has been placed in a totally humiliating position, we believe that it is not possible to support these agreements - a lot of serious work still remains to be done on them."
"(CS) Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, from my point of view, the agreement on the facilitation of the visa process with Russia is, despite all the comments and reservations that have been expressed, a step forward."
"It demonstrates that it is possible for the European Union and Russia to reach a compromise even on complex issues."
"Furthermore, let us answer the following question: do we want to make it easier, quicker and cheaper for students, scientists, businesspeople and family members to have access to visas?"
"I believe the answer is yes."
"Otherwise, access will be selective, something that we in the Czech Republic know all about in our relations with the EU."
"For example, the process of joining Schengen was slow and fraught with difficulties."
"Naturally, as someone who has spent many years in Russia and as a member of the Delegation for relations with Russia, I am well aware of the complications regarding visas and I therefore believe that simplifying at least part of the visa process is better than nothing. Thank you."
"(LT) The European Union is bringing down the barriers that hinder people of good will from associating with each other."
"After five years of negotiations with Russia, the 'visa wall' between the EU and Russia has become a little lower."
"Once the visa simplification and readmission agreements come into force, a sizeable group of people will be able to travel and interact easier."
"Those who are still disadvantaged are Kaliningrad residents who wish to visit Lithuania and Poland, and Lithuanians and Poles who wish to visit Kaliningrad."
"At the moment there is no charge for visas, but the agreement, which is supposed to make things easier for them, will actually impose the hardship of a EUR 35 charge for a visa."
"This goes against the principles of cross-border cooperation and against the Kaliningrad region's anti-isolationist policy, which interests both Russia and the EU."
"Vilnius, Warsaw, Brussels and Berlin, as well as Moscow, are trying to negotiate bilateral solutions within the margin of flexibility of the Schengen Agreement provisions."
"Lithuania has led the way as the first and only EU nation so far to have a readmission agreement with Russia."
"Three years of experience have been positive."
"Since the agreement has been in force, the Lithuanian-Russian border has been crossed by almost 2 million people; however, not once have the provisions of the agreement needed to be invoked."
"I agree with a number of colleagues who have sharply criticised the agreement, especially for the lack of sufficient nexus to human rights and liberties."
"Nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction."
"On the long road toward the 'demolition of the visa wall' there are still a lot of obstacles."
"EU citizens coming to Russia have to register, and if they want to visit certain regions, extra permits are needed."
"These 'hidden' internal visas need to be done away with, because they restrict EU citizens' freedom of movement."
"This issue must be talked about honestly."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for the many important things you have said, but also for being realistic enough to see that it is not, of course, possible to agree on everything."
"The fact is that all of us would have liked to see something in line with our own thinking, and, as indeed one speaker said earlier on, all this is an important step forward, but we need many more of them."
"It is clear from the joint statement by the Commission and the Council that we had, in various areas, due regard to the principle of mutuality, which is an important one."
"What is equally important is respect for human rights, and of that you rightly reminded us."
"While I do not wish to confuse these two considerations, they are, of course, connected in some way."
"The importance of dialogue with Russia has already been highlighted in various debates."
"Although demands are always being made that we should get our way on various fronts, if, for example, there is still no go-ahead given for the negotiation of the partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia, there is no possibility of our making demands, expressing aspirations, or putting forward what you have requested, and it is for that reason that it is high time that the green light was given."
"I hope that we will be able to find a suitable solution to the problem that still hangs over this issue."
"Even though there may be things that we cannot accept as regards respect for human rights, there is nonetheless the twice-yearly human rights consultation between the European Union and Russia, which present an opportunity for raising such issues."
"Some of you made reference to the issue of bureaucratisation."
"While we would, of course, have wished to do many things differently in this area, the regime has nonetheless been relaxed as regards necessary invitations, and I am sure that the Commissioner will have something more to say about this."
"This has not, of course, been done to the extent that some of you demanded, but it is nonetheless evident from this that we are making progress, albeit often with only small steps, for it is small steps forward that are called for in dialogue, particularly with Russia."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I have taken good note of the many concerns you have expressed, but let me first say that Article 300(1) of the EC Treaty clearly states that negotiations on international agreements on matters falling under Community competence are conducted by the Commission on the basis of negotiating directives approved by the Council."
"The European Parliament needs to be consulted before the conclusion of the agreement, as laid down in paragraph 3 of that article."
"This provision also applies in areas of codecision, so in my view the procedures set up by the EC Treaty have been fully respected, both on readmission and on visa facilitation."
"I wanted to say that, because it came up in the discussion."
"At the same time, however, I can also reiterate that of course we are at your disposal to provide any relevant information, even during the ongoing negotiations."
"I also fully share the view that the promotion and the safeguard of human rights in our relationships with Russia, and in connection with those agreements in particular, are of course a fundamental aspect."
"The Commission, assisted by the EU Member States, will therefore monitor this issue very closely in the context of the joint committees set up by the agreements and, of course, human dignity - the dignity of the human being - is certainly very important here and has priority."
"Furthermore, the regular semi-annual consultations between the European Union and Russia on human rights are always an occasion where we can address broader concerns with Russia and human rights issues are always raised at the Summit and at ministerial levels, as appropriate."
"The visa facilitation agreement constitutes a real improvement of the status quo."
"It is indeed, as our colleague said, a step forward."
"It contains important facilitations for issuing short-stay visas which will then apply on a reciprocal basis to citizens of the Schengen Member States and of the Russian Federation."
"Some of these facilitations apply to all visa applicants and others to specific categories who have a particular interest in travelling, while the agreement provides for legally binding rights and obligations, which will ensure somewhat greater flexibility in the visa procedures."
"I wish to draw your attention in particular to the fact that we, the Commission, have managed to negotiate important visa facilitation for journalists, for instance, who will no longer require an invitation or a validation by the Russian authorities, and special attention will also be paid to effective reciprocity in the implementation of the agreement, equal treatment regarding registration procedures for EU and Russian nationals and the free movement of persons within Russian territory."
"You raised two topics, namely registration requirements and the removal of invitations."
"I would like to just say that the agreement includes a commitment to simplify the registration procedures, with a view to ensuring equal treatment for EU and Russian citizens, and I would like to remind you that the Schengen acquis also imposes a general obligation for aliens to register."
"We have raised this issue with the Russian authorities on several occasions and new legislation, which entered into force in Russia last month, is already in place to simplify these procedures."
"According to this law, an appearance in person will no longer be required for registration."
"Of course, we will now monitor and seek further clarification of these rules."
"I would also like to say that the visa facilitation agreement introduces another important change, namely the fact that validation of invitations by the Russian authorities is no longer required."
"In comparison with the current situation, where the invitation from the Russian host needs to be validated, this is, I think, a great improvement for a large category of citizens."
"Of course, the agreement does not abolish the invitations and their validation for all EU citizens applying for Russian visas."
"However, it should be borne in mind that the Schengen acquis also requires any person applying for a visa to justify the purpose of the travel and present supporting documents."
"I also would like to say that the readmission agreement contains important elements for humane and more effective return management in the future and I would just like to reiterate what I said at the beginning."
"In the case of asylum applications at the border, the principle of non refoulement has to be fully respected by Member States in accordance with Article 18 of the agreement."
"So it is clear that this will be an important aspect."
"I could go on giving you all the details, because I have listened very carefully. However, I think this matter has already been discussed in the LIBE Committee, so just let me say that I hope the House will follow the committee's recommendation and give a positive opinion on both agreements."
"It will make a change for our citizens and ultimately this may be what matters most."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (ET) The groundwork for the agreement signed between the European Union and Russia concerning the facilitation of the issuing of short-stay visas was laid in May 2003 at the St Petersburg summit."
"The agreement was intended as part of a process that was designed to strengthen relations between the parties through the creation of a common area founded on freedom, security and justice."
"I see an agreement, but not the common area that was meant to arise."
"Parliament will not retreat from its repeated demand that international agreements signed on behalf of the European Union contain a mutual human rights and democracy clause."
"The agreement on the facilitation of the issuing of short-stay visas with Russia does not contain that clause."
"At the same time, Russia has paid lip service to a significant requirement of the European Union's visa facilitation policy, according to which the agreement on readmission should already have been concluded, or be at the active negotiating stage."
"The readmission agreement was proposed by Parliament together with the visa facilitation agreement."
"In addition, Russia has been granted a very generous transition period before the actual commencement of readmission."
"I repeatedly drew attention to the absurd situation according to which the European Union makes it easier for Russian citizens to cross a border that Russia itself does not recognise."
"Moscow has not yet ratified the Estonian-Russian Border Treaty."
"Logically, the recognition of that border should be the precondition for the establishment and amendment of the border regime."
"In order to support democracy, 16 years ago the European Union and the United States adopted an approach that treated Russia as a promising young country."
"This overly generous treatment continues, though it is no longer appropriate."
"It is in Europe's interests to treat Russia as a full partner that must fulfil its international obligations just like any other."
"Economic policy guidelines for 2007 - Member States' employment policies (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Mr Bullmann, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the situation of the European economy: preparatory report on the broad economic policy guidelines for 2007, and"
"the report by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States - C6-0036/2007 - 2006/0271(CNS]."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to make a few comments on your Members' reports on the economic policy guidelines for 2007."
"You will recall that it was last December that the Commission presented its annual report on the Lisbon process, in which it discusses the progress that has been made with the Lisbon Strategy across the Community and in the Member States, and also makes recommendations specific to individual countries on economic and employment policy, which will be elaborated by the ECOFIN Council and by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Protection Council jointly, although each Council configuration will concentrate on matters within its own remit."
"We are therefore glad to see that your House has given thought to these economic policy guidelines, and, in addition to this debate today, we will also have another opportunity for exchanging views at the Troika meeting on 26 February."
"The Commission's progress report met with broad approval from the ECOFIN Council when it met in January."
"In particular, we can endorse the report's fundamentally positive outlook."
"The first concrete results of the reform process are becoming visible across the EU and in the Member States, in that we can see the beginnings of an overall improvement in the economy and employment in the European Union as the renewed Lisbon Strategy bears fruit."
"It nevertheless has to be said - as it was yesterday in various ways - that there is no reason for complacency."
"We should be set on using the present favourable economic position as a means for accomplishing further reforms, and this is made all the more important by the prospect of demographic change presenting financial policy with considerable challenges."
"What is needed in order to consolidate the long-term sustainability of public finance is a three-pillar strategy, in other words a combination of reform of the pension and health care system, reduction of state debt and enhanced employment and productivity, while the quality of public finance needs to be improved by restructuring public budgets with a greater bias towards expenditure that promotes productivity and innovation and builds up human resources, and so the country-specific recommendations are a good instrument for moving the modernisation of our economy forward and enhancing the European Union's ability to hold its own in global competition."
"Starting with Mr Bullmann's report, there are two aspects of it on which I should like to comment briefly."
"Firstly, one point made in it is that financial and economic policy needs to be better coordinated, especially within the euro zone."
"Demands that this be done come as no surprise to me, for they have been made repeatedly over the years, but, if one considers closely the present situation, it quickly becomes evident that there is no lack of coordination procedures in the economic and monetary union; indeed, there are too many of them rather than too few, with, for example, the economic policy guidelines - which we are discussing today - and the budget policy monitoring procedure, to name but two."
"What matters most of all in practice is that these procedures be applied consistently and effectively, and, by presenting its country-specific recommendations, the Commission has taken the first step to this end."
"My second point has more to do with the institutions; it relates to the concrete proposal in Mr Bullmann's report for the setting-up, following the Spring Summit, of an interinstitutional working party to consider the review of the Integrated Guidelines scheduled for 2008."
"Far be it from me to give a final evaluation of this proposal today;"
"I am sure you will understand that it is an in-depth examination, rather than a personal estimate, that is called for, but I have to say that it does not, at first sight, appear to me to be wholly compatible with the way work is shared out between the institutions under the Treaties."
"Quite apart from that, though, the fact of the matter is that communication between the Council and your House has constantly improved over recent years, something attributable not least to the troika meetings and sittings such as this one."
"I am also aware, however, that there is always progress to be made."
"Let me now turn to Mr Andersson's report."
"As required by Article 128(2) of the European Communities Treaty, the Council, acting on the Commission's proposal, lays down every year guidelines that the Member States follow in their employment policy."
"In order, however, to ensure the continuity needed for proper implementation, it was agreed in 2002 that the employment policy guidelines would, in principle, be altered only every three years."
"It was also agreed that they should be brought into line with the economic policy guidelines."
"It was on this basis that, in 2005, the first integrated guidelines were laid down for the period from then to 2008."
"In 2006, then, the Commission proposed that the employment policy guidelines laid down in 2005 should be left unchanged."
"Your House has repeatedly urged that it be allowed sufficient time to carefully elaborate its position, since the tight deadlines involved in the annual employment cycle usually made it necessary to invoke the urgency procedure."
"There has been an exchange of letters on this subject between your House and the Council."
"For 2008, your House has asked for more time for a hearing, on the grounds that it will involve a comprehensive triennial examination of the employment policy guidelines, and we will consult with the Commission when considering this."
"A position on the timetable for the procedure in 2008 is unfortunately not available at the present time."
"This year, it is to be expected that the Council, as soon as the opinions of your House, ECOSOC, the Committee of the Regions and of the Employment Committee are forthcoming, will, at the 30/31 May Council meeting, be able to achieve policy agreement on the employment policy guidelines for 2007, which would then be formally adopted before summer this year."
"As Mr Andersson indeed stated in his report, the fact is that - quite apart from previous successes in terms of more people in work and fewer people out of it - there is a need for further purposeful effort if the goals set are to be achieved within the European Union."
"By way of conclusion, I would like once more to emphasise that these include, in particular, an increase in the participation of young people and older persons in the labour market, together with an improvement in the compatibility of work and family life."
"While I am aware that this is right at the top of the agenda in many Member States, I am also aware that there are those in which action is needed in this area."
"Mr President, with your permission, I shall speak in my mother tongue."
"(ES) Ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating jointly the report by Mr Bullmann, on the broad economic policy guidelines, and the report by Mr Andersson, on the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States."
"Both reports are based on last December's Commission Communication on the implementation by the Member States of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment, and the integrated guidelines for 2005-2008, which was approved by the Council following consultation of this Parliament and on the proposal of the Commission."
"Today's debate is taking place during the weeks leading up to the Spring European Council of 8 March and involves cooperating in the preparations for that Council."
"Just this morning, this Parliament adopted a resolution expressing this Parliament's assessment of the implementation to date of the renewed Lisbon Strategy and stressing the areas and policies in which decisive action by the Member States and the European Union is needed."
"It is important to stress that the reports that we are debating today and the opinion of this Parliament and of the European Commission are in agreement on a series of fundamental points."
"Firstly, both Parliament and the Commission acknowledge the results that we are beginning to see, both in terms of economic growth and in terms of employment, thanks to the application of the policies agreed within the renewed framework of the Lisbon Strategy and thanks in particular to the budgetary consolidation and structural reform efforts made by the majority of Member States."
"Just yesterday, Eurostat published the European Union's GDP growth figures for the fourth quarter of 2006."
"That information indicates that the joint growth for 2006 was practically 3%. That would represent the highest rhythm of increase in our GDP since the Lisbon Strategy was launched in 2000."
"Although Parliament and the Commission are in agreement, we must nevertheless be sure to emphasise this point, to emphasise the fact that we are beginning to see the positive results of the strategies implemented a few years ago."
"It is important that the citizens receive the message that the efforts made since the Stability and Growth Pact was implemented, since the Lisbon Strategy was implemented - efforts that have not always been easy to accept or understand - are yielding fruit and helping to strengthen the European social model within the context of globalisation."
"Many of the difficulties faced by the European project in terms of public opinion over recent times result from the fear amongst the citizens, in certain sectors of our society, that globalisation is lowering standards in a way that undermines the foundations of our social model, and that the European Union and the policies and strategies decided upon here are unable to prevent it."
"Some people even accuse the European Union of provoking and speeding up that deterioration of the European social model."
"The results we are seeing demonstrate clearly that that is not the case."
"Those people who believe that Europe has become stagnant and that the rigidity of the labour markets is preventing job creation are also wrong."
"The figures show that, since the euro was created on 1 January 1999, eight years ago now, the European Union has created four times as many jobs as it had created over the previous eight years."
"Furthermore, during this decade, since the Lisbon Strategy was launched, the European Union has clearly been creating more jobs than the United States."
"Some people describe the budgetary policies as restrictive and accuse the Stability and Growth Pact of slowing down economic growth, but the reality is that it is the countries with the best budgetary accounts, with budget surpluses, both in the euro zone and in the European Union as a whole, that for some time have been experiencing the highest levels of economic growth."
"The truth is that fiscal consolidation makes progress and improves in parallel with the increase and improvement in our growth and job creation figures."
"There has recently been a lot of talk about the strength of the euro against the dollar and the yen being an obstacle to our exports, but the fact is that the euro zone's trade balance, in relation to the United States, has improved again in 2006 and that the rise in oil prices has partly been compensated for by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar."
"In short, ladies and gentlemen, the improvement in our economies and the acceleration of job creation are clear evidence that the European social and economic model, with its high level of social protection and its environmental demands, is perfectly compatible with the globalisation of the economy and with economic growth."
"Europe, its countries, our economies, have always worked better when they have opened up to the world and, now that the global economy is undergoing an unprecedented expansion, Europe and its citizens have much to gain from this opening up of our borders and the increased integration of our economies at global level."
"Sending this message to the citizens is not just a way to vindicate the economic and social policies that we have been advocating over recent years: it is crucial in terms of increasing confidence in Europe's capacity to provide the European citizens with well-being and offers us a solid basis for strengthening the political will necessary in order to move ahead with the structural reforms laid down in the Lisbon Strategy."
"The second point on which there is fundamental agreement between the reports we are debating today and the opinion of the European Commission is the need to enhance the reforms initiated through the implementation of national reform plans by the Member States."
"In this regard, the dynamism of the emerging economies, the ageing of the population, the growth potential, which is still low, in many European economies, the continuing budgetary imbalances in certain Member States, the low growth in productivity and the segmentation of the labour market are some of the very powerful reasons for continuing to implement policies leading to greater innovation capacity, greater life-long training opportunities, better functioning of the markets and healthier public finances."
"The third significant area of agreement between Parliament and the Commission relates to the need to act not just in each of the Member States, but also at European level, in order to make progress on achieving an internal market in sectors that are crucial to our economy, such as the energy sector and the financial services sector, in order to increase support for innovation, in order to create a more favourable environment for business activity and greater adaptability of the markets in products and services and of the labour market."
"Of these priority areas for action at European level, the reports rightly place the emphasis on the issue of energy, which will be one of the key issues at the Spring European Council, which is going to debate the energy package proposed by the Commission on 10 January."
"The degree of commitment and ambition demonstrated by the Heads of State or Government in terms of creating a genuine common energy policy will be decisive when it comes to assessing whether the response to the challenge of guaranteeing our energy supply, while at the same time tackling climate change, is credible."
"When it comes to tackling these challenges, action by each of the Member States separately will clearly be insufficient and joint action at European level will therefore be required in order to defend the interests of the citizens properly."
"Finally, both the report by Mr Bullmann and the report by Mr Andersson express the need for Parliament to be able to exercise its prerogatives properly when it comes to revising the integrated guidelines of the Lisbon Strategy, which is scheduled for next year."
"I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission is fully committed, particularly those of us in the College who are directly involved with the Lisbon Strategy, Vice-President Verheugen, Commissioner Å pidla and myself, and we have a common desire to explore all possible ways to involve Parliament effectively in this revision."
"I shall end, Mr President, by expressing my desire for this plenary to endorse the practically unanimous support of the respective committees for the reports by Mr Bullmann and Mr Andersson."
"Through this support and through the high degree of consensus between Parliament and the Commission, we will be sending a clear signal to the European Council and to the citizens in general of the European Union's will and capacity to create a specific instrument to tackle the risks and take advantage of the opportunities presented by globalisation, while defending and enhancing Europe's economic progress and social cohesion."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Who would have guessed thirty-three years ago that we would be together in a debate like this in our respective posts?"
"rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, the report I have prepared on the employment guidelines is extremely short and has been accepted unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"It is really about how we are to deal with next year's employment guidelines and integrated guidelines, for our current guidelines are to remain unchanged this year, but next year we shall see a more radical review."
"Just as Commissioner Almunia said, we therefore anticipate being able to devote a little more time to the issue, and we need more time in Parliament too."
"That is something I really wish to emphasise, for there is a difference between the employment and the economic guidelines."
"The employment guidelines cannot be adopted by the Council until Parliament has made its position known."
"Constructive cooperation between the institutions is therefore required before next year."
"We made things easier in the run-up to this year. We did so last year too, when no great review took place."
"Next year's review is to be a major one, so we are expecting cooperation extending over several months."
"We have, in actual fact, already had a discussion in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs between the coordinators and myself about not delaying in appointing a rapporteur to prepare the work before next year's changes."
"I wish, for all that, nonetheless to say something about the situation, even if it is only addressed in the justification."
"Things are genuinely going better for Europe."
"Employment trends are more encouraging than they were a few years ago."
"Unemployment is declining."
"We have sound growth."
"We must not forget, however, that there are still deficiencies which we must concentrate on remedying."
"I am thinking of young people who leave school early and young people who become unemployed immediately their education is finished."
"We know that, if they remain outside the labour market for a long time, it becomes incredibly difficult to get them back into it again."
"I am thinking of the still considerable differences between the situations of men and women in the labour market."
"I am thinking of people who have come to us from other parts of the world and who, even today, have problems entering the labour market due to the shortcomings of our integration policy."
"I am thinking of people with disabilities, who are also excluded from the labour market."
"I attended the informal Council of Ministers meeting involving the employment ministers, a meeting that addressed another aspect of employment, namely that we want jobs that are actually better."
"It is true that we have more jobs, but we want higher-quality jobs too."
"What, then, is meant by 'better jobs'?"
"The fact is, we mean jobs that offer living wages and jobs that entail professional development and offer the further training that is so necessary if people are to be able to cope successfully in the labour market."
"We are also concerned here with good working environments and with giving employees the opportunity to exercise influence, both individually and through their trade unions."
"The current trend towards more jobs does not always mean better jobs."
"That is a state of affairs of which we are aware, and there are debates about it in quite a few countries, for example in Germany, which I visited recently."
"I also know from my own country that a proportion of the new jobs are what are known as atypical and do not always provide a living wage or opportunities for further training."
"The influence that people in these jobs are able to exercise is also fairly minimal."
"We must, then, also concentrate on creating not only more jobs but also high-quality jobs."
"Europe will never be able to compete in the world market by creating low-wage jobs and jobs that do not enable people to provide for themselves. Instead, it will only be able to compete by creating high-quality jobs that offer, for example, further training and the opportunity to exercise influence."
"This is a subject to which we intend to return next year when we carry out the more thorough review of employment trends, looking at more and better jobs and at groups that at present still have difficulty entering the labour market."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as Commissioner Almunia pointed out, we have, in practical terms, got our growth back up to 3%, and are therefore back on the course set by Lisbon."
"It is this continuous 3% growth that we aimed to achieve by means of the Lisbon Strategy, enabling us to implement the social and economic reforms that are needed in order that everyone in Europe may benefit."
"It is precisely because there were many years in which we did not achieve this that we need to remind ourselves that this will not happen on its own."
"Much in this upturn has to do, in the first instance, with the economic cycle, and it is because we cannot be certain that it will continue that our report takes the line that action on our part is needed, that we need to manage and direct, that we must not take time out and allow the clock to keep ticking while we neglect to take the necessary political steps."
"The single market is our great trump card, performing better than the internal market in the USA."
"90% of what we manufacture in the European Union, we - as consumers - buy back from our own companies, and that gives us strength to cope with the vicissitudes of globalisation."
"It is right, then, that this internal market should be completed, whether as regards financial services, energy, or the free movement of workers in Europe, for whom this is a fundamental right, albeit one that we have yet to put into effect, but this single market can function only if we endow it with a political framework - only if we are bold enough to give it form and ensure that the social checks and balances are in place."
"That is why it is so important to call to mind the fact that we have succeeded in creating that social balance; we did so with the Services Directive."
"It is only when people are able to support themselves properly by their own labour in this internal market that they will be able, as consumers, to support an economic upturn; it is only then that they will be able, as consumers, to invest, and only then that they will be able, as workers, to acquire further skills and qualifications and to play their decisive part in fostering innovation in our societies."
"That is why it is so important that this report should ask the Member States just where they are, how far they have come, and just what they have done about achieving the great targets that we set ourselves at Lisbon."
"It is crystal clear that they are beginning to come up with some answers, but those answers are still slow in coming and are not framed everywhere with the same quality that we would like to see; active employment policy and social integration policy, in particular, leave something to be desired."
"Looking at the positive outcomes, we can see that the countries that are ahead are the ones that are bold enough, instead of making savings to the point where nothing works, to invest in the active parts of society, in small and medium-sized enterprises, in those who are at school, in those who are doing their apprenticeships, in those who are studying for university degrees and are thereby bringing new creativity into society."
"It is not fortuitous that many Scandinavian countries, working according to the Nordic model, are producing the best results on this front."
"While it is up to each and every country to find its own best solution, we would strongly encourage the Member States to play their part in putting the pro-active Lisbon approach into practice and carrying on with it."
"I am grateful to the President-in-Office, Mr Gloser, for not, in his speech, disregarding the report, but instead saying 'yes' to dialogue, and I would urge him to be courageous, for I can find nothing in the Treaty that forbids us from developing closer forms of cooperation where the reform of the Integrated Guidelines and preparing Lisbon and the economic policy guidelines for a new stage are concerned."
"This House expects to be involved - as is only right and proper - for that is the only way in which we can help to communicate the Lisbon goals to the public, to businesses, to trade unions and to workers."
"I think the Commission is right to think in terms of coming up with more proposals on this front; why should such proposals not be adopted by the European Council as guidelines and thus give the Member States firmer guidance?"
"I do not want to close without extending very warm thanks to the services - both the committee's and those of the groups - for their contribution to the production of the report, and also to the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Montoro Romero, Mrs in 't Veld, Mrs RÃ¼hle and Mrs Wagenknecht, whose excellent cooperation has made it possible to present a unanimous report."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) We are dealing with a good report."
"I believe that Mr Bullmann has done an excellent job, an open job, in order to produce an analysis of the European economy at this time. It is a hopeful time, but it is also a time for realistic analysis."
"This report also stresses that we must make a precise diagnosis of whether we are dealing with a strictly cyclical recovery or something more."
"I hope that it is something more, but we must also tell the European citizens that we must carry on working because the rationalisation of public finances we saw last year may also be due to cyclical factors and not to deliberate or structural decisions."
"As the report does, we must accept that what has failed in the European economy over recent years has been the weakness of internal demand, that is to say, confidence, consumer and investor confidence, and that is extremely negative in terms of the European project."
"We must also stress the need for reforms: reforms of the labour market that have been discussed and agreed; reforms of economic policies to promote small and medium-sized businesses, which are key to the growth and creation of employment; reforms intended to complete the single market, particularly in services and in the energy sector; reforms to improve the efficiency of the markets in goods, services, work and capital; and also fiscal reforms aimed at providing a coordinated fiscal framework that stimulates the creation of jobs and promotes the creation and development of the fabric of small and medium-sized enterprise that we believe to be fundamental."
"Furthermore, this report stresses the need to combat protectionism, which unfortunately is present in many of our current European governments, and we also warn that the risk associated with the euro-dollar exchange rate may threaten the quality of our economic growth."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Almunia, Mr Gloser, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his work;"
"I believe that this report presents both an analysis and recommendations that my group can fully support."
"I should like simply to highlight three aspects."
"The outlook for the euro zone in terms of growth and competitiveness is improving."
"However, as the report says - and this is my first remark - there are some very important differences between the Member States."
"I believe that we should try to learn some lessons from this, or, in any case, try to understand why this is so."
"Things are not always easy; many elements come into play."
"In particular, the report mentions the difference between the situation of a number of large Member States and that of smaller ones, but, ultimately, it is more complicated than that, since we can also observe spectacular differences in results among the large Member States."
"Germany has performed averagely, with 2.7% growth last year, which is a very good result compared with previous years."
"However, with 2% growth, other large Member States, such as Italy, and also my country, France, are below average in terms of EU growth, something that only happened two years ago."
"This is combined with other elements that are fairly worrying, since the differences in external trade are just as spectacular."
"Germany is a record-breaker again, showing an ability to conquer international markets, while France, which for a very long time was a country with a very strong international trade surplus, is producing one record trade deficit after another, quarter after quarter."
"It is true that the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands and a number of small Member States have obtained good results in terms of growth, employment and international trade."
"There is a first lesson to be learnt from this, one that has perhaps come to my mind as a result of my country's situation. It is that, in a country in which for five years, there has been one, let us say, liberal, structural reform after another, in which it was explained to us that that which was going to enable us to resolve the crisis, and the employment crisis in particular, was to reduce taxes - corporation tax, income tax - to jeopardise some forms of employment protection - we had a 'new employment' contract, which undermined protection against redundancies, etc. - to weaken public services and to privatise, we have not obtained a single result."
"On the contrary, some countries that have kept compulsory levies and higher labour costs than France are, for their part, showing important results."
"I have learnt a second lesson from this, which is that not only has this formula been ineffective, but it is wrong to think that Europe will cope if it practices downwards competition."
"It is not by practising a form of competition based on low costs that Europe will manage to extricate itself, but by investing in human resources, in innovation, in research, in training and in universities."
"My third remark, and a point rightly noted in the report, is that, despite this overall increase in growth and economic results, poverty continues to be a problem."
"Even when compared with the 1990s, the level of poverty within the European Union has gone up again."
"At the end of the day, there are 80 million Europeans living below the 60% average income threshold."
"On this issue, I believe that we should also learn a lesson from what took place under President Clinton in the United States, which back then experienced a boom with the new economy, a boom that at the same time did not prevent serious poverty from continuing to somewhat poison society, because the Welfare programmes could not be implemented."
"We too must combine investments with the knowledge-based economy, the competitive economy and social cohesion."
"The two go hand in hand and support each other."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur, who has considerably lightened the shadow rapporteurs' load by submitting an excellent text that needed hardly any editing, and. with which, as it is now before us, I too am pleased, for it contains many excellent recommendations, although many of them we have, of course, made before, and what is lacking is action."
"Many of these things have not been implemented."
"It is true that the economy is picking up, but this is no time to rest on our laurels."
"Where, for example, the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned, now is the time when the preventive leg should enter into force."
"Rather than blowing the kitty, we should keep the budget in good shape, reduce debts, invest, and in that sense, I am completely at one with Mr Bullmann."
"This should not, however, take on the form that it often does, namely subsidies that distort the market and replace the desperately-needed reforms."
"This is often simply used as a fig leaf, which is not the idea."
"I am all in favour of completing the internal market, and I hope that the Services Directive, which was far too weak for my liking, will have some impact on that front after all."
"A great deal needs to be done in the area of labour market measures too, and I would like to say, briefly, that I see the social model as one in which all Europeans are given opportunities, but the one we have at present is still systematically excluding 8% of the people from the labour market, and not only eastern European workers and immigrants."
"We would rather have them drown in the Mediterranean than give them access to our labour market."
"It is meanwhile the case that we have been turning a blind eye to the fact that people working illegally on our markets under the most abominable conditions are almost kept as slaves."
"This is not so much a social model as a disgrace for Europe, so as far as I am concerned, the free movement of eastern European workers could not come any sooner, complete with an immigration system and green card."
"Finally, some question the merits of more coordination of national economic policy."
"We should have another discussion on this some time."
"I think it is, at any rate, far preferable than the current trend towards protectionism and Member States competing against one another, for the fact is that, if we in Europe want to be of any significance in the world economy, we have to ensure that we have a strong, open market, which means that we have to focus on areas of future significance, that is to say on energy, innovation and sustainable development - areas in which we should become world leaders."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteurs on their work."
"The Union for Europe of the Nations Group will support these reports."
"As I only have a short time available, I shall just raise a couple of issues."
"At present, the economies of the Member States of the European Union are in need of genuine internal solidarity and cohesion, in order to meet the challenges of competition in the long term."
"We can congratulate ourselves on a real economic revival, as demonstrated by the growth of GDP."
"However, we would do well to remember that we are not alone."
"Our population of 500 million does not even account for 8% of the world's population."
"Our competitors include not only the United States, but also, and maybe most importantly. India, China, Indonesia, Brazil and Russia."
"Nowadays, it is the economy, access to strategic raw materials and demographic potential that represent real strength."
"These three pillars are closely related."
"Accordingly, if we do not adopt a family-friendly policy that is truly harmonised with the economy, and also with regard to employment issues, then we are likely not only to lag behind in the near future but to actually collapse altogether."
"The Lisbon Strategy is not an end in itself."
"All its actions must aim to promote the individual and his or her development, that is to say, the development of a European citizen."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing I have to say is that the 'Lisbon Strategy' label now gets stuck on everything, irrespective of how little it has to do with the Strategy's original objective."
"Although it was employment policy that first prompted the Lisbon Strategy and constituted its primary goal, that is now becoming no more than an appendix to it."
"This redefinition has been accomplished as a matter of policy, as a means of obfuscation and avoiding the admission that, while the EU's economic data may be taking a turn for the better, no comparable upward trend is to be found in the employment figures."
"Secondly, I would like to remind the House that the EU's Heads of State or Government, at every spring summit, undertake to apply the growth and employment guidelines to their own national policies."
"Thirdly, when they do so, the core concern is to combat the social exclusion of people, for that is the only way to effectively reduce long-term unemployment and poverty, and, in so doing, particular attention needs to be given to groups who, by reason of their personal characteristics, are especially subject to discrimination in trying to get into the labour market, such as, for example, people with disabilities and migrant women."
"This year, though, the Council and the Commission have simply allowed this core concern to be forgotten about, even though there is no cause for them to do so, for exclusion is as much a problem as it ever was."
"We cannot accept that employment policy should be biased towards those who are already in work."
"The guideline currently in force must be taken as seriously as it ever has been, and the great coalition must not be allowed to get away with giving it a different priority and simply looking away when social need is most pressing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report on the economic policy guidelines contains a large number of statements that I can go along with."
"It states that, rather than economic growth being an end in itself, the focus must be on people's quality of life."
"It advocates not only that economic growth should be export-oriented, but also that it should be responsive to demand, and it manifests concern about the continuing high incidence of poverty within the European Union."
"Although all that is laudable and - alas - not always obvious to the Members of this House, the report does also include passages that make a vote in its favour impossible."
"What is certainly not acceptable from our group's standpoint is the favourable mention given to the neo-liberal Services Directive, which will further encourage wage dumping and the despoliation of social services in the European Union, thereby helping to make poverty and social exclusion even more widespread."
"We also see it as unacceptable that the report should call for further liberalisation of the energy sector."
"What Europe in fact needs is not even more deregulation, liberalisation and privatisation, but the very opposite; what we need is a radically different economic policy in which, for once, the interests of workers and consumers are treated as more important than big business's interest in private profit."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Bullmann report shows that economies of countries which have not yet adopted the euro are performing better than those who have."
"Indeed, I must congratulate Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia."
"They have not only shaken off the shackles of Communism but also embraced the free market, low taxation and minimal regulation."
"Is it any wonder they have the highest growth rates in Europe?"
"However, I must warn them that this has ended."
"It will all be downhill from here."
"Latvia will adopt the euro in 2008, Lithuania and Slovakia in 2009 and Estonia in 2010 and they will be hamstrung by EU regulation, EU targets and by the EU continually meddling in their economic affairs."
"I think we should all worry when the report informs us that the European Union must play a more active role in determining economic policy."
"One size does not fit all and individual countries know best how to find their markets, manage their economies and trade with the world."
"Please give them economic independence."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the latest data on the economic situation are on the whole positive but, as the Commission has stressed, growth in productivity and job quality are still below the levels that Europe needs."
"I hope that these encouraging data will not be an excuse for making less effort, but a clear signal that we have identified the key, strategic points and that we must continue to concentrate on these."
"I appeal to both the European institutions and to the individual Member States in this respect."
"I refer in particular to three areas of action: 1) learning and retraining programmes, and programmes linking universities and other training establishments with the world of work; 2) responses to the demographic challenge, such as support for women and families, and the reform and harmonisation of social security systems; and 3) support, as yet insufficient, for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular to enable them to adapt to the latest challenges of international trade and to using new technologies and innovations."
"These are the areas that still need a lot of work."
"(ES) Europe is currently facing two great challenges: on the one hand, economic globalisation and, on the other, the ageing of the population, and all of this combined with the phenomenon of immigration."
"Both require clear modernisation of the European social model."
"As you know, competitiveness is the key element in terms of facing the challenge of globalisation."
"We all know that we cannot compete with the emerging countries in terms of labour costs, but we have a clear advantage, our human capital, given its capacity, its flexibility and its creativity, and we also have the crucial values of solidarity, equal opportunities and inclusiveness."
"With regard to the ageing of the population, in order to confront this challenge and to be able to guarantee pensions and healthcare in the future, it is essential that we increase productivity, and amongst other things that requires more jobs and also better quality jobs."
"There is a general consensus amongst the Member States that it is necessary to modernise legislation in the field of employment protection."
"In this regard, the combination of flexibility and security, which we often call 'flexisecurity', is a key element that must be developed in the future."
"We also need, firstly, to apply a strategy of active ageing, with more training for people over 45 and with financial and tax incentives to extend working lives beyond 65."
"Secondly, to guarantee an appropriate immigration policy, in accordance with a proposal that is based on a broad European agreement enabling it to be controlled in an ordered fashion and immigrants to be integrated by means of training and recycling plans suited to their profiles."
"Finally, to promote a reform of public pensions systems with a view to ensuring that they are sustainable through consolidation of public finances and incentives to supplement them by means of individual plans."
"I shall end, ladies and gentlemen, by stating that we still have a long way to go in order to achieve an effective and inclusive European labour market, which above all is focussed on life-long employment, and in which everybody, regardless of their age and conditions, receives the assistance and opportunities they require."
"(NL) Mr President, I should like to join in the congratulations to the rapporteur on his excellent report, and I am pleased that other political groups are backing it too."
"The report can already be seen as a first instalment on the discussion which is indeed to take place some time later this year about the review of the broad economic guidelines."
"It is vitally important for this report to be used properly in this context, because it contains a number of points that will prove very useful during this evaluation."
"It assesses the achievements by the Member States and the European economy as a whole in the light of these recommendations."
"I would, in this connection, like to move the focus slightly away from Commissioner Almunia's statements."
"He claimed that the countries that comply with the Stability and Growth Pact most effectively, are the best achievers."
"I would, based on my own experience in the Netherlands, put this slightly differently, and I can identify more with the rapporteur's statement that it is mainly those countries that have carried out structural reforms, combined with investments, that have done well."
"I am delighted that we will now have a Cabinet in the Netherlands - the team of ministers will be put in place this week - which will put investments first, in combination with the reforms that have already been carried out, while carefully observing the standards of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This is a very important basis, to my mind."
"A number of recommendations that are made in the guidelines are also reflected in the present government agreement, for example about labour market participation of the elderly, women or migrant groups."
"One point that is very important in this connection - and I should also like to underline it on behalf of my political group - is the emphasis on European coordination."
"Member States should not have to act as individuals, but a simultaneous, coordinated effort is, in fact, of key importance."
"This is why I should very much like to advise the German Presidency to work hand in hand with this interinstitutional working party that is being introduced, and, in particular, to look at what can be coordinated macro-economically at European level."
"This whole discussion on more coordinated economic and employment policy started in Essen 10 or 12 years ago."
"It is a challenge for Germany to develop this further now."
"(ET) Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the new three-year steering cycle that was launched two years ago with the revision of the Lisbon Strategy, with which the general guidelines of labour and economic policy were merged, permits Member States to adapt national Lisbon programmes to the conditions in a particular country."
"For the first time after the slow economic growth or even standstill of the past six years, European economic growth has begun to accelerate."
"This positive trend is also reflected in the labour market, and proves the mutual connection between economic policy and social protection."
"The twofold increase in labour productivity has reduced average unemployment to eight percent."
"Last year 2.9 million new jobs were created, but much still remains to be done, and we should not yet feel completely satisfied."
"Today only a few Member States have adopted a fully integrated life-cycle-based approach to work."
"We must take seriously the implementation of decisions we have already made; that is, that each young person who graduates from school or university be offered work, that child care be broadly available, that laws and regulations concerning labour protection be up to date, and so on."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for a realistic report and emphasise that the European Parliament is a suitable forum for the assessment of strategies and measures to enable us to fulfil the Lisbon objectives through joint action and improved cooperation."
"This is the right and obligation assigned to us by the people."
"(EL) Mr President, I have read both reports by my honourable friends with interest and would like to comment on three numbers: 8, 17 and 12 500"
"It is true that unemployment in the European Union is fluctuating today around 8%, which is an unacceptable figure in a Union with the declared intention of becoming the best and most productive economy by 2010."
"The second number is the percentage of citizens in the Union living below the poverty line which, at 17%, corresponds to 80 million European citizens who cannot get by on a daily basis."
"Finally, as you will already know, the multinational Alcatel Lucent has decided to lay off 12 500 workers over the next three years, most of whom work in Europe."
"After the Volkswagen scandal, you will understand that the social and employment fabric of the Union is being seriously shaken up."
"We can therefore continue wishful thinking about the Lisbon Strategy repeatedly."
"Unfortunately the truth is different and bitter."
"However, if there is one thing that I can retain from the reports, it is the need for Parliament to have more say on employment matters."
"(PT) The news brought to us by Mr Almunia is encouraging but I feel that more ambition is needed when it comes to productivity and job quality."
"Jobs - productive jobs - are what Europe needs and they are created in companies, and companies will only appear if there are plenty of high-calibre entrepreneurs ready to take risks."
"Consequently, we must do everything we can to promote an appetite for risk-taking and to raise the profile of entrepreneurship."
"It is an area in which I feel much more can be done."
"Another vital ingredient in creating jobs is confidence, without which it is very difficult to have investment growth."
"The factors that can help engender that confidence include balancing public accounts, developing the internal market, and good coordination in the Member States' economic policies and in economic and monetary policy."
"Much has been done already, but much remains to be done."
"Job creation should be a priority for a number of reasons. Firstly, because unemployment discourages people and makes them stop believing in themselves and in others."
"It is also the biggest factor in social exclusion. Job creation is the only way of preventing young Europeans wasting their opportunities and talents."
"Yet there are other reasons why job creation remains necessary in Europe, the most important of which relates to the financial sustainability of social protection."
"It is indisputably true that it will eventually be impossible to maintain the systems we have inherited if we are incapable of creating more jobs."
"Remedying this situation entails reform in many fields of the social economic systems of the various Member States."
"These are necessary reforms, not on account of any kind of accommodation with liberalisation theories that see the market as the solution to all evils."
"These reforms are urgently required and are justified in the name of the values that lie at the heart of the European project that they seek to preserve and to leave for future generations."
"The extent to which European labour markets are able to respond to the challenges of globalisation, of the technological revolution and of the ageing population continues to be a key issue, despite the positive progress that has been made in the past two years."
"Mr President, we cannot afford to be complacent that the unemployment rate is currently reduced."
"The Lisbon Strategy calls for both more and better quality jobs."
"Currently, the concept of 'flexicurity' is seen as a threat by many millions of our fellow citizens."
"It means for them and their families ever-greater insecurity."
"The Commission's proposal on the employment guidelines notes this, saying: 'a more comprehensive approach is necessary, better combining flexibility and security'."
"That is often repeated, but in reality things are getting worse, not better."
"In its Green Paper on modernising labour law, the Commission highlights some of the issues 'through non-standard contracts, businesses seek to remain competitive in the global economy by avoiding the cost of compliance with employment protection, notice periods and the cost of social security contributions'."
"That does not sound to me like the path toward competing through quality and high added value in a globalised world."
"The Commission also notes that fixed-term, part-time, on-call and zero-hour contracts, contracts for workers from temporary employment agencies, freelance contracts, etc. have become an established feature of European labour markets."
"It notes that they are on the increase, up 4% between 2001 and 2005, and show that a significant minority, round about 16%, remain trapped in a succession of short-term low-quality jobs, with inadequate social protection."
"Thankfully, we now have directives covering part-time and fixed-term contract workers."
"But those initiatives date from a time when the Commission still believed it had a role to play in establishing minimum standards, when it believed in using the legal bases available to it."
"But what about those other proliferating forms of insecure, low-paid, low-quality, atypical jobs?"
"The best the Commission can do nowadays is to ask a series of rhetorical questions in its Green Paper on how to rebalance 'flexicurity'."
"Well, maybe it is time the Commission returned to a social agenda with legislative content; a signal is desperately needed to the Member States."
"Mr President, this is an important debate on two very important reports, but it is an issue which the House has been covering both earlier today and indeed yesterday."
"Earlier today we voted through by a large majority a resolution in relation to the Lisbon Strategy regarding the Spring Council."
"It covered growth, employment, competitiveness; it was an important statement of what needed to be done and how to get here."
"Yesterday there were other important statements."
"Commission President Barroso reminded us that EU institutions had to focus on citizens' priorities; that we cannot build tomorrow's Europe with yesterday's tools; that we needed change."
"Chancellor Merkel, on behalf of the Council Presidency, said to loud applause that we needed less bureaucracy, not more; that better and simplified regulation was the direction to follow; and she urged the Parliament to back this process."
"With our resolution today we have formally given this backing."
"But I do wish that this might mean that here, across all political groups and indeed within political groups, the old argument that we can either have more competitiveness or more social justice could be seen as an old argument."
"The reality is that they are two sides of the same coin."
"The biggest social injustice of all, as several colleagues have mentioned, is that which is inflicted on those millions still unemployed who want to work but cannot find a job."
"This is not just their problem, it is our shame."
"MEPs should no longer be seen in two camps, either on the side of employers or on the side of employees."
"Let us please all agree to be in the same camp on the side of employment - of more jobs."
"That remains the priority of all our citizens."
"So let us not just give the Council Presidency and the Commission our backing for their agenda, let us make it our job to work together to deliver it."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report makes it a good day for Parliament for a number of reasons."
"First of all, the inseparable links between economic, social and environmental policy have, as has already been pointed out, gone beyond the level of trite statements and can now be seen in practice."
"We need only compare the title and the content to appreciate this shift."
"The report states quite plainly how long this has been on the books of the Community institutions."
"The economic policy guidelines need to include the social and environmental dimensions, in the sense that these are the most important aspects of them."
"It is not just a case of combining three equivalent areas in the best way possible, but of recognising that economic development is based on social cohesion and environmental alertness."
"Secondly, since competitiveness requires compatibility, action is needed in specific sectors, such as research and development, energy and the environment, as well as equally specific objectives for creating full employment and good quality jobs, guaranteeing dignity and security for people in work, and addressing calls for flexibility from both sides of the employer-worker relationship by means of measures aiming not just at conciliation but also at worker redeployment."
"In addition, since the coordination method can provide useful results, it is not only good practice that should be pointed out and exchanged, but also obstacles, difficulties and adverse outcomes."
"Great care is always needed when going down the road of harmonisation, since it is important to take account of contexts and legal systems; they may appear similar, but they retain their own peculiarities."
"However, understanding not only the proposal but also the implementation procedure and the impact caused will facilitate everybody's work at European, national and regional levels."
"The final reason is that national decisions must in turn follow an integrated, cross-cutting approach, and the prearranged plans and priorities must be reflected in the national budgets."
"(ES) The representative of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mrs in 't Veld, began her speech by saying that Mr Bullmann's report was a good report, as previous reports on the broad economic guidelines had also been, but that those fine words had not been turned into concrete action, that we have never been able to move beyond the talking stage."
"In the short space of time available to me, I am going to focus on the institutional reforms."
"A period of reflection on the Constitutional Treaty has been opened up and is now on the point of being concluded, and practically everybody has expressed their opinion."
"Mrs Merkel is proposing a roadmap; the Socialist candidate SÃ©golÃ¨ne Royal, to question the role of the Central Bank; the presidential candidate Sarkozy, the reforms that need to be introduced in order to make the Treaty viable."
"Everybody talks about this issue apart from us."
"I know that Mr Almunia believes that the great economic Treaty was Maastricht, and that may be true, but in Marxist terms, what Maastricht did was change the economic structures."
"It now falls to us to change the political superstructures, to bring the institutional architecture into line with these changes."
"I would propose that Parliament become involved and produce a few lines on what the Commissioner, from his vantage point, believes should be introduced in the Constitutional Treaty."
"An exercise of this kind was carried out in Group VI in the European Convention that failed, but the list remains in force."
"What are our views about what should be done on the Union's list of economic objectives?"
"How do we believe, and how far do we believe, the codecision procedure should be extended in the field of economic policies?"
"What should we do about the power of retrieval in the Lamfalussy procedure?"
"How can we guarantee the democratic control of the European Central Bank without undermining its independence?"
"What should we do about economic governance (this morning, the Italian President, Mr Napolitano, referred to the need for greater economic coordination)?"
"What should the President-in-Office of the Council do?"
"Here we are still saying nothing though."
"In the area of taxation, and I shall end here, all we need to do is incorporate into the Treaty what jurisprudence has already said, a single definition of tax domicile, an agreement on double taxation, the application of the non-discrimination principle, and I shall not go on because my time has run out."
"What I propose, Mr Almunia, is that you produce a few lines and bring it to that dialogue that we approved in previous broad economic guidelines, and that we reach agreement so that we can speak with one voice and make constructive proposals in this reform of the Constitutional Treaty, because tomorrow it will be too late."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the broad economic policy guidelines could be described as a moral, or regulatory, framework for the Member States, since economic policy is a matter for the Member States but our objectives are pan-European."
"This tension characterises all our debates."
"Those failing to comply with the broad economic policy guidelines undermine and endanger European economic policy objectives."
"Secondly, we are seeing a welcome development in economic policy, one that will provide the scope and tailwind for us to apply ourselves to our policy objectives and the necessary reform measures more actively, proactively and courageously than without the economic upswing."
"Thirdly, there is no contradiction between the tasks of utilising the internal market, pursuing the Lisbon objectives, complying with the Stability and Growth Pact and meeting the challenge of the consequences of demographic developments."
"On the contrary, all these measures must be taken if we are to realise the EU's broad economic policy guidelines and their objectives."
"That is why I say that it is not true what is often bandied about in election campaigns: that the independence of the European Central Bank - as the French believe - or the objectives of the EU are the cause of national problems."
"Let us use the time at our disposal to apply ourselves more actively to our objectives and our agreed policy reforms."
"Let us reform our social security systems so that we are able to meet the challenge of globalisation."
"Let us make energy efficiency and the strengthening of innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises the model for the European Economic Area, and let us improve economic policy structures - let us make savings to give ourselves scope for the investment needed - to make ourselves sustainably competitive at global level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks for this stimulating debate."
"The positive data reported in various fields are of course welcome, yet we must not rest on our laurels on this account - further action is needed."
"Various arguments have also been put forward as to the EU's position on, for example, the issue of employment and economic policies - focusing on the Lisbon process."
"It was also important to mention that competition and jobs were joined by sustainability in Gothenburg."
"The Spring European Council due to be held in a few days' time will address an issue that intersects with the field of jobs - namely that of energy."
"This issue involves, on the one hand, energy as a product and, on the other hand, the question of how to deal with energy in future."
"Can alternative forms be found?"
"How can new fields be developed in this regard?"
"After all, this is not something dreamed up by one party or another; it has become clear that the promotion of renewable energies represents an important element."
"I should like to state on behalf of the Presidency that what is equally important - and Franz MÃ¼ntefering, the President of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, held a meeting on this issue just last week, in Nuremburg in Bavaria - is how Europe can continue to incorporate the social dimension."
"What challenges are to be met?"
"How can we show that Europe does not represent a threat, but rather an answer to the challenge of globalisation and the issue of maintaining the social security system?"
"These are very important points, which we shall also pursue within the framework of the G8."
"I have already given my assurances that, in terms of not only the dialogue, the Troika, but also of the issue as to how Commission, Council and Parliament deal with each other in order to stay in close contact on this, we are pursuing the same objectives."
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) I would like to begin by once again thanking the two rapporteurs and everybody who has been involved in the drawing up of these reports and this afternoon's debate - which I believe has been extremely illuminating - on the situation we are experiencing and the challenges we need to face."
"The situation - to use a Castilian figure of speech, though I believe that similar expressions are used in the few languages that I know of other countries of the Union - can be defined optimistically as a half-full bottle, or, if not pessimistically, then at least if we are to place the emphasis on what still needs to be done, as a half-empty bottle."
"At the beginning of the debate, some of you asked me, 'Is the growth we are seeing cyclical or does it also have structural components?', 'Will the improvement in employment just be temporary for as long as the economic expansion lasts or is it true that we are achieving a better combination of economic efficiency, more employment and greater social cohesion?'"
"I believe that it is a combination of the two elements."
"I believe that the structural reforms that have been carried out over recent years, together with the budgetary discipline and the macroeconomic policies, the mix of macroeconomic policies implemented since the launch of the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union, are beginning to bear fruit."
"I believe that it is right that the European citizens should be aware that we are beginning to harvest that fruit, that the economic growth of close to 3%, the two million jobs created last year, the twelve million jobs created in the euro zone since 1 January 1999, the very good economic results of the huge majority of the new Member States, the greater consumer confidence and the increase in investment are linked to the efforts and decisions of recent years."
"It is not merely a matter of chance. Otherwise, how can we expect the citizens to believe us and support us when we say to them, 'Look, we have to carry on with our efforts'?"
"We have to carry on integrating Europe's financial systems. We have to carry on improving the quality of legislation in order to create a favourable environment for small and medium-sized businesses so that they can compete without any administrative burden, without a series of obstacles preventing them from moving forward."
"We need to provide good arguments so that we can ask workers to allow the improvement in the functioning of the labour markets to go ahead. Only by making that effort will we genuinely be able to offer high-quality jobs, a future for coming generations and a combination of environmental policies to combat climate change and energy policies that are capable of improving our competitiveness."
"Only by doing that will we be able to offer that result."
"Therefore, the Lisbon Strategy reforms, which we must continue, call for effort and responsibility on the part of the European Institutions and the Member States, of the public institutions and of the public sector, and the citizens and companies in the private sector, but they also need to be based on certain steps forward that we are already taking and which must be demonstrated."
"I do not believe, ladies and gentlemen, that the European institutions should draw up policies pessimistically and with the feeling that the future will be worse than the past, because if we do, if that is the only message the European institutions send out, the citizens will wonder what they want Europe for."
"Europe is the best instrument available to us in the 21st century, as the Lisbon Strategy stated from the outset, for making economic dynamism compatible with social cohesion and solidarity with future generations in terms of sustainability, with the elderly, with the environment and with future generations."
"Finally, I would like to comment briefly on two aspects that have been raised in the debate."
"Firstly, the coordination of economic policies."
"If I remember rightly, the Messina Declaration back in 1955 - since we are now talking about the Berlin Declarations as if they are similar to the Messina Declaration - talked about the need to coordinate economic policies, but to that end, Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo, there is no need for you to give a humble Commissioner a mandate to become the next European Convention."
"What we need to do is to discuss the stability and convergence programmes in depth, as the Commission and the Ecofin Council are currently doing."
"What we need to do is to discuss the application of the national Lisbon reform programmes and the Community Lisbon Strategy in depth, as the Spring European Council is going to do, to discuss how to draw up a common energy policy that is compatible with an ambitious European environmental programme."
"We need to carry on integrating financial services, to carry on improving our internal market, which, as some of you have said, still provides Europe with an excellent tool for confronting globalisation with optimism."
"Furthermore - and this is more a job for national governments than for European directives, given the way things are - we need to improve the functioning of the labour markets, combining flexibility and security, because if there is no security for workers, there will be no flexibility in employment, and if there is no flexibility in companies, there will be no jobs for workers."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that that is the message that emerges from this debate, and the Commission is entirely in agreement."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate on these two reports is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. - Within the framework of the recent socio-economic developments in the Union and even if unemployment figures seem to decrease, genuine and thorough attention should still be given to social cohesion in the Union as a whole."
"As a matter of fact, despite the increase in employment data, poverty is still growing in the eurozone and part of the jobs that are created are unfortunately of a precarious nature."
"Quality and secure employment should go along with economic growth through the achievement of the Lisbon Strategy objectives."
"With the increasing disparities between the growth rates of the Member States and the relatively low growth rates of certain large Member States, significant efforts are needed in order to enable the Union to face the new challenges of an ageing population and growing competition as a result of globalisation."
"The Bullmann report, by focusing on the role of SMEs, research and development, the environment and the energy sector, aims clearly at creating greater coherence in the policy-making processes and the economic governance of the Union while attempting to develop a genuinely effective and inclusive European labour market."
"I therefore support the line adopted by the rapporteur."
"Council Question Time"
"Madam President, I can answer the question as follows."
"The objectives of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) are laid down in Article 105 of the EC Treaty."
"The main purpose of the provision is the maintenance of price stability."
"Apart from this objective, however, the ESCB supports the general economic policies of the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the Community's objectives pursuant to Article 2 EC."
"The ESCB acts in accordance with the principles of a market economy and free competition."
"This includes, in particular, the effective allocation of resources in compliance with the principles of the EC Treaty."
"The provisions of Article 107(5) EC may be amended by the Council acting by a qualified majority; that is, acting either by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the European Central Bank (ECB) and after consulting the Commission or unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the ECB."
"In either case, the assent of the European Parliament is required."
"Since, however, Article 105 EC mentioned at the beginning is not among the provisions listed in Article 107(5), it can be amended only using the general Treaty amendment procedure pursuant to Article 48 TEU."
"The Council is not currently dealing with any proposals to this effect."
"deputising for the author. - (PT) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, how do you explain the fact that the European Central Bank is threatening to raise interest rates still further, after almost doubling them over the past year? This has had serious detrimental consequences for the economy, for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises and for families, especially in countries such as Portugal with the weakest economies."
"Is this an example of the Community solidarity and economic and social cohesion that you are advocating?"
"If so, why not amend the objectives and the modus operandi of the European Central Bank?"
"When the European Central Bank was established, we laid down an important principle: that of the independence of the Central Bank."
"Its job is to assess, on the basis of various indicators, how to regulate the money market at the end of the day, including in the matter of interest-rate increases."
"This means that there is no way the Council or a Member State can influence monetary policy."
"(LT) The European Central Bank has its own stable inflation indicator, which is just nearing 2%."
"However, when the Maastricht criteria are applied, this is not taken into consideration."
"Under the Maastricht criteria, the inflation indicator is calculated according to an entirely different methodology, which in no way correlates to the inflation indicator of the European Central Bank."
"Would it not appear that these indicators should be coordinated, so that it would be clear to everyone just what exactly the stable inflation rate is?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) The EU-Africa Ministerial Conference held on 22-23 November 2006 in Tripoli was an important event, bringing together for the first time all the Member States of the EU and - I should like to underline this very clearly - all African countries, namely the members of the African Union plus Morocco, to discuss migration and development issues."
"The purpose of the Conference was to strengthen cooperation in the spirit of partnership in these fields, which are of vital importance to both sides, and also to decide on joint action."
"The Ministerial Conference closed by adopting a political declaration listing a series of fields in which action is needed, from development issues through to legal channels for immigration and the fight against illegal immigration."
"In addition, an Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings, Especially Women and Children was adopted."
"The implementation of these two instruments is expected to begin in the next few months."
"(ES) As you know, the Commission is currently making a series of proposals to regulate legal immigration, in agreement with countries of origin, particularly with the African countries."
"I would like to know whether, within the context of this Tripoli Conference, the Council will be in a position to support the Commission's proposal in this regard."
"Mr Medina Ortega, a whole package of measures was discussed at the Conference in Tripoli, since we take the view that the migration problem cannot be solved by a single proposal or solution, and that a series of measures is needed."
"The issue of legal migration was also discussed, including various points relating to the feasibility of addressing this aspect."
"Equally, however, the Conference addressed the feasibility of Africans who live in Europe - in the Diaspora, as they see it - returning to their home countries for a given period to help with the development of education systems and with job creation, for example."
"It also discussed the possibility of reducing the cost of money transfers to these countries."
"For example, it could happen that, out of EUR 1 000 remitted to a country, only EUR 800 reaches the recipient since the charges are so high."
"A whole package of measures was discussed with the countries of the African Union plus Morocco, therefore."
"Furthermore, discussions are continuing on what possibilities the EU and the African countries could open up for temporary employment in Europe, for example."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, another of the objectives of this Conference was undoubtedly to discuss ways of reducing the causes of migration; that is, to take the relevant preventive action."
"There are good examples of where such action has been very effective, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo. There, European police units have provided assistance in the field of legal education and the military field, resulting in the development of the rule of law, with a view to achieving greater stability and enabling economic investment."
"Are we prepared to extend this model to other African countries, too, since we know that migration flows come not only from North Africa but also from Central and Southern Africa, where there is instability?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) Mr Pirker, back in July, a Conference was held in Rabat: not one entitled 'EU-Africa', but one initiated by Morocco, Spain and France."
"It became clear at the Tripoli Conference, however, that there is a further African route, the East-West route, that should also be the focus of our attention."
"To return to your specific question, however, there are indeed examples of successful action."
"Another important thing that this Conference needed to make clear was that one way of tackling the causes is through 'best governance', by the Government choosing a form of governance that gives its citizens the chance to become involved in the generation and sale of raw materials and in education."
"The obligation of the EU - the Member States - to offer assistance in the field of administration and of police and judiciary systems, where this is requested, was also emphasised."
"A few years ago, in the course of various debates in Europe, 'best practices' were discussed - that is, looking at what one's neighbours are doing successfully - and this concept could certainly be transferred to certain African countries."
"This kind of comprehensive approach was discussed, and it is now up to us to decide what action to take in the various fields - although I have to say that not all measures are needed in all cases, as some countries have already made very great progress thanks to domestic developments."
"However, the EU did give assurances of its support and solidarity on this."
"(LT) Madam President, Malta is the country that has suffered the most as a result of illegal migration from Africa."
"Several nations, mine among them, in the name of solidarity with Malta, have invited illegal migrants to come to our countries legalising their status at the same time."
"Is it the view of the Minister that this will have a positive effect, or will it adversely affect the illegal migration situation?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Demographic change in Europe concerns all the Member States of the EU."
"A major feature is the low or even falling birth rates throughout Europe."
"The changing demographic of nations necessitates comprehensive structural changes as part of a long-term strategy if the social cohesion of the generations and the competitiveness of the European economy are to be preserved."
"In its Communication entitled 'The demographic future of Europe - from challenge to opportunity' of 12 October of last year, the European Commission notes that Europe has never in its history experienced economic growth without population growth."
"In this light, confronting the demographic challenge with the help of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs takes on particular importance."
"A priority for the German Council Presidency in this regard is enabling men and women wishing to start a family to do so with the help of family-friendly policies."
"Experience in a number of Member States has shown that political measures are possible as well as necessary."
"There should be a European 'alliance for the family' to serve as a platform for Member States to exchange views and experiences. Its field of competence should include key tasks relating to the management of demographic change."
"This alliance should also actively involve the social partners, civil society and representatives of science and industry."
"The key objective of the alliance should be to offer support to the Member States through this ongoing exchange."
"The intention is that, by the end of the German Presidency, not only will the political starting signal have been fired, but also the first tangible steps will have been taken towards the realisation of this alliance."
"In so doing, the idea is to utilise existing resources and to tie in with existing structures; the European Demographic Forums launched by the Commission in its Communication will be particularly important reference points in this regard."
"The European Commission has already set up a high-level group on demography and the family."
"The alliance will complement the comprehensive initiatives at European level for the promotion of gender equality, particularly the European Pact for Gender Equality and the Commission's Roadmap for equality between men and women 2006-10."
"Only an improvement in the reconciliation of family and career will enable men and women to decide to have more children without giving up their careers."
"The Member States must work together with the social partners and individual companies on reducing pay inequality and on supporting parents in the early stages of bringing up their child."
"After all, an improvement in the reconciliation of family and career is another chief objective of the European Pact for Youth, with a view to giving young people access to vocational and social integration."
"(EL) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your reply."
"However, I would like you to tell me, as far as the Youth Pact is concerned, which particular actions you are thinking of applying."
"Given that the policy on the family is a national policy and that, consequently, every Member State has its own policy, what common measures can you foresee in order to apply this intention of yours of helping families?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) In the course of our debate a little while ago, we discussed the employment issue and the fact that different countries have different structures and developments."
"There are overlaps, where we see the same trends in different Member States."
"Here, too, it is primarily a matter of taking stock and of seeing what specific answers can be found."
"In my answer just now, I mentioned several fields that we wish to develop in order to bring this issue into even sharper focus, several of which concern young people."
"In the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the following questions arise. How do we ensure that young people find a vocational training place or job?"
"What prejudices are there in society, for example against young people from migrant backgrounds?"
"These are all issues we hope to discuss at various conferences this year."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if we want to see a sensible demographic trend in Europe, we must at any rate stop clinging to our ideologically skewed, hypocritical blinkers and dreaming of a model of life that existed perhaps 200 years ago."
"Children are brought to life not only within traditional families, but also within other models of life."
"We have an example of favourable demographic trends here in the EU - in France - as childcare places there are sufficient and affordable."
"I should be interested to hear what the President-in-Office is planning in this connection."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) Mr Leichtfried, many thanks for your supplementary question."
"Here, too, we can pick up the thread of previous discussions at Spring Summits, where the generation of investment in the Member States to enable the reconciliation of family and career has been mentioned."
"A number of aspects should certainly be considered in this regard."
"A key point, however, is that people have been singling out France and other Member States that are enjoying certain successes."
"I hail from one country where the situation is unsatisfactory, but where attempts are being made to find a solution."
"It is important not to offer a centralised solution, but instead to be guided by the principle of looking at neighbours who are doing things successfully and seeing how we can implement these accordingly at home."
"That is the way to finally achieve an outcome different from the one we are seeing now."
"(DE) My question concerns the common measures that could help us."
"What does the President-in-Office think of the suggestion that the German Presidency - together with the European Commission, of course - select and recommend the best examples in Europe?"
"He has mentioned France, but there are other good examples, too."
"This would be of particular value to the new Member States."
"President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) I shall gladly take up that suggestion again."
"It is a valuable idea: rather than keeping quiet, as it were, about the positive developments in the EU, the things that have had positive results, we should find out whether they might also work in our own country on account of our similar structures."
"I shall be happy to take this idea away with me and present it to my country's Minister, Mrs von der Leyen, who is of course the current Council President responsible for family affairs, women, youth and senior citizens."
"Minister, one problem is that evictions and segregation are often condoned or even instigated by local or regional government, and central governments have not been effective in challenging them."
"Will the Presidency encourage all Member States to do so?"
"Secondly, I am not really happy with your reference to subsidiarity."
"Anti-discrimination legislation is not sufficient to tackle systemic discrimination."
"There needs to be positive action and proactive measures."
"In some Member States, public authorities have a positive duty to promote equality."
"Surely you can encourage all Member States to do that through a process of peer review."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) Baroness Ludford, on the subject of subsidiarity, Member States do indeed bear responsibility."
"The large number of progress reports drawn up in the course of the accession of the Eastern European Member States included an examination of the minorities issue from many angles, particularly concerning all aspects of the situation of the Roma."
"It is always important to bear that in mind."
"On the other hand, there is also scope for establishing programmes to promote the integration of the Roma population, including with the involvement of the World Bank."
"I believe that this is an issue that cannot be solved by the respective Member States alone, and that the integration of these sections of the population requires assistance from others."
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office, I have a question on this subject."
"We agree that non-discrimination is a question of time."
"In my home country, authorities operating not at national but at lower level are currently endeavouring to impose bans on begging, for example."
"They believe that this will offer a solution to the occurrence of at least some phenomena."
"In my view, this is the wrong approach."
"What is the Council's opinion?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) The EU emissions trading scheme is one of the most important policy instruments at the disposal of the European Community and its Member States for achieving their Kyoto objectives in the most cost-effective way."
"As the honourable Member will be aware, Directive 2003/87/EC obliges Member States to publish their national allocation plans."
"They have to notify these to the Commission and to the other Member States at least 18 months before the beginning of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, namely 2008-2012."
"The Commission has evaluated the Member States' national allocation plans."
"The Presidency will continue reviewing this EU emissions trading scheme on the basis of the Commission Communication, which identifies the priority issues."
"The Presidency will also follow up the proposal to bring aviation into this scheme."
"The Presidency is working towards ensuring that the emissions trading scheme makes the expected contribution to the achievement of the Kyoto objectives, and is working to improve and extend this EU scheme with a view to establishing a global carbon market that leads to the emission reductions needed to tackle climate change."
"No one doubts the Council's determination on the question of the emissions trading scheme."
"No one doubts the good news that we have heard recently."
"The question that EU citizens are asking, though, is what is the incentive mechanism for really making this work?"
"This is an enormous project, and what during the German Presidency would be the scope for further incentives to encourage Member States to hit the targets and indeed oblige them to meet these targets, now that European Union citizens truly believe that something is on the move here and there is something very positive?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) Mr Moraes, this instrument is in practical use, so to speak, and I agree with you that there is still room for improvement in the scheme's efficiency and that incentives should perhaps also be used to manage it."
"The Presidency will take care of this, too."
"As the honourable Member is aware, however, this is always a long-term process - it will not be possible to solve this, either, at the flick of a switch."
"The Presidency will see to this issue, however."
"I have one brief question."
"The Commission came up with its proposal on energy and climate change a few weeks ago."
"In that proposal the level of carbon emissions for cars was increased from 120g/km to 130g/km."
"Does the Presidency think that this helps or hinders the issue of emissions?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) As the honourable Member knows, there has been a Commission proposal."
"This proposal is now being examined and discussed accordingly in the Member States, and responses will be presented. I am sure that, when the energy action plan is discussed in spring, an acceptable solution will be found that involves the various modes of transport and emitting sources concerned."
"The emissions trading scheme is clearly good as far as it goes, and I was pleased to hear the President-in-Office's commitment to try and expand it to include aviation."
"However, does he accept that the climate - no pun intended - is now right for negotiating outside the European Union with countries such as the United States to make this a truly global trading scheme, which would of course have a much bigger impact on the environment?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) The Presidency would like to answer Mr Davis's question with reference to its report on the implementation of its overall policy on transparency and the assessment of its impact on the effectiveness of the Council's work - I am afraid it is a very long title - that the Presidency presented to the Council on 11 December 2006."
"In addition to a preliminary assessment of the impact of the rising number of public debates and deliberations on the effectiveness of the Council's work, the report contains data on the number of visits to the new Council video streaming website and to the website providing access to Council documents relating to public deliberations or debates."
"In the first four-and-a-half months of the new transparency measures alone, over 28 000 visits to these new features of the Council website were recorded."
"These figures document the positive response of the public and the media to the new transparency measures."
"The webcast and the online availability of documents relating to public sessions have thus considerably improved opportunities for following the debates and decision-making processes in the Council."
"The Council is constantly striving to improve these features."
"Concerning the impact of these transparency measures on the effectiveness of the Council's work, it should be borne in mind that, at the time of the initial evaluation, which the European Council had called for in June 2006, the new rules had been in operation for less than six months, including the month of August."
"This means that it was, and still is, too early to issue a definitive evaluation."
"deputising for the author. - Madam President, I too am delighted to be able to address you as such."
"I am absolutely delighted to hear that there were 28 000 visits recorded and that people can follow debates on the net."
"We talk a lot about democracy and plan D for dialogue and this is an opportunity for citizens to see it in action."
"I believe this is a real gesture towards greater transparency."
"But you did say that the Council is working hard to improve this and what I want to know is, are you satisfied it is working successfully?"
"Do you have any plans to promote it or advertise it to a wider audience?"
"And do you have any specific ideas on the improvements that you might make, even though it is only a short time in action?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) As I have already explained, this has been in operation for only a few months, which is not enough time to enable a final analysis at this stage."
"I do believe, however, that the figures indicate the interest there has been."
"We have talked a good deal about transparency and communicating European policy today, and also about taking decisions close to the citizen."
"It remains the ongoing task of many actors in the EU to seek ways of making these policies more transparent."
"After a while, when we have reliable data at our disposal, we shall consider where further improvements can be made, and how to attract a broader population of users."
"I would appeal for a little patience until we have more reliable figures."
"President-in-Office, as a former civil servant, having taken many notes in Council meetings, I know that those meetings are not necessarily the most exciting events in the world and, therefore, 28 000 viewers - hmm, I kind of understand!"
"I should like to make a practical proposal and test you on it."
"Instead of sitting in a circle in the Council with the Permanent Representative next to you, why not sit in a hemicycle with no assistance whatsoever?"
"Perhaps this would make the debate more interesting and you would get a few more hits on the internet site."
"What do you think?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) Mr Posselt, my answer to your question is as follows. Martti Ahtisaari's endeavours have the unqualified support of the EU."
"The strategic objective in this regard is still to achieve a lasting settlement for Kosovo quickly without endangering democracy in Serbia or the stability of the region as a whole."
"The EU is currently working on plans for three projects."
"These are the international civilian mission (ICM), a rule of law mission and programmes for continuing the promotion of economic development and furthering Kosovo's prospects of EU membership."
"In all three cases, the plans are being made in close cooperation with the local authorities and other international actors, particularly the United States and NATO."
"The team making preparations for the international civilian mission started work in PriÅ¡tina on 9 October 2006."
"It has the twofold task of planning the structure and staffing of the mission and determining its infrastructure requirements and, together with UNMIK and the competent Kosovo authorities, preparing the possible transfer of competences to both the ICM and the local authorities."
"Since May 2006, a Planning Team has been in Kosovo to prepare a possible rule of law mission within the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)."
"The planned mission is intended to have a general role in teaching, observing and advising in matters of the rule of law."
"In addition, it would have executive powers in some fields relating to the police, the judiciary and customs."
"The precise scope of its mandate will have to be established after the resolution of the status issue."
"The mission, which would be introduced following the conclusion of the status process and a transitional period where it worked jointly with UNMIK, would be the largest civilian ESDP mission to date."
"A successful conclusion of the status process, which is being led by Mr Ahtisaari, is essential not only to give the people of Kosovo clear prospects, but also for stability in the whole region."
"The conclusion of this process represents the end point in the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia."
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office, many thanks for that very good, precise reply."
"The longer the settlement of the status issue is delayed, the greater the risk of instability in Kosovo - and this, in turn, could be used to effect the partition of Kosovo after all, even through the back door."
"My question is a specific one: could a more intensive international and EU presence - in terms of both civilian and military forces - perhaps be envisaged for, say, potential crisis regions such as Mitrovica; one far exceeding the present dimensions and along the lines of what was seen in Vukovar?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr Posselt, you speak of delays and the potential risks these entail."
"It is very important that we have stated that a solution is needed - and the General Affairs and External Relations Council discussed this very intensively on Monday."
"There is nothing in the Council Conclusions to indicate that things are being put off indefinitely."
"On the contrary, we have used the opinions voiced - including on the occasion of the EU Troika meeting in Belgrade - as an opportunity to say that a new parliament is indeed emerging from the democratic forces, that a new government will also be formed; and that we have to give these a while longer to enable the appointment of the new negotiating team so that it can join the negotiations."
"The Council has been conscious that we cannot let the whole process start again from scratch, however, as the timing is indeed important if we are to avoid the instability you mention."
"For this reason, I do not wish to speculate at this time on other things that may or may not happen."
"Minister, you say that EU Foreign Ministers want to avoid indefinite delay, but there is some concern that the Ahtisaari status mission risks being somewhat drawn out."
"Do not last Saturday's regrettable deaths at a demonstration attended by, we understand, 3 000 people - and I would say 'only' 3 000 people - call into question the expertise and competence of the policing of demonstrations and make rather urgent a better management of this situation so that things do not get out of control?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) I should like to reiterate once more that we are currently at a very important stage of the status process."
"Account must always be taken of developments in Serbia, too, however."
"The tight deadline that has now been set is important to enable the process to continue."
"As we know, it is not the EU alone that decides; the Special Representative of the Secretary-General must of course present proposals to the United Nations to enable the necessary steps to be taken."
"(NL) Madam President, Mr Gloser, I think that the business of giving Kosovo de facto independence will prove to be one of the international community's biggest challenges in the next couple of months, and one in which the European Union will need to play an important role."
"You yourself talked about the international civil mission, the civil branch of the European defence and security policy."
"The figures I hear being bandied around suggest that 71 officials will be attached to the international civil mission and some one thousand more to the European Union to work on European defence and security policy."
"Have you any idea how much this translates into in budget terms?"
"Has the Council put any arrangements in place in order to prepare for a possible budget change?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) The Council attaches very great importance to the annual audit and Statement of Assurance of the Court of Auditors and has repeatedly affirmed its unwavering support for sound financial management in the EU."
"Following a detailed examination of the annual report of the European Court of Auditors by the appropriate Council bodies, the Council sends Parliament a recommendation on discharge pursuant to Article 276(1) of the EC Treaty for each financial year."
"This recommendation on discharge contains the extensive conclusions of the Council on the Court of Auditors' annual report, in which the Council addresses, in detail, the observations of the Court of Auditors and the Commission's opinions on these."
"The conclusions also contain recommendations to the Commission and the Member States for eliminating any shortcomings or weaknesses discovered."
"These Council conclusions are debated by Parliament at the same time as the Court of Auditors' annual report as part of the discharge procedure."
"It does not seem appropriate to introduce another Council report - which would of necessity have largely the same content - in addition to these detailed conclusions."
"(DE) Please allow me to ask a question."
"The problem with the Statement of Assurance lies in its shared management."
"A report such as this could be a solution enabling a positive Statement of Assurance for the shared management."
"Why is the Council not prepared to introduce one?"
"(DE) I can give a fairly short answer to this. There is no majority support for such a change among the Member States."
"Mr President-in-Office, do you agree that there does need to be an assumption of responsibility by Member States?"
"Eighty percent of European Union spending is carried out on its behalf by national governments and it is there that most of the errors picked up every year by the Court of Auditors are found - fortunately neither fraud nor mismanagement - but it is there that they are found, and, until the Member States take their responsibility, we are likely to face the same problem year after year, doing enormous damage to the image of the European Union."
"I should like to emphasise once more, however, that, where there is budgetary control, this is not necessarily a matter of a request by the Court of Auditors, but rather of the following question. How can we make the rules, including budgetary rules, more efficient, more transparent, more uniform, so that the necessary control can be achieved?"
"There is not the necessary majority support for a change among the Member States."
"(NL) Madam President, Mr Gloser, you have said on two occasions that this regulation has been unable to achieve a majority vote in the Council."
"Can you be frank enough to say which Member States are prepared to adopt a regulation of this kind and which are not?"
"I think that this could make for considerable democratic pressure on the Member States that are not prepared to do this and do not wish to be called to account for the funds they spend."
"President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) I do not actually know at the moment which Member States we are talking about."
"I can assure the honourable Member, however, that it is the vast majority."
"There is no point in cherry-picking at this time."
"Other proposals have been put forward, however, including by the Commission, such as the creation of an integrated control framework."
"The national declaration of assurance is also excluded here, however."
"There are many other elements, including in the context of personal responsibility, that could help ensure that budgetary control is exercised properly at the end of the day."
"In addition, irrespective of the question of political will, the EC Treaty does not provide for the field mentioned by the honourable Member. I do believe, however, that the other possibilities I have just mentioned for simplifying procedures represent key elements."
"Thank you, President-in-Office."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19.00 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Situation in Darfur (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Darfur."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, we are confronted with a dramatic humanitarian, security and political problem in Darfur today."
"The situation on the ground is deteriorating by the day."
"The number of civilians affected by the conflict has risen to almost four million since 2003."
"Throughout 2006 we saw an increase in the number of violent deaths in Darfur."
"Attacks on humanitarian aid agencies also significantly increased and this has prompted some organisations to evacuate."
"Continued violations of the ceasefire by both the Sudanese Government and the rebel factions deepen insecurity and instability."
"Most recently, on Monday, Sudanese military forces bombarded Cariari and Bahai, two villages in north Darfur close to the Chad-Sudan border."
"The African Union Mission to Sudan - established in 2004 to help prevent further conflict - continues to face resource constraints."
"Despite its best efforts, it had some difficulty in providing effective protection to civilians or carrying out additional duties associated with the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement."
"Politically, the situation is complicated by splits and regrouping among the non-signatory rebel movements as well as the Government's refusal to consider reopening the deadlocked Peace Agreement."
"Darfur is not a simple issue."
"The commitment of the European Union to alleviating such a dramatic situation has been reiterated on several occasions, most recently at the European Council last December, at the Council on 22 January and, just two days ago, through the General Affairs Council conclusions on Sudan of 12 February."
"We must work to ensure the protection of non-combatants as well as of humanitarian aid workers."
"We must seek the full implementation of the UN-AU three phase plan for Darfur, this being the most effective means at our disposal to support the African Union mission in Sudan and to protect civilians."
"But our overriding objective in Darfur must be to achieve a durable peace through a political settlement agreed by all parties voluntarily and then implemented."
"The strategy of Khartoum to negotiate individually with each rebel leader to buy their support will not create a cohesive and lasting peace."
"The Council of the EU, in its latest conclusions on Sudan, has emphasised the need for an inclusive political process and confirmed its support for the joint initiative of the African Union and UN special envoys to start negotiations between the parties as soon as possible."
"On several occasions and in various fora, the Commission has stressed the need for a political solution in Darfur based on the existing peace agreement and insisted that there is no military solution to the crisis."
"In this context, the European Commission has strongly backed the African Union in the search for a political settlement in Darfur."
"The Commission has been providing continued support to the African Union in political and financial terms."
"With cofinancing from Belgium, the Commission stands behind any and all efforts to revive the peace agreement."
"The European Commission has provided one and a half billion euros specifically for the Darfur crisis, covering security, humanitarian needs and peace efforts for Darfur."
"The aim is to create the conditions to bring the non-signatory parties of the Darfur Peace Agreement back to the negotiating table and to start effective implementation of the Agreement."
"Pending a lasting settlement, the Commission is also active in the political dÃ©marche intended to obtain the agreement of the Khartoum Government to a joint AU-UN force capable of providing effective protection of civilians."
"In the margins of the African Union Summit on 28 January, Commissioner Michel met with the Sudanese President, Mr al-Bashir, as well as with the UN Secretary-General Mr Ban Ki-Moon."
"The Commissioner was also in Ethiopia and in Eritrea where the Darfur issue was raised."
"Just yesterday, the Darfur issue was discussed in Washington in a meeting between Commissioner Michel and the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice."
"This Parliament is right to debate the Darfur Peace Agreement and the critical situation in Darfur."
"Yet we must not take the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for granted."
"EU Heads of Mission in Khartoum report that this peace agreement, made in 2005 with the south, is in trouble."
"After 20 years of civil war the comprehensive peace agreement may be the last chance for the Khartoum regime to show that the federal power-sharing form of government can work for this vast country."
"If the Comprehensive Peace Agreement cannot work, then nor can the Darfur Peace Agreement."
"It is important, I think, that the critical situation in Darfur does not divert our attention, or indeed the attention of the Sudanese regime, from the very real threat to the whole sub-region if both the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the Darfur Peace Agreement are not pursued with more vigour."
"This is a message that the Commission will strive to communicate in the weeks ahead."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the Council released its conclusions on Sudan on Monday, so it is appropriate that Parliament also speaks out strongly this week, further highlighting the humanitarian crisis and international scandal that is Darfur."
"We are attempting to raise the political temperature on this issue to increase the pressure on those who can, if the will exists, make things happen on the ground to protect people."
"We all know the figures and the scale of the humanitarian consequences of insufficient action by the international community."
"It is estimated that up to 400 000 people have been killed and more than two and a half million people displaced or made homeless in the last three years due to conflict."
"NGOs currently provide humanitarian relief for up to four million people."
"That is half of Darfur's entire population."
"In recent months there have been repeated attacks on humanitarian convoys and twelve aid workers have been killed in Darfur in the last six months."
"So NGOs are pulling their people out of Darfur while indiscriminate attacks continue on civilians."
"So what can we do?"
"The main thrust of this resolution is to call on the UN to set a clear date for deployment of the planned UN-supported peacekeeping force, or hybrid force, into Darfur, even in the absence of agreement with the Sudanese Government, in order to secure humanitarian aid corridors to an increasingly isolated population in the region."
"We are calling for this in the context of the UN's responsibility to protect, based on the failure of the Sudanese Government to protect its own population from war crimes and crimes against humanity, and a failure to provide humanitarian assistance to the population."
"President al-Bashir continues to oppose Phase 3 of the present UN Plan which allows the AU mission to be bolstered by more than 20 000 UN peacekeeping troops."
"The point is, diplomacy is failing."
"People are dying in huge numbers and at some point the international community is obliged to act more firmly."
"That is why the setting of a clear date for the deployment of troops will focus the attention on a tight timescale to find a diplomatic solution to get peacekeepers on the ground in Darfur."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Darfur has been suffering under a regime of terror for four years now."
"Hundreds of thousands of people there have lost their lives, two million have lost their homes, and rape, murder and pillaging are daily occurrences there."
"It is nearly impossible to really grasp the extent of this suffering."
"Meanwhile, despite all the fine agreements, human rights violations get increasingly out of hand."
"Over the past few months, the situation has hit an all-time low for both the people and aid workers."
"Despite the Peace Agreement concluded in early January, large parts of North Darfur were deliberately bombarded recently by the Sudanese air force."
"Even the aid workers are no longer safe from violence, aid organisations increasingly feel it."
"Last month, 15 UN organisations, including UNICEF, reported that they were no longer able to keep on providing aid to the people in Darfur in an adequate manner."
"Two weeks ago, the aid organisation MÃ©dicins du Monde was the first to withdraw, and Oxfam and CARE International are at risk of having to follow suit, even though three and a half million Darfuris rely on humanitarian aid."
"The Council is not present today."
"How long do we intend to perpetuate this untenable situation?"
"The UN may be speaking with force in its resolution, but it has not done much in the way of action."
"The peace force that was promised two months ago in Addis Ababa produced some 100 troops and very little else."
"The UN Security Council authorised sanctions against four major perpetrators of atrocities, but nothing happened."
"It is unacceptable for European Member States to be able to impose sanctions on war criminals in countries such as Belarus, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, North Korea, Burma and Zimbabwe and to fail to do so in Darfur, where the Council is neglecting its humanitarian duty."
"The international community should no longer stand by helplessly while millions of innocent people are being driven away from their homes, murdered and raped."
"Europe should take the lead and take urgent action in order to stop the humanitarian crisis in Darfur in its tracks."
"The Sudanese Government will be prepared to conclude real peace agreements and adhere to them only if its own interests are affected, for the only language it understands is its own, that of the fist."
"In southern Sudan, an oil boycott proved effective, and I would urge Members belonging to the other political parties to apply the same tactics if necessary."
"I should like to ask the Council whether it is prepared, without delay, to declare sanctions against anyone who violates the ceasefire or who attacks citizens, peace keepers or aid workers."
"Would it be prepared to do everything necessary to stop them getting away with it and, once and for all, to enforce and implement the sanctions agreed upon in the Security Council?"
"Is it prepared to enforce the presence of the hybrid peace force of African Union soldiers and blue helmets?"
"Would it, finally, be prepared to apply economic sanctions, including the introduction of an oil embargo?"
"We did not intervene when the genocide in Rwanda took place, and watched helplessly as the men in Srebrenica met their fate, even though the UN was set up in 1945 in order to reinforce our promise of 'never again'."
"We should not leave the powerless to their fate."
"I hope that Europe wants to make a difference."
"I am, above all, addressing the Council, which is absent, and the Commissioner, whom I would like to urge to take action."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I speak on behalf of my colleague, Mr Morillon."
"I must begin by highlighting the entirely surreal nature of our meeting this evening."
"There are around ten of us Members present."
"Commissioner, thank you for being here."
"I know the reasons for the absence of Mr Michel, whom you are representing."
"However, the most notable absentee is the Council, and in the meantime, I am afraid to say, people continue to die in Darfur."
"I would remind you, as a numbers man, Mr Almunia, that fourteen or fifteen people die every hour in Darfur."
"It was therefore high time we worried about a situation that no one believes is simple."
"Yet, must we continue making fools of ourselves?"
"This resolution will be the fifth that we have adopted over many months on Darfur: we can see the extent to which they undermine the officials, not least the Sudanese officials received this evening in Paris."
"I believe that we could actually finally assume our responsibilities."
"I must alert you, Commissioner, to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this resolution."
"As my fellow Member, Mr Coveney, pointed out, paragraph 2 emphasises the need for a precise date to be set by the UN."
"However, paragraph 3, Commissioner, is an appeal launched at the European Union, with the aim of having it assume its responsibilities."
"Its assuming its responsibilities will surely mean something in the future."
"If not, one may wonder about the purpose of the European Union and of the values that we seek to uphold, faced with what is essentially an endless emergency humanitarian situation, something that no one denies."
"My colleagues have nominated me as permanent rapporteur for humanitarian action."
"But what should I report on?"
"The systematic withdrawal of all the NGOs, which are no longer allowed to work, the fourteen people who have been killed and the deaths day in, day out of people who have been abandoned and who, in addition to having been displaced, have lost all hope."
"Commissioner, please speak with the Commission on our behalf; we will take care of the Council, politically, because, if we listened to them, we would have to wait a month before discussing this issue."
"This message needs to be passed on: one day, the law, not to mention the duty to interfere, will be required, when it is clear that men and women are being abused to this extent."
"Mr President, I too should like to highlight the discrepancy between the seriousness of the issue being dealt with and this practically deserted Chamber, and that is without mentioning the absence of the Council; while the Commission is at least represented, our action in relation to this matter is certainly not, in any event, equal to the challenges."
"As I was saying, the Council is absent, but when one reads its conclusions of 12 February, that is to say, those written exactly two days ago, its absence does not change a great deal anyway."
"I shall read and quote what is written in these conclusions:"
"'The Council remains gravely concerned about the security situation in Darfur' - to say the least - 'and condemns continued ceasefire violations by all parties.'"
"(FR) That is the kind of particularly forceful sentence that the Council is capable of producing after months and months of resolutions, decisions and diplomatic meetings, when the situation is more disastrous now than it ever has been."
"We therefore clearly believe that a change of level is required and, indeed, that more pressure must be exerted with regard to this unacceptable situation."
"What about the punishments that were decided on for the Sudanese leaders, and for all these war criminals?"
"What is the European Union doing with regard to these punishments?"
"It seems to me, in any case, that the European Union has a number of options available to it to freeze financial resources so as to prevent all these people from moving freely about our territory."
"Ways of exerting pressure do exist."
"What are we doing with regard to United Nations Resolution 1706, which has the backing of the European Union?"
"What initiatives have been taken by the European Commission and the Council to put pressure on all those responsible for this situation?"
"What credibility do we have today to issue a multitude of texts that, at least on the part of the Council, and even of the Commission, merely restate our grave concerns regarding this situation?"
"Only a very short time ago, the Chinese President, Hu Jintao, visited several African countries and, more specifically, Sudan."
"What is the Union's position faced with this situation, with the new and emerging role of China's leaders? Faced, too, with the importance of access to raw materials, and to oil in particular?"
"Thus, when one sees the inertia, the powerlessness, of the European institutions on this issue, what conclusions must be drawn?"
"Does this mean that, if priority is to be given to accessing raw materials or oil, which in reality is gradually dwindling, and if it is to be given to the large markets represented by countries such as China, the values of human rights and the duty that we actually have to protect civilian populations need to be put on the back burner?"
"Is that what this means?"
"I believe that it would be absolutely tragic for the European Union to come to that."
"The fact is that these issues are being raised on a daily basis, and we constantly find ourselves incapable and powerless in the face of this tragic situation."
"It is therefore high time a formal sitting bringing together the Council, the Commission and Parliament was organised - and organised very soon - on this issue, in Brussels or Strasbourg, so that the necessary decisions can finally be taken."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can identify with this joint resolution about the international blot - and I should like to underline 'this international blot' - being Darfur, despite a few of the comments that have been made."
"I should like to single out a few elements if I may."
"In recital C, it is stated that the conflict in Darfur is increasingly destabilising the Central African region."
"Less than a week ago, an analysis was published in my home country, the Netherlands, about this very disruptive situation under the telling heading 'The black hole'."
"Indeed, there is a black hole at the heart of Africa, rudderless, violent and with a stream of refugees who are headed in all directions."
"One immediate risk is that the conflict in Darfur, which is racist in that nomads of Arab origin are driving out and killing African farmers, will move to Chad and take the notorious and murderous Janjaweed militia with it."
"Various paragraphs in the joint resolution urge the United Nations finally to face up to its responsibilities in Darfur."
"Whilst I can fully endorse this parliamentary cry for help, I have to confess at the same time that I am extremely sceptical as to whether this distress signal will actually be heard in the UN Headquarters in New York."
"Earlier this week, Jan Pronk, the former UN envoy to Sudan, gave a frank and honest interview to the Sudan Tribune."
"He asserted, verbatim, that he accused New York of leaving its own mission in the lurch and, instead, of pandering to the elite in power in Khartoum."
"It is awful - he said - if you send thousands of people to Sudan and then leave them to their own devices."
"What we should, in any case, be doing is to ensure that Mr Pronk's indictment does not fall on deaf ears, but reaches our governments, the European Council and the UN Security Council, and results in action."
"I also deem as completely appropriate the appeal of this House to the People's Republic of China to put its not insignificant political and economic weight into the balance in order to try to get the Sudanese leadership to actually enforce existing peace agreements on Khartoum."
"Only a constructive international stance such as this one is in keeping with Peking's adage of harmonious external relations."
"Moreover, that is also what we can expect of a strategic partner as a responsible member of the UN Security Council."
"After all, as rapporteur for EU/China relations, I constantly reminded my esteemed Chinese interlocutors of this elementary constructive international role."
"Finally, I would like to back the only amendment to the joint resolution - that tabled by Mrs Gomes - and back it all the way."
"Sanctions against this shameless Sudanese regime should definitely involve an oil embargo, as some sort of acid test to check whether the United Nations, given the long suffering of the people in Darfur, still abides by its own political principles."
"(DE) Mr President, the situation in Darfur remains shocking."
"The response of the international community has been wholly inadequate."
"The previous speakers have described the situation adequately: there is no improvement in sight for the people there."
"Some necessary resolutions have been passed, such as United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706, but their implementation ultimately fails on account of the Government in Khartoum, most of whose leaders are no doubt listed in the files of the International Criminal Court - which launched an investigation into crimes in Darfur as early as June 2005."
"We have a situation where the United Nations has to take action, in accordance with its responsibility for protecting human beings, since the Government of Sudan has not been protecting the people of Darfur against war crimes and crimes against humanity, nor has it lent them any assistance."
"For this reason, Parliament calls on the United Nations to set a date for the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force pursuant to Article 7 of the Charter of the United Nations, even if this has not been approved by the Khartoum regime."
"We call on the Council and the Commission to do everything in their power to put an end to this sustained humanitarian disaster."
"Concrete action can be launched for the short term without great expense."
"The EU should impose personal sanctions on representatives of the regime unilaterally rather than waiting for the rest of the international community."
"I have always been in favour of this as a means of preventing family members going on shopping trips to Europe."
"The Darfur regime has thus far been ignoring the no-fly zone imposed by Security Council Resolution 1591, and is continuing to bomb villages in Darfur."
"We call for the use of capabilities available in the region to enforce this no-fly zone."
"After all, we know which Member States have aircraft based in the region - not to say the immediate vicinity."
"Why are these not being used in the services of the UN?"
"The EU must agree to this, at least."
"We should also give those in power in Khartoum to understand that they should not rely overly on forces outside Africa."
"The Sudanese Government is skating on very thin ice, and should not exhaust African solidarity."
"Two warning shots have already been fired."
"The ACP Summit in Khartoum was the summit attended by the fewest Heads of State or Government - a clear sign of displeasure."
"The fact that the AU Summit opted for President Kufuor instead of the Sudanese President was a further clear indication of disapproval."
"Mr President, as others have said, as General al-Bashir continues to prevaricate on the deployment of an AU-UN hybrid force in Darfur, we see the humanitarian crisis getting worse."
"We see the number of internally displaced people increasing. The ceasefire has collapsed."
"The international community has and is continuing to fail to fulfil its responsibility to protect innocent civilians in Darfur."
"This means that the European Union must act urgently to impose its own targeted and phased smart sanctions."
"We do not have to wait for the UN Security Council to agree on essential new measures - as others have suggested - on an arms embargo covering all of Sudan, on asset-freezing of the wealthy people of Sudan, on travel bans and on consideration of an oil embargo."
"Clearly, revenue flows to the south would need to be protected if we impose an oil embargo, and consideration would perhaps need to be given to compensating the south Sudanese for lost oil revenue."
"But the least we can do is to put a bar on investments, on technical equipment and on expertise."
"I also believe that there should be serious consideration of sports sanctions against Sudan, especially consideration of excluding Sudan from the 2010 World Cup."
"This means that Europe has to put pressure on FIFA."
"The EU position, frankly, is weak and untenable."
"There is too much emphasis on carrots and not enough on sticks."
"The German Presidency must take a lead and insist on a unified position from Member States."
"Commissioner, you have described the position, and in the Council we hear the fine words, but nothing happens."
"The question is: how does Europe put pressure on Khartoum?"
"There must be an urgent and detailed investigation of the personal finances of wealthy individuals in Sudan."
"We have to prepare the arguments against those who claim that this would push Sudan closer towards Chinese business interests."
"The truth is, frankly, that nothing is currently influencing Sudan."
"It is virtually impossible to influence them, and so, if we remain supine, then we maintain the position where they can be as brutal as they like and Europe will continue to do nothing."
"Millions of people in Darfur are paying for European broken promises and totally worthless commitments."
"Khartoum knows that Europe is all bark and no bite and that is why today we are calling for new, strong, economic, legal and military measures."
"Public condemnation is not enough."
"We want solutions which reflect the tragedy."
"Europe is shamefully weak and I have to say finally that if Darfur was, for example, Lebanon, then real sanctions would be getting a lot more discussion time in the Council, and President Barroso in the Commission and you, Commissioner, would put pressure on the Council to do more."
"Mr President, the humanitarian crisis in Darfur is on a scale which is difficult to comprehend."
"Two and a half million people have had to flee their homes."
"That is the equivalent of the entire population of north-east England."
"The death toll among these displaced people is high and it would be higher by far if it were not for the humanitarian efforts on the ground."
"But even humanitarian workers cannot operate on a battlefield and unless there is a lessening of hostilities in Darfur it can be expected that more of them will be evacuated."
"The entire fragile, overstretched humanitarian effort in Darfur could very easily collapse, precipitating hunger and disease in the camps and a rocketing death toll."
"That is why the stabilising influence of an international peace force is so urgently required."
"It is also necessary in order to provide calmer conditions in which a political process can get under way, involving all parties and including local low-key intercommunity dialogue as well as high-level, high-profile political negotiation."
"(PT) It is certainly significant and worrying that the German Presidency is not here today to represent the Council."
"This says a great deal about levels of genuine interest and commitment in the new relationship with Africa and in working for development in Africa."
"Three years ago, I was in Darfur with other MEPs who have spoken or who are about to speak. Since then, the situation has worsened, as Mr Almunia said."
"The Al-Bashir Government is toying with the international community, with the Security Council, with the European Union and with the African Union, and the EU makes fine statements and does nothing."
"The time has come for the EU to take action and to exercise its responsibility to protect people."
"The time has come to impose a no-fly-zone from Chad."
"The EU can do this, alongside African countries with which it enjoys good relations, and can have an effect on the ground."
"The time has come, among other things, to impose smart, phased sanctions, travel bans, visa restrictions, and the freezing of assets in banks and elsewhere, and to stop treating Omar Al-Bashir and the members of his government as responsible, respectable leaders."
"The time has come to impose an effective arms embargo."
"The time has come to impose other kinds of trade embargo and in particular an oil embargo and on this issue, Mr President, the EU must speak frankly with China, because China as we know is very much responsible for the Al-Bashir Government's attitude."
"It is a pity that Europe waits for the United States, as Mr Almunia suggested, albeit in a roundabout way, because the EU should take action independently on this issue."
"Let us take a look at what is happening not just in Darfur but throughout Sudan and the Horn of Africa."
"The EU cannot be dependent on the worldview and disastrous policies of the US in respect of the Horn of Africa, as we have seen in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia."
"The time has come for the EU to take action and I align myself with those MEPs who are calling on the Council and the President of the Commission to ensure that the EU does not wait any longer, and exerts the influence it actually has in Khartoum and in Africa to change the situation and to protect the people dying in Darfur."
"Otherwise, three years hence I along with other MEPs will be joining Mr Almunia or some other Commissioner in bemoaning the fact that the situation has become worse and worse."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission shares the main concerns that you have expressed in this debate tonight."
"We find the initiative of this debate particularly useful, given the situation and in particular given the latest developments in the region."
"In our view, even with this extremely difficult situation, a negotiated way out of the crisis in Darfur is the most desirable alternative and the option most likely to be successful."
"That being said, the Council already stated last Monday that it is ready to consider further measures, notably in the UN framework."
"A lasting peace is Darfur can only be political and will require all parties to support the Darfur Peace Agreement and renounce the military option."
"The Commission remains strongly committed to alleviating the plight of the three million civilian people affected by this terrible crisis."
"As you all know, the Commission, and in particular my colleague Louis Michel - who cannot be here today because he is in Washington, discussing, among other things, this particular issue - is following the situation very closely and the Commission will not hesitate to call on all parties to respect human rights and international law as well as to remove all obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian aid."
"To wind up the debate, I have received six motions for resolutionspursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) We are proud that the very fact that, as Europeans, we are compelled to condemn manifest evil in whichever part of our world it may affect human beings."
"What is happening in Darfur is a manifest evil."
"Accordingly, we are bound to express our opposition to those who perpetrate such evils."
"Is it enough for us to simply express views that stem from a moral imperative and then rest in the knowledge of a job well done?"
"Obviously not."
"We cannot rest as long as people continue to suffer."
"We can only rest when we have put a stop to the evil."
"Therefore, we are not entitled to rest simply because we have right on our side, but only when effective action has been taken."
"We shall only be able to rest and be content when our words and actions have put a stop to the activities of those who kill, supply weapons and ideology, as well as those who permit, incite and inflict cruelty."
"We will only be able to walk with our heads held high when our vision of a moral order becomes reality."
"A person who did not commit a sin simply because he or she was not tempted to do so cannot be accused of sinning."
"By the same token, one cannot praise a person who could have taken action to stem evil, but who was content to simply point it out."
"We do not lack information about Darfur."
"We do not lack experience or an ethical and political assessment of events."
"What we are lack is effectiveness and, therefore, that is what we should focus on."
"in writing. - (FR) Ever since the hostilities were launched in February 2003, Darfur, one of the poorest regions in Sudan, has been the scene of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis."
"There have been four years of conflict and suffering for the people of Darfur, and four resolutions by our Parliament to show our indignation, but the situation remains extremely worrying."
"Today, our Parliament is reiterating its concerns within the context of a joint resolution on Darfur and is urging the United Nations, the Member States, the Council and the Commission to assume their responsibilities and to clearly set a date for the deployment of a peacekeeping force, under UN control, with the aim of immediately making the humanitarian corridors more secure and of thus easing the immense distress faced by the people of Darfur."
"I welcome this new initiative, but faced with the urgency of the situation, Europe can no longer just reiterate old requests."
"Our responsibility and our credibility require us to provide a satisfactory solution to the suffering of millions of human victims whom Europe can no longer merely observe, and to adopt a resolution that finally matches our indignation."
"Darfur has been a running sore for far too long."
"A situation partly driven by climate change - what does that bode for the future - whereby desertification has driven pastoralists into direct conflict with settled farming communities and then exploited by a heartless Government in Sudan has gone on for far too long."
"Hundreds of thousands are living in misery and threatened with worse."
"I have been critical of China's reluctance to support UN action, it was claimed because of its oil interests in southern Sudan."
"But now President Hu Jintao's direct intervention appears to have persuaded Sudan's President to agree a UN peacekeeping operation manned by troops from AU countries."
"Whether Sudan's Government can be trusted is not clear."
"But now, if China is betrayed, Sudan will no longer be able to rely on their reluctance to act in the UN Secretary Council."
"This may be good news for refugees in Darfur and neighbouring countries."
"Illegal fishing (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Aubert, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the implementation of the EU action plan against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, illegal fishing is a trend that is developing extensively today and seriously harming the activities of European fisheries, local fishing communities and fisheries in developing countries, not least in those with which the European Community has concluded fishing agreements."
"It is also an activity that, I am afraid to say, is extremely lucrative."
"I would cite the example of bluefin tuna, particularly in the Mediterranean, specimens of which are sold at absolutely astronomical prices."
"We therefore find ourselves in a vicious circle, which leads to the gradual, though accelerated, depletion of fishery resources."
"Legal fisheries - those that comply with the regulations - are, for their part, very heavily penalised by these illegal activities, which can, in fact, be defined in fairly broad terms."
"We are talking about illegal, unregulated, undeclared fishing."
"That therefore relates to many activities: pirate fishing, the use of unauthorised fishing gear, the catching of unauthorised species, unlicensed fishing and the policy of transferring cargo at sea from one boat to another."
"The scope of the illegal activities is extremely broad."
"What, then, is the purpose of this own-initiative report?"
"In 2002, the FAO launched an international action plan against illegal fishing, which was subsequently replaced by a European Union action plan, which was adopted by the Council in 2002."
"The plan was unfortunately implemented in a variety of ways, at different levels, by the Member States."
"At this very moment, the European Commission is working on evaluating the Member States' action plans on the fight against illegal fishing ahead of the meeting of the FAO - the FAO's Committee on Fisheries - which will be held in the first week of March, in Rome, and which will be an opportunity to re-launch the international action plan against illegal fishing."
"The European Union has a huge responsibility in this area."
"Why?"
"Firstly, because the European Union is ranked third in the world in terms of fishing activities, after China and Peru."
"It has one of the world's largest fleets."
"Moreover, it largely resorts to using flags of convenience, which cause a huge number of problems, not only for fishing, but also for maritime transport."
"Finally, the EU is also one of the world's largest markets in fish."
"The responsibilities are therefore many."
"The Commission's response to us is that this whole business is complex, many parties come into play, nothing can be done by working alone, it is expensive, one cannot ask some Member States to comply with a number of rules and not ask the others to do the same, and so on. The pretexts and excuses for the lacklustre results are legion and, sadly, there have not been enough initiatives to fight effectively against this activity of illegal fishing which, once again, has developed at an extremely serious rate over the last few years."
"The responsibilities are as much those of the port States, as they are called, as they are of the flag States or the States in which fishery products are marketed."
"There are in fact many levels: that of the regional fisheries organisations, that of the Member States, the European level; it is at all these levels that action must be taken, across the board, with the involvement of the Directorate-General for Fisheries and the Directorate-General for the Environment, the Directorate-General for Development and the Directorate-General for Trade."
"Hard work is therefore what is required here, but only action on the part of all these administrations and these political officials will prove truly effective."
"What are the key measures in my report, which, I might add, has been unanimously adopted within the Committee on Fisheries, showing that this is indeed a concern shared by all of our Member States?"
"There is the traceability of fishery products and the introduction of blacklists, that is to say, of lists of boats that are not authorised to fish or that have already been punished for illegal fishing activities."
"We should condemn today the lack of coordination and cooperation between the various sources of information regarding these boats, which are authorised or unauthorised to fish."
"Among the important measures, I should also mention those that consist in preventing illegal fishing products from being landed and marketed on the European market, and then, finally, the actions to be carried out in the field of European and international law."
"There are, in fact, legal vacuums today that prevent the crews of vessels carrying out illegal fishing activities from being challenged and punished."
"To conclude, it is absolutely vital that we have a more integrated European policy, in terms both of control and monitoring and of penalties."
"It is from this global perspective that the report outlines a number of initiatives and proposes a number of measures that we are discussing here, with a view to the FAO meeting, in March, within the context of which it is crucial for us to appear far more proactive and far more dynamic."
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Aubert and all of the members of the Committee on Fisheries for their involvement in this truly exhaustive report on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing."
"This initiative from Parliament comes at a time when the Commission is committed to a public consultation on the review and strengthening of the current European Community policy on tackling this kind of fishing."
"I am particularly pleased to note Parliament's commitment on an issue which is of crucial importance to achieving the sustainable management of fisheries resources inside and outside of Community waters."
"First of all, I am pleased that the report stresses that the fight against illegal fishing must begin in our waters and also involve our vessels."
"Community waters are regulated, but that does not mean that illegal practices do not take place within them."
"The report also acknowledges another extremely important aspect, namely how to prevent fisheries products from third countries that have been caught illegally from entering the Community."
"As the main market and importer of fisheries products from all parts of the world, the Community has a special responsibility in terms of guaranteeing that products that end up on the tables of European consumers do not originate from illegal activities."
"This means that a new approach must be taken with a view to properly controlling the legality of fisheries products imported into Community territory."
"Another aspect that must be stressed is the need, indicated in the report, to create more synergies in order to improve the supervision, control and monitoring of fisheries activities."
"Illegal operators usually employ clandestine and international methods in order to disguise their activities."
"The success of investigation into these activities depends on cooperation amongst the different services involved in maritime monitoring at international level and also at Community level."
"I cannot comment on all of the points of the report here, but I would like to stress, for example, the call for greater consistency in the sanctions imposed by the Member States for serious violations of fisheries laws, and the need to resolve the main problems caused by public fishing flags. These points demonstrate that Parliament and the Commission are on the same wavelength in terms of priorities for future actions."
"The Commission has not been inactive over recent years."
"The European Community has made considerable progress since the adoption in 2002 of its action plan against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing."
"This progress can essentially be seen in the Community's activities, at international level, aimed at promoting measures to combat illegal fishing in all of the bodies competent in the field of fisheries and maritime law."
"Nevertheless, the most significant progress in the fight against illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing has related to the regional fisheries organisations, the majority of which, thanks to the Community's efforts, have now adopted a wide range of measures against illegal fishing."
"The Community has also improved the policy of assistance for coastal developing countries, which are the main victims of the kind of fishing we are debating today."
"Strengthening those countries' capacity to adequately control the fisheries activities in their waters has been funded from the European Union's budget, thanks to an association agreement in the field of fisheries, both at national level and at regional level, on the model of the recently agreed regional plan for fisheries surveillance in the South-West Indian Ocean."
"At Community level, the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2002 also promoted the policy to combat illegal fishing through the adoption of provisions in the field of controlling compliance with Community rules and the creation of the Fisheries Control Agency."
"However, despite the significant progress made in the fight against illegal fishing, it has still not been eradicated by any means, and it is still one of the most serious global threats to the sustainable management of fisheries resources and marine biodiversity."
"Almost five years after the adoption of the 2002 action plan, therefore, the Commission believes that the time has come to draw up a new strategy to tackle this kind of fishing."
"Within this context, the Commission has decided that this year illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing will be one of the main priorities of the common fisheries policy and of maritime policy."
"The Commission will draw up proposals in this regard and present them to the Member States and to this Parliament during the second half of this year."
"The report that we are debating today is a particularly timely contribution to the work on which the Commission will base its proposals."
"Ladies and gentlemen, over recent years illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has been the subject of numerous debates and discussions and the time has now come for us to act at European level."
"The report by Mrs Aubert and the Committee on Fisheries represents an extremely significant and encouraging step in that direction."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Aubert for her report, which reminds us of the problem of piracy at sea and the poor record in terms of what has been done to combat it."
"I would also like to thank her for supporting the amendments that I believe have clarified her report, establishing the boundaries between unrecorded and unregulated illegal fishing and violations of the common agricultural policy in Community waters. This is an important aspect because, although we need to put an end to both, completely different weapons are required for each."
"One of the most important weapons is action by regional fisheries organisations, which are perhaps currently the only possible defence against illegal actions at sea in a battle which is, by definition, international and multilateral, and whose role has also been re-assessed as a result of the amendments presented."
"At a time of such concern about the sustainability of the marine environment and when our own fishermen are gradually being denied access to resources, it is extremely worrying that we are even having to witness certain Member States taking steps backwards, including one that I know well."
"And it is depressing that, last Tuesday, the Director for External Policies of the Directorate-General for Fisheries should have had to admit that the European Union had failed to slow down illegal fisheries."
"And all at a time like this."
"It was in Galicia last week that the fishing authorities of eighteen Member States began to debate the package of measures to combat illegal fishing, which will apparently not be presented to us before the middle of the year, according to the Commissioner."
"With regard to this issue, the ball is more than ever in the Council's court, because, without genuine political will on the part of the Member States, without their firm commitment to harmonising actions, making them obligatory and making them a priority, things will carry on the same next year and the year after."
"I hope that that does not happen and that we will have an effective policy soon."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, and allow me to protest once again about the fact that a fisheries debate is taking place at night and that even a new report being newly included on the agenda is being put before it."
"I would like to make a serious protest on behalf of my group and on my own behalf about the way fisheries is treated in this Parliament."
"Your protest will be recorded."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Aubert on this report and on the way in which she has dealt with the numerous amendments that we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament tabled."
"The FAO has calculated that up to 30% of fish landed comes from illegal fishing. The EU has signed up to the FAO's international action plan and in 2003 the Commission tabled proposals to transpose this action plan into the European acquis."
"The Committee on Fisheries drew up this own-initiative report in preparation for the international forum on illegal fishing set to take place in Rome at the beginning of March, and in order that the Commission take account, in its new action plan, of Parliament's opinion."
"Numerous amendments tabled by my group will be included and I believe that thanks to those amendments, we have achieved a better definition of illegal fishing. Furthermore, we have included issues such as increased monitoring and the need for greater cooperation at international level."
"Furthermore, although this is not so much a question of implementing tighter measures but rather of improving the implementation of existing measures, there is certainly a need for an effective control and inspection system within a common legal framework across the EU and if possible under the auspices of the Community Fisheries Control Agency based in Vigo."
"Our amendments call for entry to European ports to be barred to vessels involved in illegal fishing, for Member States not to register such vessels, for Member States to discourage their nationals from flying flags of convenience, and for importers, transporters and other sectors concerned not to tranship or deal with fish caught by those vessels."
"We also call for cooperation between the Member States to step up control of vessels."
"We are aware that it is difficult to differentiate between legal and illegal catches, in particular when what is landed is not fresh fish but frozen or processed and where there are commercial networks with third countries and the fish has been processed before it reaches the European market."
"Efforts are therefore required to identify the origin of fish, because millions of people around the world depend on fisheries resources and we must guarantee the availability of those resources for future generations."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President."
"I want to begin by complimenting Marie-HÃ©lÃ¨ne Aubert on the quality of her report."
"Her explanatory statement contains an excellent analysis of the problem and of the extent of progress made in relation to the EU Action Plan of 2002."
"It makes ten very clear recommendations for a new Action Plan to start in 2007."
"Five of these recommendations involve internal measures and five involve cooperation with other countries, both directly and through the medium of regional fisheries management organisations."
"Central to the issue of combating IUU fishing are improvements in traceability, both of vessels and of the fish that they catch or transport."
"This includes, amongst other things, insisting on the use of FAO identification standards for EU vessels and those entering EU ports, and on the development of proper catch documentation schemes."
"But it also means better exchange of information between the parties concerned, so that blacklists of both fishing and fish transport vessels can be disseminated and the possibility of converting to a white list through reflagging can be avoided."
"The establishment of blacklists is, however, only effective if there are serious consequences for the vessels concerned."
"That is why we urge the Commission to take very seriously the recommendation in paragraph 18 of the resolution that consideration be given to extending the import controls relating to health and hygiene to cover the products of IUU fishing as well."
"For this reason, the revival of the inter-services consultation group is particularly welcome."
"Of course, there are many other steps that could be taken, which is why we are asking for the fight against illegal fishing to be one of the priorities of the annual work programme of the Community Fisheries Control Agency."
"In this context too, we must be sure that our own house is fully in order, which is why we repeat Parliament's previous requests for common minimum penalties for serious infringements to be made applicable across all the Member States."
"Equal treatment is a major factor in encouraging compliance."
"The importance of assisting developing countries to monitor fishing activities in their own waters must also be stressed."
"There is an additional responsibility in this regard where we have concluded fisheries partnership agreements with them."
"The inclusion of IUU fishing in the Commission's work programme for this year is very welcome, but we need a clear timetable in this regard."
"It is good to hear that the Commission will be presenting something to Parliament in the second half of the year, but we hope that it will be sooner rather than later, and comprehensive in its coverage."
"Madam President, I too would like to thank Mrs Aubert and to commend her on her outstanding report, which I endorse."
"Not only does illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing endanger biodiversity and the environment, leading to costs that in many cases may be impossible to recoup completely, but it also represents - as previous speakers have mentioned - a significant cost for many societies that currently live from fishing and that hope future generations can do likewise."
"In this regard, I feel that the EU has a twofold responsibility."
"First and foremost, it must set an example to the world and demonstrate by deed and in particular by willingness, that the fight against illegal fishing is one of its priorities."
"Secondly, it must take the lead on the world stage in the fight against illegal fishing, which involves using existing EU mechanisms - be it via fishing agreements or via cooperation with third countries - and always to include some clauses leading to the prioritisation of this issue."
"At the same time, however, given that one of the key problems in detecting and combating illegal fishing is - as previous speakers have also mentioned - the issues of traceability and of fisheries control is vital inasmuch as it is often impossible to know whether illegal fishing has taken place. Mechanisms must therefore be established to enhance traceability."
"To this end, I also wish to say that in December, this Chamber adopted a resolution on eco-labelling."
"Many of the proposals in this resolution would help the fight against illegal fishing by means of much-needed traceability mechanisms."
"I too welcome the report's call for the Commission to present its eco-labelling proposal by June."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) I too would like to congratulate Mrs Aubert on her report."
"Large-scale illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has significantly contributed to the difficulties with which the fisheries sector has to contend. Large-scale illegal fishing damages marine ecosystems, increases the cost of fishing, and reduces the incomes of people who fish legally and who comply with the rules on preserving fisheries resources."
"Large-scale illegal fishing, as the report says, undermines the incomes of communities who depend on fishing in different countries, and those least equipped to monitor their exclusive economic zones are the hardest hit."
"Large-scale illegal fishing also contributes to the deterioration of on-board working conditions and hygiene, and undermines the labour rights of crews."
"Accordingly, we feel that illegal fishing, which generates significant illicit profits for large-scale fleets working for the large economic and financial groups involved in fishing and even for organised crime networks, should not be confused with infringements of the common fisheries policy by parts of the small-scale traditional fleet, often committed because of the economic crisis that they face."
"It is worrying that, despite the 2002 Food and Agriculture Organisation plan, which was rapidly transposed into the Community acquis and then implemented, large-scale illegal fishing continues to increase owing to loopholes or imprecision in the existing rules."
"The fight against large-scale illegal fishing is hampered by the use of flags of convenience, by the lack of monitoring at sea, by transhipping on the high seas, by the lack of control at ports and by the lack of cooperation and coordination between the relevant authorities."
"Given that illegal fishing has its biggest impact on those parts of the fleet operating on the high seas and on the continental shelf, especially in the least developed countries, cooperation among the Member States and among international fishing organisations is vital if this kind of fishing is to be combated."
"To this end the necessary resources must be obtained, including financial resources for implementing the measures needed, such as the effective monitoring of fishing activities."
"The strengthening of deterrents should be accompanied by enhanced traceability of fisheries products, as has been highlighted by previous speakers, with eco-labelling also worth mentioning in this regard."
"Equally important, as the report states, is to intensify port state control of landings and transhipments from third country vessels."
"We believe that the existing measures already cover the main issues and that what they lack is more rigorous and fairer implementation and greater international-level coordination."
"This is not, therefore, simply a matter of creating more measures and more restrictive measures for the fisheries sector, especially if their impact or their unilateral nature has the perverse effect of benefiting the vessels operating illegally to an even greater extent."
"Third country vessels operating in the exclusive economic zones of the Member States must be subject to the rules of the common fisheries policy and to existing national requirements."
"Naturally, it is always possible to improve the rules in force and to plug any gaps."
"In this regard, we feel that this report, which in spite of one or two reservations we generally support, makes a valuable contribution to the issue."
"We feel, however, that it is, at the very least, premature to include combating illegal fishing in the framework of a future maritime policy for the Union, which we have only just begun to debate as part of the Green Paper put forward by the Commission."
"We accept the idea of greater international and EU-level cooperation and coordination, but we must avoid situations that may lead to centralisation and must safeguard the Member States' exclusive monitoring powers, as it is the Member States that best know each of their exclusive economic zones."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need to protect all operators who carry out their activities within the context of sound fisheries management based on best practice and safeguarding the marine environment."
"It is vitally important to clamp down on illegal fishing through surveillance and control measures, accompanied by sanctions for serious violations of Community legislation."
"To combat illegal fishing, however, we cannot confine ourselves to repressive actions, but we must also promote strong preventive action through structural measures."
"To this end, the report on which we are going to vote - for which I thank Mrs Aubert - very effectively identifies a number of strategic actions, from the promotion of commercial regulation measures that will make it possible to identify the origin of fish caught, to the proposal on eco-labelling, which would keep illegally caught fish off the European market, and to the study on tariffs and rules of origin."
"These measures are essential to reduce, if not eliminate, illegal fishing by Community fishing boats in Community waters and to prevent the landing and marketing of fish caught illegally outside EU waters."
"Equally significant is the call for a study on compliance with Community labour and health and safety legislation, on respect for the social rights of workers and on their living and working conditions on board."
"Improving full traceability of fish all along the chain of custody, from net to plate, preventing the depletion of fish stocks and degradation of the environment, and enhancing the quality of life and work for the communities that depend on fishing for their livelihoods are forms of prevention and dissuasion that will make it possible to curb illegal fishing by structural means and make the Community fisheries sector the best in the world."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Morillon, of course we must all congratulate our rapporteur on her outstanding report."
"We must also begin by noting that the situation as it stands is absolutely unacceptable."
"It is unacceptable that the amount of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing of bluefin tuna, which is the species that has been the subject of most analysis in this connection, is 50% greater than the amount fished legally."
"This has led to the total depletion of stocks, to the collapse of the value at which fish is sold and in turn to the ruin of the fishermen."
"This is a situation that the Community cannot continue to tolerate."
"Of all the measures put forward here as a means of addressing the problem, I should like to highlight traceability as a vital prerequisite to success."
"This is the measure that we must ensure is adopted in the very short term and if it is tightly enforced I am sure that we will see a very different situation soon."
"Madam President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for this report, which continues the efforts of this Parliament to address the problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing."
"The European Union's 2002 Action Plan to deal with illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing includes four actions to be implemented at Community level."
"One of these is to define the responsibility of Member States to prevent their nationals from engaging in IUU fishing."
"Indeed, the related Council Regulation of 2002 requires Member States to take action against nationals that infringe the common fisheries policy."
"We seem to be very efficient in tracking and taking action against our own fishermen for any transgression of European law, while we seem at the same time to have been rather less efficient at dealing with the much bigger problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing."
"The problem of overfishing and illegal fishing is international."
"It goes beyond the European Union waters, and yet the fishermen that I represent can with some justice complain that the Commission sometimes cannot see beyond our own waters."
"There is clearly a lot still to be achieved to deal with this problem and I welcome the practical proposals such as the suggestion that vessels bringing fish into the European Union should be subject to the same documentation delivery requirement as vessels operating within the European Union."
"Likewise I welcome the suggestion that the Commission should engage with developing countries to give them assistance in dealing with IUU fishing."
"I understand that one of the vehicles for achieving this is through the various bilateral fisheries agreements with developing countries."
"However, I would like to be sure that this represents a joined-up approach to the problem and that it is not merely ad hoc."
"I note that some countries have not been cooperative."
"Surely if we are making bilateral fisheries agreements with a country, we can force a higher degree of cooperation from them."
"Otherwise cynics might suggest that we are more interested in getting the fish than stopping illegal fishing."
"Madam President, many of our debates regarding fisheries have been centred around sustainability and the importance of finding the right equilibrium between the protection of the marine environment, the protection of fish stock and the viability of the activity."
"Regulations have been set up and fishermen are obliged to abide by these regulations so that an optimum standard is achieved, a standard that would be beneficial to everyone."
"These regulations have been based on specific statistics gathered from our seas and standards have been set on this information."
"However, I feel that, unless we tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing with an iron fist, we would be doing a disservice to honest fishermen and restricting their activity to the benefit of others acting illegally."
"The line between legal and illicit fishing is sometimes very fine and we need to have a clear-cut definition in this regard in order to avoid misunderstanding."
"We need an effective control system and a management programme that will be more coherent and specific so as to apply the existing regulations with more accuracy."
"We must also try to negotiate with our neighbouring states in order to adopt the same policies so that we would have a one-sea, one-policy system, which undoubtedly would be beneficial to all."
"In order to do this, we must be willing to share our technology with these countries and encourage new partnership agreements."
"Further to this, cooperation between us, the Member States, has to be strengthened."
"Proof of the legal origin of fish catches should be compulsory before any content is offloaded in the EU."
"This should include documents that show that fish have been caught in accordance with RFMO rules."
"This will be a very important stepping stone in ensuring that our fishermen get the right dues, and that, furthermore, our seas are protected from overfishing."
"When stocks were plentiful, we would often turn a blind eye to unregulated activity."
"Now, I think, is the time to act before it is too late."
"No regulation and no law will ever be effective or have any meaning if overfishing renders our seas barren."
"(SV) Madam President, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I am responsible for the subject of cod fishing in the Baltic Sea."
"In my work on this matter, I have been able to observe that, despite reduced fishing quotas, parts of the cod stock are close to the biologically critical limit."
"The threats to cod are many, but, despite everything, the greatest threat is illegal fishing."
"As a basis for my report, I tried to get hold of the Commission's assessment of the extent of illegal fishing around the Baltic."
"The information was kept secret, however, and it took me months to extract it."
"Yesterday, I got hold of the report, however, and I now suddenly understand what all the secretiveness was about."
"Illegal fishing in the Baltic is worse than we had all imagined."
"I can only regret that Sweden is among the worst culprits."
"The Commission states, however, that Poland is the worst culprit of all."
"When the inspectors checked up on fishing in Poland, the actual figures were 48% larger than the catches reported."
"This means, then, that something approaching a third of Polish fishing proves to be illegal."
"The second worst culprit was Sweden."
"In Sweden, the actual figures found when the checks were carried out were as much as 21% larger than the catches reported. That is quite incomprehensible, because Swedish fishermen do not even fulfil their quotas."
"The conclusion that I draw from the report I read is that we must find a new strategy."
"We cannot pin our hopes on endless negotiations about reductions in fishing quotas."
"The environmental movement should get around to withdrawing its demands for an end to fishing."
"All those of us who would safeguard fishing in seas such as the Baltic should instead unite in the fight to stop illegal fishing."
"I should therefore like to demand four things from the Commission."
"Firstly, instead of protecting the culprits and keeping their identities secret, you should expose them by publishing the names of those countries that do not put an end to illegal fishing."
"Secondly, you should ensure that electronic logbooks are required without delay for all fishing boats in the Baltic, irrespective of their size."
"Thirdly, you should take Poland to court for breaching the fishing regulations; and fourthly you should immediately set up an inquiry into the possibility of introducing individual transferable fishing quotas that give individual professional fishermen an interest of their own in protecting fish stocks."
"I would therefore ask today, in this House, if the Commission is prepared to do these things."
"(EL) Madam President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Aubert, on her report on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing."
"The question we are debating here today is of particular interest if account is taken of the repercussions which it has both on the marine environment and on legal fishing."
"Illegal fishing is one of the most fundamental reasons for the collapse of many fish stocks."
"In reality it undermines all our efforts to exploit fishery resources rationally and to protect the marine environment."
"Apart from the environmental impact, it also has adverse economic repercussions because it distorts competition between fishermen and affects the viability of those acting in accordance with the legislation enacted."
"However, I shall also examine this issue from the point of view of the human factor: often illegal fishing has repercussions on the safety of crews, given that they only have minimal guarantees in respect of the terms of employment and safety of human life at sea."
"Illegal fishing means illegal and uncontrolled employment."
"As you know, this is not a new phenomenon."
"However, the increased demand for fisheries products, in conjunction with a reduction in available resources has caused a burgeoning of this phenomenon, especially by vessels sailing under flags of convenience."
"The report by Mrs Aubert covers the most important aspects of the problem which need to be examined, such as:"
"firstly, the responsibilities of the state under whose flag the vessel is sailing;"
"secondly, the responsibilities of the state in which the fish are landed;"
"thirdly, the responsibilities of the productive classes involved in transporting and marketing fisheries products until they reach the consumer."
"I believe that more measures need to be taken to control and stamp out illegal fishing, both at European level and at the level of regional fisheries organisations."
"We must act."
"We must protect the environment, legal fishermen, consumers and the legal order."
"We need to be decisive and strict."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon tomorrow."
"Free movement of Roma within the EU borders (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the free movement of Roma within the EU borders."
"Member of the Commission. (ES) Two weeks ago saw the start of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All."
"Equal opportunities and the right to live without discrimination are among the key values on which the EU is based."
"The Commission is well aware of the fact that the Roma are among the groups most at risk of discrimination and of being excluded from the labour market, from society, from involvement in drawing up policy and from cultural life."
"Consequently, the Commission has undertaken to use all the instruments at its disposal to address the issue of the exclusion of the Roma minority."
"I should like to mention two of these: firstly, the implementation of the 2000 Directive, which provides protection against discrimination on racial and ethnic grounds."
"The Commission wishes to ensure that this Directive be incorporated into the legislation and to be implemented properly in all Member States."
"Secondly, I wish to mention the use of financial instruments, specifically the Structural Funds and, most importantly, the European Social Fund."
"The Commission has asked the Member States to incorporate the objective of including the Roma community when it draws up its operational plans for the financial perspective 2007-2013."
"Major effort is required to increase awareness among the Roma and among the population as a whole of the right to live without discrimination and to enjoy the benefits of diversity."
"In this regard, the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and the ongoing information campaign entitled 'For Diversity, Against Discrimination' are, in our view, extremely useful instruments."
"The Commission welcomes the achievements made so far during the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015 in which nine governments from Central and Eastern Europe and the Western Balkans, including five EU Member States, are currently taking part."
"For the first time, the national governments of these countries made a commitment to learn from each other and to exchange strategies on how to improve life for the Roma minority in areas such as employment, education, housing and healthcare."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that all of this is taking place in close cooperation with the Roma community."
"We also need policies geared toward the future."
"The high level group for the social and labour market integration of ethnic minorities set up by the Commission is paying special attention to issues relating to the Roma community."
"The group will publish its recommendations at the end of the year, which we are sure will provide extremely valuable information for future European policy on the inclusion of ethnic minorities, including the Roma."
"Lastly, Madam President, I should like to point out that the Commissioners' Group on Fundamental Rights will deal with all of these issues in their meeting scheduled for July this year."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) We know that following enlargement in 2004, many Roma tried to come to Europe - Western Europe."
"We also know that the actual figures were not very high, but they did call attention to the terrible and hopeless situation in which the Roma find themselves."
"We knew that the Roma were not desirable guests in Europe."
"Unsure already how to deal with Roma migration, most host countries responded by tightening their procedures for requesting asylum, which compelled many Roma to return to their home countries."
"Since they had sold all their possessions, they returned to much worse circumstances than those they had left behind."
"We also know that because of the exaggerated, hysterical and untrue statements of the media, the situation gave rise to fundamental fears in Western European countries."
"The situation even spurred many countries to try to prevent further enlargement."
"We now also know that this atypical tendency to migration among European Roma is in fact caused by the segregation in schools, the enormous unemployment rate, very strong prejudice, and limited access to health care services which they suffer in their home countries."
"We also know that the Roma would like to live and thrive in their home countries."
"In spite of the enormous sums of PHARE money, the ghettoisation, segregation, exclusion and anti-Roma feeling has continued to grow since enlargement, and in Western Europe as well."
"The European Union has a great responsibility and interest in promoting the integration of the Roma."
"Beyond ensuring the financial framework, the task of the European Commission must include promotion and monitoring as well."
"Every instrument for influencing Member States must be used, and a European strategy needs to be developed."
"We would like to see a Green Paper, and sanctions against countries that do not follow the Directives aimed at ending segregation, and those concerning employment, equal opportunities, and the equality of opportunity."
"This should be done so that Europe and the home countries may make the most of Roma prosperity, especially in light of the foreseeable European demographic indicators, at a time when we are talking about a greying Europe."
"The Roma are basically seeking to thrive in these countries, and do not wish to leave their countries behind."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, such is the way this place is organised, somehow I have more speaking time than Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka, which is hardly appropriate."
"I agree with everything she has said and the reason for that is that the speakers here present feel united in asking the Commission exactly what free movement of the Roma within the EU borders actually means."
"Our understanding is that such now is the level of discrimination - not only actual discrimination against the homogenous Roma population but also infringements on their ability to move, i.e. infringements on the ability of long-term-resident Roma in particular countries to move freely in reality."
"This can be because of actual restrictions, for example through visas and actual practical restrictions, and it can also mean, as Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka was implying, restrictions through discrimination: when Roma move traditionally through countries and from one country to another they face discrimination."
"What I would like to hear from the Commission in its statement is exactly what is its understanding of these infringements and restrictions."
"What study has it undertaken of what these infringements are and what does it think it can do to ease these restrictions for the Roma community?"
"In addition, what is the Commission saying about the Year of Equal Opportunities 2007?"
"I have heard very little about the issue of the Roma within this context."
"I have heard plenty on the issue of ageing, disability, race and religion."
"But specifically on the issue of the Roma, what is the programme of the Commission?"
"I know it is slightly unfair to ask you that, Mr Almunia."
"It is not your area of expertise, so please do not think that I am getting at you."
"However, please tell the Commissioners that we have not heard specifics."
"Please take that message back."
"What are you going to do this year?"
"What is the High Level Experts Group doing in terms of free movement?"
"What is in its pending tray on the Roma issue, i.e. actual discrimination issues, harassment issues?"
"How is money being spent?"
"Is it going to relieve poverty?"
"Is it going to educational programmes?"
"Those are all things that Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka, Mrs MohÃ¡csi and others have been struggling and fighting for for some time."
"The PSE Group fully supports their approach in asking the Commission for answers, and I think this evening is a good time to get those answers."
"If you cannot give them, Mr Almunia, please transmit this urgent message to your Commissioner colleagues, because it is about time we got some specific answers to these questions."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (HU) First of all, I would like to clarify the following: the background to my remarks is not the desire to question the right to free movement by Europeans, and hence of the Roma, nor do we or I wish to request any extra rights for these people, for this minority group."
"My original aim was that the European Union should examine how it might document - something that my fellow Member Mr Moraes has also mentioned - the number of forced migrants, those people who are forced to leave their homes because they are subject to ongoing discrimination."
"The Commissioner mentioned that it is not enough for a country to take action against discrimination, but the EU Member State in question must also ensure that there is integration."
"I think we have not yet reached this stage, nor even the stage where we might be able to monitor discrimination in each and every Member State, or to take appropriate steps against it."
"In April 2005, Parliament adopted a resolution of which the first sentence states that there is discrimination against the Roma within the Member States of the European Union."
"We do not know how many leave their homes because they are subject to ongoing discrimination and hope that their lives may be less troubled in a Western European country."
"Next week, we will have the second opportunity, when the Hungarian court will hear the case involving children who have been placed in special schools without any justification."
"Although they are of sound mind, they are compelled to attend educational institutions established for those with developmental handicaps."
"I have personally taken on the cases of 12 such children because Hungarian special schools are generally full of Roma children, who make up at least 70% of the special student population in Hungary, and unfortunately there are not very many Member States where these figures show any striking difference."
"A few months ago, several hundred Hungarian Roma sought asylum from the Swedish state, which naturally - as far as I know - rejected their request."
"I do not know how many of those families have children who suffer discrimination in a similar situation."
"This much is certain, if something like this were to happen to my children, I would seek asylum in another country."
"The struggle to eliminate discrimination and to guarantee human rights within the frontiers of our Member States is our common responsibility."
"We have the ability to take steps against discrimination, and we must do so."
"Since 2000 we have spent EUR 750 million within the territory of the EU on the integration of the Roma, yet the proportion who are unemployed and the proportion of children declared to be developmentally handicapped have increased."
"The time has come now for the European Commission, taking seriously the work it has done to date, to develop a strategy which - as my colleague Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka has also mentioned - will be able to put an end to discrimination and to call to account those countries that are lagging behind in terms of legislation."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I will start with a question."
"When will the EU finally take seriously the situation of its largest minority?"
"Fifteen million people in Europe remain excluded from basic human rights, such as the right to education, employment or physical integrity, merely because they are Roma, or gypsies as most people still call them."
"One month ago two more countries joined the EU."
"The treatment given to Roma in these countries is far from fulfilling EU norms."
"As we know from the latest report of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, the situation is not better in many of the old Member States."
"If we talk about the migration of Roma, most of us call to mind pictures of poor, hunger-ridden people who come to disturb us in our comfortable existence, rather than remembering that they have rights."
"In 1999, under the Finnish Presidency, the EU adopted a recommendation to the Member States that specific attention should be given to the situation of minorities, in particular those who have no home country, meaning the Roma."
"The Commission has spent tens of thousands of euros for the improvement of the situation of Roma without developing a clear strategy and targeted approach, following the model of other intergovernmental organisations."
"Under these circumstances migration often becomes the last resort for Roma."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia recently gave us some worrying data that show that acts of racism and xenophobia against minorities are on the increase in Europe."
"The Roma, who form the largest ethnic minority in the European Union, are particularly targeted."
"A great deal of discrimination occurs in relation to work and the right to education, and the Roma often live in conditions of poverty, marginalised from society."
"Sometimes discrimination comes from the very institutions that ought to safeguard people's rights."
"In a recent case in Slovenia, an entire group that had been living in that country for many years was removed from the area where it had been living for so long."
"I believe that we need to encourage the Roma to take part in social and political life, but for that to happen the Member States must first recognise them as an ethnic and linguistic minority."
"It would be necessary to get rid of the campsite system in favour of types of housing that would facilitate integration, thus eliminating any form of segregation."
"The Roma have inherited a centuries-old culture, and I believe that we should have great respect for nomadic cultures."
"We owe to them the birth of what we call Western civilisation, which arose in Mesopotamia, now Iraq and under military occupation, inappropriately stirring up a war of civilisations."
"We are in debt to the Roma, even though, in my view, civilised Europe has often mistreated and discriminated against them."
"We must therefore support their social inclusion and freedom of movement."
"That is why I join my other fellow Members in calling on the Commission to take a more proactive stance - although I realise that Mr Almunia will probably not be able to give us any exhaustive answers since this is not his area of expertise - but we believe that the Commission ought to be moving faster on these issues."
"Madam President, the EU Race Directive is insufficiently effective in combating the multiple discrimination faced by Roma people."
"Speaking personally - and not reflecting necessarily the view of my group, which I have not consulted - I have come round to the view, like the Network of Independent Experts in Fundamental Rights, that we need a legislative instrument specifically aimed at protecting and promoting the equality of the Roma community."
"I do not say that lightly, because normally I am not keen on specific measures, but my understanding is that the European Commission is not keen on this idea, and in the absence of such a focused and targeted instrument, I think all we will ever do is talk."
"The European Roma Rights Centre and the European Network against Racism pointed out recently, in a joint paper, that forced evictions, housing in extremely substandard conditions, denial of basic social and economic rights and school segregation are often instigated or condoned by local or regional government, and central governments have been ineffective in challenging them."
"Early this evening I had a question to the Council about the position of Roma people, and the response from the Presidency was essentially that, while anti-discrimination laws were an EU responsibility, social inclusion was a matter for national governments - a question of subsidiarity."
"Faced with that attitude, how will the Commission promote an effective pan-European programme of inclusion and equality of opportunity?"
"Madam President, I was hoping to get an answer from the Commissioner, but I see he is not scheduled to speak."
"On the website he was scheduled to reply to the debate, but here he is not."
"Are we getting a reply or not?"
"The Commissioner has indicated that he does not wish to reply, but I am sure that, in the light of the strong statements that have been made tonight, he will take a message back to his colleagues."
"The debate is closed."
"Agenda for next part session: see Minutes"
"Closure of sitting"
"(The sitting closed at 23.15)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 10 a.m.)"
"Documents received: see Minutes"
"Shareholders' voting rights (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the exercise of voting rights by shareholders of companies - C6-0003/2006 -"
"(FR) Before we begin this debate, I should just like to say that I know there are no rules governing the order in which MEPs speak."
"That being said, I should like to draw the Chamber's attention to a slightly odd situation whereby the rapporteur devoted all of his floor time to answer all of the speakers that had the floor, by way of a conclusion."
"When the issue at hand is a legislative text, those speaking on behalf of groups do so, according to our well-established practice, in an order commensurate with the political weight of their group and not at the end of the debate."
"It is for the Commission, which is well represented here, to respond."
"I am astonished by what has gone on here today."
"If this is a new, innovative practice, then it should be explained to us."
"The agenda has been drawn up with the agreement of the political groups and we must respect it."
"These are issues we can look at when we examine our work."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, due to the late addition of this item to the agenda, my colleague Mr McCreevy is unable to be here today and I shall present his considerations."
"I wish to begin by thanking the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, in particular, the two rapporteurs Mr Lehne and Mr Klinz for their excellent work on this file."
"The compromise package that is now on the table contains very effective solutions to the problems that we have identified, without imposing excessive burdens."
"These problems, which led the Commission to submit its proposal, were in principle very simple: at the moment shareholders do not receive information on general meetings in time, they face restrictions on trading their shares for a certain time period ahead of the meeting if they want to vote and they often have to go in person to general meetings, even if those meetings take place in another Member State, as there are no effective rules on representation and distant voting."
"Together with Parliament and the Council, we managed to find simple solutions to these simple problems."
"However, we cannot stop there."
"In particular, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs pointed out, in its opinion of November 2006, other issues that need to be addressed if we want to make the general meeting work efficiently and if we want to further improve the corporate governance of European companies."
"We have already identified stock lending as something we should look at more closely in the context of the future Commission recommendation on shareholders' rights."
"We agree that another important issue here is to clarify the role and the duties of financial intermediaries."
"In today's financial world, investors depend heavily on intermediaries to provide them with information and voting services if they want to exercise their voting rights."
"This point has also been stressed by delegations in the Council."
"The Commission has already undertaken to examine this question thoroughly in the impact assessment to the future Commission recommendation."
"I think all the parties involved agree that this issue is too important to address without having examined all available opinions and without having carried out a full assessment of the possible consequences."
"You might ask why we are considering using only a recommendation in order to tackle these problems."
"The reason is that the practical processes that are relevant in this context are constantly developing, also due to the constantly improving technology."
"We do not want to set the current situation in stone, but wish to leave enough flexibility for adjustments."
"The Commission recommendation will give us this flexibility."
"My colleague Mr McCreevy therefore confirmed last month, in a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, our intention to address this issue, together with others, in the context of the work on the recommendation."
"I hope you share our view that this is the right way to render the provisions of the draft directive even more effective in practice."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Almunia has already said, this is an extremely important project."
"It is concerned with deepening the European internal market, and one aspect of this is giving owners the opportunity to exercise their rights across borders in this internal market."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted this important project unanimously."
"We have come to an agreement with the Council whereby, if this House follows the vote of the Committee on Legal Affairs in plenary, the Council will do likewise, and thus we shall be able to achieve a result here at a single reading pursuant to the Interinstitutional Agreement of December 2003."
"The first crucial issue with which this Directive is concerned is that of the representation of shareholders at general meetings; that is, the exercise of voting rights not by the shareholders themselves but by intermediaries - representatives - or by means of proxy voting."
"There are widely differing rules for this in the EU, some of them highly restrictive."
"The compromise reached in the end makes representation possible in principle, but subject to a transparent procedure, and also gives the Member States the opportunity of prohibiting representation by national law in the event of conflicts of interest."
"A second important area is the issue of the right to ask questions."
"The problem here is that the traditions and, in particular, related legal consequences, rights of challenge and similar points vary greatly between Member States."
"The scale ranges from Member States where questions can be asked but do not need to be answered, to Member States where questions have to be answered correctly and, if they are not, resolutions adopted at general meetings can be declared null and void."
"A compromise has been reached on this that lays down the right of shareholders - owners - to ask questions in principle, but does enable Member States to make sensible adjustments and also limited restrictions to the right to ask questions in accordance with their own legal traditions, without calling this right into question in principle."
"As Commissioner Almunia mentioned, a number of issues could not be resolved definitively with this Directive."
"This is partly owing to legal systems. An example is the legal relationship between shareholder and representative."
"Indeed, this has no place in a Directive concerned with company law, as matters such as this belong in contract law, which is why the Council and Parliament subsequently agreed to deal with it in a separate recommendation, a separate legal act."
"The same goes for the subject of the languages used."
"In this regard, the co-rapporteur Mr Klinz from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs had made the - undoubtedly constructive - suggestion of providing for similar rules to those in the Transparency Directive."
"Here, too, however, we later decided - following the negotiations - that, in systematic terms, it would be better to regulate this within the framework of a recommendation than in this specific text. Consequently, this issue, too, will have to be resolved in the separate legal act."
"All in all, I should say that, from my point of view, we have managed to solve the multitude of problems that existed when we started dealing with this Directive."
"It is true that they have not all been solved one hundred per cent satisfactorily, there is no question about that - this is normal when one has to reach compromises."
"Ultimately, however, they have been solved in a way that enabled the solution to obtain unanimous support in both the Council and the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"I should like to express the warmest of thanks to my co-rapporteur, Mr Klinz, to the shadow rapporteurs from the two committees concerned - but particularly to Mr Medina from the Committee on Legal Affairs, with whom I enjoyed close cooperation - to the two Chairs, Mr Gargani and Mrs BerÃ¨s, to the Austrian, Finnish and German Presidencies, which contributed significantly to the success of this project, and last but not least to the European Commission, whose help with overcoming the problems was very useful."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cross-border share ownership is on the increase, but attendance at general meetings across borders remains unsatisfactory."
"That is what this Directive sets out to change and improve."
"The objective is welcomed and shared by all parties, and so I had reckoned with relatively simple, short negotiations as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - but reality taught me otherwise."
"Thanks to the peculiarities of the bodies of company and civil law of the 27 Member States, and also cultural differences - some of them major - the negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council were protracted and difficult and ultimately produced only minimum harmonisation."
"Nevertheless, there has been some very tangible progress, as Mr Lehne has already said."
"Share blocking is to be abolished, cross-border proxy voting liberalised and electronic means permitted."
"These measures will undoubtedly make it easier in future for those with cross-border share ownership to cast their vote at general meetings."
"Agreement has yet to be reached on a solution to some key problems, however, which the Commissioner has also mentioned."
"I particularly regret the removal from the Directive of the definition of the shareholder and the role of intermediaries in cross-border depository chains."
"The issues of stock lending, the language to be used and the special position of investment funds have also been left out."
"These are fields where minimum harmonisation is particularly necessary if we are to really establish a genuine European share culture."
"Nevertheless, I am pleased that the Commission intends to address and take up this subject specifically in the form of a recommendation."
"The provisions agreed give the Member States broad scope for action, and so we shall probably have to live with different rules - some of them substantially so - in the individual Member States for many years to come."
"I hope that the approach of minimum harmonisation that has been chosen does not risk diluting the whole project."
"Only experience over the next few years will show whether attendance at general meetings actually increases perceptibly and thus the main objective of the Directive can be achieved."
"That would certainly be of great benefit in terms of corporate governance."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I would firstly like to say that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is going to vote in favour of the proposal by Mr Lehne, as amended in the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"Secondly, while I am pleased that Commissioner Almunia is with us, I believe that this would have been a good opportunity to hold a personal exchange of views with Commissioner McCreevy, because, as has been highlighted in previous speeches, there are questions about the limitations of this proposal for a directive."
"It is a minimal proposal for a directive, about which there are a series of question marks."
"For example, with regard to the issue of financial intermediaries, the legitimate rights of shareholders and the use of proxy, that is, the right to vote by means of a representative."
"The text that Mr Almunia has read to us on behalf of Mr McCreevy talks about a future Commission recommendation."
"The problem with recommendations is that they raise difficulties from the point of view of Community law."
"Mr Lehne has said that we are talking about provisions of the Treaties, but at the moment we in the European Parliament are concerned about the over-use of the systems of so-called 'soft' law by the Community institutions, which raises questions about the reliability of the Law."
"I have the feeling that this issue will have to be discussed."
"I hope that, at meetings with the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Commissioner McCreevy will clarify his ideas a little so that we can ascertain what we can do in order to reassure ourselves that progress is going to be made in a particular direction."
"We Socialists are rather concerned about the protection of the rights of shareholders."
"We are concerned about the possibility that, in a great European Union market, financial operators will act with total impunity and freedom, and I have the sense that this is an important issue for everybody, for investors and for savers, which should be subject to full consideration and discussion between Parliament and the Commission."
"We will therefore vote in favour, but I would say once again that I hope Mr McCreevy can discuss the methods for making future changes in the legal field with us."
"(PL) Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Lehne for all his work on a matter that is so important for the future of European integration and the growth of the single internal market."
"At present, citizens of several Member States of the European Union who hold shares in companies quoted on the stock exchange, and whose registered office is located in another Member State, experience significant difficulties in exercising their voting rights."
"As the process of European integration gathers momentum and the internal market grows, the amount of cross-border capital investment is increasing, which is a good sign."
"It suggests that integrated financial markets are becoming established in Europe."
"This process should be encouraged, which is why the Commission recommendation on the directive deserves our support today."
"The document under debate contains many important proposals devised to make it easier for shareholders to exercise their rights."
"I should perhaps mention the need to ensure that sufficient notice is given when convening all general meetings."
"It is also important to ensure that interested parties have easy access to information announcing meetings and the results of votes taken in them."
"Providing for proxy voting is another important issue, along with measures to make it easier for intermediaries to act for shareholders."
"These are the kinds of solutions that will make it possible to restrict certain types of share blocking."
"Madam President, my congratulations to the rapporteur for his report."
"There are many essential elements concerning this report which we can all get behind, particularly in protecting the rights of shareholders and making the process transparent."
"It is nice to hear the transparency directive mentioned - which I worked on before."
"However, from a legal point of view its treatment is slightly different from the approach of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, where strong opinion found in favour of certain key issues, in particular necessary distinctions required in dealing with intermediaries and stock lending when, in particular, shares were repatriated in order to allow for owners to vote."
"The timing is vital and we are surprised, therefore, that Amendment 26 to Article 7 does nothing but confuse the situation."
"What happens to these shares - are they to be deposited?"
"Transferred?"
"Registered?"
"What?"
"There seems to be nothing there which allows for specific requirements."
"There are no specific requirements or references to them concerning the sale of transferred shares."
"Might this not lead to certain further confusion?"
"There are also amendments from the ECON Committee which I have to say have been subject to what I deem the 'recital effect' by the Committee on Legal Affairs and to the 'letter effect' by Commissioner McCreevy, who suggested that later developments on these issues should be expected."
"Let us be frank."
"Nobody likes to be told that their amendments are reducible or that they can be ignored."
"The ECON Committee is an equal player and its remit allows it to be so."
"I can only say that the process has been unsatisfactory in that regard, which is partly the reason for this debate today."
"I hope we can come back to these issues in the ECON Committee with the Commissioner to repair some of these problems mentioned in our ECON opinion."
"Madam President, it is clear that our political group and particularly the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are pretty critical about the procedure."
"I will not repeat what others have already said on this, but what I would like to stress here is that if as a parliament we have codecision rights on a dossier, we should take every opportunity to really assess what comes out of informal negotiations with the Council and Commission in a codecision procedure which is likely to go to a first reading agreement."
"This is why we were a little upset that this dossier is already being dealt with in this sitting rather than in March as had been planned."
"We would then have been able to discuss an oral question with Commissioner McCreevy about 'one share, one vote'."
"I hope that we will still have this opportunity and that the Committee on Legal Affairs will also support us in having this further debate with Commissioner McCreevy."
"On the content, the essential difference between a recommendation and a legislative text is precisely this codecision."
"A letter from Commissioner McCreevy to Mr Gargani, the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, announces that some of the issues we were concerned about will be dealt with in a recommendation."
"The last line says, 'You will be informed about this one as a parliament'."
"This is the exact point we are making."
"We would like to be co-legislators on that type of issue as well."
"This is the reason why we are not really happy that some of these issues could not be taken up in the agreement with the Council."
"Maybe if we had had more time we could have also convinced the Council that this kind of issue, which is of major concern, could have been included in the first reading, second reading or conciliation agreements."
"These are my comments on what happened today."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, the Commission's initiative was what we were looking for, but the way in which the Commission set its objectives needed correction."
"I believe that the work which we began in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and which, following many discussions, culminated in the agreement before us today, was worthwhile on two counts, first and foremost on the definition of the term shareholder, which, in the form proposed by the Commission, was too broad."
"This led us to embark on a definition of securities law that was very close to the practice in force on the other side of the Atlantic, which does not correspond to our traditional notion of what is a shareholder."
"I feel that a narrower, tighter definition, such as we are proposing today, is the right way forward."
"The second point on which we have been led to amend the Commission's proposal is the issue of the process of reattaching voting mandates."
"On this issue, too, I feel that, thanks to the work undertaken in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with our rapporteur, whom I wish to thank, we were able to emphasise the existence of compulsory instructions in the event of a mandate: an obligation to observe and retain these instructions."
"To this end, I feel that in addition to the question of cross-border rights for shareholders in this report, the Commission would be better off looking equally closely at what is important in terms of employee share ownership or the stability of shareholders in certain industrial situations regarding which, from a European perspective, we would favour a coherent strategy."
"I should like, if I may, to take this opportunity to ask you again, Commissioner, about the Commission's position on the Hague Convention."
"This issue forms an integral part of this debate."
"Parliament asked you to withdraw the Commission's signature under the Convention, and the debates in the Council have clearly not moved on very far."
"I should like to ask you, Commissioner, to talk to Mr McCreevy again and to tell him that this House wants the Commission to rethink its position on this issue and to withdraw the European Union's signature from this Convention."
"(DE) Madam President, I should like to thank everyone who has contributed to and supported this very difficult project."
"Not everything has been resolved one hundred per cent satisfactorily, but that is inevitable with such a difficult compromise."
"Nevertheless, we have taken a significant step towards making it easier for European shareholders to exercise their ownership rights."
"In Europe, there are no large strides towards our ultimate goal, but only accumulations of small steps - and the issue of shareholders' rights is no exception."
"I wish to conclude on this note, express my thanks and forgo the remainder of my speaking time."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."

"- After the vote on the motion for a resolution:"
"(NL) Mr President, you were actually going a little fast for me."
"I would like to find out from the Commission whether it accepts the amendment that has been tabled."
"As an exception, the Commission may take the floor again."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I think that the Commission is prepared to do all it can to consult throughout 2007/2008 year on the new guidelines for 2008 and 2010."
"Whether this necessarily requires a minimum of five months or not, given Parliament's internal procedures, is not for the Commission to say."
"(NL) Mr President, since it now transpires that the Commission is still uncertain as to how much time it is prepared to give Parliament, I would, given that we have not yet reached the final vote, like to ask you to refer the report back to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which will make some more consultation with the Commission possible."
"It is usually up to the rapporteur to make such a request."
"What is his position on this?"
"rapporteur. - (SV) No, I shall not arrange for the proposal to be referred back."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten should know that the economic guidelines cannot be adopted by the Council until Parliament has expressed its opinion."
"That is the actual rule."
"The Commission, and above all the Council, must take account of Parliament's points of view."
"That is the case where the employment policy guidelines are concerned."
"The economic guidelines are more of a problem because there is no such regulation in this area."

"External dimension of the fight against terrorism (vote)"
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, we are going to vote on a report on the external dimension of the fight against international terrorism on the day on which the trial relating to the biggest attack in the history of Europe begins in Madrid."
"Four direct victims of that attack are with us today in the gallery, Mr President. JesÃºs RamÃ­rez Castanedo, who was seriously wounded in the attack;"
"JesÃºs Abril Escusa, who lost his 19-year-old son; Isabel Casanova Ortega, who lost her 22-year-old son together with her father; and Euclides Antonio RÃ­o Grajales, who was seriously wounded in the attack."
"For this two-fold reason, I would be grateful if this House could acknowledge them."
"(The House rose and applauded the victims)"
"We should like to express our deepest sympathy with the victims, and we shall do everything possible within the rule of law to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice."
"We stand in solidarity with the victims and their families."
"We remember with profound compassion those who lost their lives."
"(Applause)"
"- Before the vote on Amendment 19:"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I propose that after Amendment 19 we insert the text of this oral amendment, which I believe also has the agreement of the rapporteur: 'in view of the recent discoveries of extremely dangerous terrorist organisations in Italy and France'."

"That concludes voting time."
"Mr President, on a point of order, at the beginning of voting time we voted on two Esteves reports: the first on readmission, without a roll-call vote, and the second on short-stay visas, with a roll-call vote."
"However, you announced the same title both times: 'the report on readmission'."
"As a result, there was some confusion in the vote by the Verts/ALE Group."
"I would like to ask the Secretariat and the President to check our vote."
"Our group's position was in favour of the report on short-stay visas and against the report on readmission."
"I am afraid that the whole group has voted otherwise because of the mistake made in the announcement of the title of the report."
"Please take this into account."
"If this was the case, Mrs Å½danoka, it will be noted."
"We shall look into it and make the appropriate note in the Minutes."
"Voting time"
"The next item is voting time."
"(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Colleagues, you always insist that we start the vote on time, but it is in your hands!"
"Please settle down and take your seats."
"Explanations of vote"
"I should like to take the opportunity of the vote on this report on the voting rights of shareholders, which is unfortunately taking place without prior debate, to draw the Chamber's attention to the Eurotunnel scandal, the utter daylight robbery backed by French governments, be they socialist or liberal, that has been going on for years."
"800 000 small shareholders, still accounting for some 90% of the company's capital, believed the promises of the tunnel's designers, of the public authorities, the bankers and the manufacturers and invested some EUR 4.5 billion in the company."
"They are now ruined, and will be damaged even further by a 'rescue' plan, which consists of selling the company to non-European shareholders at basement rates and reimbursing its creditors, which have already earned EUR 8.5 billion in interest."
"This plan was drawn up without consulting the shareholders and has been imposed on them by the Paris Tribunal De Commerce (Court of Arbitration in Business Matters)."
"The only choice open to them is to respond or not to a takeover bid, which will keep them forever sidelined when it comes to capital and, by extension, to business decisions, at the very moment when the business is becoming extremely profitable."
"This is a shameful episode, and the silence of the French authorities is scandalous."
"All of this serves to dissuade people from investing in the economy, thereby leaving it to the mercy of the large, stateless, financial groups."
"in writing. I voted for this report as budget support is a great tool for partnership with developing countries, allowing them to take ownership of the use of development funds."
"But funds must be used in the right way and there is a need to guard against misuse of funds and I am glad that this report suggests clearly identified criteria."
"in writing. - (FR) Fifty years!"
"Almost fifty years during which several European countries have made great efforts in the area of development aid and north-south cooperation."
"Half a century, with mixed results."
"Why?"
"For several reasons."
"One reason is the lack of appropriate development strategies on the part of the countries receiving aid."
"This is why I voted in favour of the report on budgetary aid for developing countries, that is to say, aid directly managed by the government of the benefiting country."
"In this way, it is that government that will assume responsibility for its own development, following dialogue with the Union and the drafting of a strategy."
"I am well aware that this instrument is a controversial one, especially when it is to be used in fragile countries with unstable economies, and of course when the countries concerned are undemocratic or corrupt."
"It cannot therefore be used everywhere."
"The success of budgetary support, however, is about breaking the vicious circle."
"The conditions leave no room for doubt: no budgetary support without observing standards of governance and without fighting corruption; no budgetary support without measures aimed at cleaning up the economy."
"The more points a government scores for good governance, the more aid it receives."
"This is about creating a virtuous circle."
"(ES) I would like to refer to the Community plan to eradicate illegal fishing, which, at international level, takes place above all in the waters of developing countries, which are too poor and lack the resources required to control fishing activities in the areas under their jurisdiction."
"The fact that this illegal fishing cannot be prevented leads to losses and poverty for their coastal populations that depend on fishing for a living and for a secure source of food."
"At the same time, these illegal practices lead to direct losses for legitimate fisheries operators as well."
"In this regard, I would like to stress once again that one of the virtues of the association agreements in the fisheries sector between the European Union and other countries is that Community deep-sea fishing fleets have accepted the code of conduct for responsible fishing, promoted by the United Nations, and that their presence in those waters also means that other illegal vessels do not act with such impunity."
"Therefore, being in favour of renewing all the fisheries agreements with third countries, since they offer significant mutual benefits for both parties, I have voted in favour of the plan to eradicate illegal fishing, because it poses a serious threat to the biological balance of the oceans, and that represents a great environmental risk that we cannot afford."
"I voted in favour of the action plan against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, as this is a major problem around the world, causing considerable environmental degradation, contributing to the depletion of commercial and non-commercial fish stocks and other species and resulting in difficulties for communities dependent on fishing for their livelihoods in both developing and developed countries."
"Furthermore, it constitutes unfair competition for those fishers and commercial players who abide by the rules laid down in law."
"in writing. I voted in favour of this report, which recommends several measures to tackle illegal fishing, such as urging the Commission to help developing countries, above all those with which it has fishing agreements, to comply fully with the commitments of the above international plan of action designed to prevent illegal fishing."
"In particular I support the call for the Commission to carry out and submit a study on compliance with Community labour, health and safety legislation and on respect for the social rights of workers on this type of vessel, and on their living and working conditions on board."
"The EU has on several occasions declared its willingness to develop and deepen relations with its neighbours."
"One of the essential prerequisites for improving bilateral relations is to facilitate the legal movement of people."
"At this point, I should like to point out that the Russian Federation proposed to the EU the bilateral lifting of visa requirements."
"Following the rejection of that offer, an agreement was reached in complicated negotiations covering short-stay visas for citizens of the Russian Federation and the Community, except for citizens of three of the EU Member States."
"This is something of a pilot agreement because negotiations are ongoing on a similar agreement with the Balkan countries, Ukraine, Morocco and China."
"The agreement contains a number of positive points, such as visas to be provided free of charge for holders of diplomatic passports, multiple visas, timeframes for issuing visas and fees for visas."
"Naturally, this agreement is a long way short of visa-free relations, and the quick and problem-free issuance of visas free of charge."
"Some comments made in the debate in this Chamber indicate that there are a number of MEPs with vested interests in the issue."
"Attempts are being made, on the one hand, to revive the corpse of the European Constitution and, on the other hand, to use the agreement to interfere in Russia's internal affairs."
"These attempts were mostly repelled and were not included in the visa agreement."
"We therefore support it in the belief that this is the first step on the road to visa-free relations with one of the EU's key partners."
"in writing. The GUE/NGL Group welcomes all Agreements that promote bilateral travel arrangements between the EU and the Russian Federation."
"These facilitate the travelling of Russian citizens to the EU and vice versa."
"Moreover, such arrangements are considered to be an important step forward, aiming at establishing better communication ties and creating political dialogue on a cultural, economical and political level."
"However the GUE/NGL Group is very much concerned about the EC-Russia Short-stay Visa Agreement because of its close political link to the EC-Russia readmission agreement, which seriously undermines the protection and rights of refugees and immigrants, as well as their fundamental rights."
"The GUE/NGL Group is also strongly opposed to Article 11 of the joint declaration to the agreement which defines ""biometric identifiers"" in diplomatic passports as a priority for ensuring a high level of document security."
"GUE/NGL is also opposed to the fact that certain provisions of the Agreement apply exclusively to certain categories or groups of people."
"This is considered discriminatory and the GUE/NGL Group stresses that the facilitation procedure for access visas should apply and be guaranteed equally to all citizens of the EU Member States and citizens of the Russian Federation."
"in writing. - (PT) We naturally welcome the bilateral agreements between the EU and the Russian Federation aimed at facilitating and promoting the movement of Russian citizens to the various countries of the EU and vice versa."
"These agreements represent a stepping stone towards establishing closer cultural, social and economic ties, which would meet the legitimate aspirations of thousands and thousands of people for procedures that would effectively facilitate contact between family members living in the Russian Federation and in EU Member States."
"That being said, this agreement contains obligations that we find unacceptable, for example Article 11 of the Joint Declaration, which states that the requirement of 'biometric identifiers' on diplomatic passports is a priority in order to ensure high levels of security."
"We also object to the fact that some provisions in the agreement apply exclusively to certain 'categories' or 'groups' of people, as we feel that the process of facilitating the issuance of visas should apply and should be guaranteed to all citizens of EU countries and the Russian Federation."
"The readmission agreement with Russia is one of the important documents through which the Commission is attempting to regulate immigration."
"It actually forms part of the debate on the issues of democracy, equal rights, minority rights and the protection of cultural identity."
"The issue goes beyond relations with Russia and the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States."
"The key issue for EU Member States is mass immigration from Africa, Turkey, countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC), Indochina, China and Latin America."
"The agreement with Russia should be a kind of model agreement, on the basis of which the Commission will clarify progress in the European economic area, and at the same time will gauge the extent to which it can interfere in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries."
"Russia is a large and powerful partner on which the EU is dependent up to a point, and because of this the agreement avoids making criticisms under the heading of 'respect for the basic rights of the persons involved'."
"It is only through the issues raised in the explanatory statement from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that we see an attempt to use the readmission agreement to interfere in Russia's internal affairs."
"This trend is so disturbing that there is no way that I can support the agreement."
"It runs counter to the security and humanitarian aspects of the agreement."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs is mostly interested, oddly enough, in 'the absence of a regulatory framework for implementing the agreement'."
"I welcome the call for the Commission to help Russian institutions implement the agreement."
"On the other hand, I object to the obfuscation of the concept of safe third countries."
"I share the view that the agreement on the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas and the readmission agreement between the European Community and Russia should help strengthen mutual relations and create a joint European area based on shared values and common interests."
"I should like to remind the House that Russia was the first subject of the so-called joint strategy presented to the European Council in 1999."
"Even at that time it was clearly stated that Russia should be firmly anchored in Europe and that Russia must not be viewed merely as a threat or as an inferior or troublesome partner."
"Taking account of both this overview and of current events in Europe and around the world, I cannot accept the idea put forward in the report on the readmission agreement that relations between the EU and Russia are going through a critical phase and that the new partnership and cooperation agreement after 2007 will depend on the perceived human rights situation in Russia."
"Russia is not a superpower which wages wars and tramples human rights underfoot across every continent."
"Those who criticise human rights abuses wherever they occur, and not only in Russia, should first ensure that they themselves strictly uphold human rights."
"The fact that this is not the case is evidenced by the situation of the Russian non-citizens living in the Baltic States."
"in writing. - (FR) This resolution adopts the Commission's proposal concerning the Council's decision, which heaps praise on the Lisbon Strategy and asserts that unemployment has gone down in Europe."
"The Lisbon Strategy, even in its revamped form, will remain a symbol of shallow populism and inefficiency, given that the Member States subject to the Brussels guidelines are having difficulty in toeing the pro-European line and fail on growth, employment and modernising their social security systems."
"This reduction in unemployment, according to the Commission's positive assessment, is a delusion masking the reality of the figures."
"This is very much a case of a 'Potemkin Village', because, in France alone, many poor people and people in insecure employment, not to mention the unemployed on training courses and many members of the active workforce who have been given early retirement, have been skilfully excluded from the statistics."
"Lastly, the procedural amendment proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, wisely calling for Parliament to be given the necessary time to fulfil its consultative role on these social issues, demonstrates our institution's powerlessness in the face of pro-European absolutism."
"The Employment Guidelines in the European Union, which were jointly drafted and decided both by the New Democracy government and the previous PASOK government within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, inextricably link employment policy to the core objective of maximising the plutocracy's profits, the necessary prerequisite to which is huge intensification of the exploitation of the working classes."
"The pronouncements by the ÎU about allegedly reducing unemployment and so forth are aimed at deceiving the workers, given that it itself admits the failure of its policies, finding that the overall rate of employment was 63% in 2003, which is much lower than the agreed objective of 70%, despite the apportionment of unemployment with temporary and flexible forms of employment, which accounted for 60% of new jobs between 2000 and 2005."
"The future being prepared by the ÎU for the workers on the basis of the axes of its policy is a future of 'de-employment' in which, even from preschool age, they will acquire fragmentary, opportunistic skills and training, drift from one form of semi-employment to another, with half or no employment, social, insurance or pension rights, travelling the length and breadth of their country and the EU in search of work, being constantly retrained to the requirements of capital with disposable knowledge, working into old age or until death producing incredible wealth which will be reaped and appropriated by the plutocracy."
"in writing. - (SK) I have voted for this very important - though not legally binding - report by Katerina Batzeli, which is both consistent and well-balanced, presenting numerous essential suggestions from MEPs deeply knowledgeable of local traditions and customs in their regions."
"Following the uproar caused by the Commission communication on a sustainable European wine industry, and in particular the decision to eradicate 400 000 ha of vineyards, it was necessary for the European Parliament to present its views of future reform of the wine sector in this report."
"What is vital, in my opinion, is to preserve the budget of the Community, and not to shift any funds from the first to the second pillar of the common agricultural policy, which is devoted to rural development, as this might lead to resources being lost to the wine industry."
"On the other hand, it is necessary to support the market position of wine and the wine industry by establishing a realistic advertising, communications and marketing policy based on joint organisation of the market."
"I firmly believe that the Commission can devise efficient draft legislation only by making proper provision for the proposals from the European Parliament aimed at preserving the leading position worldwide of quality wines produced by the European wine industry, which is still a significant source of employment and prosperity in quite a few European regions, including Slovakia."
"(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on reforming the common market organisation for wine, because I believe it contains many positive proposals."
"As this report was worked on in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, it was very obvious that the committee was divided into two camps."
"One comprised of the countries of northern and central Europe, and the other included southern European countries."
"Nonetheless, I am sure everyone agrees that action must be taken to balance the situation on the market."
"I also believe that the possibility of using sugar beet to enrich wine in wine-growing region A must be retained."
"Failure to do so would amount to discrimination against the countries located in parts of the Union where the climate makes wine growing more difficult."
"Those regions have never produced surpluses and should be exempt from the ban on certain plantings, which is aimed at limiting production."
"In addition, I feel that the resources allocated to the emergency distillation of wine surpluses should be limited."
"The additional wine alcohol produced in this way distorts the market in ethyl alcohol and is a burden on the Union's budget."
"in writing. (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats have voted against the report on the common organisation of the market in wine."
"The report is characterised by a high degree of protectionism that might hamper economic development in both the EU and developing countries."
"The report also contains a number of wordings to the effect that the wine sector should be encouraged with the help of subsidies for the production and marketing of wine."
"For us, supporting this is unthinkable in terms both of public health and of the consequences it would have for the EU's budget."
"A number of amendments deleting certain wordings in the report have been tabled by the xenophobic Integrity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group."
"We Social Democrats have chosen to vote against the ITS Group's amendments."
"We think it unacceptable to support this group."
"We believe that we have rejected the report by voting against it in its entirety."
"Wine, for those who have been making it for centuries, is not just a beverage like any other to be marketed solely with a view to profit: it is a choice based on history, culture, respect and a quest for quality - often a quest for excellence."
"Italy, the number one wine exporter in the world, has made high quality its banner, together with respect for consumers and the traditions of wine-making."
"This report is schizophrenic: on the one hand it talks about promoting quality, while on the other it comes down in favour of enrichment with sugar; on the one hand it talks about protecting geographical designations, while on the other it opens the door to new wine-making practices, such as wine with shavings."
"The European Commission has, in any case, often taken a similar line; for years it has preferred brutal liberalisation and large-scale distribution, at the expense of quality, tradition and the protection of consumers and producers."
"Just to give an example, I would like to point to Regulation (EC) No 316/2004 which liberalised 17 traditional designations, in reality opening up the market to wine-making piracy."
"For all these reasons, while I voted in favour of the report, I would like to express great concern for the future of the high quality of the wine-making sector, particularly the Italian sector."
"in writing. - (FR) I must congratulate Mrs Batzeli on her work in this field, of which the economic, social, environmental, territorial and cultural ramifications are enormous."
"I feel that her own-initiative report is a well-balanced and ambitious one, which will enable Parliament to influence the major guidelines of the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine drawn up by the Commission."
"The European winemaking sector is in a difficult situation, facing fierce competition from wine from the New World."
"It should be highlighted, however, that the EU remains the biggest producer, the biggest consumer and the biggest exporter of wine in the world."
"I strongly object to the Commission's first proposals, which would place production in the hands of a few major winemaking operations and would lead to a standardisation of wine and to crises in numerous European regions."
"Permanent grubbing up would lead to the abandonment of production in the areas most cut off and in most difficulty, where there is no alternative form of production, and would serve to speed up the process of desertification."
"We must respect the European winemaking tradition, the quality and authenticity of European wines and their ties with the soil."
"It is not by adopting the corrective oenological practices used in other continents that we will become more competitive, but by favouring commercial investment and improving the promotion of our products."
"in writing. - (FR) This report has gone completely against the Commission's proposals on the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine and has made that organisation more respectful of the European wine tradition."
"Speaking as a Socialist MEP, I feel that this report has struck the right balance in terms of the need to reform the sector and the interests of European winemakers."
"Firstly, I welcome the implementation of structural measures aimed at restoring the balance of the market."
"From now on, the cleaning up of the market will entail the gradual elimination of distillation arrangements and a targeted approach to grubbing up according to qualitative, geographical and environmental criteria."
"Secondly, I welcome the implementation of regulatory measures on oenological practices, labelling - in order to meet the demand for transparency for the consumers - and the promotion of European wine in order to penetrate new markets around the world."
"Lastly, as I am keen to protect traditional wine production in the face of wine subject to very little regulation, I welcome the ban on must imports."
"I voted in favour of this report as I feel that reform of the winemaking sector must safeguard the specific characteristics of European wines, including Portuguese wines, the quality of which should be appreciated."
"Given that the EU is the world's biggest producer and consumer of wine and that the sector accounts for 60% of the EU's exports, I feel that there should be far-reaching reform of the current common organisation of the market in wine, which would help consolidate traditional markets and develop expanding markets."
"The EU wine sector needs policies that lead to the strengthening, improvement and promotion of the competitiveness of European wine on an increasingly demanding international stage."
"I come from a country, Portugal, and more specifically from a region, Madeira, in which the wine sector plays a highly significant economic role."
"Although I acknowledge the need for far-reaching and ambitious reform of the common organisation of the market in wine, in order to modernise it and to adapt it to the development of the Community market and to the pressure of international competition, some of the solutions put forward by the Commission in its Communication of 22 June 2006 - especially that of permanent abandonment - do not resolve the problem of surplus production and do not address the challenge of competitiveness that European winemaking faces on the world market."
"Rather, they threaten European (quality) winemaking potential, hamper the sustainability of the Community winemaking sector and damage the stability of winemakers."
"As Mrs Batzeli, whom I congratulate, says in her report, 'the issue of permanent abandonment of wine-growing must not be the centrepiece of the CMO reform'. The report contains a sensible analysis of the Commission's proposals and presents a range of most timely suggestions."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"We are very disappointed that the various proposals that we tabled were rejected."
"This led us to vote against the final report, although we agree with, and voted for, a number of the rapporteur's proposals."
"We are dismayed that the main measure proposed in the Commission communication for regulating supply and demand in the winemaking sector is the grubbing up of 400 000 hectares of vine, which will reduce production and jobs will be lost."
"This will in turn serve to exacerbate the desertification of vast areas, as has already happened in Portugal, and to place the wine and alcohol sector into the hands of a few major producers and large companies."
"These are measures aimed at reducing the EU's vineyards, which would affect primarily the least developed regions, family holdings and farmers on low incomes, but they will have little impact on the rise in imports and the declining role of winemaking in the EU Member States."
"We shall continue to defend our proposals and to combat the Commission's proposal to liberalise the sector. What we are proposing is a different type of reform of the common organisation of the market in wine that values sustainable winemaking, the traditional characteristics of winemaking, small and medium-sized farming and family farming, the sector's social and cultural role, and its important contribution towards regional and national development."
"in writing. - (FR) I wish to ask the Commission the following questions:"
"Assuming that there has been surplus wine production since the 1970s, following 20 years of under-production, which at world level is unclear, why, then, import 12 million hectolitres every year from countries such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina?"
"If, on the pretext of surplus production, my region of Languedoc-Roussillon has to carry out a programme of grubbing up, why import 12 million hectolitres - the exact equivalent of 15 million hectolitres produced in Languedoc-Roussillon - from countries outside the EU?"
"If there is surplus production, why does Brussels want to authorise must imports from third countries, in order to make flat-pack 'Ikea wines'?"
"If there is surplus production, why seek to authorise the US practice of adding 7% of water to wine?"
"Why seek to grub up vineyards on our territory when Chile, Australia and the vineyards of the 33rd parallel are planting?"
"'When China has drunk too much', who will give it wine to drink if we grub up vineyards?"
"Of the 400 000 hectares, or 4 billion m2, that have been grubbed up, does the Commission not envisage planting 4 million villas with a real estate value of EUR 100 billion?"
"The Commission proposal on the CMO for wine jeopardises the protection of European wine production."
"The provision that it makes for the grubbing-up of vines is liable to affect entire areas devoted to this production and also to irremediably damage the growing of indigenous vines which, while not very widespread, nonetheless represent centuries-old history and traditions."
"The constant increase in wine production and quality in the so-called 'New World' countries (South Africa, Australia and South America, where vines are, by contrast, being planted), the increasing presence of these wines on the European market and the fact that worldwide demand for wine is on the increase make the idea of grubbing-up all the more incomprehensible."
"Europe needs to be able to compete with its competitors on equal terms."
"With a view to optimising European wine production and wine-making, I have tabled an amendment on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group that underlines the need to maintain the ban in Europe on using the new wine-making practices for ageing wine (such as the use of oak shavings instead of the traditional period spent in the barrel)."
"in writing. This report, whilst it had many good points, could have potentially affected UK wine production in the south-east in a disastrous manner."
"The 'fructose' practice, whereby sugar is added to UK and other northern European wines, would have been banned if amendments urging this would have been passed and accepted by the House and the Commission."
"This is a blatant attack from inside the wine-producing industry and should be forever rejected for future reports in this area."
"in writing. (SV) The present report addresses a very important and topical issue, but its approach is quite wrong."
"The European Parliament is again trying to boost its own importance, this time using the increase in terrorism and its victims as arguments."
"The report is full of wordings involving small but nonetheless worrying steps in the direction of an EU state with a common foreign and security policy."
"It also encroaches on countries' internal affairs, in certain cases in opposition to the Member States' fundamental laws."
"We also note that it has the audacity to refer to a Constitution that has been rejected in referendums in Europe."
"One of the most serious wordings concerns the desire to abolish the unanimity rule in as important an issue as police cooperation and cooperation on criminal law."
"That is completely unacceptable."
"We have consequently voted against the report, including most of the amendments tabled, and this in accordance with the mandate we have from our voters."
"in writing. The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports the majority of this report, particularly in underlining the vital role of respect for human rights and rule of law, the importance of upholding internationally-agreed values, the need to strengthen coordination of intelligence between Member States and the importance of examining the conditions that feed terrorism."
"However, it is premature to link ESDP operations with counter terrorism, and the cost of any such ESDP operation would have to come from the CFSP budget not the EU budget, as stated."
"In addition, abrogation of unanimity on police and judicial cooperation is not appropriate for this report as it is a much wider issue and is part of the broader 'Passerelle' argument."
"in writing. I voted for this report as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms must be the basis of the fight against terrorism."
"I support a multiple approach, from prevention through the building of an alliance of civilizations, to joint police operations."
"in writing. Among the reasons I cannot support this report are:"
"the reference to the use of combat units (battle groups) and enhanced cooperation with NATO;"
"the vague use of the term 'radicalisation' as an indicator for 'non-democratic actions';"
"the promotion of cooperation between security and intelligence services and police, judicial and customs authorities of the Member States and third countries, raising the issue of data protection and constituting a deterioration of civil liberties and respect for human rights;"
"the mixing of police, security and intelligence forces, which could lead to abuse of powers against the citizens, as has been seen recently in Ireland;"
"the interlinking of internal policies with terrorism results in the elimination of the inter-pillar structure, bringing forward the logic of the draft EU Constitution."
"There is no mention of state terrorism."
"Some of the root causes of violence (occupation, injustice, social and economic causes) are barely mentioned."
"The report points the finger at Islam, fostering discrimination and undermining respect for different religions and cultures."
"in writing. - (EL) Even before the ink of the European Parliament's supposed protest about the riot of CIA activities has dried on the resolutions by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and so forth, the report by the 'socialist' MEP Mr Garcia escalating the EU's terrorist policy over the entire planet is being approved."
"With what is now the familiar plea of protection of human rights, the report proposes the application of measures in a more reactionary direction, such as:"
"â¢ stepping up militarisation and 'preventive' repression inside and outside the ÎU by strengthening and increasing resources for rapid intervention forces - battlegroups - and other repressive ÎU mechanisms such as Europol and Frontex;"
"â¢ even greater 'cooperation' with imperialist forces, such as the USA and Israel, and with organisations such as ÎÎÎ¤Î, the OSCE and so forth in the military sector and in the exchange of information sector;"
"â¢ unprovoked intervention in the internal affairs of third countries with sanctions and coercive measures and the cutting of trade relations and the subsidies provided for in the various EU guiding financing mechanisms;"
"â¢ abolishing the right of veto in the sectors of policing and judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"Conclusion for the peoples: the more the ÎU cites democratic rights, the more aggressive it becomes."
"The more it appears to distance itself from the USA, the more closely it cooperates in order to strike countries and grassroots movements."
"Time has told us in Europe that 11 September was not an isolated act and that the United States was not the only target of terrorism."
"The fact that we have understood this, albeit as a result of tragic events, is a sign that we understand the world around us."
"What needs to be done in external policy in order to enhance our security in the face of the terrorist threat is to promote not only peace but also economic development."
"That alone is not enough, however."
"The key issue is combating radicalism."
"After all, it is not our freedom, economic development, modernity or the mere existence of Western culture that feeds terrorism; it is radicalism."
"We must not let the 'white man's burden' obscure reality."
"Radicalism must be combated by promoting women's rights, by increasing trade and economic relations, by developing the economy and by fostering democracy; in a nutshell, by promoting the presence around us of more liberal societies."
"It is also necessary, at the same time, to invest immediately in security, including efficient intelligence services that are equipped to face the new realities, and to be prepared to use military means when this is useful, necessary and legitimate."
"in writing. Conservatives strongly support robust counter-terrorism measures and the protection of genuine human rights, which should not be abused, as a first line of defence for terrorists."
"The report contains some useful elements, calling for closer cooperation between EU Member States and external allies like the US, Japan and Australia, an investigation into charities linked to money laundering and terrorist financing, and universal ratification of the 16 UN instruments on combating terrorism."
"However, too much of the report is devoted to extending the role and competences of the EU."
"It not only refers to the draft European constitution but encourages the EU to implement more treaty provisions relating to the European Security and Defence Policy, which is seriously flawed."
"We oppose proposals to remove the national veto in areas of police and judicial cooperation, a violation of national sovereignty that would leave the UK even less able to control its borders and defend its integrity."
"The report makes only one mention of NATO, seemingly as an afterthought."
"For all these reasons Conservatives abstained on this report."
"(PL) Mr President, Europe's economy is experiencing a period of growth."
"This has led to lower unemployment, improved public finances and a reduction in the average budget deficit."
"It should be emphasised that labour productivity has risen, and this has made us more competitive."
"I believe it is appropriate to point out to the House that these positive economic trends emerged following the enlargement of the European Union."
"Low economic development was a feature of all of the 10 new countries which joined the Union in May 2004."
"A more detailed study reveals that economic growth was significantly higher in the countries which liberalised their labour market and opened it up to the flow of workers from the new countries."
"It may therefore confidently be stated that enlargement of the Union benefited both the old Fifteen and the new Ten."
"It is to be hoped that the accession of Bulgaria and Romania will prove a further positive stimulus to the Union's economic growth."
"The purpose of the report before us is to square the circle - to tackle the economic and social problems faced by the Union whilst developing the existing economic policies and instruments that lie at the root of those problems."
"The report does acknowledge that over the past six years, since the introduction of the euro and the Lisbon Strategy, there has been weak economic growth, stagnation and even recession in some Member States, including Portugal."
"It recognises that economic recovery cannot be taken for granted, that unemployment remains high (17 million in the EU) and that poverty has gone up 2 percentage points. It also considers it unacceptable that there are almost 80 million poor people in the EU."
"Moreover, it acknowledges weak internal demand and the need for greater investment."
"It contradicts itself, however, when it says that the euro and the internal market have been crucial victories for European progress, and promotes monetary policy (wage moderation), the deregulation of the labour market (flexicurity) and the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Reading between the lines, we can see its true purpose - to create a climate that is most favourable to entrepreneurial activity."
"The current economic and social policy guidelines pursued by the EU have been championed again and the contradictions of the social democrats and their role in liberal capitalism have been laid bare."
"in writing. (SV) This report contains no analysis of what may need to be harmonised at EU level."
"It is based on assumptions the truth of which needs to be demonstrated."
"The objective is all but total control of economic policy at EU level."
"It is asserted without a shred of evidence that EMU has strengthened the European economy."
"Experience suggests, rather, that the single currency has been downright damaging in relation to stabilising the economy and has had few positive structural effects."
"The rapporteur demands more money from the Community budget for the Lisbon Strategy."
"That is absurd."
"What is required is that the Member States in fact behave in accordance with what they properly understand to be their own interests."
"There is no reason for trying to get other countries to fund them out of common budget resources."
"The report shows no understanding at all of the value of the Member States having so far avoided control from above and therefore being able to look for new directions in economic policy."
"At the same time, the rapporteur continually points out that certain countries succeed much better than others in various areas."
"The fact that he can indicate these differences and draw conclusions about what is obviously best practice is due to the fact that we have not implemented the standardisation and extreme control from the top for which he appeals."
"The report indicates a very dangerous route for economic policy in Europe."
"We have therefore voted against it."
"in writing. (PL) This report has been carefully prepared."
"It provides an overview of the state of the European economy based on a good deal of statistical data."
"It makes it possible to identify trends in the development of the Europe of 27 Member States and trends in the new countries."
"There is also a commentary explaining the relevant reasons. I would emphasise the significance of internal demand and export for economic growth."
"The report contains many important elements for assessing the impact of external factors, such as the economic situation in the United States, the price of oil and the euro-dollar exchange rate."
"Another strong argument in favour of the report is the large measure of agreement on its content within the committee."
"Credit for this is due to the rapporteur."
"in writing. (SV) With its focus on traditional growth policy, the report is old-fashioned and behind the times."
"It makes a casually optimistic assessment of the euro and is unbalanced in the way that it sings the praises of the internal market."
"At the same time, parts of the report are critical of the EU and recognise increasing wage differences, greater poverty and the advantages of the Scandinavian model."
"The report contains continued demands for forced liberalisation of the energy market, yet at the same time sets out demands for investment and a tax policy that favour renewable energy."
"There are, then, both positive and negative aspects to the report."
"I am therefore abstaining in the final vote."
"I voted in favour of this outstanding report on a most important, relevant and topical issue."
"Measures to reverse the current trend of Europe's increasing dependency on imported energy supply must be taken, for example by encouraging investment in renewable energy sources, enabling us to meet the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol."
"As a matter of urgency, a global strategy must be drawn up leading to reduced energy consumption, in particular in the transport sector, which is responsible for 56% of oil consumption in Europe."
"Higher oil prices, which have hit almost USD 80 per barrel, appear to be a structural phenomenon that is here to stay."
"Unlike the oil crises of the 1970s, which were caused by a breakdown in supplies, the current 'crisis' has arisen, on the one hand, from increased demand on the part of developing countries such as China and India, and of the biggest consumer in the world, the United States, and, on the other, from predictions that this 'finite' resource will be in short supply in the medium term."
"Living with higher oil prices worsens recession and balance of payments difficulties, results in higher production costs, inflation and interest rates, penalises families on low incomes and causes wars over control of the oil supply, as in Iraq."
"If technological solutions can contribute towards increasing energy efficiency, and towards finding new forms of fuel and energy, it is vital that we change the capitalist mode of production, which causes waste and inefficiency."
"The answer lies in reducing GDP energy intensity, in promoting high-quality public rail transport and in promoting production for local markets."
"Whilst the rapporteur has put forward some welcome proposals, we cannot accept the creation of an internal market for energy and the liberalisation that goes with that."
"in writing. (SV) The June List believes that rising energy prices are best adjusted to at national level."
"We are therefore sceptical about this opinion-soliciting resolution from the European Parliament."
"For example, paragraph 20 of the draft report regrets the lack of an energy regulator in the EU."
"Bureaucratisation and control from the top are, as always, the only way proposed by Parliament."
"We believe that the Member States should exercise the regulatory function themselves as long as there is no question of cross-border risks of the type associated with nuclear power."
"If such risks do exist, the regulatory body should, however, be the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency."
"The EU countries should agree on certain energy targets."
"How these are achieved should be left up to the individual Member States."
"Otherwise, the report contains both helpful and unhelpful wordings."
"We have chosen to vote against the report in the final vote, since it does not form part of any legislative process and carries little weight and because, in our view, it makes no difference to the debate in the Member States on these issues."
"Although the report stresses the impact of oil price increase on the transport sector, which is responsible for 56% of total oil consumption, it is a great pity that it makes no reference to other sectors, such as fisheries."
"Fuel prices have hit the fisheries sector particularly badly. Its operating margins and economic viability have been significantly affected, thus exacerbating the socio-economic crisis in the sector."
"Between 2004 and 2006 alone, the price of fuel went up by around 100%, and in some parts of the sector fuel accounts for some 50% of total operating costs."
"Fishermen have seen their incomes go down, which is particularly serious as the sector is mainly concentrated in regions with fragile economies."
"Various studies warn of the risk of thousands of fishing businesses and thousands of jobs disappearing on account of fuel price rises."
"Urgent, extraordinary measures must therefore be taken to support the sector, for example the creation of a guarantee fund, with Community participation, in order to stabilise fuel prices."
"Until such time as that fund is put in place, the fishing businesses affected must be granted some form of temporary compensation."
"(PT) I voted in favour of the report by Mr dos Santos because I agree with the principles, the analysis and the proposals it contains. I also voted in favour because the broader debate engendered by this report, both inside and outside Parliament, has helped to clarify the issues for the general public and to ensure that experts and politicians are better informed."
"I was able to use this report in a paper on geopolitics and energy that I gave in Ankara at the EU/Turkey Parliamentary Committee."
"Furthermore, I had the honour of taking part in a seminar in Lisbon organised by Mr dos Santos, where I chaired two panels. At the conference, the report was discussed in great detail with high-level personalities, experts and interested members of the public."
"The debate on energy issues must go on and must go further."
"Mr dos Santos's report is a positive contribution to that debate."
"in writing. The high cost of oil has significant adverse effects on businesses and families in Scotland, where there is still substantial dependence upon road transportation of goods and passengers, due to a lack of realistic alternatives in large areas of rural Scotland, and due to the distances involved in transporting goods to mainland European markets."
"The situation in Scotland is worsened by the fact that the UK Government imposes very high taxation levels on road fuels, further disadvantaging Scots traders and travellers."
"I supported the Dos Santos report, which rightly identifies the need to prioritise development of renewable energy sources and improving energy efficiency."
"Scotland has considerable potential to contribute to such developments."
"We also have in Scotland a significant offshore oil and gas resources, and it is essential that we maintain a set of economic circumstances which will encourage exploration and full extraction of that resource."
"My belief is that an independent Scottish government would ensure that all of Scotland's energy resource potential can be maximised."
"(MT) The economic impact of the increase in oil prices is considerably greater in situations such as that of Malta, which is a country wholly dependent on oil as its energy source."
"This is a problem that has never been addressed with the urgency it deserves, despite the fact that a country of Malta's size lends itself more easily to the development of creative alternatives."
"If our limited space does not allow us to build large alternative energy plants, then fiscal incentives must be made available to those businesses and families that want to invest in cleaner energy technology."
"Due to a lack of planning in the area of oil purchasing, Maltese and Gozitan families and businesses now have to pay a surcharge on their electricity bills, which currently stands at 45%."
"This surcharge on services that are so essential is proving to be a financial burden on families, especially those in the lower income bracket, and is giving rise to extra costs for companies - a development that in turn is putting pressure on the cost of living."
"Worse, this continuous fluctuation in prices makes it difficult for individuals to plan ahead, and this leads to uncertainty."
"What is even worse is that, while people are asked to pay extra for indispensable services, there is an unjustified waste of public resources."
"The European Parliament's recommendations indicate long-term solutions to the problem."
"However, governments too should plan ahead in order to be able to cope with problems such as these and not expect their mistakes to be paid for by workers, families and small businesses."
"The impact of the current increase in oil prices is highly significant for a European economy showing only weak signs of recovery."
"Its effect in lowering GDP growth, employment levels and investment, as well as the different energy dependency levels in the EU Member States make our task all the more difficult."
"The social consequences are thus easy to predict, given that accommodation and transport are the top two items of expenditure for European families: inequality in purchasing power will inevitably increase."
"It is clear, therefore, how important it is to complete the internal market in energy, to increase competitiveness and to boost investment in alternative energy sources."
"It is necessary to guarantee that freedom of movement remains a pillar of European growth, and it is therefore vital to ensure that European mobility is not affected, and that social exclusion and the impoverishment of the most vulnerable members of society do not result."
"The European energy supply crisis can only be mitigated effectively by means of a global EU strategy aimed at the gradual reduction in oil dependency, the development and production of alternative fuels, including looking into the nuclear option, and innovative solutions to managing transport systems as a whole."
"in writing. On behalf of the EPLP we support the broad principles and thrust of this report given that it deals with a very urgent problem facing the European Union."
"The problem is oil price shocks caused by major disruptions to oil supply, whilst at the same time demand grows across the world for this increasingly scarce resource."
"However, we would disagree that there is a need for tax harmonisation on this issue."
"Whilst many of the recommendations from the rapporteur are completely acceptable and while the UK may practise the essential elements of the tax regime proposed already, we do not believe it is the role of the EU to set a rate of taxes in Member States."
"That concludes voting time."

"Dialogue between the Chinese government and Envoys of the Dalai Lama (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Envoys of the Dalai Lama."
"author. - (NL) Mr President, it is no good thing that the world at large should have accepted for so long China's conception of Tibet as an integral part of itself."
"The Tibetans embody their own culture in inhospitable living conditions, isolated and high up in the mountains."
"For a long time, China has been unable to resist the temptation to consider that region as a fall-back that can absorb sections of its own very large population."
"This is a problem not only for the people of Tibet, but also for those of the neighbouring and more readily accessible region of Xinjiang, home to the Uighurs, who are related to the Turkic-speaking peoples, such as the Kazaks, Kyrgyzs and Uzbeks."
"They fear becoming minorities in their own countries and losing everything that is dear to them."
"Moreover, we should certainly not idealise the traditional living conditions of Tibetans and Uighurs."
"Although sweeping changes are called for, these changes should not be imposed from outside or, what is more, serve outside interests."
"Since China is the world's most populated country and an up-and-coming economic power, it is extremely unlikely that Tibet will be given the opportunity to develop into an independent state."
"This makes it all the more important that, 50 years after the major conflict, there should be a reconciliation in which, within China, the Tibetans are allowed to retain the most valuable traits of their individuality and they no longer run the risk of becoming the victim of state violence."
"These days, the progress ideology that has dominated China for nearly 60 years is mainly focused on economic growth."
"Although this has drawbacks, it does offer more scope for tolerance and recognition of diversity than was the case for a long time."
"A dialogue or cultural individuality and self-governance within China should pay off."
"My group is in favour of anything that can contribute to this dialogue and to peaceful solutions."
"author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe simply to join in the request, directed primarily towards the Chinese regime, to resume dialogue - and let us not forget that this request is also addressed to our European institutions."
"As the European Parliament, in the past we have made the proposal that a special representative be appointed to deal with the issue of Tibet, but we know that the proposal has so far not been implemented."
"In my view, this would be a useful and tangible contribution."
"There are also other instruments, such as a declaration by the Presidency of the European Union."
"I hope that the discussion and the debate will not be restricted to a mere invitation to the Chinese regime, since this request is also of direct concern, at the highest levels, to the institutions of the European Union."
"We should not be afraid of this."
"This Parliament has shown that it is not naively utopian in urging the importance of political and commercial relations with the Chinese regime."
"In this Chamber, nobody wishes to deny the real significance of such relations; nor is there any need, however, to commit the opposite error, and that is to 'poison' a line of action that is clearly highly popular, not within the institutions but with the people."
"The Tibet issue and support for dialogue are matters which enjoy the support of the people of Europe."
"For that reason, excessive timidity deriving from other motivations should not be allowed to influence the current debate, attention to human rights or the resumption of dialogue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all of you for attending this debate on Tibet - particularly now that we have reached an important point, with solutions to a problem that has been smouldering away for decades within reach."
"This is only the case, however, if the Chinese Government, too, stops deliberately raising certain issues as stumbling blocks."
"For example, it is unacceptable to put the spotlight on the history issue; that is, to ask whether or not Tibet was ever part of China."
"This is completely the wrong question to ask."
"Instead we must look to the future."
"We have to keep repeating that the Dalai Lama and the Tibetans themselves are striving for autonomy - and not just on paper - allowing them cultural and religious freedom and access to education."
"They are not questioning the 'one China' policy."
"This must be emphasised time and again, even if the solicitations from the Chinese Embassy that many of my fellow Members have no doubt received in recent days tell a quite different story."
"I can tell you that we know how things stand."
"We need dialogue, and we want this dialogue."
"Europe must support it - I fully agree with the previous speaker on this."
"Europe must bring this dialogue into much sharper focus and also conduct it at official level."
"author. - Mr President, the dialogue between the Government of China and the representatives of the Dalai Lama is to be warmly welcomed and should continue to receive our approval and support."
"Only through forward-looking dialogue will pragmatic solutions be found that will meet the aspirations of the Tibetan people and fully respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity."
"Let us always keep in mind that the 'one China' policy is a long-standing EU position."
"Our support is undeniable, but we should also ensure that this support becomes practical."
"Such practical support should be offered in the context of the new partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and China."
"Personally, I do not support the idea of a special representative for Tibet because we already have enough means in our hands to facilitate such a dialogue."
"China has an enormously positive role to play in world affairs."
"Just one example: China made a vital contribution to the success of the six-party talks on North Korea just yesterday."
"We can use this as an example and as a lesson."
"If China can make a positive contribution through structured dialogue to regional peace and stability, then we can also engage China in a dialogue which will help to create a climate of confidence that will allow for a pragmatic solution to the Tibet issue."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, on 26 October 2006 the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning the shooting of unarmed women and children in the Nangpa-la pass."
"We also called for those responsible for this crime to be punished."
"The incident caused an outcry the world over, but to no avail, as the situation in the region remains unchanged."
"It is true that no reports of further brutal murders have reached us recently, but this does not mean that the situation has improved."
"It seems to me that little has changed in this age-old conflict during the three months that have elapsed since our last debate."
"We must be consistent, however, and bear the rights of the 6 million people affected by the problems in the region uppermost in our minds."
"This is a region where human rights are still constantly violated, even in the 21st century."
"In my view, this problem should be a priority for the new President of the European Parliament and therefore, ladies and gentlemen, for us all."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, what good are bilateral talks if they do not produce any tangible results?"
"Do they mask an inability to act, or do they at least contribute to confidence-building?"
"Parliament is rightly calling for the resumption of the dialogue, last conducted one year ago, between the representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government."
"Items on the agenda should include the elimination of reprisals, an end to human rights violations, and tangible measures to guarantee the Tibetan population cultural and religious autonomy."
"The dialogue was launched in September 2002."
"China has been blocking it for 12 months."
"The grounds are always the same: preconditions are to be met; the Dalai Lama is not interested in improving relations, and is striving for Tibetan independence."
"This is simply not true."
"For years, His Holiness has been interested not in an independent state, but in Tibetan autonomy."
"There are good examples of this kind of legal status even in the EU."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats stands by four positions, as do almost all other groupings in this House. Firstly, an EU Special Representative for Tibet must be appointed."
"It is insufficient that this issue be relegated to the fringe of EU-China dialogue."
"Secondly, we want the Commission to make Tibet an integral part of the EU-China Partnership and Cooperation Framework Agreement."
"We ask that the Commission inform Parliament of progress and retrogression."
"Thirdly, the Council should include in its annual report information on current developments with regard to the China-Tibet dialogue."
"Fourthly, the EU should draw up joint strategies with its partners in the world, particularly the USA."
"It is my fervent hope that the representatives of the People's Republic of China understand the desire of the international community - as just expressed by my fellow Members - for China to resume this dialogue with the Tibetans at long last."
"After all, China's representatives are most preoccupied with good press in the run-up to the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing."
"I believe that today's debates on the dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama's representatives are particularly important for a number of reasons, but above all, because on 17 January this year negotiations officially started in Beijing toward a new agreement on the basics of partnership and cooperation between the European Union and China."
"More than once we have expressed support for the commitment of the Government of the PRC and His Holiness the Dalai Lama to resolve the issue of Tibet by means of dialogue."
"I think the European Parliament, which in the past has adopted more than one resolution on Tibet, on the human rights situation in the People's Republic of China and likewise on dialogue between the PRC and the Dalai Lama's representatives, must urge the European Council, the Commission and European Union member countries to actively support the intensifying of this dialogue and to seek a result."
"While no tangible results have yet been obtained in the resolution of these basic questions, Parliament should - in consultation with both parties - evaluate what further role the EU can play in seeking to facilitate a solution of the Tibet issue by means of negotiation, and it should appoint a special European Union envoy to Tibet."
"I support the position of the resolution we are considering that the Senior Commissioner and the Council's Secretary-General be encouraged to include information about progress on the dialogue between the PRC and representatives of His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 2007 and also in later years in the Annual Report to Parliament on General International and Security Policy."
"I think the country currently presiding over the Council - Germany - could initiate and accept a declaration that would show how the European Union might assist in achieving a peaceful resolution of the Tibet question through negotiation."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank Mr Thomas Mann and other colleagues who initiated the resolution being considered today."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, the question of Tibet's status is raised in the European Parliament several times a year."
"So far, however, the resolutions we have adopted have not led to any tangible results."
"The same is unfortunately also true of the consultations that have been taking place between the Tibetans and the Chinese Government since 2002."
"The problem of Tibet remains unresolved."
"In the meantime, over 1 200 000 of the six million Tibetans have lost their lives under the Chinese occupation that began in 1951."
"Every year, some 3 000 inhabitants of Tibet flee their country. These are mainly children and young people, who can only obtain a Tibetan education abroad."
"The Tibetan people are discriminated against in every area of social life, from education through to social care, work, living conditions and religion."
"We must act in solidarity and exert pressure on the Chinese Government, so that the dialogue is resumed as soon as possible and the status of Tibet regulated."
"The European Commission should raise the matter of discussions with the Dalai Lama during negotiations on the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between China and the Union."
"For its part, the Council should define the Union's role in resolving the Tibet issue, as the outcome of the negotiations between China and Tibet should be reflected in the Council's annual report to Parliament on the implementation of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the problem of Tibet has been with us for many years and, as has already been mentioned, this House has dealt with different aspects relating to this problem many times in the past."
"In essence, the core issue of dispute between the people of Tibet and China has been the wish of the Tibetans for self-determination, as opposed to the Chinese Government's fear of a possible domino effect leading to the break-up of China."
"In fact, such a problem has been the commonest cause of disputes worldwide."
"However, history has shown that by far the best and most effective way to solve such problems is through peaceful and open negotiations with a prerequisite determination on the part of all concerned to find a lasting solution."
"The alternative way - that of endless confrontation and bloodshed - usually leads nowhere and is, in most cases, to the detriment of both sides."
"With this in mind, we would warmly welcome a commitment by both the Government of China, in particular, and the Dalai Lama to resolve the Tibet question through a process of dialogue, and wholeheartedly hope that such a process, if brought about, will lead to a successful resolution of the Tibetan problem."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Despite the fact that since 2002 there have been five rounds of dialogue between the Government of the People's Republic of China and representatives of the Dalai Lama, it is abundantly clear that there are fundamental differences standing in the way of reaching a definitive agreement that clarifies the situation of Tibet in a way that is satisfactory to all of the parties, while at the same time being fair and proper, particularly for the people of Tibet."
"Nevertheless, I am one of those who believe that the responsibility of each of the two parties for the fact that an agreement has not been reached cannot be compared."
"The Dalai Lama, as the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, has demonstrated his desire for dialogue and agreement on more than one occasion, and he has even given up his demand for complete independence in favour of a genuine autonomy that guarantees respect for the ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious identity of Tibet."
"In this regard, I believe that it is the Chinese Government that should show greater signs of willingness and at least accept a resumption of dialogue with a view to reaching a good final agreement."
"I would therefore urge the European Commission, the Council and the Member States to take every possible opportunity to support a new round of dialogue between China and Tibet."
"In particular, as others have said, it is essential that we take advantage of the negotiations of a framework agreement on European Union-China cooperation, which began on 17 January, to express the Community's commitment to dialogue and a fair and lasting solution to the issue of Tibet."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, it is often the case that different standards are applied to China, where human rights are concerned, than to countries where lucrative contracts are unlikely to materialise."
"It is very unfortunate that the rule in these situations seems to be that of Erst das Fressen und dann die Moral."
"When reading the relevant resolutions, which reflect not only the positions of the different groups in connection with this dialogue, but also the stance of official Europe, I, as a Fleming, do have some reservations."
"Politicians who, yesterday and the day before that, while discussing the Fava report, brandished international law and insisted on human rights - which they were right to do - are now suddenly talking about the need to respect China's sovereignty, whilst not breathing a word about the illegal occupation and subsequent annexation of Tibet, about the mass human rights violations, the ever increasing exclusion of the Tibetans from their local government, or the Namdrang Rangdrik programme, launched in 2005, whereby Tibetans are forced to demolish their houses and subsequently rebuild them according to strict official guidelines."
"The sanctimonious line is that a mutually acceptable solution must be found for Tibet's future."
"To say that is to make victim and executioner equal partners in dialogue."
"It became once again evident on whose side the EU is when in November 2005, the Chinese President, Hu Jintao, was received with much pomp and circumstance across Europe, yet it had, in fact, been he who perpetrated serious human rights violations when he was Secretary of Tibet's Communist Party between December 1988 and March 1992."
"The Tibet issue once again demonstrates that European rhetoric all too often amounts to nothing but moral wrapping paper and that in reality, only economic interests matter."
"We must continue to have the courage to denounce the cowardice and sanctimoniousness of this Europe, of this mercantile Europe that chooses to side with the oppressors to the detriment of innocent peoples."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, thank you for your very strong commitment to human rights."
"I trust the honourable Members have noticed the same strong focus on fundamental human rights and universal values in the recent Commission communication and in the Council conclusions on China."
"This reflects the fact that it is and will remain an important priority for the European Union with regard to our overall relations with that country."
"We share the concern expressed in the joint resolution regarding the human rights situation in Tibet and, in particular, the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people."
"This issue has been regularly addressed by the European Union in the framework of bilateral dialogue on human rights, as well as at the highest political level, such as our bilateral summits and senior officials' meetings."
"Former European Parliament President, Mr Borrell, also raised the matter when he officially visited China last year."
"With regard to the recent shooting mentioned by Mr Czarnecki, I would like to inform you that this matter was formally taken up by the European Union during the last session of the EU-China Dialogue on human rights held in Beijing in October 2006 and via the subsequent follow-up dÃ©marche in December 2006."
"On both occasions, the EU urged the Chinese authorities to undertake a thorough investigation of this incident and refuted the Chinese claim that the shooting had been done in self-defence."
"We will follow this serious matter closely."
"I agree with Mr Matsakis that bloodshed leads nowhere."
"The Commission has regularly kept this Chamber informed regarding its overall policy vis-Ã -vis Tibet and will continue to do so."
"As Commissioner Fischer Boel underlined in this Chamber in October 2006, the EU has consistently taken the view that establishing a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities is the only realistic way to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the question of Tibet, which will hopefully lead to the recognition of a genuine autonomy of the Tibetan region."
"We have therefore followed very closely and welcomed the five rounds of talks which have taken place up to now between the Special Envoys of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government."
"In this respect, EU officials have regular contacts with the two Special Envoys, the last being in November 2006."
"Even in this Chamber there are differing opinions on the question of the appointment of a special EU envoy."
"We have our doubts about the value of such an appointment, because such an envoy would probably be prevented from having a real impact on the ground or from playing a significant role in this dialogue."
"We need the two sides to continue and deepen the dialogue."
"We agree with the honourable Members that this dialogue should be regular and substantive, and that the respective parties should refrain from taking any step that would compromise the establishment of a climate of confidence."
"We take note that the Tibetan side is ready for a rapid resumption of the dialogue and hope that the Chinese side is willing to do the same."
"The European Union will spare no efforts in stressing the importance of this dialogue to both parties on all possible occasions."
"I also want to express my gratitude for your attention and focus on this matter and your support, especially now via this resolution, because such support is helpful in the process."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"Written statements (Article 142)"
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, first I wish to express my thanks for this motion for a joint resolution."
"I believe that it is sound, impartial and relevant."
"Constructive solutions need to be found for this age-old issue of Tibet."
"The motion for a resolution is geared towards finding a solution to the Tibet question which is compatible with China's right to self-determination and which respects the rights of the people of Tibet, and this, I think, is the right approach."
"We need a constructive, peaceful process that recognises that Tibetan nationals have a right to their own culture and religion."
"As citizens of Europe and of the world, we have to ensure that people's fundamental rights can be implemented around the world."
"In this respect it is to be hoped that people's cultural and religious rights will not be restricted in Tibet either."
"We would hope that proper dialogue can be established between Tibet and China, leading to a solution that is satisfactory to both sides."
"I hope that we will find practical solutions which also show respect for China's regional inviolability but which at the same time fulfil the wishes of the Tibetan people."
"I do not know if this is too much to hope for, but we in the European Union must work hard to establish such a peaceful coexistence."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order."
"As we have often complained about the Council's absence from our Thursday afternoon debates on human rights, I would like to point out that, today, the German Presidency is represented, and in the person of its spokesman on human rights Mr Nooke, who was at one time a civil rights activist in the former German Democratic Republic."
"This is something of a sensation."
"It is one that gives us pleasure, and I would be very happy if, during the trilogue, we could bring pressure to bear to ensure that this becomes something of a dependable tradition, that is to say, that the presence of the Council - Mr Nooke is here as an observer today - becomes a fixture in these Thursday afternoon human rights debates in future."
"In any event, Mr Nooke, many thanks for joining us here today."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr Posselt's contribution was not a point of order, but we agree entirely with him."
"2."
"Humanitarian situation of refugees from Iraq (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the humanitarian situation of refugees from Iraq."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, although this resolution on the situation of refugees from and in Iraq is a very sound one, it is silent on the central issue, namely the reasons why there are refugees in and from Iraq."
"The primary reason is the occupation of Iraq by troops from the US, the UK and other EU Member States, and, above all, the nature of that occupation."
"If you pursue a policy of occupation of this nature, you should not be surprised when it generates refugees."
"Despite Germany's restrictive asylum policy, people from Iraq now form the largest group of asylum-seekers in that country."
"According to figures from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are 1.7 million refugees within Iraq and a further 2 million in neighbouring countries."
"These people are fleeing because Iraq is in a state of war."
"The Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins University have presented a study, published in the New York Times and the Washington Post, which estimated the number of Iraqis over and above the normal mortality rate who died as a result of the invasion and its consequences between March 2003 and July 2006 to be 650 000."
"Of these, the estimates count 600 000 people who have died as a direct result of violence and 50 000 who have died as a result of disease and other causes."
"The study goes on to say that, after the end of the invasion, 31% of the victims were believed to have been killed by coalition troops or air raids."
"According to the Johns Hopkins University, the risk of dying a violent death is 58 times higher than before the invasion."
"What I want to say to this House is that these figures show that the occupation of Iraq is wrong and must finally be brought to an end."
"The collective support of this war by a number of EU Member States, including Germany, must cease."
"If that happened, there would not, in fact, be as many people who have to flee as there are at present, as has been quite properly stated in the resolution."
"author. - Mr President, my thanks to colleagues for initiating this important debate."
"I cannot agree with the point made by the previous speaker, which was not discussed when we framed this report."
"May I say that what we can do in the European Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament is something different."
"There are huge numbers of Iraqi refugees in Jordan, in Syria and in other neighbouring states, yet in almost every one of those countries these refugees are not allowed to work."
"Their children are prevented from going to school."
"Their parents and children are not allowed access to healthcare."
"They are in a desperate plight and there is no state support for them, as there would be were they in European Union Member States as refugees."
"Inside the country there are huge numbers of IDPs - internally displaced people - equally without work, without food, far from their homes."
"They have been displaced mainly through religious and ethnic cleansing, one of the most miserable of wars to fight internally, as we know so well from our past history in Europe."
"The Shia are fleeing the Sunni, the Sunni are fleeing the Shia and many others are fleeing because of the various different insurgencies that are going on."
"I would suggest, therefore, that the European Commission, which has worked mightily on this problem, should declare Iraq an emergency."
"I would ask the Council of Ministers, which has also worked incredibly hard with the Government of Iraq, to discuss this with the Commission and with other G8 donors, for example."
"Iraq has in a sense been put on one side."
"People have been unclear as to what to do, but today, now, the Iraqi people are back in the sort of crisis they were in under the prolonged dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, under whom many more fled and under whom many more were killed."
"But here we are."
"They need our help."
"I strongly request that the Commission and the Council of Ministers declare Iraq to be in an emergency state, to mobilise donor funding and spend it accordingly: housing inside, aid outside."
"There is a lot that we can do, but we have to look at the situation differently."
"author. - Mr President, this unhappy debate takes note of the oh-so-predictable humanitarian disaster which has afflicted the people of Iraq since the coalition invaded illegally."
"It also demonstrates the double standards of our own Member State governments, particularly, I am afraid, my own in London, rather than Edinburgh, where I would rather it were."
"Chancellor Gordon Brown was asked how much funding was to be allocated to the military action and his answer was 'as much as it takes'."
"I am afraid the financial allocation to the humanitarian support measures is shameful."
"As we have heard, the United Nations estimates that 1.8 million people have been forcibly displaced within Iraq and 2 million have fled that unhappy country."
"That is more than the population of a number of our Member States."
"Prime Minister Blair worries about international terrorism - he talks about it often enough."
"Well he might!"
"The direct result of his policies has created the best possible recruiting ground al-Qa'ida could ever have asked for."
"So, what to do?"
"As we, of course, go through airport security this evening flying home from this place, let us think that that is Prime Minister Blair's legacy to Europe and to global politics."
"We, as we have heard, can do better: by sticking to our principles and by digging deep into our budgets."
"The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Red Cross efforts are severely underfunded."
"The countries neighbouring Iraq are in desperate straits and in dire need of support."
"This motion has a number of points in it which I commend to the House."
"We did not create this disaster, but we are in a position to ameliorate its effects."
"By doing so, I hope we can lead by example where so many of our Member State governments have so comprehensively failed."
"author. - (PT) Mr President, the text that we are submitting today for Parliament's approval very much reflects the fact that this situation can only be described as a human tragedy of massive proportions."
"I should like to thank the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr AntÃ³nio Guterres, for drawing attention to this disaster, which took place on 7 February."
"I should also like to give a special word of commendation to the Swedish authorities for their exceptional European-level response to the human disaster."
"I should particularly like to commend the Egyptian authorities, which is the non-bordering country that has done by far the most to welcome these refugees, and I should like to make a heartfelt plea to the Egyptian authorities not to prevent these refugees from arriving or to suspend the conditions for hosting them when they arrive."
"Most of all, however, I wish to call on the Commission and the Council - as Mr Posselt, who is here today, so aptly reminded us - to open their eyes, to go to Iraq and to see what is happening there."
"A disaster of this nature would never be possible unless it were organised from somewhere, as was the case previously in Rwanda and in the Balkans."
"We can no longer turn a blind eye; we must go to Iraq and understand what is happening."
"In this connection, I should like to say that I am proud that I was there recently."
"I have drawn up a report and invite all my fellow Members to have a look at it on the Internet."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, I do not wish to speak about politics."
"Mr Casaca has just recalled the political context of the invasion of Iraq and its consequences."
"He may well be right."
"I would prefer to focus on issues that may not be as important for journalists or for politicians like ourselves, but which are probably far more important for those who are currently going through hard times in Iraq, namely the refugees."
"In my view, the underlying reasons for events in the world of politics are of secondary importance."
"What is really important is what we can actually do."
"I am firmly convinced that we are currently being perceived as helpless by the rest of the world."
"I am also firmly convinced that the European Union is not in a position to provide real help to these people."
"This is even truer of the United States, and is really tragic."
"There seem to be two aspects to the situation in Iraq."
"There are the victims of attacks, in the form of the hundreds and thousands of people we see on our television screens."
"They make up the news we are bombarded with. We hear very little, however, about the other aspect of the situation in Iraq, namely the tens of thousands of refugees."
"The European Union must certainly not appear helpless in this regard, and I agree with the previous speakers who referred to initiatives by the Scandinavian countries and to Egypt's role."
"All that is true."
"We must make a clear and determined statement to the effect that we are interested not only in that first aspect, namely the victims of the attacks we see on television. We must let it be known that, as Europeans, as European politicians, we are equally concerned about refugees."
"The refugee problem is probably one of the greatest embarrassments for those who started this war and for those who are pursuing it, even if they are acting with the best of intentions."
"A reaction is therefore necessary, and that is what the European Parliament is currently engaged in."
"I am grateful for the wise words contributed by other speakers today."
"author. - (FI) Mr President, behind the Iraqi refugee problem is a set of circumstances the like of which it is predicted will only become more common in various future conflicts."
"The situation has reached a state of civil war."
"The Christian minority in particular have become a scapegoat, and many Christians have been killed."
"Iraqi security forces have been unable to protect Christians, no matter what the Government's attitude is."
"For example, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon have taken it upon themselves to place refugees temporarily."
"In these countries, the United Nations refugee agency has not been able to confer refugee status on incoming Iraqis during the current conflict because the situation does not meet the criteria of the Geneva Convention."
"The present Government in Iraq is not persecuting Christians, but the problem is that sects inside the country are, and the Government cannot do anything about it."
"International agreements therefore do not grant refugee status to Iraqi Christians, although there is no doubt that they are in need of temporary protection."
"To protect the asylum seekers, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has not made a negative decision with regard to them either, since otherwise the host country could return them to Iraq, a situation which the UNHCR wants to avoid."
"Accordingly, it is vitally important that the international community responds to the agency's appeal for more international support."
"To aid the refugees, international assistance is required so that Iraq's neighbouring countries, which are struggling with huge numbers of refugees, will not close their borders to Iraqis."
"The latest news that the United States of America is accepting more refugees is a step in the right direction, and is vital, because earlier the United States had been shirking its responsibilities in this area."
"We need more news like this."
"Of the EU countries, Sweden deserves special mention."
"The Iraqi refugee situation is absolutely desperate."
"There is a shortage of everything: food, medicines, health care and fuel."
"I heard of actual examples of this when the human rights organisation I head met a group of Iraqi Christian refugees in Turkey last autumn."
"Crucial, however, to the assistance of Iraqis is to establish comprehensive reforms to promote justice and the law throughout Iraq."
"Similarly, the Iraqi Government must do all it can to bring those guilty of crimes and breaches of human rights to justice."
"This is essential if the unrest and violence against minorities is to cease."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I endorse this resolution, not least because, at least in some of its subsidiary clauses, it vigorously champions the rights of the persecuted and imperilled Christians of Iraq."
"We must bear in mind that the Christian communities in today's Iraq are probably some of the most ancient in the world."
"They have survived for 1 300 years as a minority in a Muslim-dominated part of the world, something for which those Muslims also deserve credit, yet today, in a time of massive Western presence in Iraq, they are under threat."
"This has to do with the fact that Iraq was put together as an artificial state after the First World War, that that state is now on the point of breaking up and that its constituent parts are attempting to make themselves homogenous units through a process of nationalistic self-discovery which, of course, poses a particular threat to the minorities."
"There is one laudable exception, and that is the Kurdish sector. This is something worth highlighting."
"I do, however, call on Shias and Sunnis to follow in the great tolerant tradition of their forefathers and once again afford the Christian communities in Iraq the protection that they have enjoyed in that part of the world for over a thousand years."
"I call, above all, on the Commission to go into bat strongly for the rights of Christians, because who else will do this if we do not?"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, on 8 January, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) issued an urgent call for funding to the donor states for a new USD 60 million aid programme."
"The object is to help hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the conflict in Iraq, irrespective of their faith."
"Such massive movements of fleeing people are the results of a war that was begun against the will of the international community, yet it is the international community that now has to bear, and pay for, the terrible consequences."
"We are currently witnessing the largest long-term exodus since the displacement of the Palestinians in 1948."
"One in eight Iraqis is a refugee."
"In 2006 alone, half a million Iraqis fled their country. Every month, another 50 000 join them."
"There may now be 1.7 million deracinated Iraqis in Iraq. By the end of 2007, the UNHCR estimates this number could be 2.3 million."
"The longer the conflict goes on, the worse will be the plight of these displaced persons and the communities that help them and that want to help them."
"We call on the Member States and the Commission to support the UNHCR, politically and financially, in its work protecting the refugees, irrespective of their faith."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the figures given are more or less in agreement: we are now approaching 4 million refugees, around half of whom are 'external' and the other half 'internal' within Iraq."
"To all intents and purposes this is a humanitarian catastrophe almost without precedent, and for this reason the opportunity offered by the Geneva Conference on 17 April 2007 should not be wasted: the European Union must prepare itself and arrive in force, with a political presence at the highest levels, having already decided on an appropriate amount of funds to put on the table."
"If this is not done, we risk total failure."
"This is a point on which we all need to be united, regardless of the political reasons for the conflict: thus the greatest possible unity is needed to resolve an issue which is liable to explode in our faces, with disastrous consequences."
"With regard to its causes, I believe that perhaps - obviously this is not the subject of our resolution; I am just mentioning it to the representatives of the Council and the Commission - it would be useful to take into consideration the possibility, faced with the daily carnage in Iraq, of referring the matter to the International Criminal Court, since these are crimes against humanity, committed systematically and on a daily basis."
"Perhaps this could also be helpful with regard to the causes of this humanitarian catastrophe."
"Mr President, I too want to focus on the Assyrian Christians who are now seeking refuge mainly in Syria and Jordan."
"Iraq's Christian communities are amongst the world's most ancient, speaking Aramaic, the language of Christ."
"They suffered terribly during the 1915 Armenian genocide, and then again under the Iraqi Hashemite monarchy for cooperating with the British during the First World War."
"Then they suffered again during Saddam Hussein's days when he had the war with the Kurds."
"Today there are only about 6 000 to 8 000 who remain, mainly living in the Nineveh Plain."
"As many as 60 000 Assyrian Christians, or perhaps even more, have fled since the beginning of the insurgency that followed the US-led invasion in 2003."
"Their exodus was accelerated in August 2004 after the start of the terrorist bombing campaign against Christian churches by Islamists, who accused them of collaborating with the allies solely by virtue of their practising the Christian faith."
"Last April the European Parliament voted for the Assyrians to be allowed to establish, on the basis of Section 5 of the Iraqi Constitution, a federal region where they can practise their own unique way of life, free and safe from outside interference."
"I call again on this House, on the Commission and on the Human Rights Special Observer from the German Presidency, for this solution to be considered as a possibility."
"(LT) Every day we hear about bloody explosions in Iraq, and the victim count is growing steadily."
"We do not get enough information though about another tragedy - the painful fate of becoming a refugee has affected 4 million Iraqis."
"Almost one in six of the inhabitants of that country has been forced to leave his or her home, the number of refugees is increasing, and their situation is terrible."
"The United Nations Organisation is trying to help, but unsuccessfully, because the international community has still not grasped the seriousness of the situation."
"The initiative of Sweden, which has agreed to grant refugee status to 9 000 Iraqis, is to be commended."
"Not many EU countries so far, especially the new ones, have had the resolve to follow this example."
"However, particular responsibility falls on the United States, which, willy-nilly, created the current situation, in which Iraq is wading ever deeper into the quagmire of a nation beset by divisive internal and external conflicts."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the emergence of Saddam Hussein in the post-colonial troubled era in Iraq brought a rule of intimidation, persecution and murder of citizens."
"The illegal military invasion and occupation of Iraq undertaken in 2003 by Mr Bush and his British bulldog, Mr Blair, have brought an unprecedented calamity to the people of Iraq."
"The Bush-Blair duo has succeeded in accomplishing in the space of three years what the likes of Saddam Hussein did not succeed in doing for thirty years, i.e. to bring the country completely to its knees, with hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians killed, with utter lawlessness, with comprehensive destruction of the country's infrastructure and with millions of internal and external refugees."
"The USA and Britain could together spend over one thousand billion dollars a year supporting their war machines in Iraq, which largely caused the problem in the first place, but now expect the international community to deal with the enormous humanitarian problem of the Iraq refugees."
"Instead of the USA and Britain taking care of the Iraqi refugees and all the necessary costs involved, they expect neighbouring and European countries to do so."
"Fair enough: we must not deviate from the rule that those who cause a catastrophe very seldom pay for it."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the German Presidency, and warmly welcoming the presence of its representative at today's debate."
"I am delighted the German Ombudsman is with us today."
"According to UN data, almost two million people have left Iraq in recent years because of the danger to their lives, the chaos and the difficult economic conditions."
"We are witnessing a major tragedy of refugees fleeing from Iraq to neighbouring countries."
"There are a million of them in Syria, some 750 000 in Jordan, over 100 000 in Egypt, 40 000 in Lebanon and many more scattered throughout other countries."
"Those Palestinians inside Iraq are in a particularly difficult position."
"In its statement on 2 February 2007, Human Rights Watch called on Syria to immediately open its borders to the Palestinians who are currently in danger in Iraq."
"The UN is calling for a contribution of USD 60 million to a fund to help refugees from Iraq."
"The world cannot remain indifferent to their fate."
"Today's decision by the United States to grant asylum in the United States to 7 000 Iraqis next year is a step in the right direction, as is the decision by the United States to contribute USD 18 million to the programme to assist refugees from Iraq."
"These are still only drops in the ocean of need, however."
"The European Union must play a leading role in the forthcoming conference to be held in Geneva on 17 April 2007."
"It must provide financial support to alleviate the plight of the refugees and help resolve this crisis."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I wish to express my gratitude to the authors of this resolution and to the groups and individuals who have presented their opinions."
"There was a strong focus on the eminent need for solidarity with the people in great need."
"The Commission is also extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Iraq and the scale of human suffering caused by the ongoing violence in that country, the high level of displacement inside and outside Iraq and the impact this is having on the whole region."
"Over the past few months the Commission has kept monitoring the situation, keeping in close contact with other key international players, notably with the Red Cross and the United Nations."
"As you have mentioned, we have the same figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees: 1.8 million people are now internally displaced and 2 million Iraqis have already fled to neighbouring countries."
"As Mr Smith said, that is nearly 4 million people."
"However, an exact assessment of the needs inside Iraq has so far been made impossible by the difficulties of gaining access to the affected populations as a result of the security situation."
"The conference the United Nations is holding in Geneva in April, which has also been mentioned here, is expected to provide more clarity regarding the situation of internal and external displacements, the impact and the needs."
"The Commission will take an active part in that Conference."
"I am certain that Mr Cappato expressed an important invitation be united there with the Council and the Member States."
"In the meantime, based on the information received from partner international humanitarian agencies, the Commission, through its Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid (ECHO), has decided to allocate EUR 10.2 million for humanitarian aid to the victims of the Iraqi crisis."
"As announced this morning by my colleague Mr Michel, an initial funding package of EUR 6.2 million, focusing on the most vulnerable groups, will be proposed for meeting the humanitarian needs of refugees who have fled to countries such as Syria, Lebanon and Jordan."
"The aid will consist of basic healthcare and education, as well as targeted distributions of food and essential household items."
"Protection activities are also envisaged, in particular support for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' refugee registration system, which is important in identifying the most vulnerable groups and assessing their specific needs."
"Another initial funding package of EUR 4 million is in the process of being drawn up for people suffering inside Iraq, based on a careful assessment of priority needs and aid delivery arrangements in what is a highly volatile security environment, as you can imagine."
"Humanitarian aid will be provided impartially and without discrimination, with a focus on those most at risk."
"The Commission will consider further funding decisions when new needs emerge or when access to groups requiring help, and who are currently out of reach, becomes possible."
"The Commission will also continue monitoring the situation closely and to raise specific matters through its regular discussions with third countries and the Government of Iraq, including the Ministry of Displacement and Migration."
"If the situation deteriorates further in the coming months, the Commission will examine the situation in the light of the criteria of the Temporary Protection Directive, in order to decide whether to submit to the Council a request to activate the temporary protection mechanism for the Iraqi asylum seekers."
"This may offer them immediate protection while, at the same time, providing financial support for their actual reception as well as making arrangements for an eventual redistribution of asylum seekers amongst Member States."
"The Commission will also explore, in close cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the possibility for a coordinated effort by EU Member States to resettle refugees from the region."
"Such a resettlement effort could target particularly vulnerable categories of people, such as women-at-risk and unaccompanied minors."
"I want to thank the honourable Members for their resolution and support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"3."
"Guinea (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Guinea."
"author. - (NL) Mr President, when in 1958, France agreed to self-determination for its West African colonies, Guinea was the only one to decide in favour of immediate and complete independence."
"In the 11 other colonially governed areas, the elite chose, often disregarding the will of their own people, to perpetuate close administrative, military and economic ties with France."
"Guinea, on the other hand, followed the example of the former British colony Ghana, which had gained independence one year earlier, and which wanted to develop an African model of socialism with strong participation of the own population."
"The leaders Sekou TourÃ© and Kwame Nkrumah inspired many Africans in their battle for a better future, in which colonialism and poverty were set to be replaced by equality and development."
"Unfortunately, a military coup in both countries stopped this development in its tracks."
"In Guinea, ContÃ© has wielded dictatorial power since 1984."
"Most parties did not take part in the elections that were organised under his control, and the official opposition that was represented in parliament was forced to leave it."
"The trade union confederations CNTG and USTG are now the main force in the fight for democracy."
"The presidential security force, led by the dictator's son, responded to their protest rally on 22 January by killing 59 people and wounding 150 others."
"The dictator increasingly treats the country as his own private property."
"Like many other countries that are run by dictators, Guinea is also becoming the victim of the fight over natural resources among factions that want to get their hands on the revenues from them."
"In this case, the resources in question are gold, iron and bauxite."
"This resolution stands up for the demands of the democratic opposition, and it enjoys my group's support."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner and the representative of the Council for being here today."
"The time has come for the Union to take action, as the situation in Guinea is sliding downhill."
"Guinea has for too long been deliberately kept in a state of underdevelopment by the dictatorial regime and is becoming mired in a tragic deadlock for lack of transparency and democracy."
"The people of Guinea have had enough of poverty, destitution and social injustice; they have not enjoyed the benefits of Guinea's riches - the country has an abundance of natural resources - which are monopolised and mismanaged by the President and his cronies, who are as guilty as he is."
"President ContÃ©, who has been in power since 1984, is ill, and is clinging to life as he is clinging to power."
"If he survives, no one will begrudge him his health."
"If, on the other hand, he remains in power and re-establishes a state of emergency. We will neither understand nor accept this."
"After decades of undiluted power, one has no choice but to condemn such an attitude when wisdom, or a modicum of compassion for his people, would surely have led the President to prepare for the smooth transfer of power to his successor and for the transition to a genuinely democratic regime."
"Instead of that, a state of siege has been declared, the right to assembly and freedom of movement have been curtailed, and the military have violently broken up peaceful demonstrations and killed people."
"This is unacceptable."
"We have no choice but to condemn this brutality, this lack of respect for the most basic human rights of the people of Guinea and the shameful behaviour of a leader who is at the end of his reign but whose capacity for causing suffering is sadly not at an end."
"We must demand that a committee of inquiry be set up to look into the events in Guinea in order to ascertain the full extent of the repression and the level of the hierarchy at which decisions have been taken and by whom."
"Furthermore, will the EU demand political dialogue, as laid down in Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement?"
"We must keep a very close eye on the situation, because, if it were to continue to worsen, not only would the people of Guinea suffer but so too could the whole of that region of Africa, as the deepening internal conflict would spread to neighbouring countries."
"The past is sadly all too full of such examples."
"author. - Mr President, you might be surprised to know that Guinea has a long history of association with Europe."
"It first became known to Europeans during the Portuguese discoveries that started the slave trade in the 15th century."
"In 1890, present-day Guinea was created as a French colony and remained so until 1958."
"From 1958 until 1984 the country was governed by a dictator, Ahmed SÃ©kou TourÃ©, who was supported by the Soviet Union."
"Following TourÃ©'s death in 1984, a new totalitarian regime took over, headed by another dictator, Lansana ContÃ©, who some claim was supported largely by the West."
"ContÃ©'s rule has certainly been better than TourÃ©'s, but is still very far from being democratic."
"The heavy-handed approach to political opponents and the events in February which led to the killing of 23 demonstrators is proof of that."
"Guinea represents a country used and sometimes abused by Europe in the past and is now struggling to survive in extreme poverty and political instability."
"Guinea's mineral wealth makes it, potentially at least, one of Africa's richest countries."
"We, as Europeans, have a duty to assist its people - honestly and effectively this time - in finding and following the road to true democracy, freedom, justice and prosperity."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, in Guinea, since 17 January, an old senile dictator has been massacring his people with complete impunity in order to protect his regime, his corrupt friends and his waning power."
"Guinea is in complete decline."
"Despite its status as the leading exporter of bauxite and despite its deposits of gold, diamonds and iron, its people are among the poorest in the world."
"Its wealth is consumed by corruption, and bad governance does the rest."
"Repression beats down on a people who no longer accept it."
"President ContÃ©'s only response to the January strikes was to have the crowd fired on, to imprison the trade unionists, then, having pretended to negotiate on 27 January, to go back on his commitment to appoint a consensus prime minister and to declare a state of emergency."
"There have now been more than one hundred deaths, and the massacre goes on."
"Europe cannot remain silent and do nothing."
"We cannot wait for Guinea to descend into chaos with unforeseeable consequences for the region."
"Europe has a responsibility to fulfil."
"We call on the Commission to implement the provisions of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, applicable in the event of violation of human rights and democratic principles."
"We must now support the people of Guinea and demand that the authorities end the massacres immediately, release those arrested during the demonstrations, restore civil liberties, lift the state of siege, open negotiations with the trade unions and civil society, and, in cooperation with the opposition parties, appoint a consensus prime minister and government."
"Furthermore, I believe that the European Union must call for elections to be convened under international supervision, with missions sent by the European Union and the United Nations."
"That is what is currently being done in Mauritania, involving our fellow Member, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, to whom I pay tribute in this House, and it was what was done in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with results that have been extremely effective and significant."
"Finally, we must indeed support the proposal for an independent committee of inquiry, led by the United Nations, into the violence of recent months."
"After twenty-three years of dictatorship, enough is enough; the European people must stand alongside the people of Guinea in their fight for freedom and dignity."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, as has been said already, Guinea's fishing, farming and raw material resources make it, potentially, a very prosperous country."
"The fact that, despite this, the country is languishing in miserable poverty is a result of the terrible mismanagement, the dictatorship and the abysmal administration by the state that have obtained there for decades and I am most grateful to Mr Matsakis for having pointed out that SÃ©kou TourÃ©, to whom Mr Meijer referred, was one of worst dictators ever to rule over it."
"Today too, unfortunately, the prevailing state of affairs is anything but acceptable, for which reason we must call on the current transitional president - for he cannot be any more than this - to use the short period that remains to him to bring about an ordered transition to democracy and the rule of law."
"He can only do this, however, if he does not name a puppet as prime minister, as he now has, but only if he truly commits to the demands of the trade unions and the democracy movement and constitutes a broad-based transitional government, including the forces of opposition, which then does nothing other than set about creating public order and preparing free elections so that the past terror and dictatorship can finally give place to democracy and prosperity."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, like many other African countries, Guinea is rich in mineral resources but at the same time is extremely poor."
"A large proportion of its people live in abject poverty."
"This was the reason for the strikes and demonstrations that took place in 2005 and also at the start of this year, protesting against the corrupt rule of Lasana ContÃ© who has been in power for 23 years."
"The strikes are an expression of discontent regarding inflation, unemployment, energy and water shortages and the high price of basic goods."
"In recent times, the strikes have also led to the interruption of the export of aluminium ore, which is Guinea's most precious asset. Tremendous losses were incurred, reaching a level of USD one million a day."
"The leaders of the January strike and the trade unions did suspend the protest, however, following the signing of an agreement demanding a change of Prime Minister."
"The promises contained in the agreement between the trade unions, the Parliament of Guinea and its Supreme Court were not kept, and once again a member of the ruling party was appointed Prime Minister."
"This does not bode well in terms of improving the situation, as demanded by the protestors."
"Events in Guinea are similar to those that took place in my home country some time ago."
"In Guinea, the current regime is also firing on fellow citizens fighting for change, better living conditions and respect for fundamental human rights."
"We demand respect for the principles of democracy and reforms in a country whose inhabitants wish to live in dignity, supported by their own natural wealth which is currently being exploited by rich companies and siphoned off by corruption."
"Thousands of Guineans are dying of hunger and poverty."
"Over a hundred were killed during the demonstration."
"These are the victims of a fledgling democracy and of the struggle for human rights."
"They are also a stain on the consciences of those who value aluminium ore, bauxite, gold and diamonds more than human lives."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, not only has the country had a very difficult history and legacy, but it faces a very difficult current situation."
"However, together we can help to bring more hope to Guinea."
"The Commission is fully aware of the situation in that country."
"In a press release of 22 January, the European Commission condemned the violent interventions by the security forces and called for restraint and civic responsibility during these demonstrations."
"Commissioner Michel regretted the loss of human lives and encouraged the different stakeholders to pursue a constructive dialogue in order to implement the necessary political reforms important for that country."
"The German Presidency, on behalf of the Union, issued a declaration on 9 February regretting the loss of life during the demonstrations and asking the Government of Guinea for an explanation of the circumstances of those deaths and of the judicial steps being taken against those responsible."
"The inquiry commission appointed in Guinea is led by public prosecutors, but victims and relatives are invited to submit their cases either to the courts, which have limited means, or to the police, an institution heavily involved in the repression."
"Given this situation, the Guinean Bar has refused to participate in the inquiry commission and has called for an international commission instead."
"The Bar also wishes to present a case to the International Criminal Court."
"The Commission's delegation in Conakry and Member States' embassies have repeatedly stressed to the Government of Guinea the need to carry out a full inquiry into the events."
"This was also stressed by Commissioner Michel to Foreign Minister CondÃ©."
"The delegation and other diplomats have also stressed to the new Prime Minister that the behaviour of security forces observed during the previous strike should simply stop."
"The ninth European Development Fund cooperation strategy with Guinea, signed on 21 December 2006, includes governance as a focal factor, as a priority."
"Actions foreseen are aimed at promoting effectiveness and transparency in public management, reinforcing the rule of law and promoting a democratic society."
"A reinforced political dialogue with the country is ongoing as a follow-up to the Article 96 (Cotonou Agreement) consultations, which ended in April 2005."
"The Commission has stressed to the Guinean authorities that the new situation would be taken into account in this context."
"I should like to thank you for the resolution, and express the firm belief that the European Union should support the country in seeking a better future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"Debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (debate)"
"1."
"Dialogue between the Chinese government and Envoys of the Dalai Lama (vote)"
"2."
"Humanitarian situation of refugees from Iraq (vote)"
"- Before the vote on Amendment No 5:"
"Mr President, we propose in paragraph 5, line 4, to delete the words 'the European Parliament' on the grounds that it is a little linguistically untidy and perhaps a little illogical for Parliament to call on 'the Parliament' to take part in this international conference."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"
"-Before the vote on Amendment No 7:"
"Mr President, on this amendment to paragraph 7, we would in no way limit our praise of the Swedish Government, but the figure listed in paragraph 7 - 8951 - is just factually incorrect."
"We would propose that the words 'which granted asylum to 8951 Iraqis in 2006,' be deleted."
"That will help the flow of the paragraph, while still praising the Swedish Government's efforts."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"
"3."
"Guinea (vote)"
"- Before the vote on section D of the Preamble:"
"(FR) Mr President, we have indeed agreed to withdraw our Amendment 1 in order to maintain a consensus and a unanimity among the groups that, I am delighted to say, will, I believe, strengthen the resolution."
"With the agreement of the various groups, we have instead submitted an oral amendment to be added at the end of recital D and which I will read to you in English, since that is the language to be used as reference and in which the oral amendment was negotiated."
"It will specify that intervention is taking place by mercenaries from Liberia and Sierra Leone, currently used by the authorities, but that officially there is not yet absolute proof of such intervention, even if all observers on the ground have begun to note it."
"In order to refer to the situation while remaining rigorous, we will state the following:"
"'whereas there are allegations of the presence of mercenaries and former guerrilla fighters'."
"(FR) However, I believe that our fellow Member, Mr Matsakis, wished to make an oral amendment to the oral amendment in order to make it still more precise, and I should like to say straight away that I support the wording that he will now propose to us, so that we may all vote unanimously in favour of the same text."
"Mr President, in order to clarify it even further and make it more factually correct and comprehensive, I wish to make an oral amendment to the oral amendment by Mr DÃ©sir."
"After the words 'whereas there are allegations of the presence of mercenaries and former guerrilla fighters', I wish to add 'working as paramilitary government forces'."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"
"That concludes the vote."

"(DE) Mr President, I have a couple of questions to put to you and to the Secretary-General of this House."
"I learned as early as last Thursday that a ceremony commemorating the victims of terrorism was to be held here this afternoon before this plenary sitting began."
"I take it as read that it was of an appropriately dignified character, and do not indeed doubt that it was, for I see the occasion, and the need for such a ceremony, as important."
"What I am not willing to accept, however, is the way in which this was prepared and staged, and I would also like to tell the Secretary-General, Mr RÃ¸mer, that I intend to energetically follow up what he said in the Conference of Presidents last Thursday, so I will tell the plenary that I, the chairman of my group, had no advance notice of this event whatever."
"I do not know whether the members or chairmen of other groups were informed of it, but I, in any case, was not."
"When I, last Thursday, asked the Secretary-General and you how this had been prepared, I was told - for you left the answer to the Secretary-General - that it had been done in close cooperation with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and, that appearing to be to be an acceptable explanation, I declared myself content with it."
"Since then, I have learned that neither the deputy chairman of that committee, Mr Lambrinidis - who is a member of my group - nor my group's coordinator, Mrs Roure, had had any word whatever of this event."
"I think this House has earned the right to be allowed to take part in an event of this kind, and I would have been happy to be present in my capacity as a group chairman."
"I do not think it helpful that Parliamentary business or initiatives of this kind should be staged in this building without Members of this House being present, and so I ask that, the next time events of this kind - which are, as I have said, useful - are prepared and held, a better job should be made of it."
"I personally, as President of this House, took it as read that the procedure would be the same as it was last year; we will check to see if something different was done then."
"I myself presided from 3 p.m. onwards and wanted to do so until half past three, but the sitting then dragged on longer as the young people - whom it was very nice to see there, may I say - and the group chairmen were not so punctilious in keeping to their speaking time, and the President was not in a position to tell the young people to stop speaking after four minutes, so that I myself was unable to keep a very important appointment at half past three."
"The whole thing lasted until just before 4 p.m."
"The sitting had been chaired before 3 p.m. by Mr Cavada, the chairman of this House's home affairs committee; the rapporteur was Mr Sifunakis, who is a member of your group, and Commissioner Å pidla was also present."
"What I would recommend is that we should check to compare what was done last time and what was done this year."
"As for next year, I would ask - and I am grateful to you for saying how very useful you, too, find this - that we should try for a bit more transparency next time around, but there is one thing that will not be possible, for the Chamber was packed out with 580 young people in it, and if we invite all the Members of this House, there will not be enough space."
"We should, though, give some thought to how this House can be properly represented through the political groups."
"Can we agree on that?"
"Statement by the President"
"Perhaps I might make a comment to the topic we have just discussed."
"Yesterday - Sunday, March the eleventh - was the third anniversary of the terrorist attack in Madrid on 11 March 2004, when 192 people were killed."
"The day of this appalling event has become a European day of commemoration for the victims of terrorism."
"It is a day for keeping memory alive - the memory of the victims of terrorism - and for solidarity with them and their families, with those who lost their lives and also with those who still suffer the effects of it, whether physical or psychological."
"It is a day for fostering awareness, for, following the attack on Madrid, the bombings in London on 7 July 2005 resulted in more victims within the European Union, and, elsewhere around the world, too, it is still too often the case that too many people are being killed by violence motivated by fanaticism."
"Terrorism is an attack on freedom and democracy."
"Terrorism is an attempt at making things happened through blind violence and, in the process, destroying values, the values that are the foundation of the European Union and its Member States."
"Terrorism is a crime that cannot be tolerated under any circumstances."
"It represents one of the greatest dangers to the security, stability and democratic values of the international community and is also a direct assault on our citizens."
"The European Union and the international community of states must be determined in fighting terrorism in whatever shape or form."
"There can be no justification for terrorism, and, in fighting it, we can allow ourselves no weakness; that is why we need a strong and united Europe."
"If we are to fight it effectively, we need to go beyond mere close cooperation and develop a coherent common policy that meets the needs of the public while also reflecting our understanding of human rights and human dignity."
"Let me, then, say once more that this House does not see Guantanamo as compatible with our European legal order, and that we must ensure, in joining together to fight terrorism in Europe, that we do so in a manner consistent with the values that we are defending."
"On the occasion of this day commemorating the victims of terrorism, we must again declare ourselves willing to fight terrorism in whatever form and also to take the action needed in order to do so."
"We must not forget the victims of terrorism; the punishment of their murderers is a debt we owe to them, but a determined policy must also have the object of preventing, in so far as possible, terrorism and terrorist acts on European Union soil and anywhere else in the world, in line with the principles of the international community and our system of law."
"On 5 March this year, Daniele Mastrogiacomo, an Italian journalist and Afghanistan correspondent for the newspaper 'La Repubblica', was abducted by the Taliban."
"He was simply doing his job, which was to report on the situation in that country."
"I would like to take this opportunity of expressing this House's solidarity and my own with Mr Mastrogiacomo's family and with the newspaper 'La Repubblica'."
"I would also like, speaking on behalf of this House, to express the same solidarity with the German citizen and her son, both of whom were abducted in Iraq in February."
"We urge and demand of the persons who are holding Mr Mastrogiacomo and the organisation Kataib Siham al-Haq, which abducted the two German citizens and long-term residents of Iraq, that they should let these people go free - free and unharmed - without delay."
"We must not allow ourselves to be blackmailed by violence."
"I now ask that we remember the victims of terrorism."

"The final draft of the agenda for this sitting, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents meeting on Thursday, 8 March 2007, in accordance with Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been circulated."
"It has been requested that the draft be amended as follows:"
"Monday:"
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has moved that there be no motions to close the debate on the oral question to the Commission on Community measures to provide cross-border health services."
"Who wishes to justify this motion?"
"(FR) Mr President, my group believes that this proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to submit an oral question with debate and resolution on the provision of cross-border health care is inappropriate for the simple reason that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, backed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, is currently debating a draft report that relates to the same subject, namely health services in the European Union."
"The vote on this resolution is in danger of being redundant and, above all, is in danger of cutting short the debates taking place in the two other committees."
"My group could therefore just about endorse the presentation of this oral question with debate, but it requests that the resolution be left in abeyance and dealt with at the same time as the report by the committee concerned."
"According to the information I have, this report is scheduled for the May plenary session."
"Let us therefore avoid any duplication of effort and let us try to do some serious parliamentary work."
"In other words, let us wait for the background report by the committee concerned to become available."
"(DE) Mr President, I can, in fact, do no more than repeat what my colleague Mr Goebbels has already said."
"We, in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, are currently drafting a comprehensive report, which will also include opinions from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"It would, of course, be good if our committee's ongoing work were not to be prejudiced by the adoption of a resolution that had to be cobbled together within the space of three days, whereas we have been spending many weeks preparing a good document that, it is to be hoped, will enjoy broad support."
"I think the sensible thing to do would be to have a debate on this - that is something we can certainly accept - while not adopting a resolution on it."
"Mr President, I understand the courteous and moderate way in which the request has been put by the colleagues opposite, but I have to say that I think it is based on a misunderstanding."
"I am grateful for their support."
"However, we are not talking about two debates on the same issue, but about a report by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which is not yet completed, concerning the exclusion of health services from the Services Directive."
"An opinion from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is winging its way to that committee and, in due course, we shall have a full debate on that."
"This resolution is not about services but about patients."
"(Applause)"
"It is about the consequences for patients of the judgments of the European Court of Justice."
"When colleagues say that this debate might be untimely, they are right because it is very late."
"This resolution was not cobbled together in three days but was put together by the Committee on the Environment last December, when it was carried unanimously by that committee."
"The Health Commissioner, Mr Kyprianou, told us on numerous occasions that he was waiting for the resolution and asked why he could not have it because he knew that it had been carried."
"Therefore, it is long overdue."
"It is quite separate from the report by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and we will give that due respect when it comes."
"However, for now, I ask Parliament to agree that the oral question should be accompanied by the resolution, which did not come before us in January or February, but surely can now do so in March."
"(Applause)"
"(Parliament rejected the motion.)"
"Tuesday:"
"Motion by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Virrankoski's report on biotechnology: Prospects and challenges for agriculture in Europe to be sent back to the committee."
". - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on the report held in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 24 January was split down the middle: of the 43 members present, 22 voted in favour, 15 voted against and 6 abstained."
"Due mainly to the fact that it focuses on GMOs, when biotechnology is far broader in scope, this report, which is entitled 'Biotechnology: prospects and challenges for agriculture in Europe', has provoked numerous reactions, and not only within our group."
"For that reason, and due to the ensuing risk of this report - which is fairly crucial for a subject as important as biotechnology - failing, it would be helpful if the report were referred back to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development so that it can re-examine it and perhaps arrive at a more balanced proposal that receives more votes."
"I would add that I met Mr Virrankoski to discuss this issue - I am grateful to him for the constructive meeting that we had last week - and that it seems, moreover, that my fellow coordinator, Mr Busk, shares this opinion, if the e-mail that he sent me is anything to go by."
"(FI) Mr President, biotechnology offers massive opportunities for European agriculture, although it presents challenges for it as well."
"For this reason, a report such as this cannot be treated as a yes or no issue: instead, it needs to be examined thoroughly and without bias."
"Accordingly, I am in favour of it being referred back to the committee so that we might get the greatest possible support for it in plenary."
"(Parliament adopted the motion.)"
"(MT) I ask that this debate on hunting in Malta be concluded without a resolution because I feel that such a resolution is unnecessary and unjustified, and for three reasons. Firstly, spring hunting is, in itself, illegal, its being through the use of a derogation that European law allows the practice of hunting at this time of year."
"Secondly, the use of a derogation to allow spring hunting was the specific subject of negotiations between Malta and the European Union in the period prior to accession, and there is therefore no reason why this chapter should be re-opened."
"Thirdly, if spring hunting is to be abolished, then this should be done on a scientific basis and not in response to political pressure."
"(MT) I agree with my colleague, Mr Busuttil."
"I believe that we are talking in this case about an agreement between the European Union and Malta, approved by both Parliament and the majority of the Maltese and Gozitan population of my country."
"I believe that it is at this stage unnecessary to come up with a resolution that goes against what was decided on between the Maltese people and the European Union, because I feel that we would in that way be sending out the wrong message to every European citizen, namely that the very European Union that originally endorses an agreement tries to put a stop to it after a while."
"I therefore believe that this is not the time for a resolution on the matter."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we asked for and accepted this debate and why a resolution is needed is precisely because Malta has failed to abide by the agreements."
"It is obvious that that is what the problem is."
"Otherwise a resolution would not have been put forward; we would not have received the results and the very explicit recommendations of a fact-finding mission sent to Malta; and the Commission would not have recommended, as my fellow Members are very well aware, that the Maltese Government should not authorise the spring hunt in the country this year, in view of what has happened in previous years."
"The reason, therefore, why we are calling for a debate and resolution is exactly the opposite of what my fellow Members maintain: since there is a violation of Community law and since we must apparently legislate less, we had better concern ourselves with applying this law."
"I hope this House will act in accordance with the decision made earlier and draw up a resolution on this topic."
"(Parliament rejected the motion.)"
"Wednesday:"
"Motion by the Presidency of the Council for the debate on the statements by the Council and the Commission on the Berlin Declaration to be taken following the debate on the report on the European Council and the statement by the Commission on the meeting of the European Council (8/9 March 2007)."
"(DE) Mr President, starting the agenda in this way with a brief debate on the Berlin statement is a good choice."
"If the declaration is worth anything, let it be debated briefly and early in the morning, rather than at the end of a long and perhaps rather problematic debate on the Council, with different groups pulling in different directions."
"I think it is certainly appropriate that we should first have an hour's worth of debate on the Berlin statement, followed by an exhaustive one on the Council."
"(Parliament rejected the motion.)"
"Thursday"
"Debates on violation of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (Rule 115 of the Rules of Procedure): Motion by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to delete the word 'Nigeria' and replace it by the wording 'arrests of activists contending for the rights of women in Iran'."
"(DE) Mr President, we have seen that World Women's Day was marked in Iran by demonstrations by women, which were then violently suppressed."
"Over recent weeks, pressure on women's organisations in Iran generally has increased, and it is for that reason that we think it more relevant and more a matter of urgency that this be debated rather than the subject in relation to Nigeria."
"(DE) Mr President, although I am sure that Mr Gahler is right to say that this is an important problem and one that we should not disregard, I do nevertheless believe that we should not drop the subject of Nigeria in favour of something else."
"What I would propose is that we leave Nigeria on the agenda and take the subject of women in Iran during the next part-session in Brussels, for example in the format of a brief oral question to the Commission or the Council as to what they envisage doing in order to support women in that country."
"We would be happy to agree to that, but this time we should leave the agenda as it is."
"In that sense, I am against the motion, but would offer the opportunity for an in-depth discussion of the issue at another time - that time being in the course of the next part-session."
"(Parliament rejected the motion.)"
"(The agenda was therefore adopted.)"
"Corporate social responsibility (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Howitt on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on corporate social responsibility: a new partnership."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, companies, politicians and above all people understand that the problems of world poverty and of environmental degradation remain stubbornly prevalent in today's world."
"For ten years, many companies have begun to examine how they can manage their own social and environmental impacts through initiatives for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)."
"Business cannot be expected to take responsibility alone for meeting these challenges."
"However, it is now time for the communications, the conferences and the codes of conduct to begin to make a significant and measurable difference and a move from process to outcome."
"In this vote, the European Parliament will draw attention to the limitations of voluntary CSR reporting and of social auditing as it exists today."
"We will say that the drive for ever lower prices can prejudice fair treatment for people at work."
"We will insist that CSR can only work by adopting a multi-stakeholder approach, internationally-agreed standards and independent monitoring and verification."
"We will call for actions to tackle corporate abuses in the world's developing countries and to provide means for redress for its victims."
"The Commission's communications seem to me to opt out of this debate, to prescribe an 'anything goes' approach to CSR and to risk Europe falling behind, compared with the rest of the world."
"However, tonight I am not proposing that we reject the Commission's approach."
"Indeed, I am asking the European Parliament to contribute constructively by seeking to rewrite some of the agenda and, where the Commission is making commitments, to come forward with detailed recommendations to turn fine words into concrete actions, to give full transparency to the evolving alliance for business, to rebuild confidence in the European multi-stakeholder forum and bring the NGOs back to the table, to make a genuine financial contribution to enabling CSR to grow, to genuinely put into operation support for CSR principles in Commission policies and programmes, including enterprise, employment, corporate governance and, in particular, trade and development programmes."
"I know that Commissioners Verheugen and Å pidla will not be able to accept all of Parliament's recommendations tonight."
"However, I am heartened and grateful for the private meetings I have held with them as this report has evolved."
"I now call on them publicly to promise that decisive progress will be made on CSR at EU level within the life of this Commission."
"I also know that some Members in the debate will seek to oppose the report: I say to them that this report represents a carefully crafted compromise between the political groups."
"Indeed, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the shadow rapporteur."
"The one clear piece of new legislation we will support will be for mandatory environmental and social reporting by business, reiterating our previous position and sending a powerful political signal from this Parliament."
"All of our other proposals are about more effective use and implementation of the existing regulatory framework and support for voluntary action."
"I say to the opponents inside this Parliament and to the one or two associations outside that, in their enthusiasm to block action at EU level, I do not believe that they do justice or genuinely represent the best interests or the best of business when it comes to CSR."
"Take the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, speaking on behalf of the business leaders' initiative for human rights, which told us: 'Minimum standards are essential for a level playing field to be developed in this area'."
"Take the European Investment and Research Service, who told us: 'If you can go some way to rekindling the interest of the Commission in a more substantive approach to CSR, that would be most welcome'."
"Or take the French business confederation MEDEF, speaking of behalf of Business Europe: 'I want to thank you very much for the quality and the relevance of most of the questions and suggestions put forward by you.'"
"Now is not the time to retreat."
"It is time to be ambitious and to show vision and take all of these and others together."
"One of the key ways we can get greater enthusiasm, dynamism and consensus behind EU action on CSR is by championing it in global institutions and better implementing global CSR initiatives here in Europe."
"There is also the strategic partnership that I propose between the Commission and the global reporting initiative, a new business dialogue between the EU and Japan on corporate social responsibility, and the use of the fifth anniversary this year of the World Summit on Sustainable Development as an opportunity for us in Europe to lead the international debate for intergovernmental initiatives and corporate accountability, which was agreed at Johannesburg."
"When the Commission published its communication it said it wanted Europe to be a pole of excellence for CSR."
"When I read it I feared that CSR in Europe was instead falling down a black hole."
"However, if we can agree substantively on many of the recommendations in this Parliament report, I believe that we can make the Commission's aspiration come true."
"Mr President, honourable Members, it is indeed true to say that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is marching ahead in Europe, and last year's communication from the Commission triggered a great wave of activities and new ideas."
"It is because CSR can make a great contribution to sustainable development and enhance Europe's potential for innovation and its competitiveness that it is closely tied in with our strategy for growth and employment, the object of which is not only to create more jobs but also, and primarily, to create better ones."
"We are talking here not about short-term successes or apparently favourable quarterly results, but rather about the need for our companies to adjust in the long term to the changed conditions under which we have to compete in the world as a whole."
"Favourable social conditions may well be an important factor in competition, but producing them is not a responsibility for policy-makers alone; businesses have a responsibility of their own, and it goes beyond mere obedience to the law."
"They are responsible for the social climate, for the environment, for equality of opportunity, for training, for innovation and for structural change; to sum up, they are responsible for the people who work for them, and for the location where they are based."
"The Commission welcomes Mr Howitt's report, which is evidence of deep knowledge and competence and not only essentially endorses the Commission's aim of strengthening CSR in Europe, but also makes an important contribution towards achieving it."
"I certainly agree that the debate should aim to achieve concrete results; that the multi-stakeholder approach should embrace all the interested parties and groups affected; and that the whole process should be even better integrated into the Lisbon Strategy."
"You will be aware that the Commission believes that the openings for regulation in this area are limited."
"We do not believe that an enterprise's culture can be imposed from above or standardised by legislation, and that is why the Commission has been unwilling to take a decision in favour of proposing a regulation on CSR or the standardisation of it at European level."
"If something, somewhere, has to be regulated; if we, by reason of our political responsibility have to insist on businesses doing something, then we have to summon up the courage to enact the relevant legislation, which must be specific and practically relevant to the area in question, but corporate social responsibility is, by definition, something that goes beyond companies' obligations under the law and is more than that which we lay down in regulations."
"We want to support businesses and to encourage them to make use of the internationally recognised instruments, which are available in great numbers."
"The Commission is also supporting CSR in the global context, for example, through the EU-Africa Business Forum, brought into existence by my fellow-Commissioner Mr Michel, in which representatives of businesses from both continents met in November 2006 to discuss social responsibility."
"The Commission is continuing to discuss with developing countries the progress being made in implementing the basic standards of the International Labour Organisation, and, in Europe, we are promoting the further development of relevant instruments within the various sectors, alongside multi-sectoral initiatives."
"My fellow-Commissioner Mr Å pidla and I are meeting more and more business people who are getting committed to and involved in making Europe a front-runner where CSR is concerned, and who see it as putting their businesses at a definite advantage on the market."
"In the short time in which it has been in existence, the European CSR Alliance has set in motion some impressive and exemplary initiatives, and far-sighted managers and investors have long known that a company with a good record of CSR is usually a successful one, as, indeed, is evident from the prices at which such businesses' shares are quoted on stock exchanges."
"The Commission calls on Europe's businesses to make CSR a European brand and to compete for the best ideas."
"We are convinced that a European company must be one that acknowledges its own social responsibility and acts accordingly."
"That is something on which the Commission and your House are in complete agreement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my colleague Mr Verheugen has characterised the general framework of corporate social responsibility."
"I feel I must emphasise that this is about voluntary commitments on the part of businesses, commitments that clearly go beyond what the law requires."
"This must not of course restrict the right of any lawmaker or relevant authority to draw up any law it deems essential."
"Given that the general framework has been described sufficiently clearly, I should like to present a number of specific areas in which we support corporate initiatives and which form part of the March 2006 strategy."
"First of all, businesses play a major role in professional cohesion and also support social cohesion insofar as they hire workers and are involved in human resources management."
"Secondly, 2007 has been declared the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All."
"We have neither the right nor the means to deprive ourselves of our diverse talents, and therefore we support corporate initiatives aimed at equal opportunities."
"Thirdly, an important part of the intergenerational pact, which ageing Europe desperately needs, is cohesion and the retention of older people in employment."
"The other priorities in the March communication, such as health, investment in lifelong learning, innovation in training, science and operating on a global scale are equally important."
"The text you will be debating addresses these very issues."
"If we want to ensure that corporate social responsibility continues into the 21st century there needs to be dialogue with the whole community, and for this reason in December we held a multi-stakeholder forum on corporate social responsibility."
"At the same time, it was decided to convene a European level discussion body from one of the plenary sittings, which will bring together representatives from civil society, the world of business and academic institutions."
"These forums have made it possible for us to assess the results of initiatives launched since 2004."
"As regards Commission initiatives I believe that corporate social responsibility is becoming increasingly influential across all of our policies, and in particular in external EU policy."
"Issues of common interest for the future have also been staked out, such as education, research and working conditions across chains of subcontractors."
"This will clearly have a major impact in fostering more secure social conditions in regions outside Europe for subcontractors who work for European firms."
"There is much work to be done but we are on the right track."
"It can be seen from our debates and discussions with interested parties that corporate social responsibility is an increasingly important issue."
"It is important to maintain existing conditions and to be unstinting in our efforts."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his report."
"I think he has managed to present a report that can secure widespread support in this Chamber."
"I think it is important to make some remarks about corporate social responsibilities."
"First of all, the main task of companies is to deliver the services and products they are established for and to be run at a profit, because otherwise they will not survive."
"If they cannot fulfil these main tasks, they will fail in their fundamental social responsibility as employers and as producers of services and goods."
"I think it is important to underline this when we discuss how to define corporate social responsibilities."
"Our point of view - because we have discussed this question in the ITRE committee as well as within our group - is that it should be a matter of voluntary responsibility."
"It has to be performed on its own merits and as a part of the responsibility that the individual company has in society."
"Companies have a social role in society."
"They must be good employers, delivering services and products of a high quality, because otherwise they will lose credibility and they will lose out in the market."
"But there are also grounds for saying that they must behave well in their own terms, because good and strong companies who stand up for fundamental values, whether in Europe or anywhere else in the world, are contributing to a better world, but also to a better economy and to better products and services."
"There should be voluntary responsibility, because otherwise legislation would be needed and that is another matter."
"If we try to streamline too much, we will lose the variety and the dynamism that each company can deliver by making the most of its opportunities to be a good employer, a good company and a good service and product provider."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (EL) Mr President, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, in its opinion on corporate social responsibility, calls on the rapporteur for a holistic understanding of this issue, because it believes that the role of companies is fundamental as regards respect for the values underpinning the European Union, irrespective of where they trade, within or outside the European Union, and irrespective of their size, of whether they are small or medium-sized enterprises, multinationals and so on."
"At global level, core standards of the International Labour Organisation are promoted through corporate social responsibility."
"Within a framework of voluntary action, they can introduce measures to support female human resources, within the framework of national and Community legislation on gender equality and non-discrimination, both during the recruitment procedure and during the procedure to promote and elect women to the administration bodies, to the board of directors, when promoting the planning of actions for corporate social responsibility."
"We congratulate the European Commission on reinforcing the new alliance and we do not believe that it will be a repetition of the multi-stakeholder forum."
"A charter of good practice to which companies subscribe voluntarily will help to promote actions for the living and working environment and facilitate a better combination of professional and home life alongside cultural and educational services."
"Finally, we are calling for good corporate social responsibility practices to be promoted and rewarded, especially in the gender equality sector, but not with a mandatory report by companies."
"Commissioners, allow me to express the view that the possibilities of voluntary application of corporate social responsibility, not as a means of advertising or competition, should be planned in the multi-stakeholder forum, which is a forum for discussion between all the social partners, and we hope that there will be significant female participation in it."
"Mr President, far and away most of the EU's businesses have committed themselves to social responsibility, to socially and environmentally responsible action, to the protection of people and their environment, and to security of production."
"They support cultural and religious facilities, sports and clubs."
"As both Commissioners have just said, though, it is and remains a prerequisite that these things should be done on a voluntary basis, something laid down in the European Parliament report back in 2003, and, a year later, on the occasion of the founding of the Multi-Stakeholder Forum."
"If you want to maintain the voluntary character of this commitment, you have to reject binding regulations and suffocating bureaucracy."
"A comprehensive reporting system ought, if at all, to be expected only of large companies;"
"SMEs, which make up over 90% of all companies, cannot cope with it, for they quite simply lack the human and financial resources required to give an all-round picture of their CSR."
"My group's shadow rapporteur, Mr Bushill-Matthews, has succeeded in reaching some compromises that have the effect of defusing the Howitt report, which my group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was right to reject."
"I count it a victory that the demand for the award of public contracts to be made dependent on compliance with social and environmental clauses has been largely struck out."
"Firms must be able to win a public contract even if they do not have an ecologically-correct pot of flowers in front of the factory gate and even if the menu of their works canteen does not include alternative meals."
"Paragraph 11, which calls for the setting-up of a central point of coordination for CSR, is problematic, as are paragraphs 39 and 55, which advocate the appointment of an ombudsman for CSR."
"I am opposed to any extension of enterprises' liability and obligations to account for their corporate social responsibility, and regard such dirigiste manipulations as unacceptable."
"Finally, we are talking today about an own-initiative report, one that many do not take seriously on the grounds that it is thought to be no more than a declamation."
"What I say is: principiis obsta - resist that which is only just beginning!"
"If this House calls for some of all this to be made mandatory, then legislative measures from the Commission are no longer far away."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) A transnational company has, within its network in one of the new Member States, employed people living with handicaps as cleaners in a city struggling with social problems."
"The company received subsidies from the local authorities for these employees with handicaps, thereby depleting almost the entire funding source available for this purpose."
"In my view this mode of behaviour does not meet our expectations regarding corporate social responsibility."
"The efforts to recover costs can and must in all cases be harmonised with social goals."
"This is pointed out in Richard Howitt's excellent report."
"I would add that a favourable economic environment has since the early 1990s attracted numerous transnational companies to Central and Eastern Europe."
"Certain regions of the new EU Member States continue, however, to experience multiple disadvantages."
"To use a distinctive phrase: they are in a sense the European Union's internal peripheries."
"Therefore we must make it clear to transnational companies as well that their actions must follow the principle of 'think globally - act locally'."
"This will help avoid that certain regions of the Union become peripheries that only 'think globally'."
"This is why I consider Richard Howitt's report to be important, and this is why I hope that it does not sink under arguments over formalities, but will develop its role within the European social model of CSR."
"Corporate social responsibility does not simply mean avoiding doing harm, but is an ordered system for positive actions."
"The question here is not whether or not certain actions can be prescribed, but rather whether they can fulfil expectations in view of a better world."
"It is my belief that they can."
"We can expect that they treat employees as human beings, in their entirety, with their rights, state of health and cultural and social traditions."
"Richard Howitt's report is a very important step along this path."
"(ET) I am certain that corporate social responsibility promotes sustainable development and also the improved implementation of the Lisbon Strategy in such matters as the more sensible use of natural resources, improving the results of innovation activity, the reduction of poverty, and also, of course, improved compliance with human rights requirements."
"Corporate social responsibility should also act as an additional measure for the management of industry and restructuring, and act so that new areas are added to it; for instance, lifelong learning, equal opportunities, social involvement, sustainable development, and also ethics."
"Companies' participation in such social activities must be voluntary."
"If we wish to move forward towards the creation and development of traditions in the area of corporate social responsibility, it is inevitable that we follow agreed and internationally recognised principles."
"We have no other framework or agreed system with which we could adequately measure companies' activities in connection with corporate social responsibility."
"Thus the creation of the institution of ombudsman would be premature and pointless at the present moment."
"The imposition of a package of regulations would not have a positive effect, and would instead lead to negative counter-reactions."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his eight years of persistent activity in aiming to achieve this objective."
"Thank you for giving me the floor."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Howitt on his report."
"However, I am not sure that I am so happy about the deal he made with the PPE-DE Group to weaken what we will vote on tomorrow."
"Yesterday I participated in a citizens' consultation, and it is quite obvious what citizens want - they want Europe to be more active on environmental issues."
"I think that last Friday's Council was well received by citizens."
"The second thing that citizens want is greater social responsibility, and I am afraid the Barroso-Verheugen Commission went in entirely the opposite direction when it took office."
"So, Commissioner, you have already turned somewhat on environmental and energy issues under pressure from science and from citizens."
"I hope that this report by Parliament, especially if it is not watered down too much tomorrow, will help you to reconsider your social agenda."
"It was the Commission not being active enough in the multi-stakeholder dialogue that played a large part in frustrating NGOs to the extent that they left the table completely."
"There are some good bits in the report which will be voted on tomorrow."
"I just wanted to highlight one issue: the deletion of paragraph 63, in which we call for global leadership from the European Union on this issue."
"Why is this important?"
"With more Chinese oil and mining companies investing in Africa and other areas, if Europe does not elevate corporate social responsibility from a purely European issue to a global, UN issue, our companies will lose out, so I do not understand how the PPE-DE and the PSE Groups can delete a paragraph from the original report as voted on that calls for us to be much more proactive on a global level."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate and thank Mr Howitt for his initiative and his report, and to endorse the series of amendments adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"As has been demonstrated, the main problem or the main question in our debate is over whether regulation is in fact needed in this area or whether a voluntary approach will suffice."
"I for one am not in favour of excessive bureaucracy and superfluous regulation."
"In questions such as corporate social responsibility, however, it is clear that relying on the goodwill of businesses is simply not enough."
"Otherwise, a part of the population of Europe will find itself facing an unequal situation."
"I feel, though, that what is needed is a workable legal instrument that would force companies to fulfil their responsibilities not only in the social field but also in the area of protecting working conditions, health at work and the environment."
"Although I warmly endorse this report, I have tabled two amendments in conjunction with members of our group, the purpose of which is firstly to sound a warning about the current situation and the problems faced by workers regarding, for example, company relocations, low salaries, precarious work and insufficient health protection at work, and secondly to express our objection to the policies proposed by the Commission in the area of social responsibility, which often do not match the goals and the principles on which corporate social responsibility should be based."
"I hope we will succeed in producing not only a statement of intent, but also the practical instruments needed to take practical action."
"If not, we will end up with mere window-dressing, and I believe that the citizens expect more from us than that."
"Mr President, in this House we talk constantly about the Lisbon Agenda, which is supposed to make the EU the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010."
"The Commission President, JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, likes to boast about his plans to control excessive regulation to help enhance the competitiveness of European economies."
"Yet this report, as originally presented, sought to create mandatory regulation of a wide range of areas of corporate activity, including employee relations and the environment."
"But these areas are already heavily regulated, indeed massively over-regulated, by EU legislation already on the statute book."
"What we were proposing to do here was to double up on existing regulation with all the potential for ambiguity and confusion that would have created."
"Mandatory CSR would be hugely damaging to competitiveness, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, to which we constantly pay lip-service but which we constantly seek to strangle with oppressive, intrusive and unnecessary regulation."
"However, there are now agreed amendments which firmly establish the voluntary nature of CSR and I for one strongly support those amendments."
"I agree with the rapporteur that we need to promote CSR, but we also need to protect the enterprise, productivity, competitiveness and wealth-creating capacity of European businesses."
"We should also be aware of existing best practice of CSR amongst existing major businesses."
"Last summer, I had the privilege of visiting the Gates Foundation in Seattle, which of course is run by Bill Gates of Microsoft."
"This Foundation's spending on philanthropy exceeds the GDP of a number of small countries."
"Arguably, it does more to relieve poverty and hardship in Africa than EU aid does and, because it is a private sector organisation, its spending is hugely more efficient."
"I believe that, with the amendments that we are proposing to put in place here, we should be able to support this report."
"(PT) Mr President, the main function of business is wealth creation, but companies are, in certain circumstances, capable of being more than merely wealth-generating machines."
"Companies can also be seen as communities in which people live and interact; people can view their company as their place of professional fulfilment, and even, in many cases, personal happiness."
"Successful companies, those capable of creating wealth, are those that normally enjoy good relations with their partners, customers, suppliers and with the community in which they operate."
"Successful companies are those that adopt transparency criteria in their relations with the authorities and operate on the basis of codes of conduct and ethics, which are sometimes extremely stringent."
"If one were to describe companies that exist for a long time in human terms, there are companies that function with a strong personality, with a particular culture that they have managed to create and develop and that identifies them and distinguishes them from the others."
"These are companies, one might say, with emotions and feelings."
"Companies such as these opt to give more to the community over and above their traditional functions and thereby take on a greater responsibility; this is what might be termed 'social responsibility'."
"I feel, however, that corporate social responsibility is not something that can be decreed or imposed, but something that must be entered into willingly."
"Corporate social responsibility can never be imposed from above."
"If it were, there would be a risk of reducing its role to a public relations exercise aimed at creating a smokescreen and at enabling companies to sidestep their responsibilities of addressing social and environmental issues."
"In which case corporate social responsibility would be a fraud because it would be insincere."
"I endorse the report before us because, in its final version, my view on the issue was ultimately taken into account."
"(ES) Mr President, I am obliged to begin by thanking Mr Howitt for his wonderful work and for his extraordinary willingness to receive the contributions that other members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have presented to him."
"He is also showing great capacity and flexibility on such a complex issue, opening himself up to dialogue and agreement with other groups in Parliament."
"As others have said, I believe that corporate social responsibility is good per se."
"This must not lead us to think, however, that it is not possible to improve our current framework and the relatively short experience we have acquired in the European Union."
"I believe that the world's problems are increasing at a considerable speed, both environmental problems and the problems faced by people who are deprived of all kinds of rights."
"I therefore believe that we must make an additional effort."
"That is all Mr Howitt is asking us for in his report."
"I hope that the Commission, whose Communication has had a mixed reception, not very positive in some cases, will see this as an opportunity to take more account of social responsibility."
"Much can still be done, avoiding false debates on what should be voluntary and what should not."
"We must continue moving forward with a view to creating criteria to make responsibility objective."
"Companies will be free to adopt codes of conduct, but they cannot be free when it comes to respecting the codes of conduct that they have adopted."
"There must be transparency, there must be more than philanthropy in this notion of corporate social responsibility."
"We Europeans offer the world a model based on the sustainability of our economic model for us and for others."
"We can go further on the control and verification of these obligations that have been taken on freely."
"We have directives in the European Union. Directives that have not been transposed in the Member States on union law, on environmental responsibilities."
"The Commission can make commitments and not take the laissez faire, laissez passer approach to everything."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, for a few minutes now, each of us, in turn, has been repeating the fact that we do not want the forthcoming provisions to result in so many additional constraints and regulations."
"We want a commitment on the part of business leaders, we want them to be proactive, we want this proactive approach to be applied internationally, we want SMEs to commit themselves and, as the rapporteur said, above and beyond declarations, we want something concrete."
"As a company director myself for over thirty years, well, I want things to be able to materialise."
"With this in mind, I have a proposal for you, Commissioners."
"A system is already applied internationally by hundreds of thousands of businesses."
"This system coordinates the social responsibility of businesses via the ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 18001 standards, which ensure that business relationships with customers are better, that practices are totally environmentally-friendly and that hygiene, health and safety rules are complied with in full."
"Therefore, allow to me to suggest, Commissioners, the use of these three management standards with the aim of having businesses throughout our Europe genuinely assume their social responsibilities."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this excellent report."
"One of the key points to come out of the report is that we are not just looking at corporate social responsibility within the European Union, but beyond the Union as well, and at the behaviour of European companies elsewhere in the world - a move away from the double standards of how you operate here with one legislative framework and what you think you can get away with somewhere else."
"What we have heard from the Commission on the Africa Forum is a good initiative, but we need to look much more closely at how companies behave in conflict zones."
"We have the leadership on the diamond process at the moment and we need to move forward on that."
"I also note from the report that voluntary reporting is now stabilising and that not all voluntary reports cover supply chain compliance, which is one of the most important mechanisms we have to drive up standards, to ensure brand protection for companies behaving well and to ensure that they avoid the actions of companies which behave irresponsibly."
"I look forward to Parliament's report on socially irresponsible corporate behaviour so that we can look at the contrast in how we work."
"(PL) Mr President, I am aware that the concept of corporate social responsibility is becoming an increasingly important part of the debate on globalisation, competitiveness and sustainable development."
"According to the definition of this concept, companies voluntarily take account of the social and economic impact of the activities they undertake."
"In the framework of implementation of social responsibility on a voluntary basis, companies decide to go beyond the minimum legal requirements and commitments resulting from collective agreements, in order to respond to social and environmental needs."
"I should like to make it very clear, from the floor of this House, that it is precisely the voluntary basis of the action taken and of companies' response to the notion of social responsibility that is vital."
"As corporate social responsibility is based mainly on decisions taken by companies on a voluntary basis, I believe that the imposition of any kind of additional duties and administrative requirements would most probably prove counterproductive."
"It would also be at variance with the principles of better legal regulation and with efforts to simplify and improve the functioning of the European Union."
"It was with this in mind that I tabled 10 amendments to the text presented by Mr Howitt, and I am pleased that the spirit of these amendments has been incorporated into the compromise text proposed by the rapporteur."
"I should also like to take advantage of this opportunity to underline the importance of introducing methods for the exchange of good practice concerning implementation of the notion of corporate social responsibility."
"In practice this can be achieved in the framework of the European Alliance for Corporate Social Responsibility."
"From the floor of the House I would like to commend the European Commission on its commitment."
"The Commission recognises that the companies themselves are the main players on this stage, and has announced its support for this body, which represents a sound and open way of exchanging good practice between all types of companies be they large, small or medium-sized."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Howitt, on his systematic work and his constructive proposals."
"The concept of corporate social responsibility seems to be more topical than ever."
"On the one hand, the dramatic change in the climate, due in large part to the uncontrolled use and consumption of natural resources and, on the other hand, the worrying spread of poverty, in conjunction with the reversal of the demographic pyramid, appear to be the result of attempts to downgrade employment and overturn the social acquis."
"Nonetheless, if we want to flesh out the bones of this concept, at least three preconditions need to be met: firstly, the Commission needs to take serious account of the proposals tabled by Parliament."
"Secondly, it should be acknowledged that companies need to accept their responsibilities towards the environment, society and the workers which derive from their economic activity, without of course this being seen as a sacrifice on their part."
"Thirdly, priority should be given to supporting investments designed to promote workers' knowledge and the development of new technologies, especially those which are more environmentally friendly."
"Both these sectors should be seen as basic pillars of corporate social responsibility."
"Finally, this is an excellent opportunity to prove that the competitiveness must not be at the workers' expense, but must go hand in glove with respect for environmental equilibria, the promotion of dignified working conditions and social progress in general."
"Mr President, over the past seven years I have had the pleasure of debating CSR with Richard Howitt on and off for a considerable time."
"It has, of course, been a most enjoyable experience - as it says here!"
"It has certainly been a challenge, but I am sure he would be the first to admit - and I see him chortling over there - that it has been a challenge for both of us."
"I would like to thank him for the way that he has risen to that challenge, because clearly we have both been approaching this issue from slightly different standpoints, although in our ways, like all the other speakers, we are equally wishing to champion the cause of CSR."
"I should just like to take issue on two tiny points with which he opened his comments."
"Firstly, he said he was disappointed that the Commission report almost indicated that it was opting out. I disagree with that."
"I think its report was very positive and we should welcome it."
"Secondly, he said that he hoped that the Commission would help bring the NGOs back to the multi-stakeholder forum table."
"In fairness, it was neither the Commission nor the multi-stakeholders that encouraged them to leave."
"They themselves chose to leave."
"It is up to them whether they wish to come back or not."
"Some of them at least had a minority view - in a democracy that is perfectly permitted."
"However - if the interpreters can rise to this challenge - we should not allow the tail to wag the dog."
"It is up to the NGOs to return."
"I will not comment further on his speech, nor, indeed, make other comments in detail about colleagues' speeches other than to say I am sure the President and Commissioners are aware that - with no disrespect to any of my colleagues including myself - sometimes our speeches are for different audiences because we have to impress constituents back home."
"There is nothing wrong with that; we are politicians and that is something we have to do."
"However, I would invite you particularly, rather than just listen to us talk, to read what we say, to read what we are voting upon because the text is very significant."
"There are some aspects I still dislike about the text."
"I agree with Mrs Oviir from the ALDE Group in that I do not like the idea of an ombudsman, but it is an idea."
"There are a number of ideas that I do not particularly welcome, but they are ideas and all these ideas are generally worth serious consideration."
"However, the text is what is important."
"I particularly invite the Commission to think of the three reports: the original report that went to committee; the report that was amended and voted against by 15 members of the committee; and the final report as it is likely to emerge tomorrow."
"That report I believe will be very much on your side."
"If I may say so, Commissioners, I think you are a great double act."
"Tomorrow we will show we are a treble act and wish to follow your lead in advancing the cause of CSR."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, what seems clear first of all is that more and more companies see social and environmental responsibility as an opportunity, as an instrument for sustainable development, for growth and for creating jobs, and also as a good instrument for helping companies and workers to adapt better to the changes demanded by the globalised economy of the 21st century."
"I would like to comment on two issues in particular."
"Firstly, that it is clear that companies are the main players and that we must also take account of other parties such as consumers and non-governmental organisations."
"Above all, however, I believe that we must take account of the central role of unions, and codes of conduct cannot replace the crucial role of unions and collective negotiation under any circumstances."
"Secondly, it is clear that corporate social responsibility must be a factor that increases competitiveness, but behind the labels relating to corporate social responsibility there must be realities and not just mere propaganda."
"Otherwise, we will undermine them and consumers will not trust those labels and we will stop moving towards corporate social responsibility and its capacity to create more competitive companies."
"Many companies are currently making decisive efforts towards corporate social responsibility and they naturally know that it offers added value, and I am sure that those who do it in a clear and fair way will not object to it being verified by means of objective data."
"(HU) Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to welcome the report by my fellow Member Mr Howitt."
"The debate concerning corporate social responsibility is a very sensitive subject on which people are divided, since we would like to ensure a strong European social environment, while at the same time wishing to enhance the competitiveness of European companies."
"The current practice of corporate social responsibility, or CSR, is an excellent example of the fact that strengthening the social and environmental dimension does not necessarily mean a decline in companies' competitiveness."
"We need to strengthen the European social model, but we must avoid introducing a mandatory model based on a single pattern."
"A better regulated voluntary model offers greater opportunities both to producers and to consumers, rather than new administrative burdens that are difficult to bear."
"If we reinforce voluntary CSR by defining minimum standards with which we can avoid excessive increase in expenditure on the part of smaller companies, then this will be able to increase their competitiveness, provided consumers are sufficiently informed about CSR-type production and business practices."
"We need to increase consumer awareness and information, as this creates a market for responsible production."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission is grateful for the constructive and frank spirit of this debate."
"I would like to stress once more that Mr Howitt's report contains numerous valuable suggestions that the Commission will be happy to take into account in the further development of its policies on CSR."
"This will bring us, together, a good way further ahead."
"Businesses need a clear legal framework; they have to know what they have to do and what they must not do."
"If they do not, they cannot function on the market."
"Businesses have a social responsibility; that is why there are thousands of rules, at the European level and in the Member States, compelling companies to discharge their responsibility to society."
"All the legislation we have enacted - be it on the protection of consumers, health and safety at work, protection of the environment or social security benefits - is intended to compel social responsibility on the part of business and set standards that we believe absolutely have to be met."
"The intellectual problem we have with the debate we are having is that I, for one, find it difficult to imagine how we are supposed to fashion a legal framework for something that is not prescribed by law."
"The idea of creating a regulatory framework for CSR means that one would be enacting a law regulating how companies have to handle things that the law does not require them to handle."
"That is inherently contradictory, and the Commission really did want to put this debate behind it, and, for once, to see real progress being made; that is why, last year, we encouraged European businesses to get this Alliance for CSR up and running."
