"We are on track to deliver the EUR 1 billion we pledged in Tokyo for the period 2002 to 2006."
"If we think back to the chaos, devastation and repression in Afghanistan four years ago, it is clear that the country has made progress."
"Five million children are back in school, one-third of them girls."
"Eighty per cent of children have been vaccinated against measles and polio."
"Roads, schools and clinics are being built and many of them are already working."
"However, the situation is still fragile and the improvements are not yet fully sustainable."
"It is clear that the country still has a long way to go."
"More work is needed, particularly on good governance, the rule of law, security, counter-narcotics and development."
"I therefore very much welcome the idea floated by the United Nations at the end of August of a major international conference, hopefully early in 2006, to draw up the ‘post-Bonn compact’ between Afghanistan and the international community."
"The European Union will again be an important participant in the conference."
"What should the compact do?"
"It should focus particularly on Afghan ownership and sustainability."
"Lasting stabilisation will not be possible unless the Afghan side is willing and able to take greater responsibility for the transition process and for making it sustainable."
"The Bonn Agreement showed the value of clear-cut targets and timetables to ensure momentum."
"So we should aim to incorporate clear benchmarks in the post-Bonn compact."
"Some form of joint Afghan-international monitoring of progress would also be useful."
"The post-Bonn compact should be a two-way street: it should contain clear-cut commitments from the Afghan side and commitments from the international community to stay engaged financially, politically and militarily."
"Finally, I turn to the role of the European Union."
"The European Union and its Member States have been playing an important role in Afghanistan."
"Together we accounted for one-third of the USD 12.5 billion in grants pledged at the Tokyo and Bonn conferences."
"EU Member States are currently contributing 80% of the troops in ISAF."
"The EU Special Representative in Afghanistan, Francesc Vendrell, has been doing excellent work politically."
"Under the auspices of the British Presidency, we are currently discussing with President Karzai’s Government a joint declaration on an EU-Afghan partnership."
"It would be an important political signal of continuing EU commitment to Afghanistan."
"It would also make clear our expectations, the kind of further progress we want to support in Afghanistan in fields such as governance, development and human rights."
"My hope is that this can be concluded in the weeks ahead so that it would be in place ahead of any post-Bonn conference and could help to shape discussions there."
"Finally, I believe that the European Union is both entitled and obliged to play a major part in ensuring the success of the post-Bonn compact."
"The Commission will, in any case, remain engaged."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner."
"Firstly, on her positive and active commitment to the cause of democratic consolidation in Afghanistan; secondly, on having rightly sent an election observation mission to that country, which is experiencing very difficult circumstances."
"This has ensured the presence of the European Union, which is alive, despite the crisis we are experiencing and the debate we have held this evening, with the President-in-Office of the Council, the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair, and clearly demonstrates that we are not entirely wrapped up in our contemplation of our own problems, but that we are showing solidarity with the problems of other countries that are suffering and that have experienced extremely difficult circumstances, as in the case of Afghanistan."
"I am glad that the members of the European Parliament’s delegation are here in this debate."
"I can see Mr Evans, Mrs Scheele, my friend Philippe Morillon, Mrs Nicholson and Mr Schröder."
"I would like to take advantage of this debate in the plenum of our Parliament, as we did in the press conference that we held with Emma Bonino in Afghanistan, to pay tribute to the candidates who died in this electoral process, to the electoral agents, and, above all, to the European Union citizens who lost their lives in this noble task of contributing to the cause of democratic consolidation in that country."
"I am thinking of the French soldier who lost his life at the very time we were carrying out our mission and also the seventeen brave Spanish soldiers who died in a helicopter accident, in honour of whom we expressed our gratitude and recognition during our visit to Herat, the base where they had their general headquarters, and also our visit to the Governor, the President, the authorities of the United Nations, women candidates and the General Head of the NATO forces in that country."
"From a general point of view, I would like to say that our mission of Members of the European Parliament fully agreed with the conclusions resulting from the extraordinary work carried out by Emma Bonino, and also, from a political point of view, we expressed our view of the priorities that the European Union should set for the future."
"We believe fundamentally in the democratic consolidation of that country, from an institutional point of view and in terms of respect for human rights and, in particular, the rights of women; because democratic development cannot be achieved in a country without the contribution of its men and women and their right to determine their own future."
"Madam President, the European Parliament’s delegation expressed its opinion that our Parliament should contribute to the post-Bonn Process, hosting and organising a broad conference with the participation of the Commission, of the Member States participating in the joint actions of NATO and, of course, of the new representatives in the Afghan Parliament, so that in this way they can go on defining and marking out their own future."
"We also believe that it was important for the European Parliament to give its full support to the joint statement that the Commission is going to sign with the new authorities and with the Afghan Government, and to provide an institutional framework and a channel for the broad and generous cooperation our Parliament has been demonstrating."
"Furthermore, we would call upon the Commission to consider whether in the future we should establish a broad association agreement which could provide and guide an institutional format for cooperation in the future."
"Madam President, we feel greatly reassured following the statement by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, in which she said that the European Union will continue to contribute to the dividends of peace, understanding, agreement and reconciliation in Afghanistan, which to date has suffered so much agony."
"I shall end, Madam President, by thanking Emma Bonino, with whom we have worked in magnificent harmony, for the hospitality and support she offered to the European Parliament’s delegation."
". Madam President, last month’s elections in Afghanistan were an important milestone and I echo the tributes paid to Mrs Bonino and her colleagues for all the work they did."
"After all, these were the first parliamentary elections to be held there since 1979."
"The turnout, greater than 50%, compares favourably with other electoral contests around the world."
"There were problems, but those – not necessarily in this House – who want to criticise need to remember the starting point, and the Commissioner’s words ‘chaos’ and ‘devastation’ really summed it up."
"Whilst Afghanistan may now still be far from perfect, it has come a long way."
"We, as an election observation team, were very proud to witness not just women coming to the polling stations to vote – many choosing not to wear the burkha, as is their choice – but many women election officials and women standing as candidates."
"We know now that many women were elected."
"So Afghanistan, for all its problems, has come a long way."
"On the list, one of the first names to be announced as elected was the women’s rights activist Malalai Joya."
"She will be one of 62 women members in the parliament, a major achievement and unthinkable a little while back."
"Some of them were elected in their own right, and some of them by virtue of the ‘25% women’ rule."
"However, some of the ghosts of Afghanistan’s brutal past have re-emerged as other results have trickled in."
"When we were there observing the elections, President Karzai explained to us his choice, or choice, of electoral system – to which the Commissioner has also referred – based on a single non-transferable vote."
"This entails no public political party support on the ballot papers but presents the voters with a list of quite literally hundreds of names from which to choose."
"Hidden in those lists of names are people who could best be described as having less than satisfactory records, some implicated by human rights groups in war crimes."
"Former Taliban governor Mawlawi Mohammadi, who, if not personally responsible, at least oversaw the destruction of the Buddha statues, was elected in one province on less than 10% of the vote, which arguably is a flaw in the system."
"Mullah Raketi, commander of a Taliban military unit, was elected in another."
"So the task now facing President Karzai is not an easy one."
"It is to help those disparate forces form a useful, workable and effective legislative body."
"One of the challenges facing them, but a vital one, is to address the country’s serious drug problem, to which the Commissioner again referred."
"The army, the police and the law enforcement agencies need to work together with all the international bodies to look at alternatives for the poppy growers."
"Another is to address the frightening availability of weapons, which was very visible to us in Kabul and around Afghanistan."
"Last year, the Dutch Presidency made much of its plans for supporting and helping Afghanistan."
"These plans must not be forgotten."
"The Election Observation Mission of which I was proud to be part must be part of a longer, deeper process of support for Afghanistan."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to take this opportunity to thank on behalf of this House the members of my core team, the long-term observers, and the people who spent four months with me in this extraordinary but very difficult country, in conditions sometimes very tense and unusual, and also very emotional and not particularly easy."
"You will never see them but they do exist, and they were there under a European flag."
"I believe they did a good job in representing the support for democracy that is the common ground between us all and the fundamental value we wish to uphold."
"The Mission, in short, will make public, after consulting the Commission, its final report on the elections; we shall also undertake, again after consultation, to draw up for the first time a report on democratisation and its future steps."
"Naturally, the whole electoral process had its awkward moments, which, moreover, we had already anticipated in the preliminary statement, but there were also moments of concern, for example the arrest of Mohaqui Nasab – a journalist who edits a weekly publication on women’s rights – which was declared illegal even by the representative of the Media Commission of the Afghan authorities."
"I believe that to be a cause for concern, and I hope that the European institutions will let it be known to our Afghan friends and the authorities of the country, or will remind them of the need to respect both the law and the rule of law."
"Moreover, with regard, as you said, to future follow-up to the Bonn Conference, I would like to emphasise two things."
"Firstly, we have to be aware that this is at least a medium- to long-term commitment, whichever formula is adopted."
"Secondly, I would like to emphasise the regional dimension, which is so important to the whole success of Afghanistan."
"Whether one talks about security, or commerce, or economic development, the regional dimension is definitely an element to take into account."
"It is also true, though, that Afghanistan is one of the countries to which international commitment, particularly from Europe, can make a difference."
"Afghanistan is a country trapped between a possible future and a very outmoded past. In my opinion, though, it possesses the human resources to look to the future."
"When thousands of young girls can be seen coming out of school in black uniforms and white headscarves, with normal books in their pockets, I believe this is the future, even though it may yet be many years before it is fully realised."
"It is precisely in areas like this, however, that we can make a difference, though not on our own."
"Our American friends must also remain in the country at a time when there are still difficulties on the security front, while hopefully behaving more respectfully towards local traditions, which is something that does not always happen."
"I remain convinced, though, that a future is possible."
"It depends on the Afghans, of course, but it also depends on us."
"I believe that this is the hope and commitment that motivated your visit to us, as well as the visit of the European delegation and our presence there over so many weeks, a presence which, in my opinion, also earned the respect and gratitude of the Afghan people themselves."
"Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to apologise on behalf of my colleague Mrs Beer, who is unfortunately unable to take part in this debate and who would have liked to have been here."
"As our fellow Members have said, I think that we can be very pleased with the course of the parliamentary elections in Afghanistan on 18 September 2005."
"Even though there has been some violence in recent months, especially against candidates and tellers, the elections themselves took place in a non-violent atmosphere."
"That is a good sign for the journey towards democracy and the rule of law in Afghanistan."
"At present, as Europeans, we need to clarify our commitments on the ground."
"We support an extension of the ISAF’s mission, because that mission is reconstruction and nation building."
"This mission is an important one, Commissioner, because it creates a favourable climate for the development of the country following decades of conflict."
"In this regard, one very important point must be stressed: we must not mix up the two missions, that of the ISAF and that of Operation Enduring Freedom."
"The latter, which is led by the United States, seeks to combat terrorism, in other words the Taliban."
"These are combat operations."
"If we mix up the two reconstruction missions, we will lose the trust of the population and tarnish the good reputation of this mission."
"Moreover, it will make the situation very difficult for the NGOs, which are currently cooperating with ISAF."
"We must also raise the issue, as you did, Commissioner, of drugs in the country."
"We need a plan that takes account of all aspects connected with this problem, which equally affects the agricultural and health sectors and the Afghan economy in general."
"Of course, this problem also affects neighbouring countries."
"I would like to make one final important point."
"The current government of President Karzai has signed contracts for US troops to be stationed in Afghanistan indefinitely."
"We do not consider this to be a good thing for the stability of the region."
"Once the nation building has been completed, Afghanistan will be a sovereign state that will have no need for foreign troops."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret to say that I was unable to participate in the elections in Afghanistan: I would have done so most willingly, but Parliament’s d’Hondt system did not permit me."
"I am truly convinced that the changes underway in Afghanistan are concrete, effective and real."
"They are, however, slow, difficult and complicated."
"An example of the growth of democracy comes, in fact, from a girl, Malalaia Joya, a 26-year-old whom I got to know when she was an 18-year-old in Afghanistan, secretly involved in women’s education, and who has now been elected into a difficult province in Afghanistan."
"It was she who, amongst other things, said two years ago in the Loya Jirga, with great clarity: ‘The warlords are still here.’"
"The fact that a woman like this, with all the hardship and intimidation she must have suffered, can succeed in being elected – and I am sure she will contribute towards the building of democracy in Afghanistan – is an extraordinary fact, and why in my opinion these elections have been positive."
"I too would like to thank Mrs Bonino – whom I trust, even though we disagree on many issues, such as the Middle East, but in whose democratic nature I have total faith – for her presence in Afghanistan, and I am delighted that the European Union was able to play so positive a role."
"If Malalaia Joya is an example of the new Afghanistan, so too is Omar, a boy I got to know when the Taliban were still there, and who said: ‘I want to live: it is not only for the women that I am fighting against the Taliban, it is also for myself, because I do not want to have a beard and I want to listen to music.’"
"He too has been elected, which represents, to my mind, another extremely positive fact."
"We cannot, however, ignore the complex and difficult choices faced by President Karzai, who has not in fact chosen to punish the warlords, as Human Rights Watch, for example, would have him do, but rather has gone down what is perhaps the only road currently available to him, namely permitting the warlords to be elected as well."
"I believe, furthermore, that there is a serious problem with, for example, the International Security Assistance Force, which is undeniably playing an extremely positive role, though I personally am against all war and all military involvement."
"The role, however, carried out by the US forces is unhelpful to conflict resolution, reconciliation, and the development of Afghanistan."
"I am not just referring to the horror of seeing the two burnt Taliban bodies – or so-called Taliban, because in the end they are all considered such – but am referring to the absence of lawfulness and lack of rules, seen, for example, in the prison at Bagram, where the Taliban are being held with no system of checks."
"It is precisely because we need to reason, understand and change together that I believe we should not hide away from truths which, judging by the reactions of the Afghans that we have seen on television, may create conflict."
"In that regard, I believe the role played by the EU is very important in this matter."
"I wish to thank not only the Commissioner but also the whole European Union, which is working in an alternative way to ensure that Afghanistan is favourable towards democracy."
"In order to achieve this objective, however, we need to work very hard to support public institutions, so that both NGOs and civil society may somehow make themselves heard."
"– So far Afghanistan is the only case where a terrorist organisation has started a war with the world's most powerful democratic state and had a known address."
"That address was a backward state, which guarded a specific terrorist organisation, that was the Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban party."
"Thus, the democratic alliance was able to target its retaliatory blow at a defined geographical point that removed the tyranny of the Taliban and opened up the prospect of democracy to the Afghan people."
"Indeed, one could not fail to be moved by the sight of vast numbers of ordinary people, especially women from the countryside, going for the first time in their lives to vote for the hope of a better system, freedom and respect for all people."
"We will see that, although they may have supporters, following the removal of the Taliban, none of the terrorist organisations repeat the mistake of providing visiting cards with a specific address to be hit."
"They have forced others into a situation where all they can do is defend themselves and even more confusion is created when terrorists from Jordan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, who are active in Iraq, are called not invaders, but insurgents."
"However, Afghanistan, having become the first theatre of the global war on terror, is already creating a true democracy."
"Iraq is now the fatal front line of the fanatics' total war against the West, while Afghanistan is now almost behind the front."
"Nevertheless, the opportunity for democracy and human rights in Afghanistan is a great test for everybody."
"The European Union has made a significant contribution and the whole of Europe must lend a hand in the historic construction of this new state."
"I am proud that my country Lithuania is helping to do this by taking responsibility for one whole region."
"Lithuanians are helping to build the new Afghanistan."
"More European states could do the same."
"Success in Afghanistan will represent the first defeat of the front of global terrorists, as well as the hope that this new type of totalitarian aggression can be repelled."
"Thank you."
"Madam President, speaking as one of the members of the delegation that was sent to observe the elections, I would like to extend the warmest of thanks to our chairman Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, for the good work done by the delegation in Afghanistan, and also, of course, to Emma Bonino, who led the EU’s observation mission, and to the European Union’s long-term observers, who did a splendid job, and are continuing to do so to some extent."
"As many of us have already, today, emphasised the importance of these elections as a stage in Afghanistan’s democratic process, I would now like to concentrate on the single issue of Afghan women’s involvement in political life."
"We did of course read a great deal, while the Taliban regime was in power, about the oppression of Afghan women, and it gives great joy to see from the election results that women make up 27% of the future members of parliament."
"The 25% quota for women has been very useful in this respect."
"Nevertheless, I have no desire to pass over the obvious fact that it will not be enough to have the quota in place and to keep the donor countries quiet if, in future, Afghan women are to participate more in political life and see their social position continue to improve."
"It is evident from the social indicators that the situation is still very difficult."
"It is significant that the leader of our delegation, Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, told a press conference in Afghanistan that the European Union will, in monitoring developments in Afghanistan, take a very close look at human rights, and the rights of women in particular."
"Mention must also be made of the conditions under which some non-governmental organisations are obliged to operate in Afghanistan."
"The Commission must make it abundantly clear that NGOs will always be our partners, in order that they may not be subject to repression."
"Madam President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner struck exactly the right note at the beginning of her speech when she said that this was an historic occasion: the first election for decades and the first parliamentary election in which we believe women were ever allowed to take part."
"I personally found it a great honour to be a member of the team that was able to witness this momentous event."
"I want to thank very warmly our good colleague, Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, who led us so wonderfully well."
"This is the second time I have worked closely with him in an election; we were in Lebanon together just before that."
"I also want to thank my long-time colleague whom I have always admired, Mrs Bonino, who has been committed to Afghanistan for so long."
"She was brave enough to go there while the Taliban were in power."
"Very few women would have shown her courage and commitment, and she is continuing her work."
"I chose to monitor the women-only polling stations."
"I saw thousands of women, most in burkhas with their faces shrouded."
"Of course, they rolled them back when they came into the women-only polling booths."
"They could not do a great deal once they were there."
"Some spent half an hour puzzling frantically, trying to understand what the piece of paper in front of them meant, what to do and how to make a mark."
"They had no education."
"Let us not forget that Afghanistan is one of the two poorest nations in the world."
"Its health statistics are comparable only to Somalia’s."
"We will be helping Afghanistan for years to come with education, preventive health care – the basics."
"It is right and proper that we should do so."
"However, we should also remember those from the European Union who have already given their lives for Afghanistan."
"Led by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, we witnessed a wonderful, moving tribute to the deaths of the 17 Spanish troops, whose names will be enshrined forever where they died."
"They sacrificed their lives for the future of the people of Afghanistan."
"We cannot give up."
"The country is desperately poor."
"We shall be there for a very long time, but it is the sort of job to which the European Union is wonderfully suited."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the people of Afghanistan, for decades now, have been paying with blood and tremendous destruction the for continuing interventions of imperialism, because the country is of major geo-strategic importance."
"The hypocritical interest of the American and European imperialists in the terrorist attack, human rights and democracy in Afghanistan is an insult and mockery of history, because it was they who supported politically, morally, financially and militarily the blindest and most reactionary of forces, in order to block the path of the Afghan people towards progress and turn the country into an advanced military base."
"The war unleashed in 2001 by the United States of America and ΝΑΤΟ, with the assent of the European Union, has as its objective to achieve military and political control of the country which is today under occupation."
"Thus one of the biggest bases of the United States of America has been constructed, threatening neighbouring countries."
"The country is prey to the power-crazy servants of the USA and the only development to be seen is the cultivation of and trade in opium."
"The efforts by the occupying armies of the USA and the countries of the European Union are directed at stabilising forces and governments over which they will have absolute control."
"The precondition for any prospect of a solution for the benefit of the people is for all the occupying forces to leave and for the people themselves, in the midst of really tremendous difficulties, to seek paths to peace and independence."
"Madam President, I should like to pay tribute to the Commissioner and to Mrs Bonino for her proactive approach."
"I should also like to pay tribute to Mr Salafranca, who headed the delegation, for his work."
"This issue is one of extreme complexity."
"Afghanistan can look back on a proud history during which the Afghan highlanders fought against invaders."
"At the same time, however, there can be no question that in some senses the country could be said to export drugs to the rest of the world."
"I am glad that the European Union is not turning its back on Afghanistan, and that the European taxpayer, to put it quite bluntly, is funding measures to promote democracy in a country that would appear to have been forgotten by God and the world."
"It goes without saying that it would be nothing short of disastrous if the Americans were the only ones to take any interest in Afghanistan."
"Regardless of the cost, I am glad that the European Union is funding the arduous and long-winded process of democracy-building in Afghanistan, and that we provided genuine assistance during the recent elections."
"I believe that this was a turning point, although it remains to be seen how long the trend will continue."
"We should obviously bear in mind the fact that a large number of countries exert an influence over Afghanistan, whether in political or economic terms."
"It is worth noting that the country is undoubtedly a focus of Iranian and also Pakistani interests, as well as of American interests."
"Mention should also be made of the quite incredible fact that the vast majority of Afghanistan’s revenue comes from the drugs trade, with the state budget only covering one third of civil servants’ salaries."
"Without US and EU aid the country would quite simply not exist."
"We should ask ourselves a very straightforward question, namely whether Afghanistan would not export terrorism to the rest of the world to an even greater extent than it does now if we did not provide it with financial aid."
"I believe that it is worth lending our support to the process of democratisation in the country."
"There is a further point that needs to be made."
"It is a well-known fact that Europeans are more highly valued, or perhaps more accepted in Afghanistan than our American friends."
"This is a signal of sorts that the EU should concern itself more with Afghanistan, and that we should maintain our presence in the country."
"I should like to thank all the Members of the House who flew the European Union’s flag in Afghanistan, and showed the Afghan people that we want to help them."
"I believe that this debate is proof of Parliament’s interest in this key issue."
"Afghanistan is not some far-off land, but a truly European problem."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by warmly thanking Mrs Bonino and Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra for having done such a good job of leading us in Kabul."
"I would also like to express my gratitude to all the Members of this House who were with us there."
"Perhaps I might be permitted to return to one subject that has cropped up a number of times this evening, namely the criticisms that are levelled at Afghanistan, a country that I think has made a gigantic leap forward and is in the process of making more of them."
"We should be very, very judicious in our criticisms; we Europeans have no good cause to point the finger at this country, which has suffered so much, and say who should be punished and what has gone wrong."
"To be sure, many things have gone wrong, and many more have yet to do so, but let us consider the history of Europe over the past century, that of my own country for example: even in the old Federal Republic, after the Second World War, many people with links to the old regime were accepted into the civil service and spent their careers in it."
"Recently, too, the West – to which we belong – has cosied up to the former Soviet ; being on friendly terms with former KGB bosses has become something to be boasted about, and so on and so forth."
"I would warn against our constantly telling the Afghans, from a position such as our own, what they have to do."
"A lot of very good things are happening;"
"I was most especially impressed by the high degree of open-mindedness and commitment shown by the young people."
"There were very many young people helping out in the polling stations, and, when we asked them what they wanted, they said, ‘We want education, education, education’."
"I shall conclude by saying that I would very much like to see this House set up a delegation for relations with Afghanistan, for I believe that to be the best way for us to help the parliamentarians there."
"Madam President, I should like to pay tribute to the Afghan people and to the country’s authorities, in particular President Karzai, for having succeeded in holding free elections."
"These are a crucial step towards the establishment of democracy and peace in Afghanistan."
"Five thousand seven hundred candidates stood in the elections held on 18 September of this year to provincial councils and to the Wolesi Jirga, which is the Lower House of the National Assembly, and this figure included 575 women."
"The scale of the problems faced in holding the elections can be gauged from the fact that 26 000 polling stations were opened throughout the country."
"The ballot paper for Kabul, to cite but one example, took up seven pages, and included 617 candidates standing for the 62 seats in the constituency."
"30% of seats in the Wolesi Jirga and the provincial councils are reserved for women."
"While the number of women voting in the presidential elections in 2004 was over three million, over 7000 new female voters registered for this year’s elections, representing 44% of newly-registered voters."
"This is only the first step towards democracy in Afghanistan."
"Parliament’s pre-election mission, which visited Afghanistan on 14-19 July of this year under the leadership of Mr Brok, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Mrs Morgantini, Chairman of the Committee on Development, held meetings with election candidates, women’s organisations, human rights groups and NGOs in Kabul, Herat and Bamiyan."
"The people we met were hopeful that democracy would be victorious, although they also expressed concerns about threats to this process."
"As I see it, the key threats are the state of security in the country, violence against women and corruption."
"Many former military leaders accused of human rights violations or even crimes ran for election and gained seats."
"There is also a risk that criminal elements, above all drug barons and smugglers, will gain an influence over politics in the country."
"The European Union must do everything in its power to stabilise democracy and the re-emerging civil society in Afghanistan."
"Madam President, Commissioner, when, last month, I accompanied the delegation led by my fellow Member and friend Mr Salafranca, it was the fifth time in five years that I was returning to this territory, where I have not only visited the capital, but also travelled through most of the country, from the Panjshir valley in the north, to Kandahar, the capital of the Pashtun south, via Herat, Mazar-e Sharif and Bamiyan, the site of the giant Buddhas that fell victim in 2001 to the barbaric stupidity of the Taliban."
"On each occasion, I have been struck by the desire for peace and reconciliation felt by the vast majority of the population, a population that has had enough of violence after 30 years of civil war and international war, a population, moreover, that has been vaccinated against any risk of Islamic fundamentalists returning to power, following their suffering under the regime of Mullah Omar."
"At each new contact, I can also see how difficult the task of reconstruction still is and how necessary it therefore is for the European Union to continue to provide aid."
"I will only mention here one aspect of this aid, relating to the restoration of security, which is still too frequently under threat in some provinces."
"This aid is currently provided by the joint efforts of the national army of Afghanistan and international forces, which are themselves divided into two categories, with different mandates: the coalition, under US command, operating essentially around the border with Pakistan, and the ISAF which, as you said, has a large European majority and is gradually being deployed throughout the rest of the country."
"This duality is a source of inefficiency: I welcome the fact that NATO is now planning to bring the mission under a single command, under a new mandate from the United Nations."
"When it comes to discussing the terms for this, I would like, Commissioner, to act as an interpreter for the Afghan people themselves: they insist on the urgent need for protection from the interference of their neighbours in Pakistan and Iran, and believe that, once this is achieved, they will be able to solve their own problems between themselves."
". Madam President, I would like to comment on a few points which have arisen from the debate."
"One such point is the question of human rights abusers who have been elected to parliament, because this is something that concerns us all."
"Unfortunately, Afghanistan has not embarked with any ease on a process to come to terms with its past, and I hope it will take its time."
"In such circumstances, it is deeply regrettable, but probably inevitable, that this first post-conflict election will result in some questionable individuals being elected to parliament."
"Politically, the key question is how much influence these individuals will have in parliament, and I think it is too early to judge, since the voting system, as many have mentioned, myself included, is very complicated."
"There are no clear party blocks."
"Parliament will certainly be very fragmented."
"I would also like to highlight some positive aspects about some of the people who were elected."
"There were courageous people with a record of standing up for justice and human rights in Afghanistan who also managed to get elected, including, as many of you mentioned, quite a significant number of women."
"I met some of the women candidates and, admittedly, I was really surprised and I very much appreciated their courage."
"When I met them, they said that they had been out working with many women, and I am sure they all said ‘we will get elected’."
"Ultimately, that has proved to be the case."
"That is a very positive development."
"Furthermore, it is also positive to note that, although a few Taliban were elected, many prominent Taliban were not successful in the elections."
"The former foreign minister, the former deputy interior minister and the former deputy justice minister were all defeated."
"I am sure that the voters knew whom they should not vote for."
"I would also like to say a few words about drugs."
"We realise that the drug question is still a very important one."
"We have also discussed it with President Karzai and are working with the UK Presidency to see what we can do in the future to tackle this problem even more robustly on two fronts – the first of which is alternative plantations, the second being justice and law – which are to be reinforced."
"Finally, education is one of the key questions."
"I would like to put my finger on that issue for future programmes, not only because it applies to the whole of society, but specifically because, over many decades, women did not have any opportunities and we have to compensate for that in some way."
"In 2004 alone, we built 50 schools and childcare institutions."
"We also have a specific project for street children."
"I visited this project and, again, I must say that I saw how much courage and enthusiasm there is among the young children, the beautiful girls and really handsome boys who have a future."
"They want to get off the streets where they are normally selling vegetables and other small things."
"I agree that education and healthcare will be the key issues, and we will certainly continue to put our emphasis on those issues."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the November part-session."
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the situation in Azerbaijan before the elections."
". Madam President, Azerbaijan is one the European Union’s key partners in the Southern Caucasus region, principally due to its geostrategic location and energy resources."
"Last year we therefore proposed to the Council that Azerbaijan, together with Armenia and Georgia, be included in the European Neighbourhood Policy in order to further strengthen our relations, building on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in force since July 1999."
"The Commission has been following the preparations for the parliamentary elections of 6 November 2005 with great attention and some concern."
"The events last week, such a short time before the elections, are a source of further concern."
"Some Azeri Government ministers were dismissed by President Ilham Aliyev and subsequently arrested on charges ranging from corruption and embezzlement of state funds to an attempt to stage a coup d’état."
"We cannot make any judgement on these accusations, nor are we willing to interfere with the decisions to be taken by the Azerbaijani judiciary."
"However, we wish to point out that it will be crucial for Azerbaijan to carry out, in a very transparent way, fair and thorough investigations and, if necessary, a balanced trial in order to establish the truth."
"The arrests are inevitably contributing to a worrying deterioration in the atmosphere of the electoral campaign."
"Unfortunately the campaign has already been marked by several episodes of violence and some specific incidents."
"As a consequence of this climate, we have learnt of dozens of candidates who have withdrawn in the last hours."
"Access to State and public TV is no longer being granted to opposition parties, or it is subject to so many restrictions that it cannot be considered satisfactory."
"In all the contacts the Commission has had recently with the Azeri authorities, we have strongly insisted on respect for fundamental freedoms, including, of course, freedom of expression and the possibility for political parties to hold public rallies without undue restrictions and to access mass media."
"We have also stressed several times, to opposition representatives as well, the need for such rights to be exercised in a moderate and peaceful way."
"We fully concur with the assessment of the electoral campaign by the OSCE-ODIHR in the two interim reports published so far."
"It cannot be denied that some progress has been made compared with the parliamentary elections of 2000 and the presidential elections of 2003."
"More candidates than ever were registered; state authorities have proved cooperative with international observers; all parties have been granted some access to television."
"Finally, we welcome the decision by the Azeri authorities to introduce systems such as finger-inking that could dramatically reduce the possibility of multiple voting, although this came very late."
"Whilst on the one hand commending Azerbaijan for this progress, we agree with OSCE-ODIHR that it might not be sufficient."
"The worrying deterioration in the climate of the electoral campaign over the last few days threatens to completely overshadow this limited progress."
"We will continue to monitor the situation very closely throughout the electoral campaign, on the day of the election and in the aftermath on 6 November."
"In accordance with our well-established practice, we will not deploy a separate Election Observation Mission; as with the OSCE countries, support will be given to the OSCE office and the ODIHR office which will take on that task."
"As we have stressed several times recently, these elections will be a litmus test for Azerbaijan and its aspirations to come closer to the European Union in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"On the question of the Neighbourhood Policy, I can only say that we will start consulting on the action plans in the near future."
"We hope that we might be able to work out satisfactory action plans by next year."
". Madam President, last June I spoke in plenary in the human rights debate."
"The situation in Azerbaijan at the time was particularly serious, with allegations that the government was holding political prisoners and indeed that torture and ill-treatment in custody was common."
"This time I speak as the resolution’s co-author, as I am being sent to Baku by this Parliament as an official observer for the 6 November elections."
"But I also wear the hat of the European Parliament’s rapporteur for the European Neighbourhood Policy, which is now being extended to the three Caucasus republics."
"I welcome President Aliyev’s decree which, theoretically at least, orders state officials in the Central Electoral Commission to observe and implement free, fair and transparent elections."
"I also believe that the recent dismissal of the old guard hard-line ministers resistant to political change, like the former health minister Ali Insanov, suggests that the dominant pro-government YAP party finally realises that the time has come to manage the transition peacefully to multi-party democracy and bring Azerbaijan closer to European democratic practices."
"The newly-elected parliament will no doubt be more mixed politically, with so many registered candidates to choose from, and will have new, younger and more independent technocratic MPs as well."
"The system of government is still heavily presidential, so the parliamentary election will be more of a test of willingness by the state to commit itself permanently to western-style democracy, rather than a real change in the exercise of power which will only come about in 2008 at the next presidential election."
"Nevertheless, there are still grounds for concern in terms of press freedom, balanced political access to the media, and the right of free assembly and protest."
"It is also true that Azerbaijan is still affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh unresolved frozen conflict which can only be resolved peacefully by dialogue through the Minsk Group."
"I regret the huge rise in military expenditure in the region and threats of escalation and a fresh outbreak of hostilities."
"Azerbaijan will shortly enjoy a huge injection of funds, as oil – now at historically high prices – will flow from Baku via Tbilisi to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan."
"It is important that this money be used to enrich the entire country fairly, and there must be transparency and a renewed commitment by the government to fight public corruption."
"Lastly, I hope that the action plan negotiations with Azerbaijan will shortly be resumed, once the direct air links to Turkish-occupied Northern Cyprus are discontinued, as this matter is clearly of deep concern to the Republic of Cyprus as an EU Member State."
"I, as the co-author for my political group, commend this resolution to the House."
"It will send a strong message to the Government of Azerbaijan about where this House stands and the European Parliament’s hopes in particular for that country’s democratic future."
". Madam President, I am obliged to the Commissioner for painting a picture that is very rich in light and shade."
"We can indeed point to some advances, and they are deserving of mention and praise, but there has, recently, been a great deal of renewed nervousness, resulting in a number of measures that are not really compatible with free elections."
"It is quite crucial that we should observe elections not only on the day on which people go to the polls – where some of the measures to which you referred could indeed bring improvements – but also in the period leading up to it; we should observe the transparency of the processes, the degree to which access to the media is possible, and what scope there is for the opposition to develop and expand."
"Our delegation’s cooperation with the parliament of Azerbaijan gave us the opportunity to discuss a variety of circumstances that gave us a great deal of food for thought."
"The country’s ambassador had a job to explain why opposition rallies kept on being cancelled or rescheduled or had to be held on the outskirts of Baku, which must surely have hindered the opposition in its attempts to present its programme and candidates during the run-up to the election."
"I am, therefore, far from surprised to learn from what you said that a number of intending candidates had changed their minds because they felt that neither the campaign nor the elections were fair."
"Azerbaijan will have to accept that it needs to make great advances towards democracy and transparency."
"There is no doubting that it has a difficult process of transformation ahead of it, but – the smouldering conflict over Nagorno Karabakh notwithstanding – these steps must be taken."
"Something that struck us during our visit to Azerbaijan – and it was something of which we had to take note – was that the fact that the country was living in times of great conflict was the standard reason given for the constant obstruction of measures intended to foster modernisation, transparency and democracy."
"We realise that it is in Azerbaijan’s interest that the conflict should be resolved, and we do of course hope that it can be, but it must not be allowed to prevent the government from modernising and further developing the country’s internal structures."
"You mentioned media access; the media have great problems to contend with, not least as regards their own safety."
"The safety of critically-minded and free-thinking journalists cannot be guaranteed; one who comes to my mind is the late Elmar Huseynov, whose murder has still not yet been satisfactorily investigated."
"We would of course welcome a much more determined approach to such things on the part of Azerbaijan."
"There is something else I should like to mention in this connection."
"Azerbaijan is now, thanks to the rapid increase in its oil revenues, in a position to raise a great deal more additional funds."
"We heard it said during the course of our visit that we can no longer, through our European Neighbourhood Policy, exert any real leverage, as the country is no longer dependent on European funds."
"It should be obvious to Azerbaijan that its people’s own interests demand that social and economic progress be ensured, and that, if this is to be done, then much more investment will be needed, for which, in turn, more transparency, public access and democracy are prerequisites."
"Commissioner, you are quite right in the things you say, and I would like to endorse them."
"We – by which I mean the Commission and this House – should, together, do everything possible to ensure that, in post-election Azerbaijan, the new parliament can put more important reforms into effect."
"It is in the interests of that country’s people that we should not stint in our efforts to that end."
". Madam President, the third parliamentary elections since independence are taking place against a background that is deeply discouraging in this autocratic and corrupt system."
"Violence and harassment are being meted out to opposition supporters, journalists and human rights activists."
"Prominent opposition leader Rasul Guliyev was allowed to register as a candidate, but the authorities then refused to let him return to Baku and had him arrested in Ukraine."
"I recently helped to free a member of his family."
"A British citizen and a constituent of mine, she was detained in Baku when customs officials claimed to ‘discover’ a gun – clearly planted – in her luggage."
"She suffered chronic ill health as a result of being detained and is now recovering."
"There has been a temptation for the West – Europe and the United States – to stress continuity and so-called stability."
"They have an eye on the oil, the new Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline having been opened last May by BP Chairman Lord Browne."
"Foreign criticism of the 2003 presidential elections and 2004 local elections, which were deeply flawed, was inexcusably muted."
"Have we not learnt that there can be no real stability without democracy, the rule of law and an honest economy?"
"This time the European Union needs to send a very strong signal that there cannot be a partnership with Azerbaijan without democracy and human rights there."
"President Aliyev has to decide whether to embrace the democratic process or try to maintain autocratic rule with just a thin veneer of legitimacy."
"We need to tell him that, if he wants the European Union as a friend, there is only one choice."
". Madam President, your proposals do indeed show, Commissioner, that there really is something lacking in Baku."
"There really is a need for a delegation from the Commission to follow our policies, in order to help Azerbaijan – because it is true that the situation there is not exactly great – and so that, in a few months’ time, we can put this country back on the agenda."
"Indeed, now more than ever, Azerbaijan is facing its destiny."
"That country must now show the international community that it can be regarded as a democracy, and that it can follow the rules."
"Azerbaijan must follow the path of a state under the rule of law."
"In joining the Council of Europe, Azerbaijan has not only turned towards Europe, but has signed up to its values of democracy and human rights, which bring us all together here."
"Today, the European Union and Azerbaijan, just like the two neighbouring countries in the Southern Caucasus, are truly forging a joint path, because they are taking part in the new Neighbourhood Policy."
"As such, they have new rights and obligations."
"The message that the European Parliament must send to our Azerbaijani friends is clear: if this country wants to become a true democracy, free and transparent elections are a milestone for this."
"These parliamentary elections, which will be held on 6 November, must take place transparently and according to the rules, with neither pressure nor repression."
"During the pre-campaign phase and at the moment, however, we have seen an increase in police repression, which is unacceptable."
"The brutality, violence and intimidation observed against the opposition and their lack of access to the media are unacceptable."
"In our previous resolution, we called on the two sides, the government majority and the opposition, not to resort to violence, so that the electoral campaign could take place under the best possible conditions."
"We all had reason to be optimistic at that time, following the presidential decree last May organising these coming elections."
"We were also optimistic to see the number of candidates registering for the 125 constituencies; even dissidents were allowed to participate!"
"Today, however, as you have said, we cannot fail to notice that, as the elections approach, tensions are mounting and the rules laid down are not being applied at all."
"By sending a delegation of MEPs to monitor the smooth running of the ballot, the European Parliament is showing its interest and its desire to support the ongoing democratic process in Azerbaijan."
"Today, we must call on all the parties contesting the election, particularly the majority in power, to demonstrate that this country is able to achieve its ambition: to hold free and transparent elections, in which every citizen, using his single ballot paper, can choose the candidates that will run the country in future."
"I would remind you – because this is very important, Madam President – that the challenges in Azerbaijan are immense: finding a resolution to the frozen conflict in Nagorny-Karabakh, the increasing power ..."
". Commissioner, after listening to your introductory remarks, I found it hard to believe that you would go on to talk about Azerbaijan."
"Even one hundred years ago, Azerbaijan was an incredibly rich country by reputation alone, although Baku was and continues to be one of the world’s leading centres of oil production."
"It is well known that the Azerbaijani people are extraordinarily poor, in spite of the country’s abundant natural resources."
"Hundreds of thousands of refugees driven from their homes during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict are still living in refugee camps in Azerbaijan."
"Furthermore, the state of democracy in the country is amply illustrated by the fact that I once heard a famous explorer call it a khanate."
"Nevertheless, the short-term goal must be democratic elections."
"All of our deliberations on this issue must be guided primarily by the resolutions adopted by Parliament and the interparliamentary delegation since 1999."
"It should not be forgotten that the countries of the Caucasus are part of Europe."
"It is therefore crucial that relations with Azerbaijan be stepped up, and that this should take place on the basis of the EU’s fundamental democratic values."
"In particular, minimum standards should be applied in social and environmental matters."
"In the run-up to the democratic elections, it is of fundamental importance that the climate be conducive to opposition parties and politicians."
"Access to the media and the freedom of association are equally important, and the safeguarding of these rights must involve more than merely issuing the appropriate legal and regulatory standards."
"I find it somewhat surprising that recital L of the resolution refers to the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, yet makes no mention of the presence of government representatives from Stepanakert."
"I should like to conclude by expressing my support for the motion for a resolution."
"I am well aware of how complex the situation is in the South Caucasus, and thus understand that it is far from easy to make progress in terms of democratic standards at a time when the threat of extremist attacks is ever-present."
"At the same time, however, basic principles and procedures must not be abandoned during electoral campaigns and elections to legislative bodies conducted in accordance with OSCE standards."
". Madam President, there are only 11 days left before the parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan begin."
"What is quite striking in that connection is that the media in Baku are dominated by reports about spectacular dismissals and arrests of members of the government and top officials in the country’s oil industry."
"The official statements and indictments speak of conspiracy with the opposition against the lawful authorities and corruption."
"This is not a very uplifting image to take to the ballot boxes."
"That is why I am very surprised that the joint draft resolution makes no reference whatever to these recent events."
"In this resolution, the opposition is being dismissed, for the sake of public opinion, as a party that is about to carry out a , and, at the same time, President Ilham Aliyev can portray himself as the unimpeachable enforcer of law and order."
"No wonder I heard a key expert on Azerbaijan lamenting, last night, that ‘those parliamentary elections of 6 November are a waste of time and a waste of money!’"
"That will definitely not, though, put a stop to his commitment."
"He, too, will be travelling to Azerbaijan as an observer."
"The same can, this evening, be said of the European institutions, the Commission and this House."
"Any electoral improvement is welcome."
"Hence my appeal to the Commission and all international organisations involved, in fact, to urgently press for the meticulous registration of all voters (ink marking of the thumb, for example) by the Azerbaijani authorities."
"This is a precautionary measure that President Aliyev, in a speech before regional magistrates yesterday, said he would seriously consider."
"After all, there has, in the recent past, been no lack of cases of vote rigging, a truly national tradition that is taking on ever more refined forms in Azerbaijan these days."
"I should like to take this opportunity to emphasise that the gagging and marginalising of the democratic opposition in Azerbaijan can, in time, have serious political consequences, not only at national level, but just as much at regional level."
"Repressive, authoritarian rule by the regime in power spawns a process of political polarisation and radicalisation among the forces opposing it, which will express themselves in increasing anti-western attitudes."
"I would warn the Commission not to underestimate this development."
"This radicalisation will manifest itself just as much in growing Islamic aspirations."
"This, for example, is evident from an opinion poll held during the winter of 2004-2005, in which 23.2% were in support of the idea of an Islamic state, and another 28.9% welcomed the partial introduction of Islamic law – a vague sign, certainly when set alongside the stricter Islamic regime currently in power in Teheran."
"I have to tell the Commission that the wealth of Azerbaijan’s energy resources, or fine talk about such things as democratisation and (geo)political stability, should not temporarily blind us to what Azerbaijan and its people fundamentally lack – the democratic rule of law."
"I would urge you and the Council to be clear and forthright in calling the leaders in Baku to account on this matter – never mind the domestic electoral battle – certainly when such heavy charges as planning a and embezzling public funds are brought against prominent citizens."
"To sum up, we should, most of all, guard against the murky power game that President Aliyev and his evidently changing are playing today."
"That game is about the greedy division among themselves of the richly flowing oil funds and about playing senior party members and reformists off against one other."
"European aloofness and a word of caution are really called for here, for the benefit of Azerbaijan’s society."
"Madam President, the draft resolution presented points out the most pressing problems in Azerbaijan which jeopardise the clean, democratic and pluralistic conduct of the parliamentary elections on 6 November."
"It seems that the representatives of the government apparatus state one thing and do another."
"In spite of the endeavours made so far by the South Caucasian delegation of the European Parliament, the public law dignitaries, Parliament and the government of Azerbaijan have a strange way of interpreting democracy, the rule of law, state and human rights."
"The Head of State and his entourage are ruling autocratically."
"As mentioned by the Commissioner, we must note that last week President Aliyev dismissed several highest-ranking government officials or ordered their arrest and detention on remand on charges of attempting to stage a ."
"Subsequently, at the peak of the campaign, several dozen opposition and civil rights activists were arrested."
"All the signs point to the fact that the authority intends to defend its autocracy using its power, and tries to thwart the mass meetings of the opposition."
"As Azerbaijan is part of the EU Neighbourhood Policy, it is in our interest to see a fundamental change in the current situation, and the upcoming elections constitute the best opportunity for change."
"The European Parliament is interested in the establishment of a multi-party legislation process, ensuring equal opportunities for the opposition."
"I believe that the proposal we have tabled is extremely important."
"In this proposal, the European Parliament declares that international public opinion only accepts clean, free elections with equal opportunities."
"This is not just a warning from the European Parliament to Azerbaijan, but also an important message to the entire South Caucasian region."
"And Baku can prove itself on 6 November."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Azerbaijan has strong historical, cultural and economic ties with Europe, and it also has strong European ambitions."
"I was able to see this for myself during a recent visit to the country, both from conversations with ordinary people on the street and during talks with political actors."
"This was one of the reasons why I welcomed the European Council’s decision of June last year to include Azerbaijan, together with Armenia and Georgia, in the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"It is my belief that this policy provides an appropriate framework for the development of mutual and multilateral relations, and for the fulfilment of both Europe’s and Azerbaijan’s ambitions."
"If this mutual partnership is to develop and become stronger, certain common values must also be shared, such as respect for human rights, civil liberties, democracy and the rule of law."
"Elections are an important measure of respect for these values in any country."
"I should therefore like to take this opportunity to call on the Azerbaijani authorities to comply with basic electoral principles during the forthcoming parliamentary elections."
"These principles include the freedom of association and the freedom of speech, both for government and opposition candidates."
"The authorities must also ensure that the elections are conducted in a calm and peaceful atmosphere."
"As previous speakers have already mentioned, we are receiving mixed signals in the run-up to these elections."
"On the one hand, it is apparent that some progress has been made since the last elections; there are more candidates in general, for example, and also more from independent opposition parties."
"On the other hand, however, repressive measures are still being imposed, and the opposition still suffers oppression."
"It is my belief that the way in which these elections are conducted will also have an impact on our future actions."
"By this I mean that if we are able to ascertain that certain procedures are followed during these elections – and I myself will be a member of the observation mission – then this will have a positive impact on our work on the proposed Action Plan."
"If we are left with an overwhelmingly negative impression, then this will have a corresponding effect on our work."
"Madam President, freedom of speech is one of the key factors in the democracy-building process."
"A good indication of the extent to which this freedom has been achieved is the level of freedom enjoyed by the media."
"Azerbaijan became a member of the Council of Europe four years ago."
"At the time, it undertook to guarantee freedom of speech, the independence of the media and the work of journalists."
"We are well aware of such matters, but there is an ongoing need to inform and remind the people of Azerbaijan about the importance of the role played by the media."
"We must also remind them about the importance of free and equal access to the media for all citizens and political forces, particularly during electoral campaigns."
"This includes the campaign conducted in the run-up to the forthcoming November elections."
"The fact of the matter is that one of the country’s best-known journalists, Elmar Huseynov, has been murdered."
"No one took any action to prevent this murder, even though his wife had reported that he was being followed by unknown individuals and many of his friends claimed that he had expected to be murdered."
"After the event, President Aliyev announced that it was a serious provocation against the state, and accused the perpetrators of damaging Azerbaijan’s good reputation."
"The government even asked other countries for help, but the investigation has yielded no results to date."
"Instead, it has resulted in much speculation."
"The most widely-read newspapers are still controlled by the government, and the opposition press is only read by a minority."
"The newspaper was discontinued after Huseynov’s death, and although his successor has launched a new publication, , he almost immediately came up against enormous problems publishing it."
"At present, the publication has a circulation of only 3 000."
"The editor-in-chief of the newspaper , who is also a member of parliament and head of the Musavat party, is one of the opposition leaders who were imprisoned in October 2003."
"Although he has now been pardoned by the President, his editorial team had to stop work due to the enormous pressure exerted by the ruling parties and the excessive fines imposed by the courts."
"This is the situation in which the opposition press finds itself in Azerbaijan today, both in general and in the run-up to elections."
"Even though state television was privatised several months ago, the main stations still operate in virtually the same way, by which I mean that they exclude the opposition."
"Even though new television stations that are in the pipeline are intended to target a wider cross-section of society, there is virtually no chance of them doing so."
"In conclusion, there is a chance that free media may one day operate in Azerbaijan."
"It is too late, however, to establish a genuinely diverse media landscape before the November elections."
"– Madam President, mass infringements of democratic freedoms and human rights, the imprisonment of political adversaries and attacks on the free media are undermining the prospects of free and democratic elections being held in Azerbaijan."
"We saw during the presidential elections in 2003 that there were serious irregularities."
"However, there was no reaction whatsoever from the international community."
"How ready is the European Commission today to activate the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement suspension clause for infringements of democratic rights?"
"The Azeri regime, in breach of the international legal order, is allowing flights to the occupied part of the Republic of Cyprus."
"The European Commission must be firm and clear in its message to the Azeris."
"The same decisive message, about non-participation in European Neighbourhood Policy, must also be sent in the run-up to the parliamentary elections."
"The release of all political prisoners, respect for the rule of law, the holding of free elections and democratisation of the institutions must be the basic terms for the further development of relations between the European Union and Azerbaijan."
". Madam President, I just wish to make a few points about this debate."
"The first is that we share the same concerns about this election process."
"We have seen that the freedom of the press and freedom of expression are sometimes violated and we must follow this whole process very carefully."
"However, I can say that the European Neighbourhood Action Plan – which is not yet ready as we have only just begun negotiations – will provide an opportunity to promote democratic reform."
"It will also enable us to make many of our offers conditional upon further democratic reforms and respect for the rule of law."
"I agree, however, that with the new oil possibilities, it will not be as easy as we previously thought, because there will be more wealth in the future."
"Secondly, I recently held talks with the three countries of the Caucasus in New York during the Millennium Summit and the Ministerial Week."
"We also discussed the question of these flights."
"We hope that there will be a change."
"The situation is very clear and I was very adamant."
"We are now waiting for a high-level troika to come back to see how we can start these negotiations on the action plans."
"On Nagorno-Karabakh, we are ready to deploy a rehabilitation programme once a settlement is reached on the peace plan."
"It seems – and this is what I heard when I spoke to the two ministers – that there are some positive developments."
"I hope that this will happen after the Azeri elections, on the one hand, and the Armenian referendum, on the other."
"It is a very complicated question."
"I myself have often witnessed positive developments, for instance in 2000, when I was chairperson of the OECD."
"In the end, a stalemate was reached once again."
"However, there are possibilities and we would like to explore them."
"Let me also say that we currently have a fully-fledged delegation in Georgia, and a regionalised delegation covering Armenia, while we intend to open a fully-fledged delegation to Azerbaijan in 2007."
"We wanted to open a regionalised delegation but the Azeris refused."
"They only wanted one of their own."
"It is also a financial question regarding funding for the external service."
"I hope we will get some funding under heading 4."
"Finally, on radical Islamism, our message to President Aliyev was also very clear."
"We said that he would really be opening the way for radical Islamism if he did not allow the political opposition any breathing space."
"I gather from this debate that we all agree on that."
"I hope that the Azeris will hear our message."
"At the conclusion of the Commission’s statement, I wish to inform the House that I have received six motions for a resolution(1), which have been submitted pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be held on 27 October 2005 at 11.30 a.m."
"Azerbaijan is a strategic partner for Europe in terms of economics, security and foreign policy."
"For that reason the EU has welcomed Azerbaijan as a partner in the European Neighbourhood Policy and is following with interest the development of its internal politics."
"The upcoming elections are a key moment in the history of Azerbaijan, which will demonstrate the direction in the country wishes to move, and its willingness to follow in the footsteps of other ex-Soviet republics towards greater democratic participation, transparency and freedom of expression."
"On the eve of such an event, a certain nervousness is understandable."
"I do not, however, consider the attitude the present government has shown up to now to be justifiable."
"It seems deliberately to be creating a climate of fear, which is degenerating into violence and unlawful interference in the process of the electoral campaign, as attested to by the withdrawal of various candidates from the list."
"Even the decision to use ink to reduce the risk of fraud came late and after too many objections, something that can only cast a bad light over the goodwill of the government to proceed in a clear and transparent way."
"The future attitude of the EU, and our receptiveness towards an increasingly fruitful partnership, will depend on how this last electoral week, and above all on how the voting itself, unfold."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0280/2005) by Mrs Anneli Jäätteenmäki on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the Barcelona Process revisited (2005/2058(INI))."
". Madam President, the area around the Mediterranean is, of the EU’s neighbouring regions, the one which has perhaps had the most influence on the culture and history of the EU countries across the ages."
"Our language, our religion, the origin of our words and numbers have their roots in the Mediterranean region."
"The region is also strategically important, but most important of all, the countries which lie to the south of the Mediterranean are our neighbours."
"But history is history."
"1995 marked a turning point in relations between the European Union and its southern neighbours. It was then that the Barcelona Process began."
"Today, 10 years later, Mediterranean policy is one of the main priorities of EU foreign policy."
"We might therefore say that in this respect there has been considerable change and development."
"Now, 10 years later, however, we should perhaps ask whether we need the Barcelona Process today."
"Europe is so different from what it was when the process started."
"I believe and am convinced that Parliament’s unanimous reply will be that we do indeed need this partnership."
"Europe needs it, we Europeans need it, and, hopefully, our partners need it, much more than they did when cooperation at this level began."
"Nevertheless, we require more effective cooperation, and, indeed, more cooperation."
"It pleases me to say that the European Parliament has always been a strong supporter of the Barcelona Process, and many individual Members of Parliament have done much to take this partnership forward."
"Given this situation, I want to mention a few issues which I hope the Barcelona Process will focus on more closely in the future."
"One is education."
"There is a high level of illiteracy in our partner countries."
"We in our own countries stress the importance of education and skills; it is the only way we can succeed."
"There the situation is exactly the same."
"I would like in particular to emphasise how important it is for young girls and women to have an opportunity to get an education and for the EU to invest in the eventual eradication of illiteracy."
"We here in the EU like to stress how important functional democracy is, but before we can expect democracy to work, people have to know how to read."
"The ability to read is therefore important for democracy."
"Secondly, I would like to raise the matter of economic growth and the reforms relating to it."
"The EU has actively supported economic integration and free trade, and is indeed the biggest trading partner with the individual partner countries."
"More than 50% of these countries’ trade is with the EU, while just 13% is with the United States of America."
"There is, however, a certain dilemma associated with this."
"The brisk trade that exists between the EU and the partner countries is not reflected in any increase in the EU’s political influence."
"50% of the trade does not mean that we hold 50% of the influence."
"I would also like to emphasise the importance of the work of the Anna Lindh Foundation."
"I hope that more time and effort will be invested in this in the years to come, because the dialogue between religions and cultures is important."
"Unfortunately, it has to be said that the Barcelona Process has not been entirely successful in this respect, and this needs to be put right."
"Migration is one important dimension of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, and today it seems that the problems are only increasing, so we also need to invest time and money in this area."
"Finally, I would like to say that, as a representative of the Nordic region, it has been an agreeable experience working as rapporteur."
"I have learned a lot and I have also observed that that there is a need for dialogue between the cultures of Northern and Southern Europe."
"To my surprise, I have realised that at the moment there is not enough of it going on in the European Parliament either."
". Madam President, the report that Mrs Jäätteenmäki has presented to your House is an outstanding one."
"Its title – ‘The Barcelona process revisited’ – may at first sight appear rather surprising, but perhaps I may interpret it as meaning that its concern is with the strengthening and deepening of partnership between Europe and the other Mediterranean states, something that is quite clearly expressed in the motion for a resolution."
"The tenth anniversary of the Barcelona process is not just an opportunity to appreciate past successes, which there have been, even though not everything we wanted to achieve has been; it is also particularly necessary that we should look forward, building on the foundations laid by these successes and, with determination and political courage, making full use of the potential of this cooperation for the future."
"I agree with Mrs Jäätteenmäki when she says that it goes without saying that the Barcelona process will continue to be needed in the future."
"It is for that reason that I attach particular importance to the major summit meeting to be held in Barcelona at the end of November, at which Heads of State and Government will, for the first time, be able to have their say on this subject."
"The Commission has, at my suggestion, produced a communication of its own, to which I attach particular significance in view of the fact that it takes up the very same points that all of us in this House – for I have heard these same things from you – regard as especially relevant."
"There are three main ones, to which I would add culture."
"First among these points is political reform, with, above all, the promotion of human rights, democracy and good governance, to which I shall return later."
"Second comes education and training;"
"Mrs Jäätteenmäki is quite right to say that this is something on which we need to carry on working, an area in which we need to become stronger."
"This is a very particular concern of mine and I intend to see that something is done about it."
"The third area is that of economic development."
"It is in this area that we have achieved perhaps the most successes to date, but it is also one in which we need to make further progress. I would like to come back to that and discuss it in detail."
"There is of course more work for us to do in relation to culture, with the Anna Lindh Foundation, dialogue between civilisations and cultures, and this network’s potential for extension, being enormously important."
"The Commission is of course available to assist in this."
"Let me start by considering political reform, democracy and human rights, areas in which we cannot stand aloof, but must endeavour to support reform from outside."
"We cannot, of course, impose them; rather, we need to offer firm support and the possibility of supporting measures."
"That means that it is very important that the Neighbourhood Policy should build on the Barcelona process in making the right instruments available."
"Over recent weeks, I have visited many of these Mediterranean countries – Tunisia, Jordan and Lebanon among them – and see with what efficiency we can work with these instruments, even when, as is the case in these countries, human rights issues are addressed under different headings."
"We have thought up something special in order to promote human rights, the plan being that we will – we expect from next year onwards, but certainly starting in 2007 – be making available complementary assistance in the form of a ‘Democracy Facility’."
"What that means is that the countries that are making particularly good progress with reform will, by way of support, receive at least an extra 10% on top of the funds that they already receive."
"I hope that this will give these countries an incentive to press on with still greater dedication and encourage others, which are currently dragging their heels, to do likewise."
"This presupposes the extension and development of the political and security policy aspects of the partnership."
"It is because better use needs to be made of the political framework that I regard Parliament’s meetings in conjunction with Euromed as particularly important, but meetings of the Council of Ministers and meeting in troika format can also help promote further development."
"Secondly, it is essential that we consider the vital importance of education, not least in terms of its impact on society."
"In the Mediterranean countries, one-third of the population is under 15 years of age, and that means that we have to focus especially on education."
"The UNDP report on human development showed that education, and equal status for women in particular, will help drive development forward."
"I have therefore made a special priority of the eradication of illiteracy, bearing in mind the UN millennium statement of intent that this should be done by 2015."
"I do hope that we will accomplish that."
"I would like to see girls and boys get the same opportunity to be enrolled at the same schools and to receive the same education."
"I would also like to see priority given to special support measures for women."
"We plan a scholarship programme for this purpose, which will provide, in particular, postgraduate grants for women, with the object of accelerating development in this area."
"I also regard the problems surrounding migration as quite central among social issues."
"Today, for example, I welcomed Morocco’s Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr Taieb Fassi Fihri, and we did of course discuss current events in Ceuta and Melilla, to which we cannot be indifferent."
"We have to work together to arrive at solutions – solutions not only for the European Union as a whole in its relations with the Mediterranean in general, but also for the sub-Saharan states and Africa."
"While we must, of course, attempt to cut off people-smuggling, so that people do not become the victims of this terrible trade, we must also create additional development opportunities for these countries so that migratory movements of this kind do not occur."
"While refugees must be treated in accordance with the Convention and with absolute respect for their human rights, the flood of illegal refugees must be stemmed, and this is certainly one of the key topics for the Barcelona Summit."
"On the economic front, we have done much to ensure normal trade and a free trade zone by 2010, but much more remains to be done about services and agricultural trade, and South-South trade, also known as the Agadir process, must be further developed."
"Other vital topics include transport, energy, and the environment."
"There will be a conference on transport in December in Marrakesh; on the energy front, more and more sub-regional networks need to be developed."
"As regards the environment, the cleanliness of the Mediterranean should be guaranteed as far as possible."
"Mrs Jäätteemäki quite rightly puts particular emphasis on cultural cooperation, to which we, too, want to give greater attention in future."
"It is of course a matter of common knowledge that, although the Barcelona process offers the chance to get Israel and Palestine sitting around the same table, that same process is itself constantly overshadowed by the peace process in the Middle East, and so it is essential that we should make headway here."
"I have Mr Wolfensohn, the quartet envoy, who has done really good work here and whom we support entirely, in mind when I say that."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Jäätteenmäki on her report on the Barcelona process revisited."
"I would now like to turn to my proposal."
"Next month, the European Heads of State or Government will meet their Mediterranean counterparts to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona process."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership was intended to provide the ambitious prospect of a better, varied future, simultaneously political, economic, social and cultural."
"The results, 10 years on, are mixed."
"We have created a forum for discussion and cooperation with our Mediterranean neighbours, which I welcome, but we are far from achieving all the objectives set."
"The conflict in the Middle East has not been resolved."
"The region is still unstable."
"Human rights and democratisation are not progressing, or are not progressing enough."
"The southern shore of the Mediterranean and its population have not benefited from the expected economic and social well-being."
"Unemployment, particularly among young people, is still too high and results in hopeless migration flows."
"On the economic front, I will mention just one example: the end of the Multifibre Agreement, which has added to the difficulties experienced by the region."
"Although the new rules of cumulative origin, as proposed by Commissioner Mandelson, are moving in the right direction, South-South economic integration is still far from complete."
"We are the privileged partner of this region and all its hopes are turned towards us."
"Caring about these people primarily means responding to their concerns and their aspirations, in other words our ability to achieve greater social cohesion and sustainable economic development."
"The new Neighbourhood Policy proposed to us is a positive element, because it calls for greater democracy, even though the aid will have to be shared more broadly amongst our neighbours to the east and to the south."
"I hope that this new policy will pursue the objectives of the Barcelona process and that it will take account of the difficulties specific to this region."
"I am also concerned by the absence, in the neighbourhood and partnership instrument as proposed by the Commission, of a specific reference to the Millennium Goals."
"In the global environment in which we live, liberalisation cannot be the answer to the problems raised."
"That applies to the protection of our environment – given that we are responsible for our planet – but, even more acutely, to the issue of public services that meet the basic needs of the people, namely education, health, culture, and access to water and power, which the Committee on International Trade, of which I am a member, proposed and which the Committee on Foreign Affairs did not adopt."
"We agree with the view that our work is not yet done."
"Let us be in agreement tomorrow to achieve a common goal."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Jäätteenmäki on her report and on her willingness to cooperate, which has resulted in a complete motion for a resolution as regards information and political proposals."
"The 10-year anniversary of the Barcelona process offers an excellent opportunity for us to take stock and, more importantly, to redefine our political vision and our strategy in the light of the new situation represented by the enlarged European Union, the challenges of globalisation and the increased threat of terrorism."
"The Barcelona process deserves our special attention because it is the most integrated expression of the European Union's foreign policy, in that it is a multilateral, global partnership expressed through an integrated strategy."
"It is totally connected to the vital interests of the European Union, in that it can contribute towards peace and security in our area and can influence peace and equilibrium in the world."
"The results to date are not satisfactory."
"Both sides have been guilty of weaknesses and oversights."
"There has been a lack of perspicacity, political will, adequate financing and an inability on the part of the partners to promote reforms and cooperation between each other so that they become attractive markets and economies."
"What I consider worrying is that this multilateral relationship and procedure has not helped to resolve the chronic problems, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Cyprus question. It is also worrying that it has not reached the people."
"Citizens have not become participants and partners in this process, of which they are ignorant on both sides of the Mediterranean."
"They have not become aware of the challenges which require us to live together or of our points in common or even of the substance of our differences."
"I trust that the 2005 summit, 10 years after the first summit, will clearly include in its priorities this need to involve civil society in the Barcelona process."
"We expect initiatives to be encouraged, such as the Euromed platform mentioned by Mrs Jäätteenmäki, and other forms of cooperation at all levels, such as between local authorities, regions and universities."
"The mobility of citizens in all social and professional groups must be encouraged."
"The role of the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference is very important and has already started to prove its worth and we hope that it will contribute to this mutual understanding and forging of a common conscience."
"We expect a real dialogue between cultures, in the full meaning of the word, which will not merely be a coming together to exchange business cards, but at which we shall engage in dialogue with a willingness to reveal our differences and find our points in common."
"The dialogue between cultures must encompass the full breadth and depth of the word; cultural standards, the interpretation of history, the way of life and the position of women."
"I am delighted, Commissioner, that you referred specifically to this, but I would like to point out to you that valuable work has been carried out by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, not only in the opinion attached to the report, but also in a report drafted in 2002, which formed the basis for the first regional women's programme in the Mediterranean which we have today."
"What we are calling for is more than just education and jobs."
"We are calling for a real review of the situation of women and, on the part of the European Commission, for a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results of our policy to date and for the integration of the gender dimension in all three pillars of the Barcelona process."
". Madam President, as rapporteur on the European Neighbourhood Policy, I believe it is clearly in our mutual interests to strengthen ties with our southern Mediterranean partners in North Africa and the Middle East, as formally set up in the Barcelona process 10 years ago on 28 November."
"Along with our US allies, this sends a clear message that we support, in this region, a strengthening of civil society, an open market economy, democratic pluralism and respect for fundamental human rights, including media freedom, independence of the judiciary and the rule of law and, in particular, women’s rights, as the previous speaker mentioned."
"Tunisia is an advanced country in the eyes of the Arab world in this respect."
"Environmental cooperation is also one of our priorities."
"These countries, and in particular their growing populations, will provide growing markets for our own products."
"I believe that it is in the European Union’s interests to target substantial development aid through the current MEDA Programme, which, I believe, amounts to some EUR 3 billion per year, and eventually through the newly anticipated ENPI – the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument – to assist the Euromed group of countries with enhanced economic growth in order to prevent rising unemployment and rising tensions, which will in turn, from the EU security point of view, provide recruiting grounds for Islamist hardliners."
"We have seen that in the recent past during the Moroccan Casablanca bombings, the tragic civil war in recent years in Algeria and the rise of Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad in the occupied Palestinian territories."
"We must remember, of course, that the tragic Madrid bombings were carried out by Maghribi Salafists."
"We must also try to prevent large, uncontrolled migrant flows to the European Union."
"Otherwise, this will cause a total breakdown in the good intercommunal relations we enjoy at present."
"We all hope for a free trade area by 2010."
"The new EuroMed Assembly facilitates dialogue between traditional enemies such as Israel and the Arab world."
"This forum uniquely allows them to resolve their problems peacefully."
"Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, in my view, is a good start to putting the roadmap for peace back on the agenda."
"This Assembly is also a forum for the exchange of ideas between the Islamic world and the majority-Christian European Union."
"I am optimistic about the spread of our democratic values in this region, with the recent elections in Iraq, Palestine and Lebanon and now, even, some tentative democratic moves in this direction from Egypt."
"On behalf of my political group, I strongly commend the Jäätteenmäki report to the House."
". Madam President, I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Jäätteenmäki, who has done so much good work on the drawing up of this report, and who has been so receptive to the amendments that my political group has presented."
"I would also like to thank Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner who is here with us so late at night."
"It is now ten years since the historic Barcelona Declaration, which led to the first Euro-Mediterranean Summit, which was hosted by Prime Minister Felipe González in his capacity as President-in-Office of the European Union."
"The prospect of the Euro-Mediterranean association that was opened up at that time gave us enormous hope."
"It is true that the results have been irregular and that there remains much to be done, but it also true that the obstacles and difficulties are and were immense, and it is not reasonable to ignore them."
"The Mediterranean, the cradle of European culture, has been and continues to be, in part, a sea of confrontations and conflicts."
"The Euro-Mediterranean partnership makes sense if it is the instrument used to remove those obstacles and to promote dialogue and cooperation between North and South, but also to prioritise South-South relations in those regions, which are greatly weakened."
"With regard to the Summit in November in Barcelona, Barcelona + 10, the important thing is to establish clear, viable and realistic priorities, which at the same time must be ambitious."
"We now have a reference framework, which is the alliance of civilisations, proposed by Prime Minister Zapatero and adopted by the United Nations, by means of the statement by its Secretary-General in July of this year."
"A necessary condition for achieving the objectives is a reduction in the tension in the region, in particular the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the real Achilles heel of Euro-Mediterranean relations."
"The main objective of this association is to create an area of shared prosperity, making progress on reducing poverty, overcoming the socio-economic gap between North and South, and, as has been said, promoting political reforms, democratisation and the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"Many other issues have been arising in this debate: the problem of the management of migratory flows, discrimination against women, the serious environmental problems facing the , dialogue amongst the three monotheistic religions, the need for local and regional cooperation, the fight against terrorism, control of weapons of mass destruction, participation by populations, etc."
"The Mediterranean is the European Union’s most vulnerable flank and if we do not take this issue seriously, we will pay the price in the future."
"Madam President, in the run-up to its tenth anniversary, there is every reason to evaluate the Barcelona Process."
"The world today does look very different to the way it did ten years ago."
"We have had enlargement involving, for example, Cyprus, and have begun negotiations with Turkey and Croatia."
"The Neighbourhood Policy has been developed, and we have seen how, in many of our partnership countries, democratisation has progressed and, in certain others, unfortunately taken a step backwards."
"The fight against terrorism has become ever more important."
"The war in Iraq and the difficult process that Iraq is now going through on its way to democracy also has an impact on relations with the region as a whole."
"We have Iran and the problems surrounding the policy on nuclear fuel in that country. We have the Palestinian election and the withdrawal from Gaza but, at the same time, stagnation in the peace process."
"The exciting events in Lebanon and Syria and the ongoing tragic situation in Africa’s last colony, Western Sahara, show that there is still a very great deal indeed to be done in the region."
"In the light of this, it is only natural to review and debate the Barcelona Process."
"It has created structures, and extremely important ones at that, and a form of more securely established cooperation between us."
"The association agreements with all the countries have led to more interchange, trade, projects and many shared fora, and it has given rise to a long-term commitment for the whole of the EU."
"Proof of this lies in the fact that there are Members from the whole of Europe, and not just from the south, debating in the Chamber this evening."
"We have a common history and culture and also common problems and solutions to those problems. The areas concerned, of which there are indeed many, include terrorism, migration, growth, development, trade, the environment and energy."
"Above all, however, the issues for the future are those of human rights and democracy."
"These are the most important areas of all and, in these, the Barcelona Process has in many ways failed."
"Even though the association agreements contain human rights clauses, these are not used because we have no sound mechanisms for dealing with serious human rights violations in the countries with which we cooperate. There is also sometimes quite limited interest in the issue."
"These areas present the big challenge for the Barcelona Process in the future."
"We must restructure the whole of our cooperation so that it becomes a framework for a huge push for democratisation throughout the region."
"Nothing contributes more to stability than the transition to democracy."
"The least free countries in the whole world are concentrated in the Middle East region, and this creates a breeding ground for fanaticism, frustration and perhaps also terrorism. That is why, within the Barcelona Process, we must form strategies that push for extensive democratisation."
"We must support dissidents, civil society, freedom of expression and communities founded on the rule of law, etc. The means for doing all this are, of course, trade, interchange, educational programmes and cultural cooperation."
"The Barcelona Process must in that way become a type of alternative for countries that can never become EU Members."
"It must provide practical advantages in exchange for our requiring reforms."
"If we succeed in bringing this about, we shall have made an historic contribution."
"In conclusion, I wish to commend my colleague, Mrs Jäätteenmäki, for her very constructive report."
". Madam President, I think that Mrs Wallström and yourself, Commissioner, have, like others, put your finger on an issue on which the Barcelona process has not kept all its promises."
"I am referring, of course, to the issue of human rights and democracy."
"If you are not convinced, you simply have to take stock of the situation regarding freedom of the press in the region – this was done at the invitation of Mrs Patrie this afternoon – or the situation regarding freedom of expression in Tunisia, on the eve of the World Summit on the Information Society."
"The proof can be seen in the number of violations of the rights to freedom of association, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly; a justice system that suffers major deficiencies in many countries; the torture which is commonplace, or even virtually systematic, in some countries, and the defenders of human rights who, all over the world, are the victims of numerous violations of their rights and are subject to a great deal of harassment."
"The Barcelona process has therefore not kept all its promises on these issues."
"As Mrs Jäätteenmäki said, I believe that it has some shortcomings with regard to women’s rights, economic and social rights and the mechanisms put in place for an effective policy regarding democracy and human rights."
"Despite all that, the Barcelona process has made it possible to institute mechanisms and forums for political dialogue on these issues, and has therefore laid the necessary foundations to launch an ambitious policy of promoting human rights and democracy."
"You said, Commissioner, that the issue of immigration would be at the heart of the discussions at the Barcelona Summit."
"Allow me, in this regard, to draw your attention to one point."
"I think that, with regard to the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration, we are encouraging countries to break international law."
"That is pretty clear and it has just been illustrated once again by the incidents at Lampedusa involving Libya, and more recently by the incidents in the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Mellila and in Morocco."
"By asking these countries to stem the flow of sub-Saharan refugees, we are encouraging and urging them to commit human rights violations."
"Before we try to quell the flood of those we call ‘illegal immigrants’, Europe itself has to define its legal immigration policy."
"However, you will be aware that we are making hardly any progress on this issue."
"I am convinced that civil society and Members of Parliament can help to improve the implementation of our policies on human rights and democracy in this region."
"That is why I very much hope that the Commission will be present in Rabat for the next extraordinary meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur for her hard work on this report, and also the Commissioner, for the words of hope she offered on this tormented area of the Mediterranean."
"In 1995, an irreversible process was begun in Barcelona, which aimed at closer cooperation between countries in the Mediterranean area."
"Pessimists will tell us that the results have been below expectations, that economic progress in southern Mediterranean countries has been insufficient, that political dialogue has been difficult and fragmented, that Europe has not been able to make itself heard properly with regard to human rights and democracy, that South-South economic cooperation is still in its infancy, and that results have not been satisfactory in terms of joint management of immigration."
"The international geopolitical landscape of today’s Mediterranean has certainly changed, and the ambitious project of the Barcelona Process must therefore be modified and adapted to this new international context if the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is to meet the current challenges."
"Let us begin, however, with what has been done."
"We have set up joint inter-ministerial cooperation mechanisms – which will receive no further debate – for the common resolution of problems in that particular area."
"We have established a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly to supplement governmental cooperation, in which we work together under parliamentary rules."
"We have initiated a support programme worth EUR 700 million a year – MEDA – in order to channel resources and development between north and south, which today has achieved some quite attractive rates of implementation."
"We have set in motion the democratic process, which has started anyway, in coastal countries such as Lebanon, Egypt and, to a certain extent, Palestine."
"Association agreements have been signed between the European Union and all the southern Mediterranean countries, and there have of course been plenty of examples of cooperation, seemingly minor but very effective on a cultural level, which were all initiated within the wider framework of the Barcelona Agreement."
"All that has allowed us to understand one another better, whilst opening the door with a certain optimism to a second decade, when we must consolidate the positive aspects of the process, make more concrete our objectives and current planning, and correct any mistakes made, so that stability, peace, democracy and socio-economic progress may be results shared by an ever greater number of countries and citizens in the Mediterranean area."
"One final point I wish to raise is the issue of culture, which is not only about education and training, but also about cultural heritage."
"If we safeguard our cultural heritage we can understand and respect each another better within the context of our own identities and diversity."
"Madam President, the Mediterranean region is important for the Member States and for the European Union as a whole."
"It is clear that the countries of the southern flank do not enjoy the same level of political development and/or economic prosperity."
"Nevertheless, the majority of these countries have to deal with various shortcomings, to a greater or lesser degree: political shortcomings, lack of democratic development and limited pluralism; economic shortcomings, because we are talking about antiquated economies, which do not have the capacity to generate employment for a growing population and are not sufficiently attractive to bring in the necessary foreign investment; and social shortcomings, high poverty and social inequality, illiteracy, discrimination against women — as has been mentioned — the public institutions’ lack of capacity, with negative consequences in terms of health, education, the economy, border control, and many other things."
"The Mediterranean region must therefore be treated as a priority by the Union, not only due to the many historical, political, economic and social ties linking the countries of both flanks, but also for other reasons, such as security, including the terrorist threat, or the challenge of immigration."
"Cooperation between both flanks is therefore essential and must cover a very broad range of activities."
"Cooperation must operate in both directions — I repeat — in both directions."
"The problems of these neighbouring countries affect us, ours is a shared future; it is impossible to create a wall between the north and the south of the Mediterranean, especially in today’s globalised world."
"We must therefore enhance our relations with these countries, stimulate them and help them to overcome the shortcomings that I referred to earlier."
"The report that we will approve tomorrow therefore insists on the need for political, economic, social and institutional modernisation and also improvements in relation to human rights."
"In this regard, I welcome the Commissioner’s words and the importance she attaches to these issues."
"We need impetus for reform — and I believe that we should all agree on this — on the southern flank."
"The European Union must not concern itself solely with the stability of those countries; stability cannot ultimately become an excuse for not moving forward."
"If we insist on the need for reforms in our countries, how can we not insist on the need for reforms in their countries?"
"These countries must evolve."
"Otherwise, the problems will increase, and political and economic crises — including in the field of immigration and security — will only increase and ultimately it will be a lack of reform that brings instability."
"Hence the importance of the Barcelona Process and the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"They must be fundamental instruments for the Union with a view, firstly, to demonstrating to those countries that they are priorities within our foreign action and, naturally, to helping them, to demanding that they also cooperate faithfully with us on resolving these problems affecting us and, finally, in order to stimulate them towards reform."
"A reform that can bring prosperity, freedom and, ultimately, more stability for these countries and hence for the whole of the Mediterranean basin."
"I would like the next Barcelona Summit to be up to the challenge and I would of course like to end by thanking Mrs Jäätteenmäki for her efforts."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like quickly to highlight three aspects of this process."
"The first is the connection between the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and the Neighbourhood Policy, which was raised by the Commissioner."
"I believe this aspect must not lead us to focus solely on bilateral action plans, but should encourage us to create a geographical and political space that is both European and Mediterranean."
"The principal means of all that is the political dimension, which has increased, it must be said, because the European Parliament has contributed to the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, and the civil societies have set up the civil forum."
"What is missing are the governments. Where are the governments?"
"I believe that to move forward with this process we need parliaments, societies and governments to engage somewhat more in dialogue, which in turn will enable us to create a more advanced human rights dimension."
"Finally, the sociologist Edgard Morin is quite right when he points out that it is not cultures, religions and civilisations that engage in dialogue, but people, individuals, men and women."
"I believe that the most serious limitation in all the years of this very generous and intelligent process has been the failure to make our different societies relate to each other, and because of that, terrorism and immigration today threaten to widen the gulf even further."
"I agree with our rapporteur when she says we must reinforce all the programmes and instruments that foster dialogue and understanding – and hence education, culture, training and information – between our societies."
"In short, we support our rapporteur because her report moves in that direction, and because Euro-Mediterranean politics need less rhetoric and a great deal more substance."
"Madam President, for the past few years the European Union has been watching the countries of eastern and central Europe carefully."
"Most of the Union’s attention has been focused on enlargement, the new accession process and future enlargement."
"Unfortunately, southern Europe and the southern basin of the Mediterranean often only received attention when problems or specific issues arose – as when thousands of immigrants arrived in Ceuta, Melilla or Lampedusa, or when the situation became extremely difficult for the western Saharan refugees in Tindouf."
"The human rights situation in the southern and eastern southern basin of the Mediterranean has not improved."
"There are no clear improvements in this field, or in democracy, freedom and transparency."
"I must point out that economic differences have also increased over the years."
"In the European Union, Member States continue to be keenly attached to their bilateral relations with governments south of the Mediterranean."
"This clearly makes the partnership less coherent."
"This is an old problem of European politics not being able to act with a single voice, even in the relationship with such strategic areas as the area south of the Mediterranean."
"There is still the recurring question as to who is going to pick up the phone and speak on behalf of Europe."
"I must mention another important deficiency in our intercultural dialogue."
"Some very important cultures and languages are ostracised and not represented."
"I should like to mention the Amazigh language and culture, which is neglected and even banned in several countries in northern Africa, and the Catalan language and culture."
"I hope that the next meeting in Barcelona will be an opportunity to achieve more visible and concrete results in a short time."
"Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union automatically increased the number of countries with a stake in the Barcelona process."
"I should like to stress that this process is of importance not only for Malta and Cyprus, but also for the Central and Eastern European countries."
"Whereas some of the reasons for this are historical, others are very much more up-to-date and practical."
"As recently as 20 years ago, the average Pole regarded Libya as the only Mediterranean country with which Poland maintained close relations."
"At the time, relations between the European Communities and the country were a great deal less friendly."
"Thousands of Poles worked in Libya, and a huge number of copies of Gaddafi’s ‘Green Book’ were published in Polish translation."
"The situation today is entirely different."
"Tens of thousands of Polish tourists visit Tunisia and Egypt every year, and a considerable number of Poles go on pilgrimages to Israel."
"Polish scientists are engaged in research in all the countries of the region, from Syria to Morocco."
"This is why it is not only politicians and diplomats who take an interest in the broad concept of the Neighbourhood Policy, but also large sections of the populations in the new Member States."
"Problems relating to illegal immigration, respect for human rights, equal rights for women, the advancement of democracy and the economic development of the countries around the Mediterranean Basin have become our problems too."
"Europe never has been and doubtless never will be an isolated island."
"Our relations with our closest neighbours are a measure of our solidarity and responsibility."
"By this I mean solidarity not only in terms of a duty towards partners within the European Union, but also in terms of a task that goes far beyond the borders of Europe and takes us everywhere that people desire peace, stability, the rule of law, economic growth and freedom."
"The European Union will benefit from the genuine implementation of as many of these values as possible in the countries neighbouring us to the south and east."
"The new EU Member States very much want to become involved in building a political partnership concerned with security, as well as an economic and financial partnership and a social, cultural and humanitarian partnership."
"Madam President, the Euro-Mediterranean process is ten years old and the first conclusion to draw is that, had it not existed, it would have to be invented urgently, quite simply because, as the report by our rapporteur Mrs Jäätteenmäki states, despite its shortcomings, it has been a success."
"It was an unimaginable challenge: to resolve the structural and historical problems of the Mediterranean countries in one decade."
"But we have been working hard and we are beginning to find a solution to some of those problems."
"I therefore believe that the objective of a free trade area by 2010, rather than being a final objective, must be a stepping stone from which to move forward, and many other things must be added."
"We must enhance, at the same time as reforming, the Euro-Mediterranean process; we must stress the fundamental idea that inspired it and, in this case, transform potential achievements into a tangible reality."
"Furthermore, the international situation demonstrates that the Euro-Mediterranean process is the best way to promote cooperation."
"Other strategies, based on aggression and threats, do not yield results."
"Nevertheless, the premium for moving forward, which is at the heart of this Euro-Mediterranean process, is proving to be effective."
"For example, I chaired the Delegation of European Parliament Observers at the legislative elections in the Lebanon, a Euro-Mediterranean partner; there have been elections, with problems, it is true, but there have been elections."
"And in other States as well, democratic progress has been made, although regrettably, in others, nothing is changing."
"Let us move forward in democracy, human rights and equality."
"I would naturally like to stress the good aspects of your proposal."
"Let us also consider that we need a Euro-Mediterranean area of freedom, security and justice, let us accompany the free trade area with the essential concept of economic, social and territorial cohesion, which is as valid for our partners as it is for us, and let us also promote political participation."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is an extraordinary success."
"We had the ACP-EU Assembly and this is the second institution we have created."
"I therefore believe, Madam President, that the Barcelona Summit will be positive, because it will enable us to create a Euro-Mediterranean citizenship within a process, the Euro-Mediterranean process, which is the best concrete manifestation of the proposed alliance of civilisations."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, if I had to tell my constituents that I was addressing the European Parliament at 11.30 p.m., I doubt that they would believe me, let alone tell me that they tuned in to the new Europarl website to listen."
"But at least the late hour of this debate has not kept us from making a sober assessment of the Barcelona Process, and the rapporteur is certainly to be commended for her candid report."
"Ten years on, the Barcelona Process has not lived up to expectations and it would be fair to conclude that we do not have much to celebrate."
"However, this is not to say that we should be pessimistic; rather, we should look at the experience of the past ten years and demonstrate that we can learn from it."
"Here are some lessons that I would like to draw."
"Firstly, we should avoid spreading ourselves too thinly."
"If necessary, we should admit that the Barcelona Process may have been far too ambitious and should focus instead on fewer priorities where we can truly make a difference."
"Secondly, we must acknowledge that the problems of our Mediterranean partners are our problems too."
"Take immigration, for instance: the limitations of the Barcelona Process on immigration have turned into a massive problem at the door of European Union Member States."
"So, in helping our Mediterranean partners, we are in reality also helping ourselves."
"It could be a win-win situation."
"Thirdly, we must treat our Mediterranean partners like true partners."
"All too often, Europe has fallen into the trap of sounding patronising and appearing to dictate to them when this is not the right partnership approach at all."
"Finally, the process needs visibility, both for EU citizens as well as for citizens of the member partners."
"Unless people see that the process can affect them and benefit them directly, they can hardly be asked to support it."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to Mrs Jäätteenmäki on her analysis. I agree with it."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your resolute proposals."
"Whether via the Barcelona Process, the association agreements or, more recently, within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, Europe sets itself up as a partner of the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean."
"This partnership includes economic, social and cultural dimensions, but, above all, it must be based on mutual recognition of a political platform made up of shared indivisible values: democracy, fundamental freedoms, human rights and gender equality."
"Fundamental freedoms include the right to individual safety, freedom of conscience and freedom of expression."
"At a time when human rights activists are being prevented from holding their meeting in Tunisia, at a time when we are considering the conclusions of Mr Mehlis’s report on the assassination of Mr Hariri, we must remember that."
"In this regard, freedom of the press, which I would like to emphasise today, and the status of journalists are without doubt the best examples of this set of shared values."
"Without individual security for these journalists, there is no freedom of expression, and if the press do not have freedom of expression, there is no democracy!"
"Freedom of expression is not a Western value: it shone more brightly under the Islam of the Umayyads than in the shadows of the Inquisition."
"That is why, following the assassination of Samir Kassir, following the appalling attack, more recently, on May Chidiac, I took the initiative, in agreement with my fellow members of the delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries, and also with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, to organise a hearing today, during which we have heard from journalists from all over the Euro-Mediterranean area."
"This morning, we submitted a symbolic appeal to the President of the European Parliament, calling for a free press in the Euro-Mediterranean area."
"My proposal this evening is that we should engrave the freedom of the press into the marble of the Barcelona Process as an indispensable condition of our partnership agreements."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today we are commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona process, and the changes that have occurred over these 10 years."
"Although some of these changes have been positive, a great many have been negative."
"I should like to draw the House’s attention to one of the former, namely the enlargement of the European Union to include Central and Eastern European countries, since it is my belief that these countries have something to offer as far as the Barcelona process is concerned."
"Their experiences of the transition from an authoritarian to a democratic regime, for example, or of implementing extremely successful economic reforms and overcoming the negative social consequences of these reforms, are still fresh in their minds."
"All these countries also have strong ties with the North African countries, be they of a political, economic or cultural nature."
"In some cases these ties date back many years, whereas in others they are more recent."
"I should like to note that it is in our interests, or in other words in the interests of both Europe and of our partners in North Africa, to put the experience of these new Member States to good use, and to enhance the Barcelona process by means of their knowledge."
"I believe that we would then be more capable of working together to resolve the problems that we are debating today, such as migration, the slow implementation of political reforms and, in a large number of cases, inadequate economic and social reforms."
"– Madam President, it has now been 10 years since the Barcelona Declaration and it is therefore time to make an honest and dispassionate review of the policies and actions of the truly historic initiative of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation."
"In 1995, we set ambitious objectives, because the regional environment was much more favourable."
"Unfortunately, I fear today that the geopolitical regional scenario in the Middle East and the Mediterranean in general is not conducive to the implementation of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation."
"The impasse in the peace process in the Middle East and the Palestinian question continue to have a determining and negative influence on Euro-Mediterranean cooperation."
"This was and is the basic precondition for the implementation of the objectives."
"Everyone spoke of results that were not particularly encouraging."
"However, I should like to comment on two main points."
"The question is how the Barcelona process will proceed in coming years."
"I believe that it is particularly difficult for the European Neighbourhood Policy to coexist with the Euro-Mediterranean process, when there are overlaps between objectives and policies."
"It is difficult for the European Union to persuade our Mediterranean partners of the honesty of its intentions without significant financing resources and with a limited Community budget."
"There has been institutional inflation in Euro-Mediterranean cooperation with the constant creation of new institutions and bodies."
"How will they operate without adequate financing?"
"How will serious initiatives be implemented, such as that of the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Zapatero, on the alliance between civilisations and dialogue between religions?"
"At the Barcelona conference in November, wish lists will not be enough to persuade the Mediterranean partners."
"What is needed is a realistic roadmap and realistic priorities for the implementation of the objectives of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation."
"Madam President, I should like to draw the attention of the House to two issues."
"The European Union’s Mediterranean policy establishes a Mediterranean partnership between societies based on the Jewish, Christian and Islamic faiths."
"At a time such as this, when fundamentalism is on the rise and the threat of terrorism is increasing, joint measures undertaken with universities, schools, civic institutions and churches to promote mutual understanding and tolerance among young people in the Mediterranean countries are of fundamental importance."
"I can tell the House that the new Member States are seeking inspiration in the experiences gained through the Mediterranean partnership as they strive to devise the Union's Eastern policy."
"The establishment of a common cultural area based on human rights and democracy, together with the rejection of fanaticism of any kind, is our response to the jingoistic movements operating in the world today."
"The second issue I wish to address is the problem of migration."
"Migration can be regarded as a threat, as has been amply illustrated in recent times by the writings of Oriana Fallaci."
"The real message of her books is that a new form of apartheid should be introduced in the European Union."
"At the same time, however, migration can also represent an opportunity to promote the development of Europe and the establishment of an international order based on peace and human dignity."
"The Barcelona process should serve as proof that such an order is feasible, and it should constitute Europe’s response to the threat of a clash of civilisations."
". – Madam President, thank you very much for this very interesting debate."
"I think it is clear to all of us that the Barcelona Process, of which we are celebrating the 10th anniversary, is a very important and historic process, even if we differ somewhat in our assessments."
"I think we can all say that the Barcelona Process has already made a difference, although it has not been exploited to the full."
"I agree with those who said that we have to deepen and reinforce it and we have to motivate ourselves to carry on the work."
"I can tell you again, I am a passionate, I would even say activist for this Barcelona Process and therefore I have initiated this communication, of which I have spoken before, in which we have prioritised the most important areas, at least in my view."
"We cannot do everything at once: education, democracy, human rights and reforms and economic development are priorities, but we must not forget the cultural aspect and also our heritage – remember the Euro-Med heritage programme."
"What is the difference between Barcelona and the Neighbourhood Policy?"
"For some, this may be confusing."
"Let me explain."
"Barcelona is the multilateral platform, the multilateral process, it is the process from region to region."
"This does not exclude this complementary bilateral process in the Neighbourhood Policy, with a tailor-made programme for each country."
"Why is that so important?"
"As many of you know, different countries have different attitudes."
"I have just come back from Lebanon, where we are working with the Prime Minister on his reform project, together with our action plan."
"There, I am very hopeful."
"I was also in Jordan recently, where we will do everything we can to support the national agenda."
"The Moroccan Deputy Minister was here today and we will be working very closely with the Moroccans."
"There are other countries where I am somewhat disappointed and where we need to work together."
"But it is for the countries themselves to make a difference and for us to support them."
"Although we have to share the responsibility and show solidarity, every country should first and foremost have ownership of its own process and reform."
"We should not forget that they have the primary responsibility for developing their own countries."
"The Euro-Med non-governmental platform presented its ideas in Luxembourg from 1 to 3 April 2005, and this very successful civil forum was organized with a series of national consultations and concluded with the approval of a statute and the charter of the NGO platform, as well as the election of a governing board."
"There were quite a number of proposals, which is certainly positive."
"That was reinforced in the declaration to be made in Barcelona."
"I know that the British Presidency intends to give those NGOs the right to speak and I think that is very positive and enriching for all of us."
"The Commission has been organizing three press conferences and a media taskforce will be set up in 2006 to work on this."
"Those who are not pursuing reforms in their own countries contribute to instability in those countries and thus in the region, whereas those who promote reforms improve stability in their countries and the region."
"Finally, may I say that I regretted very much not being able to attend the Euro-Med Parliamentary Committee in Rabat, but it was arranged on a day when the General Affairs Council, that is the Council of Foreign Ministers, was meeting and my first obligation was to that meeting."
"Otherwise I certainly would have attended."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place on 27 October 2005 at 11.30 a.m."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I dare say you have taken note of yesterday’s statement by President Ahmadinejad of Iran, who has expressed a desire to wipe the State of Israel off the map, claiming that this is what Ayatollah Khomeini would want."
"That is a monstrous thing to say, and in saying it, the President of Iran is aligning himself with terrorists."
"We see Israel’s integrity and security as being of great value, and we defend them."
"Speaking on behalf of my group, I wish to announce our intention to make an issue of this."
"We will be proposing it at the next part-session of this House, and I would welcome support from the other groups."
"I see that Mrs Koch-Mehrin and Mr Swoboda are here, along with others who might well give their support."
". Mr President, if this statement really was made in these terms, that is of course utterly unacceptable to anyone in this House and cannot be passed over in silence."
"It is because this demands an appropriate response that I wish, on behalf of my group, to express my strong support for Mr Poettering’s idea that this should be put on the order of business for the next part-session."
". Mr President, if these statements have indeed been made, we too find them unacceptable, scandalous and dangerous."
"It is in itself staggering enough for a president to address a conference with the theme of ‘a world without Zionism’ and to express himself in such terms."
"Such a thing is absolutely unacceptable, and we endorse the motion that it be made the subject of a debate in this House."
"Your proposals have been noted, as has your stated intention of, in due course, bringing this matter before such bodies as the Conference of Presidents."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0276/2005) by Mr Mavrommatis, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2004 (2005/2136(INI))."
". Mr President, I wish to thank you for this opportunity to address Parliament and to present the annual report for 2004, my first full year in office."
"The year 2004 was hugely significant for the European Union: a year of historic enlargement, European elections, a new Commission and intense debate about the Constitution."
"These events and the popular attention they attracted had important consequences for the Ombudsman, as I will explain in a minute."
"The annual report records our progress in handling complaints, in promoting good administration and in making the Ombudsman’s work better known to citizens."
"In total, 3 726 complaints were received, a 53% increase compared with the previous year."
"The rise in complaints does not result from worsening administrative behaviour by the institutions; rather, it reflects citizens’ increased general awareness of matters European and growing knowledge about their rights and about how to exercise those rights."
"As I have mentioned, 2004 was a year in which European subjects figured prominently in headlines throughout the Union."
"I also made intensive efforts to inform citizens about their right to complain to the European Ombudsman and to spread the word about the positive results that have been achieved."
"All in all, I gave over 30 public lectures and presentations and held over 150 meetings with ombudsmen, public officials and other interlocutors in the Member States and candidate countries."
"During 2004, I was able to help almost 70 % of the people who complained to me."
"The help took one of three forms: opening an inquiry, transferring the case to a competent body or advising on where to turn for a prompt and effective solution to the problem."
"I closed 251 inquires during the year."
"In 45 % of the cases, the inquiry revealed no maladministration."
"Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of a full explanation from the institutional body concerned of its actions."
"Furthermore, even when there is no maladministration, I may identify an opportunity for the institutional body to improve the quality of its administration in the future."
"If so, I point this out in a further remark in the closing decision."
"Whenever there is maladministration, I try, if possible, to achieve a positive-sum outcome that satisfies both the complainant and the institution."
"In 28 % of cases, my inquiries resulted either in the institution concerned settling the case to the satisfaction of the complainant or in a friendly solution."
"When a friendly solution is not possible, I close the case with a critical remark or make a draft recommendation."
"An example of a draft recommendation accepted in 2004 was a case in which the Commission granted compensation to a small company that had been given insufficient time to prepare a proposal for a research and development contract."
"If a Community institutional body fails to respond satisfactorily to a draft recommendation, the Ombudsman’s ultimate weapon is a special report to the European Parliament."
"Only one special report was made in 2004, following the Commission’s refusal to reconsider its rules on the grading of press officers in its delegations."
"I made the draft recommendation in this case because the Commission failed to provide a coherent and convincing explanation of the variations in its current practice, despite having every opportunity to do so during my inquiry."
"In my view, it is important that the European institutions should be willing to think again, rather than give the appearance of acting in an arbitrary way."
"I am grateful for Parliament’s support in this important issue of principle, as expressed in paragraph 11 of Mr Mavrommatis’s report."
"Two own-initiative inquiries addressing systemic issues were closed during the year with positive results."
"The Commission accepted the need to improve the administration of the European schools and gave a commitment to cooperate with parents."
"I encouraged the Commission to seek to ensure that the schools themselves acknowledge the need to empower parents and to win their trust."
"The Commission also accepted and implemented a draft recommendation to introduce an internal complaints procedure for seconded national experts."
"I would now like to say a few words about my priorities for the future."
"The first priority is to promote a citizen-centred approach by the EU institutions and bodies in all their activities."
"To this end, I will seek every opportunity systematically to reach out to the institutions to encourage best practice and promote friendly solutions."
"The active cooperation of the institutions and bodies is essential to the success of the Ombudsman’s work for citizens."
"The annual report contains many examples of the institutions taking prompt action to settle cases brought to their attention and responding positively to my proposals and recommendations."
"During visits to the institutions and bodies, I underlined the value of reacting promptly and constructively to complaints."
"The ultimate goal for us all must be to ensure the best possible service for the citizen."
"I will continue to push for an end to the present confusing situation in which different institutions and bodies apply different codes of good administration."
"Parliament has already approved, on 6 September 2001, the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour."
"That text contains the rules and principles that should apply to all the Union institutions and bodies."
"The Code has received wide recognition internationally, in the Member States and candidate states, in the Council of Europe and elsewhere in the world."
"It is, by all accounts, a European success story of which both Parliament and the Ombudsman can be justly proud."
"I was encouraged by the positive reaction of the President of the Commission on this point when I met the College of Commissioners in May this year."
"With the cooperation of the Commission, I believe that it would be possible for a common code to be adopted in 2006."
"I also intend to revisit the question of the Ombudsman’s statute."
"My principal objective here is to ensure that citizens can have full confidence in the Ombudsman’s power to find the truth when hearing witnesses or inspecting documents."
"I would also like to cooperate with Parliament to ensure that citizens’ complaints about violations of the fundamental rights mentioned in the Charter can be brought before the Court of Justice if an important issue of principle cannot be resolved in any other way."
"Parliament already has full rights as an institution to initiate cases before the Court."
"In that context, it could be useful for the Ombudsman to have the power to intervene in such cases; a power, I note, that has already been given to the European Data Protection Supervisor, with whom I had a very friendly and productive meeting last week."
"A third priority is to deepen my close cooperation with ombudsmen in the Member States through the European Network of Ombudsmen."
"The network makes it possible to transfer cases rapidly, share best practice and promote a free flow of information about European law and its implementation at the national, regional and local levels."
"The aim is to promote good administration throughout the Union so that citizens can enjoy their rights under European law."
"I am delighted that, following a valuable proposal from the De Rossa report last year, the Committee on Petitions participates in the network as a full member and was represented at the meeting of national ombudsmen, which took place in The Hague in September."
"I would like to thank the Members of the Committee on Petitions and, in particular, this year’s rapporteur, Mr Mavrommatis, for their support and constructive proposals as set out in Parliament’s report."
"I have already mentioned today many of the matters on which the report contains wise advice, at least to the Ombudsman."
"As regards other points, I have already undertaken to ask to appear before the Committee on Petitions whenever I deem it advisable and necessary to submit a special report to this House following the rejection of a friendly solution or draft recommendation."
"Earlier this month, I presented the Committee with two special reports."
"The first was on the financial treatment of Commission staff whose children cannot attend the European Schools because of their degree of disability."
"The second report found that the Council has given no valid reason for continuing to legislate behind closed doors."
"The Council could easily amend its Rules of Procedure to provide for open legislative meetings."
"I am also committed to improving information to citizens about the services provided by members of the European Network of Ombudsmen."
"I intend to introduce an interactive guide on our website to help complainants find the appropriate ombudsman to deal with, be it at the European, national or regional level."
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the first ten years of the European Ombudsman."
"To mark the occasion we published a volume tracing the history of the institution."
"We have also held a number of successful commemorative events, including one for the European Parliament on 27 September this year."
"Further events will take place in the next few weeks in both Strasbourg and Brussels."
"I believe that the relationships of goodwill, trust and understanding that have been built up over the last decade are a precious resource for improving the quality of public administration in Europe to the benefit of citizens."
"The European Parliament and its Committee on Petitions constitute vital partners for the European Ombudsman in this regard."
". – Mr President, I thank Mr Diamandouros for the cooperation which we enjoyed throughout the preparation and drafting of this report."
"My sincere thanks also to the Committee on Petitions, Mr Libicki, all my colleagues here today, Sir Robert Atkins and everyone else who helped with this report."
"Commissioner, Mr Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, the Ombudsman is an independent institution and a mechanism for controlling the administration of the European Union."
"The report presented to us by Mr Diamandouros at the meeting of the Committee on Petitions in Strasbourg constitutes a basic source for the drafting of the annual report by the European Parliament on the activities of the European Ombudsman."
"It is a fact that complaints increased by 53% in 2004, compared with the previous year."
"Although it was assumed that enlargement would be the main cause for the increase in complaints to the European Ombudsman, only 51% of the increase was accounted for by the 10 new states."
"Nonetheless, the increase in complaints does not necessarily mean that there are more cases of maladministration by the institutions of the European Union; it means that the citizens are better informed about their rights."
"This is due mainly to the intense activity of the Ombudsman."
"His numerous visits to Member States and third countries, public lectures, press interviews and other meetings in 2004 helped to inform citizens about his role and about the right of citizens to complain."
"However, despite Mr Diamandouros's activity to inform the public, confusion continues to reign as regards the sectors of competence of the European Ombudsman."
"To be specific, in 2004, 74.8% of complaints received by the European Ombudsman fell outside his mandate."
"Consequently, as the European Parliament, we too must contribute to the clear differentiation of the competences of the Community institutions to which European citizens can take recourse in order to exercise their rights."
"I also wish to comment on certain statistics in the Ombudsman's annual report."
"In 2004, 251 enquiries were closed, of which 4 were opened on his own initiative."
"Twelve friendly solutions were proposed, 36 cases resulted in critical remarks, including one to Parliament for failing to take adequate measures to promote fundamental compliance with smoking rules on its premises, 17 draft recommendations were prepared and one special report was submitted."
"An important factor in the efficacy of the institution of the Ombudsman is his cooperation with the institutions of the European Union and the European Parliament in general."
"I would refer, by way of example, to the regular briefings and meetings between Mr Diamandouros and the Committee on Petitions and its chairman, and his meeting on 25 May 2005 with the College of Commissioners."
"The conclusions of this meeting emphasise the genuine community of interests between the Commission and the European Ombudsman in ensuring that both the corrective and the interventionist aspect of the Ombudsman's job are carried out successfully."
"It is a fact that most complaints concern cases of maladministration."
"A case of maladministration, in accordance with the Ombudsman's 1997 annual report, occurs when a public body fails to act in accordance with the rule or principle which is binding upon it."
"22% of cases of maladministration were based on lack of transparency and refusal of information, 19% were based on discrimination and 12% were based on avoidable delay."
"In addition, 9% concerned unsatisfactory procedures, 7% unfairness or abuse of power, 6% negligence and 5% legal error."
"Bearing these statistics in mind, therefore, the Ombudsman should define the concept of maladministration with reference both to the institutions and bodies to which it applies and to matters which may be the subject of complaints."
"Mr President, Mrs Wallstöm, I should also like to point out, as I mention in my report, that it would be most helpful for the Ombudsman to be present in the Committee of Petitions of the European Parliament in order to discuss all forms of refusal on the part of the institution or to organise a friendly solution."
"The Ombudsman's annual report also demonstrates, among other things, the efforts being made by the Ombudsman to extend and energise the network of national and regional ombudsmen by developing exchanges of information and best practices."
"Participation by the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions in this network could facilitate practical cooperation between the European institutions and national and regional ombudsmen and would allow regular contacts with the committees on petitions of the national parliaments and with the ombudsmen of the Member States to be increased."
"The finding that 69% of complaints were against the Commission is particularly interesting."
"For its part, the European Commission should examine the complaints which concern infringements within a reasonable time, in order to ensure that citizens' complaints are examined immediately and effectively."
"Finally, a reference point for the preparation of my report was also last year's De Rossa report on the European Ombudsman's 2003 report."
"Comparing the Ombudsman's 2003 and 2004 reports, the result was positive and guides us to focus on the points of particular interest to the Committee on Petitions."
"In addition, in this way we can see the material progress made within a year."
"To close, I should like to thank all of you and the secretariat of the Committee on Petitions, of course, and all my honourable friends who helped with their amendments in the drafting of this report."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Mavrommatis, for his report, which is a very useful document."
"It allows the Commission to take into account the views of the European Parliament on a number of important issues raised by the Ombudsman in his annual report for 2004."
"Let me say that, for me, the Commission’s relationship with the Ombudsman is about firmly engaging ourselves to guarantee good administration and openness and, ultimately, democracy."
"The same applies to our relations with Parliament’s Committee on Petitions."
"To me, the European Ombudsman has an essential role in building bridges between citizens and the European Union."
"His actions contribute to enhancing the Commission’s interaction and communication with citizens."
"The Commission, therefore, will continue to look at different ways of further promoting its cooperation with and commitment to the European Ombudsman."
"As is rightly pointed out in Mr Mavrommatis’ report, the number of complaints to the European institutions and bodies addressed by the Ombudsman rose by 53% in 2004."
"I agree with the Ombudsman’s annual report that this reflects Europeans’ increasing awareness of the European Ombudsman, which is a development that we should welcome."
"In light of the Commission’s dedication further to improving and promoting its cooperation with the Ombudsman, I would like to take the opportunity to highlight the very recent reform of the Commission’s internal procedures."
"The reform aims at strengthening the guarantees of strong political ownership by each commissioner as regards Ombudsman enquiries within his or her domain."
"The Commission has decided to replace the existing empowerment – at present granted to the President alone – with an empowerment granted to the Commissioner in charge of the subject-matter of the enquiry addressed to the Ombudsman."
"In parallel, the Commission Secretariat-General reinforces its role as guardian of the political and administrative coherence and consistency of the Commission’s final replies to the Ombudsman."
"This reform will enter into force on 1 November 2005."
"Furthermore, the Commission needs to strengthen its efforts to agree to friendly solutions proposed by the European Ombudsman."
"Recommendations for the Commission to follow up certain aspects in order to remedy problems highlighted by different cases need to be taken into account promptly."
"Proposing solutions that give satisfaction to the citizen and to the administration is one of the main tools of the Ombudsman."
"It should be underlined again that the Ombudsman’s inquiries often not only produce positive results for the complainants but also help to improve the quality of our administrative services."
"Mr Mavrommatis’ report touches upon the issue of transparency, regarding in particular the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on access to documents, a fundamental right of citizens."
"The report also points out that Regulation 1049/2001 now applies to Community agencies."
"We can also confirm that we examine applications for access to documents with the utmost care and that derogations from the right of access are applied on a case-by-case basis."
"The role of the Ombudsman in this field is really important."
"We have made significant progress in the direction of better and more transparency."
"This is the case in particular for access to documents in infringement procedures."
"It is essential that the Commission should have the necessary room for manoeuvre to conduct its procedure totally independently."
"In these cases, a balance needs to be found between the transparency principle and confidentiality."
"For closed infringement procedures, the Commission has reviewed its practices and, in principle, documents have now been made available."
"The Commission is set on applying procedures that will allow the European Ombudsman to do his job."
"For example, it is now possible for the Ombudsman to inspect files."
"It allows him to verify the completeness and accuracy of the information supplied by the Community institution or body concerned."
"It is, therefore, an important guarantee to the complainant and to the public that the Ombudsman can conduct a thorough and complete investigation."
"The Commission attaches great importance to the issue of a code of good administrative behaviour, with binding effect upon all the EU institutions and bodies."
"We consider this matter with an open mind."
"The Commission’s own code entered into force in November 2000."
"We will report to the bodies concerned the results of our reflections on this issue."
"The recent creation of a European School of Administration increases the importance of this matter."
"The proposal for a new Constitutional Treaty would give the Union a specific legal base to act on this."
"However, considering the situation, we need to look at the issue differently."
"Nevertheless, a positive conclusion on this dossier is possible and I hope that we can arrive at the result proposed by the Ombudsman and the rapporteur."
"Let me say a few words on the Ombudsman’s Statute."
"During his visit to the College of Commissioners on 25 May 2005, Mr Diamandouros informed the Commission that he had asked the European Parliament to review certain aspects of the Ombudsman’s Statute."
"He would like in particular to be entitled to intervene in proceedings before the Court of Justice in cases relating to alleged violations of the rights set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It should be noted that, on this subject, it is the European Parliament that has the right of initiative and acts by majority vote, subject to Council approval, with the Commission merely issuing an opinion."
"The Commission will examine any new initiative in this respect with the utmost care and an open mind."
"Our willingness to cooperate with the Ombudsman is not only our obligation but is also very important for better administration."
"This is the reason why we welcome your report."
"Let me assure you that we continue to engage the Commission to work even closer with the Ombudsman and with Parliament’s Committee on Petitions."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Diamandouros, I welcome the Ombudsman’s report and would also like to express the warmest congratulations to my colleague Mr Mavrommatis on his draft."
"There is little doubt that the Ombudsman is one of the most important aids to securing the citizen’s position in his dealings with the institutions."
"Whenever people have dealings with large administrative units, an independent, straightforward and, above all, free external monitor is indispensable."
"I do not suppose it is accidental that it was the Scandinavian states that acquired such an instrument at a very early stage and that thought was given as early as the 1970s to establishing such an office in the Community, something that was eventually accomplished by the Treaty of Maastricht."
"The original idea was that the European Ombudsman would have a role as a parliamentary commissioner who would mainly advise and monitor, but the developments in practice have been speedy and have meant that the Ombudsman of today acts as the external monitor for European public administration and highlights recurrent abuses."
"Look at the figures for complaints and you find a constant increase, but, as I see it, the primary significance of that is not that European administration has become worse, but that more and more members of the public are endeavouring to assert their rights."
"That makes it less significant that inadmissible complaints have remained at a constant high level, amounting to some 70-75% on average. What they do indicate is that someone believes they have been on the receiving end of unfair treatment and wants to do something about it."
"If dealing with these things is not a permanent feature of daily life, finding the correct form is not always easy, and people ask themselves such questions as: ‘Have I supplied a full description of the facts of the case?’"
"‘Which institution should take action?’ What the inadmissible complaints should really do, then, is to present us with an opportunity to think about how we can create systems that offer the public a clear and cogent answer or the beginnings of a solution, both quickly and without red tape."
"It is for these reasons that the Ombudsman’s efforts to create closer networks among the national complaints offices and between them and himself deserve our wholehearted support, as do his efforts at improving communication."
"It is by these means alone that we will meet the citizen where he is at the moment, and will be able to allay some of his fears of a Community that is still, alas, largely a faceless entity."
"There are things that it is very definitely incumbent on the EU to do in this respect: it needs to improve administration, make for more transparency, speedier processes and easier access to the law, not least through non-judicial instruments such as the Ombudsman himself, as well as, of course, this House’s Committee on Petitions."
"For that reason, too, I am not particularly happy about the section in the draft report headed ‘Reflections on developments in the Ombudsman's role’ in which there is reference to the present time when ‘a debate is in progress on the failure on the part of European institutions and national governments to educate the peoples of the Union, following the twin referendum failures in France and the Netherlands on the European Constitutional Treaty’, and more of the same besides."
"What is this saying?"
"What is at issue here, surely, is not so much a failure to educate as the question of how we can improve the Community’s communications and policies."
"This is not about our didactic proclamation from on high of things that the population at large do not support."
"In this sense, what this report presents us with is both an inventory analysis and a mission, a mission not only to lay down improved rules that will enjoy public support, but also, and at the same time, to ensure that they are properly enforced, while equipping one of these instruments, namely the Ombudsman, with the powers and responsibilities he will need to perform his monitoring role independently, without reference to the courts, free of charge and in a citizen-friendly manner."
". Mr President, I welcome Mr Mavrommatis's report and, indeed, I welcome the European Ombudsman here today to the European Parliament."
"The Ombudsman's office is a direct link between the citizen and Europe; it enables citizens to make known their concerns about maladministration at European level."
"The committee of which I am a member and which prepared this report, the Committee on Petitions, equally, is a direct link with the citizen, but has a different role in that it enables citizens to ensure that authorities in the Member State comply with European rules, regulations, funding etc. So the Ombudsman and the European Parliament's Petitions Committee are, in a sense, complementary to each other."
"The very existence of the Ombudsman's office, I believe, is a deterrent to maladministration, and the 10th anniversary of that office deserves a review of the statute."
"I do hope that this Parliament, which has that responsibility, will undertake that in the course of the next 12 months."
"The Ombudsman's office clearly has resolved many problems, but it has not been in a position to resolve them all."
"Indeed, the fact that 75 % of the complaints the Ombudsman's office receives do not relate directly to European Union institutions and problems therein is, in my view, not necessarily a bad thing."
"It demonstrates that people are aware that there is a body there that can help them, and the fact that the Ombudsman's office refers them to the appropriate area where they may receive a resolution of their problem is an important service."
"I would like to mention a number of issues here; one relates to the European schools."
"A report is in preparation on the issue of funding for the European schools to enable children with special needs to be catered for, in the same way that all children attending European schools are catered for, free of charge with compulsory education."
"That is a matter the Commission, and specifically the Commissioner responsible for the budget of the European schools, has to address."
"Unless the Commission brings forward a detailed analysis of the money required in order to enable the schools to do their job properly, either in providing the special needs education within the schools or providing that education outside of those schools, then we are failing as a Union, and, indeed, as an employer of the parents of these children."
"The other issue I want to refer to is the code of good administrative behaviour."
"As has already been mentioned, this has been adopted by this Parliament; this Parliament itself operates by it and the Council operates by it."
"There is absolutely no reason why the Commission should not buy into that code of good administrative behaviour, so that we would have a common code for all three institutions."
"I would appeal to Commissioner Wallström to address that issue and to raise the matter with the college of Commissioners."
"The final point I want to make relates to the most recent special report, which is a rarity – special reports from the Ombudsman are a rarity – relating to the need for the Council to meet in public when making law."
"Your job in promoting the Plan D – debate, democracy and dialogue – is being undermined by the fact that the Council continues to refuse to make law in public."
"We would not accept that from this Parliament or from any national parliament; the Council should not be allowed to get away with it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mr Mavrommatis for his excellent report, and also the Ombudsman."
"The institution of the first ombudsman in Europe dates back to 1809 in Sweden."
"As an Italian citizen, I should, however, like to mention that it was Giuseppe Mazzini – the bicentenary of whose birth is this year – who instituted the petition by allowing people, both individually and collectively, to submit petitions under Article 10 of the Constitution of the Roman Republic of 1849."
"It was he who had the idea of a political association of Europe’s peoples in a Europe made up of free nation states federated together: the precursors of the concept of Europe that gained shape and substance a century later in the initial core of the current Union."
"Our Ombudsman’s annual report, which is being examined today, gives us an idea of the desire of citizens to interact with Community institutions."
"The fact that we have to consider, however, is that 72% of the 3 726 complaints received lay outside his competence."
"It is also significant that 51% of cases were reported by citizens in the enlargement countries."
"That means that the perception that citizens have of the Union and of their representatives is still confused, that Community citizens are undeniably well aware of their rights, and that they want to exercise their citizenship by complaining. It is also obvious, however, that they are not able to identify the right recipients for their complaints."
"The Ombudsman figure and the petition have been a success."
"That is a fact that cannot be ignored."
"Today, however, we have to look more closely into the reasons for the mistakes and why people make use of them wrongly."
"I believe an effort should also be made to reduce the time needed to examine complaints – as was also mentioned in the Mavrommatis report – by improving information exchange and cooperation among the institutions wherever possible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the office of the European Ombudsman was set up by the Maastricht Treaty as a part of European citizenship, which is still an ongoing issue that requires new rights as a result of enlargement and the complexity of migration and globalisation."
"I think our Ombudsman has fully met the three objectives that he undertook to fulfil: promoting the rule of law; good administration and respect for human rights; and enlargement – and hence closer contact with all citizens, including constant relations with ombudsmen throughout Europe."
"A political analysis of the data shows, however, that Europeans recognise and thus complain to Community institutions while effectively bypassing national institutions."
"Therefore, even though people’s perception of Europe corresponds to a different entity – which they imagine endowed with powers and competences – that perception often cannot be made real."
"We therefore have to do better at orienting European citizens towards our institutions, while accepting the people’s mandate to call on governments to be more open and to transfer areas of sovereignty for the sake of making European action more incisive."
"As has been mentioned, the Ombudsman is an independent, impartial body."
"He has to cooperate with all the other institutions and I believe he will do so to the best of his abilities, with our cooperation and that of all the institutions."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent report, and the European Ombudsman for the work he does every day and for his annual report."
"Commissioner Wallström, although your so-called Plan D to bring us closer to the European citizens, to open up the doors of this Institution and to promote dialogue, is worthy of our support, this does not preclude the right to complain to the Ombudsman, since it is he who offers the citizens an independent analysis in the event that they want to make a complaint about bad government or bad conduct on the part of the European institutions."
"There is absolutely no doubt that one of the conclusions that can be drawn from the referendums in France and Holland is that the citizens do not want to be treated as mere passive spectators, but as dynamic players in the process of European integration, who want more transparency and more means for participation."
"I believe that the Ombudsman does a very good job."
"But I would like to mention some of the problems we have faced, one in particular: I would like to express my concern and disapproval at the way in which the Conference of Presidents has dealt with the recent very important special report by Mr Diamandouros."
"This report contains an issue which is of great significance to the citizens: the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) apparently did not fully cooperate with the Ombudsman while he was investigating a complaint against it."
"The Committee on Petitions — the appropriate Committee — decided, therefore, to draw up a report and listen to both the Ombudsman and the Director of OLAF."
"I must express my surprise and amazement at the way in which the leaders of the two main political groups blocked the report and did not allow that hearing to take place."
"And to make matters even worse, the Conference of Presidents, on the insistence of the two main groups, prevented the Committee on Petitions from hearing the Ombudsman and the Director of OLAF, something which I believe Parliament’s Rules of Procedure do not allow it to do."
"I believe that the reasons given — that we were immersed in the process of electing a new Director of OLAF — were not acceptable, and that this House should examine this issue, because it has done no good, either in terms of transparency or in terms of responding to the citizens’ complaints."
"I believe that these actions cause collateral damage: they weaken the role of the European Ombudsman, which is completely irresponsible."
"In reaction to this, in agreement with the rapporteur, Mr Mavrommatis, I have presented several amendments to his report, so that Parliament may respond to the Ombudsman whenever he presents us with a special report."
"Since the amendments presented were supported by my colleagues in the Committee on Petitions, they are now part of the report that will be presented to the House."
"Naturally, it falls to Parliament to decide whether or not it agrees with the recommendations of the Ombudsman."
"What is unacceptable is that no position should be adopted, thereby damaging and weakening the crucial and extremely important role of the European Ombudsman."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Ombudsman’s report for 2004 does not, in our opinion, contain an overall view of the principles involved, even though the need for one could certainly be felt."
"As many speakers have emphasised, the referendum results, which sank the draft European Constitution in some major countries with great democratic traditions, show that there is a strong sense of impatience and widespread dissatisfaction among European citizens with regard to the democratic nature of the European institutions."
"In the eyes of the vast majority of European citizens, the European Union is seen as a Moloch, and the European Ombudsman should have felt the need to voice this feeling, which has been expressed so clearly."
"The report before us, however, is like a document from a statistics bureau: it is sterile and gives no hint of any battle over the principles and motivations behind the subjects dealt with."
"We need only think of the sensitive area of subsidies and public funding, for instance, which are responsible for perhaps the major part of the impression that European citizens have of the lack of transparency in Europe’s institutions."
"To whom can European citizens turn when they see a sign for huge and perhaps useless works bearing the words ‘funded by the European Union’ and they think of the money they have paid in taxes?"
"Why have you never thought of demanding that, wherever such signs are erected or EU-funded works are carried out, there should be an indication of how citizens – ordinary people – can reach the institution that should be upholding their desire for transparency?"
"If I think of what comes out every time that the anti-Mafia commission in my country touches on the use of European funds in certain regions, I wonder what an honest citizen from Sicily, Apulia, Calabria or Campania thinks when he or she sees such public works undertaken perhaps through non-transparent tendering processes."
"I believe that the office of the European Ombudsman needs to change direction and that the essential, sensitive subject of the role of a modern democracy in Europe should be addressed."
"The report talks in general terms of contacts with national ombudsmen, without specifying what was discussed at such meetings or explaining the spirit behind this cooperation."
"Although this network is certainly useful and we welcome it, there is no explanation, either, of the ramifications of the work that it can accomplish through the presence of national ombudsmen in the individual Member States."
"The idea of the European Ombudsman’s role that emerges from the report is somewhat ‘over-bureaucratic’, for a change."
"In addition, Mr Diamandouros, your statement of intent for your first five years of work is very general: you confine yourself to saying that citizens must know their rights, without mentioning the fact that a measure is currently being implemented that greatly endangers citizens’ freedom: the European arrest warrant."
"Let us therefore uphold the freedom of Europe’s citizens!"
". Mr President, I am delighted to take the floor during this debate, since I am sharing it with individuals for whom I have a great deal of respect."
"I refer to the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, with whom the Committee on Petitions, of which I am Chairman, cooperates very closely, the rapporteur, Mr Mavrommatis, who is one of the most active members of our committee, and Commissioner Wallström, with whom our committee maintains close and friendly contacts."
"I believe that an ombudsman needs three characteristics in order to perform his duties well."
"The first is to be professional and competent, and Professor Diamandouros possesses these attributes to a very high degree."
"The second is to be objective and impartial, and there can be no doubt that these are also qualities that can be ascribed to him."
"We are not aware of anyone ever having accused him of failing to perform his duties objectively, and it would have come to our attention had this been the case."
"I repeat, we have never come across any such accusations."
"The third characteristic is something that is less frequently mentioned nowadays, namely performing one’s duties with dignity."
"Professor Diamandouros demonstrates a great deal of dignity in the course of his duties."
"The role of ombudsman also demands a certain ability to make the job one’s own."
"This is very much apparent in Professor Diamandouros’ energetic approach, and we are delighted that this is the case."
"Every official should enjoy the respect of others, and this is true in the case of Professor Diamandouros."
"I am very much aware of this, since I am in close contact with the national ombudsmen, who are the best judges."
"Professor Zoll, the Polish Ombudsman, has always expressed his respect for Professor Diamandouros’ activities, and we find this very convincing proof."
"After all, our Committee on Petitions is fully aware of the high standard of Professor Diamandouros’ work, and he was also re-elected by an overwhelming majority."
"We should like to thank you on all these counts, Professor Diamandouros, and I should also like to thank the rapporteur."
"Mr President, Mr Diamandouros, this year marks the tenth anniversary of the European Ombudsman, as our rapporteur, Mr Mavrommatis, points out in his very comprehensive and pleasing report."
"Forgive me for saying so, Mr Diamandouros, but you only have competence with regard to maladministration issues."
"Therefore, as regards the issue of the feta cheese made by my Greek friends, you are not acknowledged as having competence with regard to feta cheese, which is produced in Lozère using goats’ milk from the south of France."
"On the other hand, you do have competence with regard to the violation of fundamental rights, in the European Parliament itself, to which 10% of your work relates."
"For example, a person’s fundamental right to speak his or her own language: the 35 non-attached Members do not benefit from interpretation services at group meetings."
"Why is this so?"
"Because between a monkey and a political homo sapiens, the non-attached Member is the missing link of humankind."
"Therefore, when we, the non-attached Members, communicate among ourselves, we scratch under our armpits, we stick our tongues out and we make grunting noises."
"That is obviously the reason why we do not need any interpreters."
"Second example: everyone has the right to accommodation, water and toilets here in Parliament."
"Well, we, the non-attached Members, have offices without toilets and without water."
"That is why we are calling for the Geneva Conventions on the rights of political prisoners and, in particular, on the right to go to the toilet, to be implemented."
"That is why, Mr Diamandouros, I will be nominating you as a candidate for next year’s Sakharov Prize if you denounce the violation of the human rights of the 35 Members who are being denied their right to use the toilet."
"It is true that the arrival of the Turks will resolve matters for the non-attached Members, inasmuch as we will perhaps have the right to use the toilets of the Turkish Members."
"That goes to show that the Lord works in mysterious ways."
"It is Turkey’s joining the EU that will finally mean that the political minorities – the non-attached Members – are respected within the European Parliament …"
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr Diamandouros, Mr Mavrommatis, let me start by saying how very grateful I am for the report that the Committee on Petitions and its rapporteur Mr Mavrommatis have produced; what makes it so very successful is that it revisits the most important problems that the Ombudsman addresses in his report and seeks to find a solution to them."
"Over the past year, the Petitions Committee and the Ombudsman worked very well together;"
"I believe that the way in which they managed this should be a model not only for the cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Commission but also – and this is a point to which I shall return later – for the cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Council."
"While this working relationship was, in the overwhelming majority of cases in 2004, marked by a great willingness to cooperate, it has to be said that there were a number of cases in which things could have turned out much better."
"The functions of an ombudsman – a position that the state from which I come has abolished – are of fundamental importance to the European Union, as he or she communicates directly with the European Union’s citizens and thereby brings them closer to its institutions."
"Despite all the difficulties to which Mr Seeber referred, this has already made it possible for much to be achieved, but we should nevertheless keep trying to persuade the public of the advantages that the Ombudsman can offer in bringing to light those abuses in European administration that are rather more serious than the case just described by Mr Martinez, and in following these problems up."
"Through his work, the Ombudsman ensures adherence to the highest administrative standards within the European Union, its institutions and bodies."
"Even in the 113 – out of a total of 251 – cases in which it was not possible to establish maladministration, the Ombudsman does do helpful work, since the institution concerned – the Commission, for example – can indicate ways in which quality might be improved in future."
"In individual cases, the Ombudsman can spare the institution unjustified criticism, being, as a sort of outsider, able to lay claim to absolute objectivity."
"As Mr Mavrommatis pointed out, the figures have, over the past few years, been on a constant upward curve."
"I am sure that reflects the confidence that is placed in you."
"We should, however, strive for a closer link between representing the interests of those members of the public who turn to their MEPs, and the work of your own institution, enabling us to make a better and more efficient job of handling their concerns."
"There is one thing left for which I would like to offer you the warmest thanks, and that is for your positive response to the question from the German – of which I am still a member – that was brought in by Mr Brok."
"I will take this opportunity to point out that the Council, which is the object of my criticism in this regard, is again, today, distinguishing itself by its lamentable absence."
"By holding its meetings behind closed doors, the Council does nothing to achieve the goal of the European Constitution that it played a part in adopting, which has to do with the most open possible approach to defending the interests of the public and speaking up for Europe’s citizens and inhabitants."
"It is indeed a positive sign that one European institution should be able to take a critical view of the actions of another and be guided in so doing by nothing other than the goals of the European Constitution."
"For that, Mr Diamandouros, I should like to thank you most warmly."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank both the Ombudsman and Mr Mavrommatis for their excellent report, and would like to begin by making a personal observation."
"I am an MEP from a new Member State, and when we discussed the annual report of the Ombudsman last year, I had no personal experience with the Committee on Petitions or with the institution of the Ombudsman."
"However, as Mr Mavrommatis mentioned in his report, in the course of the activities of the Ombudsman last year and his campaign in the new Member States, a great number of Hungarian citizens became aware of their right to submit a petition to the European Union."
"I am delighted to see that they are actually exercising this right, as well, and – even if the petitions submitted do not always comply with the expectations of the Union and we do not always know what to do with them – it is of considerable assistance to citizens of new Member States to have another forum to contact."
"As mentioned by Mrs Wallström in her speech, the Commission has a reform plan to assist our efforts."
"European citizens are justified to expect public institutions to work efficiently and openly."
"I hope that in the future the Commission will implement the reform endeavours formulated in the speech."
"Echoing the opinions communicated by many of my colleagues in the course of the debate, I, too, would like to ask the Council – as expressed by the Ombudsman in his special report – to consider opening up all Council sessions to the personnel of the other EU institutions."
"But if the Council insists on making all political decisions behind closed doors, at least the legislation procedure should be made transparent to us, and we should be allowed to be present when such decisions are made."
"Mr Diamandouros prepared a material last year resulting in an even closer cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, and created the so-called European Network of Ombudsmen, mentioned in his introduction."
"This is also to be welcome, and I am very pleased that this year the delegates of the Committee on Petitions have been able to take part in the meeting of this network, too."
"I would like to summarise my comments by pointing out to all of us that the activity of the European Ombudsman in the past ten years has been really successful, but there are still a great number of tasks to be tackled."
"And all of us, as well as all EU institutions and bodies must focus on these tasks, so that European citizens can feel that we are working for them, for the assertion of their rights and for finding solutions to public matters in their interest."
"Mr President, Mr Diamandouros, I should like to thank the Ombudsman for his detailed statement on his activities in 2004."
"This was a particularly significant year in view of the EU’s enlargement to include 10 new Member States."
"I should also like to pay tribute to Mr Mavrommatis and to thank him for his excellent report."
"The European Ombudsman referred to the three challenges that he faces."
"These include enforcing the rights of citizens as set out in EU legislation, adhering to the highest standards of administration and ensuring that measures taken on behalf of citizens are effective and of the highest quality."
"Professor Diamandouros has responded positively to all these key challenges."
"I should therefore like to pay tribute to him, not least for his attempts to help people in cases that fall outside his jurisdiction."
"The fact that this institution has been in existence for 10 years serves as an excellent example of the growing awareness of citizens’ rights in our Community."
"I say this as a representative of Poland, a new Member State, which has gained experience in this field through the institutions of the Polish Ombudsman and the Polish Ombudsman for Children."
"These factors all help to create a European society of citizens who are aware of their rights and obligations, and this is a point I should like to stress."
"It goes without saying that a great deal remains to be done."
"I have found that young people in particular are aware of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, and this means there is reason to be hopeful."
"It is also crucially important for the principle of transparency be adhered to wherever possible."
"There is one small point I should like to make to the Ombudsman."
"In my opinion, it was a mistake for him to refer to the Constitutional Treaty, since this document has no legal force, and we are all aware of the state of affairs following the two referendums."
"I believe that the current arrangements enshrined in the Treaty of Maastricht still hold."
"Finally, I would stress that it would be a fine thing if this institution became redundant, because absolute compliance with legislation had been achieved."
"If I may, I should also like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros on his anniversary, and to wish him !"
"Mr President, Mr Diamandouros, the Ombudsman’s home country of Greece won the European basketball championships a few weeks ago for the first time in over a decade."
"I mention this because Parliament’s motion for a resolution states that the Ombudsman provided effective assistance in almost 70% of cases referred to him."
"I can assure the Ombudsman that his fellow countrymen, who are the best basketball players in Europe, would tell him that a 70% success rate for two-or three-point field goals is unheard of, and I should like to congratulate him on his achievement."
"I should also like to congratulate him on the increase in the number of complaints, since this is proof that people take his institution seriously and believe there is a genuine need for it."
"I do not agree with the claim that only half of this increase is due to the 10 new Member States, as stated in the draft resolution."
"The word ‘only’ in this sentence should be replaced by ‘as much as’, since the institution of the European Ombudsman is a very new concept for the citizens of the new Member States."
"The Ombudsman should rest assured that in time he will be bombarded with our complaints."
"Mr President, first of all, please allow me to congratulate my colleague, the rapporteur Manolis Mavrommatis, who has reviewed with great care the anniversary report of the European Ombudsman on his activities in 2004, submitted to the European Parliament."
"I, too, support the close cooperation of the Ombudsman with the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament, because this enables citizens’ petitions to reach the decision-makers of the European Parliament directly, providing a direct feedback on the efficiency of EU legislation."
"The 2004 annual report issued by the European Ombudsman reveals that the number of complaints received increased by 53% in 2004 compared to 2003."
"Even more surprisingly, only half of this increase originates from the ten newly joined Member States."
"In other words, it may seem that the citizens and businesses of the new Member States have fewer grievances in the EU, or are less prone to complaining."
"As the representative of one of the newly joined Member States, I can tell you from experience that neither of these is true."
"Although it is true that the majority of the ten new Member States submitted fewer complaints compared to the proportion of their population, the main reason for this lies in their relative unfamiliarity with the institution of the European Ombudsman, and not in a lower number of grievances."
"Unfortunately, under information, as well as an ingrained negative conditioning, a fear of making a complaint rooted in past experiences still persists in the eight newly joined post-socialist states."
"It is an unfortunate fact that to this day citizens are still contacting us, MEPs, informally, to tell us about discrimination suffered in European institutions."
"Therefore I know from experience that it is difficult even for us to persuade them to take their complaint to the Ombudsman."
"As an MEP, but not as a European employee, I often see discrimination even one and a half years after accession."
"One example I could mention is the Parliament practice whereby the questions we ask in writing are only translated into our mother tongues and the languages of the fifteen old Member States, and the answers received are only given in our mother tongue, English and French."
"In particular, I would like to call the attention of Mr Diamandouros to a discriminative phenomenon experienced in the course of admission to European institutions."
"One of the conditions of the admission exams announced to the 25 Member States is that the exam will be conducted in two of the 15 languages of the EU."
"This means that while a candidate from an old Member State may take the exam in his/her mother tongue and a foreign language, a candidate from a new Member State cannot use his/her mother tongue."
"Countless similar complaints are received day by day."
"The Parliament debated the Vaxholm issue of Sweden on Tuesday, but we see similar discrimination committed against businesses in new Member States, as well."
"Allow me to mention the case code named Soko Bunda and Soko Pannonia, involving the exclusion of several dozens of Hungarian businesses from the German market with methods that are finally considered wrong even by the courts."
"Incidentally, my fellow MEPs and I have also contacted the competent Commissioner in this matter."
"In view of these issues, I believe that the continuous information of citizens is of utmost importance."
"I was delighted to read that citizens in Member States are increasingly aware of their right to contact the Ombudsman concerning any administrative irregularities they experience."
"In particular, I find it very important to stress that the institution of the Ombudsman is not just one of the many superior authorities or an enforcement office – it is a special institution established to assist citizens with their concerns and complaints."
"An additional plus in the Ombudsman’s report for 2004 is that apart from a presentation of cases and investigations it also provides a topical analysis of the work carried out."
"I am particularly delighted by the fact that the Ombudsman undertakes an active public role in order to inform citizens."
"Mr Diamandouros, as Ombudsman you represent the 450 million citizens of the European Union."
"This is the case both when they write to you as individuals and when they take collective action."
"The law states that any citizen of the EU and any natural person residing in a Member State can refer a complaint to you."
"As well as adults, who can protect their own interests, this includes those of the EU’s citizens who are not yet of age, or in other words children."
"Your report contains certain indications that your institution takes an interest in this issue, but I should like to ask a more general question."
"To what extent do you personally feel responsible for representing the youngest citizens of the EU, and for representing their interests and needs in their dealings with EU institutions?"
"Before I put my second question to the Ombudsman, I should like to congratulate him on his consistent application of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour."
"This Code has been adopted by the administrations of the Member States, and it is gaining in popularity throughout Europe, including in my country, Poland."
"Good administration starts with the proper selection of staff, however, and with the recruitment and employment of officials in an entirely non-discriminatory fashion and in full respect of the principle of equality."
"In this context, I should therefore like to ask your opinion of the procedures for employing citizens from the new Member States in the EU institutions."
"Does the fact that few or none of these citizens are employed as officials, and in particular as high-ranking EU officials, not amount to discrimination?"
"Mr Diamandouros, our goal is an EU that is closer to its citizens, and you have taken the first step in this direction."
"You are closest to the EU’s citizens, and they both need and appreciate you."
"I should like to congratulate you on this score."
"Mr President, the European Ombudsman performs an extremely important role in democratic European society."
"He is a direct point of contact for citizens, who refer complaints about cases of maladministration within the European institutions to him."
"Although the vast majority of complaints, 75% to be more precise, concern matters that are outside his competence, this would indicate that the Ombudsman is frequently regarded as a last resort in the fight against the incompetence of national authorities."
"In view of this fact, the provision of reliable and detailed information to citizens about their rights and the role of the European Ombudsman should be regarded as a priority."
"Professor Diamandouros deserves much credit for his activities to date in the role of Ombudsman, which include the drafting and distribution of annual reports and a strong public presence in terms of the provision of information to citizens."
"Nevertheless, it is absolutely essential that efforts continue to make these activities more effective."
"The Ombudsman should be a guardian of good administration within the European institutions, and he should cooperate even more closely with his counterparts at local and regional level."
"Citizens’ complaints must be dealt with rapidly and effectively, and the Ombudsman should therefore be supported in his efforts to encourage the European institutions to deal with complaints more speedily."
"These complaints relate, , to refusals of access to documents."
"Public access to information relating to the European institutions serves as proof that the actions of the latter are open and transparent, and our aim should therefore also be to guarantee this right to all citizens of the European Union."
"These citizens are after all the ones for whom these institutions are working."
"In particular, I would suggest firstly that the European Commission should stop refusing to distribute its documents, and secondly that it should adopt the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour without delay."
"This would put an end to the current situation whereby the European institutions apply different codes of practice."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Members of Parliament for their kind remarks on the work of the Ombudsman during the past year."
"I am deeply appreciative of the attention and the very careful and constructive comments."
"I note that a great many of the comments came from the new Member States, which I welcome very much as an indication of their commitment to this institution."
"I welcome the tenor, the nature, the thrust and the intent of the remarks by the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs Wallström."
"I am delighted to hear her formally announce the reform that the Commission is about to adopt as of 1 November, which will make it possible for the complaints to be handled at a higher level, with a greater degree of responsibility and uniformity."
"I appreciate the Commissioner’s commitment to greater cooperation, particularly the encouraging words concerning the proposed revision of the Statute."
"I note, finally, that we can look forward to a binding code."
"I see that from your positive remarks and I am very grateful for the political will you have demonstrated on issues to do with the Ombudsman."
"That is exactly the kind of cooperation I look forward to from the Commission."
"I want to thank the Commissioner for that publicly."
"Concerning the various comments from Members, allow me to mention briefly those of Mr Seeber."
"Clearly we have a high percentage of inadmissibles, but we have managed to help 70% of those who come to us and whose complaints are not admissible."
"I find that to be a satisfactory percentage of citizens we can help, even though they are outside the mandate."
"I wish to thank Mr De Rossa for his remarks."
"At the last meeting of the national ombudsmen held in September in The Hague, we took specific decisions on how to address, through the network, mechanisms to expedite the handling of issues outside the mandate."
"I hope to be able to take further steps to reduce the number of inadmissibles."
"Concerning Mr Hammerstein Mintz’s remarks, for which I thank him, the report that he referred to relates to 2005."
"It is therefore not part of my report to this body for 2004; it is a report concerning OLAF that will be examined next year."
"As far as I am concerned, I have completed my duty to Parliament and have submitted a special report."
"It is now up to this august body as to how it wishes to move forward."
"I appreciate the remarks from Mr Borghezio and Mr Martinez, but I need to point out that the Ombudsman, unlike Parliament, is not a political body."
"Therefore, it is not within my mandate to get involved in the kind of political activities that you are asking of me."
"I fear that, were I to do so, this body – to which I am ultimately accountable – would object to my taking political initiatives which are beyond my mandate."
"I am aware, Mr Martinez, of the problem that arises as a result of your being a non-attached Member."
"Yet, once again, I will confine what I have to say to the content of your remarks."
"However, your remarks fall outside the scope of my mandate as they are, instead, to do with political issues."
"I want to thank Mr Libicki for his cooperation in his capacity as chairman of the Committee on Petitions."
"I am also grateful to all the staff of the committee for their help and I hope that this cooperation will continue."
"The remarks by Mrs Dobolyi and Mr Olajos were very constructive."
"Let me just say to Mr Olajos that I am currently dealing with a case concerning discrimination in language candidacies."
"I have asked for further information."
"That particular case is still being examined and I hope to be able to report to this body next year on the outcome."
"Finally, let me say to Mrs Grabowska that I am, as you know, very sensitive to issues concerning children."
"One of my special reports to this body this year had to do with the special education needs of severely disabled children."
"Therefore this is very much a concern of mine and I will be happy to consider any other complaints."
"I have not in fact received any other complaints relating to children."
"Nor I am aware of having received any complaint about recruitment and the filling of senior posts."
"However, because I receive many complaints concerning recruitment, I shall be very sensitive to that issue."
"Lastly, I know there is a case concerning recruitment pending before the Court of First Instance."
"That is therefore automatically outside my mandate and I will have to await the decision of the judicial authorities."
"I should like to thank Members of Parliament and the Commissioner again for their remarks and support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"Mr President, I wish to say something pursuant to Rules 142 and 143 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Many Members of this House were surprised to note that yesterday’s budget debate was over just after 11 a.m., although it had been allotted time up until midday."
"Now it may well be that the time had not been properly worked out, and it is the case that a number of Members did not turn up, and that there were those – the Commission and the Council, for example – who spoke with unexpected brevity."
"I would ask the House’s Bureau, however, to give some thought to whether it might not be possible to respond more flexibly under such circumstances, particularly by giving the floor to those Members who were present in the Chamber right up to the very end of the debate – if they so desire it, that is – or by letting them speak for longer."
"Instead, Members were given only a minute each in which to speak, and we wasted almost an hour in which no business was transacted."
"Could the Bureau perhaps introduce a rule on this, so that this debate may be conducted flexibly, and the time available used to the full?"
"Thank you very much, Mr Swoboda."
"We take good note of your request."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before starting the vote I must put a specific issue to the House: in its meeting yesterday, the Conference of Presidents decided to propose that, on an exceptional basis, the debate on human rights in the Western Sahara should not conclude with the vote on a motion for a resolution, in order not to prejudice the visit by the Delegation to that region from 11 to 15 January of next year."
"In accordance with our Rules of Procedure, I must submit this exceptional decision by the Conference of Presidents to the House and I shall allow one Member to speak in favour and one to speak against this proposal."
"Mr President, I would in fact like to put the case for a vote on the resolution."
"In the Conference of Presidents, I saw fit to argue that there should be no resolution, my justification for this being that we should wait to see what comes back from the delegation before drafting one."
"As its Chairman, I am of course dependent on my Group’s support, and so I reported this to them this morning."
"The Group was unanimous in its view that we should in fact frame a resolution today."
"What that means – and I am not ashamed to admit it – is that the Group’s opinion differed from my own."
"I am under an obligation to act in accordance with the Group’s vote, and so, good democrat that I am, I am in favour ..."
"... yes, and I wish others would do likewise and say that they accept what the group bids its chairman do. Our group’s opinion is that we should not await the outcome of the delegation, but should instead make our views on the subject known now."
"It is for that reason that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in favour of us coming to a decision on a resolution today."
"Mr President, the situation has changed, inasmuch as Mr Poettering, a member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has finally come round to the position held by his group, which was the position that I myself had upheld at the Conference of Presidents. It consisted of saying that no tactical consideration whatsoever should prevent Parliament from expressing its opinion on the urgency of the human rights situation in Western Sahara"
"and that, before sending a delegation, it would make more sense for Parliament to outline its position on, in particular, the very recent and serious revelations involving the discovery of common graves, to enable it to highlight this issue and to call on the Moroccan authorities and, indeed, everyone to work with the new UN representative."
"I therefore welcome the position outlined a few moments ago, which will undoubtedly be the one upheld by our entire Assembly, namely that in favour of holding a vote at the end of our debate this afternoon."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, before I propose a few technical adjustments, please allow me to thank all my fellow Members for the excellent debate – concise and to the point – that we had yesterday and for the loyal cooperation that they have given so far and, I hope, will continue to give during the vote and in the subsequent stages."
"As happens every year, before we proceed to the vote I ask that a few technical adjustments be accepted."
"With regard to line 15 06 06 on special annual events, in the second indent of the text the words ‘at the new Museum of Europe’ should be deleted."
"In line 19 03 06 on European Union special representatives, the word ‘envoy’ in the remark should be replaced with the word ‘representative’ for the sake of consistency with the title of the line."
"The remainder of the remark on this line has been struck through because of a technical error; that part of the text therefore is not supposed to be deleted."
"In Amendment 771 in block 4, the total amount of payment appropriations for budget line 22 02 01 01 should be written in the line and, finally, in the lines on the European Development Fund, a reminder should be introduced to restore the preliminary draft budget."
"This specifically affects lines 21 03 01 to 21 03 015."
"Mr President, what I am about to do is not standard practice."
"In the following heading, we have two amendments: one amendment tabled by the Committee on Budgets and another concerning orphan medicinal products, which was tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"We have to vote in favour of the amendment tabled by the Committee on Budgets."
"As far as the second amendment is concerned, it is calling for an additional EUR 1 million for orphan medicinal products, which the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products requires."
"I should like to know if it would be possible for us to vote on Amendment 231, so that the Agency might be able to work this year with all of the resources it requires."
"You will realise that, technically speaking, this is not correct procedure."
"I entirely agree."
"However, it turns out that, since the vote in the Committee on Budgets, we have received additional details."
"If it were possible to vote in favour of Amendment 231, which would add EUR 1 million still available in the budget margin, this would enable us substantially to improve working conditions in such a very important area to us."
"If we have understood properly, you want us to vote first on Amendment 231 and then on Amendment 779."
"Mr President, we can also vote in favour of Amendment 779. However, I should like it if, in addition to Amendment 779, we were able to vote in favour of granting a further EUR 1 million to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for orphan medicinal products."
"I should like to point out to you that, if anyone objects to this, we are obliged to accept his or her objection."
"Is there any opposition from the political groups?"
"Mr President, we prefer to conform to procedural principles."
"The original distribution of the voting list is therefore preferable."
"Then we shall proceed as planned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if this amendment is adopted, I also ask that the standard phrase that we have used for all similar amendments be adopted, which is ‘part of the appropriation is intended for’, because we cannot reserve specific funds."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to avoid confusion during the vote, I propose we vote on Amendment 74 for the remarks and Amendment 223 for the amounts."
"Is there any opposition?"
"Mr President, we are returning to the same thing; we prefer the voting order established in the procedure."
"We do not understand these last-minute changes."
"Mr President, in the amendments before us there is no change in the amounts."
"We are not voting on the amounts."
"There is only a remark on it."
"That is the only change."
"We will vote only on the remark."
"We will vote on the figures later."
"You are absolutely right."
"We shall proceed as planned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I said before also applies to this amendment: if it is approved, the standard phrase should be adopted, because we cannot specifically reserve funds: hence ‘part of the appropriation is intended for’."
"Having taken note of this, we shall proceed to the vote on Amendment 292."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the ‘other institutions’ section of the 2006 budget, the following technical correction is necessary."
"The date mentioned in Amendments 473 and 475 — 31 October 2005 — should be removed from the notes and added to the explanatory statements."
"Mr President, there is a problem: in this row we do not have any interpretation or any microphone service."
"It is the whole row."
"I would ask the technical services to come and resolve this technical problem."
". Mr President, due to technical problems I shall speak English in order that those colleagues who also have technical problems can better understand."
"As a result of the vote on the draft general budget, the following technical adjustments should be made. First, in paragraph 5, the amount should be EUR 7.7 million."
"Paragraph 27(b) should begin ‘to create 46 posts (21 A*, 1 temporary A*, 19 B* and 5 C*)’."
"In paragraph 41, the amount should be EUR 3 398 000."
"In addition, the date mentioned in paragraphs 17, 23 and 25 should be replaced by 30 November 2005."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Dombrovskis has spoken in English instead of Polish."
"I am aware that many Members understand English better than Polish, but all the languages have the same status and interpretation should therefore be available for all of them or for none of them."
"It has been a technical problem beyond the control of this House and Mr Dombrovskis has been kind enough to cooperate with his fellow Members."
"That concludes the vote."
"Mr President, today, at the first reading of the general budget, I voted against Amendments 543, 301, 344 and 345 on the grounds that they draw no distinction between breeding animals, production animals and animals for slaughter."
"I speak not only for myself but also for Austria when I say that I am opposed to the export of live cattle for slaughter, but as there is no difference in valuation between breeding animals and animals for slaughter, the abolition of export subsidies amounts to the destruction of European production and of cattle farmers’ livelihoods."
"Secondly, I voted in favour of Amendment 99 on the grounds that the Common Market Organisation for tobacco still exists and is in force."
"We want the budget to contribute to sustainable social, economic and environmental development for the EU in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy."
"In the vote, we have therefore chosen to support those amendments that accord priority to research, development and education."
"We do not, however, wish to support those amendments that would give more money to direct agricultural aid, since such aid is already disproportionate and leads to inefficient agriculture that harms the environment and that, through the dumping of surpluses, helps widen the gap between the world’s rich and poor."
"Nor do we wish to provide money for aid for tobacco cultivation since this directly contributes to public health problems."
"We believe that this aid should quickly be phased out with a view to its being completely abolished before long."
"The money thereby saved could be spent, for example, on measures designed to reduce the use of tobacco and people’s dependency on it."
"We want to see direct aid to sugar producers reformed, since we cannot in the long term support production that is in large part superfluous."
"We do not, however, want producers in developing countries to lose their livelihood, and we have therefore voted in favour of transitional aid to compensate them until they have had time to convert to other forms of production."
"The June List believes that the EU budget should be limited to 1.00% of the Member States’ average gross national income and therefore supports the Council’s position in principle."
"The 2006 budget is the last budget within the present financial perspective, which is why it is additionally unfortunate that the European Parliament should be trying to promote its own positions prior to the forthcoming negotiations by proposing hefty increases."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against all the increases proposed by the European Parliament, at the same time as having welcomed the few savings proposed in the form of amendments by one or other of the budget committees or by individual Members."
"There are further unfortunate budget items, but the June List particularly regrets the high amount of aid for the EU’s agricultural policy, Cohesion Fund and fishing industry, as well as those budget items providing aid to various forms of information campaign."
"Amendment 263:"
"This budget line would have given an authorisation to use funds to communicate the benefits of the euro."
"As Scotland, as a current part of the UK, is not a member of the euro I have accordingly abstained as this is not a matter for me."
"Amendment 440:"
"This budget line would have extended the translation facilities of the ACP assembly to include all languages, as opposed to the current working languages of that assembly."
"While I would in principle support the extension of translation on the basis that all languages are of equal dignity, the costs of this move to such a vast number of languages would be prohibitive."
"It would also, I suspect, be unnecessary as the current system has worked well enough up till now."
". It is a real pity that Parliament today has voted to maintain tobacco subsidies."
"Half a million EU citizens die needlessly each year from tobacco related illnesses."
"It is only through concerted action that we can fight against the tobacco industry and protect public health."
". I hereby declare that I voted in favour of the amendment about CESI 446 concerning budget line 04030302."
"British Conservative policy is firmly committed to ensuring that budgetary commitments should not exceed 1.0% of GNI contributions. We would like to see an EU that spends taxpayers' money wisely on initiatives that support the Lisbon objectives while eliminating fraud, mismanagement and wasteful spending such as tobacco subsidies."
"For these reasons, we have voted against amendments or proposals that would breach the 1.0% ceiling without, in our view, contributing to the promotion of sustainable growth and jobs in Europe."
"However, we do support projects that will encourage the development and supply of new-generation energy solutions."
"The Members of the European Parliament from Denmark’s Liberal Party voted against Amendment 7, tabled by Mr Bonde on behalf of the Independence and Democracy Group."
"The Liberal Party is opposed to the export of live animals and has voted against budget line 05 02 13 04."
"Mr Bonde’s proposal cannot, however, be implemented in practice and must be considered unrealistic and ill thought-out."
". I support the Pittella Report including Amendments 3004 [amp] 3005, which restore €12 million of the 2006 funding for PEACE 11 to the technical assistance/innovative actions budget-heading."
"The Member States must ensure the budgetary flexibility required in no way endangers continued full funding of PEACE 11, as envisaged last year when funding for that programme was guaranteed into 2006."
"The Socialist Group played a key role in securing €108 million for Ireland's Peace 11 programme for 2006, and continues to pledge its full support for the programme."
"John Hume, a former member of the Socialist Group was the architect of the PEACE programme and its contribution to reconciliation has been enormous."
"If we are to succeed in bringing communities together from both sides of the sectarian divide continued funding for the PEACE programme is crucial"
"We must also support the SDLP campaign for a PEACE 111 programme by earmarking €200 million in the 2007-2013 budget."
"I hope Minister Noel Tracy takes this up urgently and all Member States ensure smooth administration of arrangements for finalising the PEACE 11 funding, and guarantee continuing funding for a PEACE 111 programme for 2007-2013."
". I voted in favour of the scrapping of tobacco production subsidies."
"I feel that tobacco production, a key component in the tobacco industry, should no longer be subsidised."
"The harmful impact of tobacco use on public health (over 500 000 deaths per year due to illnesses linked to tobacco use), and in turn on the economies of the Member States and the EU, leads me to conclude that the EUR 100 000-plus spent on subsidies to these producers under the CAP is morally, politically and economically indefensible."
"To my mind, tobacco production and the tobacco industry should not only lose our support but should gradually, but quickly, be eliminated."
"Parliament must exert pressure on the Member States and the Commission to effect such a change, through the EU budget that it adopts."
"Naturally, I am sensitive to the problem of the 3 500 jobs that depend on tobacco production in Portugal."
"I therefore believe that efforts to convert this industry must be redoubled, in order to guarantee jobs and the economic survival of producers in Portugal and all of the European tobacco-producing countries."
"In this regard, I support all of the financial backing that can be given to them, on the part of Community or national institutions."
"To persevere with the policy of European subsidies, however, represents ..."
". The purpose of this explanation of vote is to condemn the hypocrisy of the majority in Parliament, which, having previously approved plans to set up a ‘Community programme’ with ‘adequate resources’ for the textiles and clothing sector, ‘especially’ designed to help the ‘least favoured regions’, with support for ‘research, innovation, vocational training and the SMEs’, has now rejected a clear proposal aimed at putting this programme into practice under the Community budget for 2006."
"In other words, the majority in Parliament is guilty of shameless inconsistency."
"From our perspective, we are bitterly disappointed at the rejection of proposals which we tabled and which enjoyed the support of various Members of this House. They were aimed at:"
"- creating a pilot project for action in the textiles and clothing sector with a view to the future creation of a Community programme;"
"- creating recovery plans for fisheries resources, in light of the social and economic impact of the closed seasons;"
"- and promoting multilingualism, not least in the ACP-EU parliamentary assemblies."
"We also campaigned for the adoption of other proposals that we tabled, aimed at reforestation and forest fire prevention, the preservation of cultural heritage, and support for cooperation amongst SMEs."
". In the budget vote I voted for CAP reform, for cuts in Tobacco subsidies, for the end of the transport of lives animals over 8 hours, against cuts in the Northern Ireland peace programme and for assistance to ACP banana and sugar producers."
". I voted for Heading 3 of the Budget Vote today because I want to add no less than 200 million euros in payment appropriations to a range of budget headings for the Lisbon strategy which the Council reduced at first reading."
"The main areas which would boost EU competitiveness include increases for programmes to support small and medium-sized companies, but above all for the 6th framework research programme."
"The payments for education programmes are also increased, by 35 million euros for Socrates, 20 million euros for Leonardo da Vinci and 3 million euros for e-learning, which I fully support."
". I voted to delete this budget line because I do not believe that we should in this day and age be refunding the export of live animals, often in dreadful conditions."
"I accordingly voted to end this practice."
". – The Communist Party of Greece is categorically opposed to the anti-grass roots preliminary draft budget of the European Union for 2006."
"Its approval by the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the social democrats and so on marks the intensity of the anti-grass roots attack by the European Union and urban governments in the Member States against the working and grass-roots classes, in order to increase the profits of euro-unifying big business."
"It is an 'escort' of the anti-grass roots, reactionary action plan being discussed at the informal summit in England to extend capitalist restructurings within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, make drastic cuts to social benefits, agricultural production and small and medium-sized enterprises and transfer resources to strengthen the military capitalist mechanisms."
"Tobacco farmers are in the firing line with cuts of EUR 1 billion."
"On the pretext of identifying tobacco farming with the anti-smoking campaign, Community tobacco is being proclaimed dangerous and imported tobacco is being proclaimed 'innocent'."
"These decisions by the EU on the anti-grass roots reform of the CAP are also trampling over the limited support for agriculture up to 2013."
"While unemployment and poverty are increasing exponentially and there are huge requirements for public health, education and so on, capital is being transferred to communications policy in order to camouflage the imperialist and anti-grass roots nature of the EU."
"The fight by the workers' movement against the draft budget needs to include the entire anti-grass roots policy of the EU."
"The Members of the European Parliament from Denmark’s Liberal Party voted against Amendment 4, tabled by Mr Bonde on behalf of the Independence and Democracy Group."
"The Liberal Party is in favour of reforming the reimbursement of travel expenses, so that all reasonable and necessary travel expenses are refunded."
"Mr Bonde’s proposal is, however, absurd and could not be implemented in practice."
". I wish to record that I abstained on amendments dealing with travel allowances at cost because I believe this is covered in the Member's Statute."
"Whilst the Members of this House belonging to the SPD are in favour of a statement of travel expense that reflects the costs actually incurred, we will not agree to any amendment calling on the President to break the House rules."
".In one month’s time in Barcelona, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is due to be radically reformed on the basis of a number of forceful ideas."
"Firstly, in the fight against poverty, a Mediterranean version of the Millennium Development Goals needs to be drafted and funded and progress made with solidarity structures comparable to those found in European regional policy."
"Promoting democracy and human rights has to be at the heart of the partnership by practically implementing Article 2 of the Association Agreements and by bringing into widespread use the sub-committees on human rights."
"The fight to eliminate discrimination against women and to promote gender equality has to be the subject of a specific and priority policy area for the EU."
"It is women who will act as the vehicles for genuinely bringing together the different peoples and cultures around the Mediterranean basin."
"Common responses to the issue of immigration are required."
"Let us put a stop to the hypocrisy and cynicism."
"Let us not think about keeping our hands clean while we let our southern partners do the dirty work."
"We have to lay the foundations for shared management of migratory flows by adopting a generous and united approach to the issue of the movement of persons in the Mediterranean area."
"We require an ‘area of sustainable development’ in the Mediterranean, with a programme aimed at eliminating pollution in the Mediterranean Sea by 2020, along with a precise timescale in which this is to be carried out."
". I welcome this report."
"I would like the Barcelona Process and structures to be used to a greater extent to encourage dialogue and interaction (economic, social cultural, educational, technical etc) between Israel and its neighbours."
"I am convinced this is the only way that the peoples of this region will be able to live in peace."
"There can be no security behind barriers."
". Recently, in the course of one night, over 1 000 black Africans tried to storm the border of Melilla as a means of finding their way into the ‘promised land’."
"The attempt cost an untold number of them their lives, while large numbers of others surrendered themselves into the merciless clutches of the people-traffickers who, as ever, dangle before them the prospect of Europe, the land of milk and honey of which they dream."
"So it is that desperate people find themselves forced into a hopeless situation, not least since they often have no prospect of returning home."
"It has to be said, though, that local decision-makers must bear their share of responsibility for the tragedy, in that they encourage this development by surreptitiously granting residence to illegal immigrants en masse."
"An excessively liberal and naive attitude towards illegal immigration, lamentably exemplified not least by the recent ‘Kiev Affair’, far from helping anyone, does nothing but create more problems, primarily by benefiting people-traffickers and others who engage in organised crime."
"Uncontrolled population growth will further swell the flood of economic refugees on Morocco’s borders and off the coasts of Italy and Malta, necessitating not only an EU-wide approach to the problem but also action to dispel the unrealistic images of paradise Europe in the countries from which the refugees come, to the end that we may free up the resources to improve living conditions on the ground."
"It is for precisely that reason that it is so important to retain the Barcelona process as a means of combating poverty and to press on with the development of the action plans specific to each country."
". The purpose of the Barcelona Process was to act as a turning point in relations between the EU and its southern neighbours and, in turn, as a framework for a concerted and mutually supportive development of the Mediterranean countries."
"As the process celebrates its tenth birthday, its implementation needs to be adjusted and enhanced, to help the partnership to face current challenges and to adapt to a modified regional and international environment."
"By combining bilateral and regional levels of economic and social dialogue, as well as opportunities for interaction, the Barcelona Process helps to strengthen ties and to build confidence between peoples."
"I feel that the most pertinent point is the proposed setting up of a Euro-Mediterranean Free-trade area, which is scheduled for 2010 and which will cover some 40 countries and around 700 million consumers."
"There is no doubt in my mind that a relationship based on an enlarged free trade area will be a more effective one. Furthermore, the boost that the southern countries’ economies will receive might contribute towards the region’s development and, in so doing, help, for example, to prevent the kind of migratory tensions that we have seen recently."
"I voted in favour of the Jäätteenmäki report."
"We believe that the EU has an important role within its immediate surroundings in promoting democracy and human rights."
"Both resolutions are concerned, however, with countries and areas that cannot be regarded as being in the EU’s immediate vicinity."
"Clearly, the aim is to promote the EU’s role in the sphere of foreign and security policy."
"Other organisations – for example, the UN, the OSCE and the Council of Europe – are suited to these purposes."
"The latter two organisations should be given priority when it comes to election monitoring and the protection of human rights within Europe."
"In the light of the above, we choose to abstain in the final vote on the two resolutions."
"We have, however, chosen to support a number of proposals not, in our view, related to the EU’s foreign and security policy."
"These include the proposals to set up a free trade area between the EU and the Mediterranean region by 2010 and to develop cooperation with a view to civil and environmental protection."
"Although this report refers to the work of the previous Ombudsman during the mandate that has come to a close, we welcome the way in which he carried out his work. He sought to bring the citizens’ complaints to the attention of the institutions, and in some cases, managed to resolve those complaints."
"He also tabled proposals aimed at ensuring that the European institutions in question respond more promptly, which if accepted may enhance the Ombudsman’s ability to take action and resolve the citizens’ problems."
"Furthermore, we agreed with the rapporteur that there needs to be greater cooperation between the European Ombudsman and Parliament’s Committee on Petitions, and that efforts should be made to give greater prominence to people’s rights."
"Hence our vote in favour."
". I welcome this report which rightly praises the ombudsman during 2004."
"The Ombudsman has show diligence and forcefulness in dealing with complaints from the EU citizens regarding the activities of the EU institutions."
"He is proving to be a true champion of citizens rights to fair and open treatment by the Institutions."
". Europe is facing a crisis of dialogue with its citizens."
"The European Ombudsman continues to receive complaints that do not fall under his mandate."
"It therefore strikes me as vitally important that dialogue be re-established with the citizens, whereby the powers of the institutions are explained clearly and simply."
"The European Ombudsman has taken initiatives in this respect and must continue to do so."
"Moreover, by proposing to step up cooperation with his national or regional counterparts and measures to promote the highest standards of European public administration, the current Ombudsman has shown us that he is well aware of his role."
"Lastly, I wish to point out that it is crucial to maintain the impartiality of this influential body, which acts as a conciliator between the European public administration and the citizens and offers extrajudicial remedies."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Mavrommattis report."
". – The institution of the European Ombudsman was decided at the Maastricht summit and has been applied for 10 years."
"Its purpose is to investigate complaints of maladministration by the institutions of the ΕU and by the governments of the Member States."
"It is clear that this institution serves the need to embellish the EU in the eyes of the citizens, to shift reactions to the anti-grass roots policy towards harmless channels; in other words towards whether the privatisation of everything, the abolition of workers' wage and social rights, the policing and repression of trade union and political action and so on are being well or badly administered."
"Good administration and anti-grass roots/anti-democratic policy are irreconcilable."
"We do not underestimate the suffering of the workers from cases of maladministration or the value of facilitating their relations with the 'Brussels bureaucracy' or the governments of the Member States."
"However, the institution has very little to do with the broad grass-roots classes, was not created to resolve their problems and is used to buffer dissatisfaction with the anti-grass roots policy itself and with the administrative means used to impose it."
"In order to pave the way for resolving the worsening problems of the workers, the fight by the working, grass-roots movement against the anti-grass roots policy of the EU needs to be stepped up overall."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on human rights in Western Sahara(1)."
"Mr President, although I think the process of bringing the resolution on human rights in the Western Sahara into being was such a difficult one that everyone involved in it must be rather exhaustedI am glad that this House has resisted Moroccan pressure, and that the plenary has, today, resolved almost unanimously that this item should remain on the order of business rather than being deleted from it, which is what the Conference of Presidents decided yesterday."
"That was very important in terms of our self-confidence and of the image of a self-confident parliament that we present to the world."
"One thing that is important about this resolution is that it calls for the release of the Saharan political detainees, the most prominent among them being Aminatou Haidar, who, having been seriously injured, was taken prisoner on 17 June in El Ayoun and thrown into the so-called ‘black prison’ there."
"Parliament has taken an initiative on her behalf before, for in July 178 MEPs signed up to demand for her release."
"What is so very good about this text, though, is that it highlights the real problem, which is that international law still does not apply in the Western Sahara and that no political solution has been found to this conflict."
"I am very glad that we are at least attempting to include reference to raw materials in this resolution, for we know that one reason for the conflict in the Western Sahara is the region’s wealth of raw materials and fish."
"Parliament also has the task of spelling out in clear terms the reasons for this conflict if it wants to help improve the situation."
". I would like to begin by expressing my regret at the incomprehensible attempt we have just seen to prevent this House from giving its opinion on such an important issue as this one of human rights in the Western Sahara."
"If that initiative had successfully prevented us from issuing this opinion, it would have set a very worrying precedent for future urgent debates and resolutions on other issues relating to human rights."
"I am therefore glad that common sense has finally prevailed and I am pleased that today we are not just debating, but also approving, I hope, an important resolution."
"A resolution which, furthermore, is urgent, for some of the reasons already mentioned by Mrs Scheele and on which I would like to insist, because I believe that we must also take this opportunity to call upon the Moroccans to play a significant role in resolving this conflict."
"At the moment, several people are in Moroccan prisons in entirely unacceptable conditions, an aspect that has been identified, criticised and condemned in reports by Amnesty International and the World Organisation against Torture."
"Furthermore, in August many political prisoners were released, hundreds of Moroccan prisoners of war, by the Polisario Front."
"That was the right time for Morocco to demonstrate its good will with regard to the management of this conflict, by making a positive gesture, releasing prisoners and providing information on the treatment they are receiving in Moroccan prisons."
"That has not been done."
"This House — the European Parliament — therefore had to issue its opinion, this resolution is important and it is urgent that we speak loud and clear for the sake of improving European Union-Moroccan relations and in order to be able to resolve — I insist — not only the specific problem of the people being held, but also the conflict in the Western Sahara once and for all."
". Mr President, I am pleased and relieved to have an opportunity to speak in favour of the joint resolution."
"I want to make quite clear my absolute rejection of attempts by the President of Parliament and the Conference of Presidents to set aside this motion on the human rights situation in Western Sahara until after the visit and conclusion of some future EU delegation."
"The decision was made to move ahead with this urgency on the Western Sahara through the normal and proper channels."
"Different Group motions were debated and a compromise common text was agreed and a decision taken by plenary."
"Last-minute efforts to shelve the motion, without consultation, threatened to set a dangerous precedent that, in my view, would have significantly damaged the credibility both of the urgency procedure and perhaps, more importantly, Parliament’s work on human rights issues generally."
"On human rights questions, the politics of the issue should be secondary to the need to outline concerns and criticisms – if they are warranted – based on credible facts."
"The politics of the Western Sahara issue is complex and I want to focus my remarks primarily on human rights, although, obviously, there is a crossover between the two."
"This motion welcomes and recognises the freeing of Moroccan prisoners of war but demands that the Moroccan authorities release human rights defenders."
"It also calls for the release of Sahrawi political prisoners and assistance from the authorities in solving the question of the disappeared."
"We are calling on both sides to cooperate fully with the International Red Cross on the question of the disappeared and missing since the conflict began."
"The motion insists on the protection of the population of Western Sahara generally and in a manner consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, specifically in the area of freedom of expression and freedom of movement and calls for any final political resolution to be consistent with international law and the relevant UN Security Council resolution."
"Finally, the motion demands open access to all territories in Western Sahara for independent observers, NGOs and the free media."
"I am glad to support the motion and commend it to the House."
". Mr President, firstly I should like to add my voice to that of the previous speakers and say how wonderful it has been to see that the attempts made by some to stop Parliament from passing a joint resolution today on Western Sahara have been unsuccessful."
"Let this be a precedent and a warning for the future: hypocrisy and false, pretentious tactics should never stand in the way of our will and determination to express condemnation for human rights abuses anywhere in the world."
"Refugees are protected by various UN resolutions, UN protocols and UN conventions."
"In some cases this protection is effective, and in many cases it is lifesaving."
"In others, unfortunately, the situation is not as it should be and innocent civilians suffer hunger, ill treatment, disease and even death."
"Such is the case currently for a large number of refugees in Western Sahara."
"It is reported reliably that hundreds of people have been subjected to inhumane treatment by the Moroccan authorities in the regions of the so-called Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, where many migrants have been shot dead while attempting to enter Spanish territory."
"Now, why there is Spanish territory in Morocco is another story."
"There is a similar reason, I suppose, as to why there is British soil in Cyprus, or why there is – or has been until recently – French soil in faraway oceanic lands."
"Perhaps modern colonisation is not entirely finished, but then, who wants to talk about such sensitive matters?"
"After all, some of the old colonising powers – of which we are all constantly reminded in this House – are splendid examples of fighters for the principles of democracy, freedom and respect for human rights."
"That is fair enough."
"Coming back to the subject-matter of this resolution and in conclusion, this joint resolution makes it absolutely clear to the Moroccan Government, and to all other interested parties, that we expect nothing less than their doing their utmost fully to safeguard the rights of refugees in Western Sahara."
". – I should first like to express my delight that attempts to scupper the resolution on Western Sahara have failed."
"In our view, this debate should be concluded with a show of solidarity with the Sahrawi people’s just fight for self-determination, in line with United Nations resolutions."
"As the motion for a resolution states, a just and lasting solution must involve putting an end to colonial rule, of which Western Sahara is a victim, and creating a sovereign, independent and viable Sahrawi state."
"In spite of the strenuous efforts, unilateral concessions and goodwill gestures made by the Polisario Front, the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people’s interests, such as the recent release of all prisoners of war, the process remains hampered by the intransigent attitude of the Moroccan Government – albeit the least of its crimes – which refuses to grant fundamental rights to the Sahrawi people."
"Urgent, effective measures must therefore be taken with the clear aim of completing the process of decolonising Western Sahara. There must also be initiatives to condemn the repression of the Sahrawi people in the occupied territories and to demand the release of Sahrawi patriots held by the Moroccan authorities."
"Furthermore, the Sahrawi people must be provided with decent living conditions; all those in refugee camps require substantial aid in the form of food, healthcare and education."
"Mr President, I too am glad that we are having this debate today; let it be an unmistakeable shot across the bows of the President and of the Conference of Presidents, for without it, a dangerous precedent would have been set."
"On Thursday, the Conference of Presidents was giving it as its opinion that the Western Sahara was one of the three most pressing human rights problems with which we had to deal, and there was no dissent from this view even on Monday."
"Then an ambassador did the rounds of this place, and, shortly afterwards, it turned out that a delegation was on its way."
"That would have created a precedent."
"The next thing might then have been that a human rights issue could have been arbitrarily wiped off the order of business because of a dinner with Mr Putin, and the time after that it would have been because of lunch with the Chinese Consul-General or some such reason, and it would have kept on like that."
"That is something that no group here in this House can tolerate."
"Let me move on to the matter in hand. I am very much a friend of Morocco, and I do indeed believe that both sides share responsibility for this conflict."
"Both Morocco and the Western Sahara were victims of colonialism, the colonial powers having simply drawn their borders in the desert with a ruler, and that is why the issue is a problematic one, one that can be resolved only through negotiation and mutual agreement."
"It is in the interests of both sides that our delegation should be able to do its work there without let or hindrance; that is indeed a minimum and something that should go without saying."
"It is monstrous that the threat should be made that it might not be allowed to do so."
"While we respect both sides, and want to do our bit in establishing peace, it must be clear beyond doubt that peace is possible only on the basis of law, which, in this case, means international law, with particular reference to human rights."
"There can be no peace negotiations without unconditional adherence to human rights or without all political prisoners being released."
"That is why we stand ready as a partner and as an intermediary; that is why our good offices are at the parties’ disposal."
"We will not take one side or another – the European People’s Party will certainly do no such thing – but we are not mincing words when we express our view that human rights are human rights, that political detainees are political detainees, and that, if there is any real desire for a solution to this knotty problem, these latter must be set at liberty with neither ifs nor buts."
". Mr President, I would like to bring together some of the opinions that have been expressed, which include those of some of my good friends with whom I share many things: values, ideas and objectives."
"My long political experience, particularly in foreign policy, has taught me that it is not always those who shout the loudest or pass the most forceful resolutions who achieve the best results."
"When a position is adopted, many factors must be taken into account."
"We are discussing a procedural issue, but nobody has pointed out that what the outside world is going to see is the hypocrisy of a parliamentary vote: 600 Members say that there must be a debate ― and that is how I voted, and here I am ― but then we are only 20 in the debate, and at the vote there will be 70."
"Is that really good enough, or is it only we who believe in the importance of these debates on Thursday afternoons?"
"We must be a little more realistic and take account of these factors."
"I agree with the joint Resolution and with the objective of supporting the demands of the Saharawi people and, above all, their demand for self-determination ― which they have still not achieved after thirty years ― but also that this issue must always be balanced with the problem of security and stability that we are facing on the southern border of the European Union, and that we must take account of the Morocco factor, a country of 30 million people, where there is a latent danger of Islamic regression."
"Through our action, or through our inaction, we must contribute to political reform and a democratic process in that country."
". Mr President, I would wholeheartedly endorse the previous comments of my group colleague, Mr Romeva i Rueda, and add my own disbelief that the situation in the Western Sahara remains as bad as it so clearly does after all these years of European hand-wringing and alleged involvement."
"The situation today remains as grave as it has been for many years."
"The unseemly, shabby debate in the Conference of Presidents yesterday demonstrated Europe at its very worst."
"When we Europeans concern ourselves with tactics, internal politics, the considerations of our own domestic situations, we are weak and divided."
"If we remember our core principles of the promotion of democracy, human rights, freedom from torture and above all of dialogue, then we will speak with a loud and clear voice."
"This motion goes some way towards that."
"We must take a view on the motion before us today, otherwise, what is this Parliament for?"
"The motion is worthy and valid and I hope the delegation of our Parliament will speak with a suitably clear voice on this matter when it visits the region."
". – In Africa today, there are no colonies, nor any remnants thereof; this, at least, is the theory often put forward in Parliament by certain conservative Members of the House."
"The reality is of course entirely different."
"The two enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla remain under colonial rule, and Western Sahara, the former Spanish colony of Rio de Oro, has now been occupied by Morocco for some 20 years."
"In the resolution before us, Parliament lends its backing to the referendum on the future of the country, which has been on the table for some considerable time."
"Let us not forget, ladies and gentlemen, that it will be necessary not only to support the actual holding of the referendum itself, but also to determine technical details, such as who is eligible to vote."
"I welcome the decision, announced today, to arrange for a Parliament delegation to visit the country next January."
"I feel that those Members taking part should not lose sight of the fact that this is a desert land, which is rich in phosphate deposits, and should broach every aspect of the problem with representatives of the Polisario Front, the Moroccan Government, and the two other countries sharing its borders, especially Algeria."
"This is the only way in which we can ensure an even-handed view of the whole situation."
"It would also be useful to take on board the opinions of the African Union."
"It is important to lay down the rules for taking part in the referendum."
"There is a large community of immigrants from Morocco living in the country, for example, whilst a number of people from the former Spanish colony remain outside the territory."
"Therein lies a series of further, as yet unanswered, questions, and I believe that meeting the requirements laid down in the resolution may pave the way for those questions to be addressed and, in turn, for a solution to the issue of decolonising Western Sahara to be found."
"Mr President, 1975 to 1991 was a period of bloody conflict in Western Sahara between Morocco and Polisario, ending with a UN-brokered ceasefire, which called for a referendum for independence, yet to happen I have to say, monitored by MINURSO."
"Seventy-six countries now recognise the Sahrawi Democratic Republic."
"In 2001 James Baker proposed a five-year period of autonomy within Morocco before holding the referendum, but Polisario rejected it, particularly on the issue of who would be allowed to vote."
"So, legally, the 1991 UN Settlement Plan remains in place."
"In the meantime Morocco has continued its repression, including the recent alarming allegations of arbitrary arrests, ill treatment of prisoners in custody and even allegations of torture."
"Algeria has now come into a large windfall profit from the high oil revenues it is enjoying and is therefore in a position to rearm Polisario."
"That is extremely dangerous, because there could be a resurgence of hostilities."
"We must avoid hostilities and stop war breaking out again at all costs."
"Mr President, a few months ago, in this very Chamber, we debated the need to assist the Saharawi people by means of humanitarian aid."
"We took that opportunity to point out that this situation is the result of a political conflict which we have so far been unable to resolve."
"We are talking today about a serious and worrying situation, relating to the violation of the human rights of the Saharawi people: their rights to free expression, to demonstrate and to freedom of movement, of which we have become aware over recent months both via human rights organisations and via the media."
"We in this Parliament are therefore today appealing strongly to the Moroccan authorities to release the Saharawi political prisoners."
"Furthermore, we believe the visit of this delegation from the European Parliament to be vital, in order to acquire first hand accurate information about the current situation in Saharan territory."
"There is no question that this conflict requires decisive intervention, both by international bodies and by the European Union, in order to put an end to three decades of injustice and suffering."
"The appointment by the United Nations of the new representative for MINURSO is a good sign."
"It is now time to make it possible to establish the conditions to resolve this conflict and to recognise the legitimate aspiration of the Saharawi people to determine their own future."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate must not be just one more debate, and nor must today’s resolution be just one more to add to the many we have passed on this subject."
"For the sake of human rights and social justice, we have the duty to work in this direction."
". Mr President, the Commission continues fully to support the role of the United Nations and its efforts to bring a political solution to the conflict in Western Sahara."
"We share the hope that the new personal envoy to the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr Peter Van Walsum, as well as the new Special Representative, Mr Francesco Bastagli, will bring new impetus to the search for a political solution."
"The Commission encourages all the parties involved and the international community fully to cooperate with them towards this objective."
"The Commission also welcomes the release of 404 Moroccan prisoners of war by the Polisario Front."
"This is a very positive measure that will no doubt contribute to finding a solution."
"Regarding recent tensions in Western Sahara, the Commission followed last month’s demonstrations, arrests, trials and hunger strikes very closely, and continues to monitor the situation."
"The Commission, through its delegation in Rabat, and in cooperation with the Member States, has undertaken high-level demarches to the Moroccan authorities and other parties involved, expressing concern and requiring direct information about the situation and the measures to be taken."
"Moreover, the Commission continues to work resolutely on human rights, since respect for human rights is an essential principle of the European Union’s external relations."
"In the context of our bilateral relationship with Morocco, a sub-committee on human rights, democratisation and good governance is being set up."
"The date of its first meeting will probably be fixed at the Association Council with Morocco in November."
"This sub-committee will allow the Commission to approach the human rights issue as a whole, including freedom of expression and assembly."
"These issues – human rights, democratisation, political and institutional reform – are also considered in the action plan agreed between the Commission and Morocco within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 4 p.m."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on human rights in Uzbekistan(1)."
"Mr President, Uzbekistan is home to over 20 million people, and was the birthplace of the legendary Tamerlane."
"It lies on the Silk Road, and, ever mindful of its historical heritage, plays a key geostrategic role at the point where Europe meets the Middle East and Asia."
"The Uzbek people and the country’s rich culture mean that it is destined to play a key part in establishing an international political order based on peace, democracy and respect for human rights."
"Islam Karimov’s authoritarian regime is stifling the democratic ambitions of the Uzbek people."
"It violates fundamental human rights, and was responsible for the Andijan massacre."
"Last Saturday, 22 October 2005, an opposition leader, the businessman Sanjar Umarov, was taken into custody."
"There have been alarming reports from his lawyer, Vitaly Krasilovsky, about the humiliating treatment of Mr Umarov during his stay in custody."
"Mr Krasilovsky is concerned about the well-being of his client, since he was only allowed to visit him in prison for a few minutes, and Mr Umarov was incapable of providing coherent answers to his questions during this time."
"This is one of many violations of human rights by the Karimov regime."
"The European Union cannot remain unmoved by the situation in Uzbekistan."
"Our actions must be geared towards Uzbek civil society, and they must serve to establish good relations with the Uzbek people, as well as helping those who have suffered political persecution under the authoritarian regime."
"A visit by Parliament representatives to Uzbekistan remains a matter of fundamental importance."
"The Uzbek authorities must agree to our visit to Andijan, and to meetings with representatives of the media, the opposition and NGOs."
"If I may, I should like to express my hope that the good relations between the European Union and Uzbekistan will continue to flourish further, since these relations will boost the development and prosperity of the Uzbek people."
"They will also promote the advancement of democracy and human rights in Uzbekistan and in Central Asia as a whole."
"Mr President, the Council made a good decision on 3 October in favour of an arms embargo."
"Uzbekistan does not need any weapons, which may be used to oppress its own population."
"It is good that we are now demanding that an independent investigation be carried out into what happened in Andijan."
"The media are tightly controlled, and the opposition and members of popular movements are prevented from meeting."
"The demands we are making of President Karimov should not be so difficult to fulfil."
"He needs only to comply with his own country’s constitution, which states that freedom of movement, association and assembly must prevail and that the courts must be independent."
"It is not unreasonable to demand that a president comply with his own country’s constitution, and that is what we are demanding in this Chamber today."
"Mr President, I apologise. I should, of course, have acknowledged the presence of the Commissioner the last time I spoke, but I will this time."
"I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak briefly on the motion on Uzbekistan."
"Uzbekistan is a large and very influential country in Central Asia."
"Its stability directly impinges on the whole region and the EU has rightly attempted to build contacts and a relationship with this geographically close and significant neighbour."
"For me, however, this motion has one main focus: to ask again what happened in Andijan last May and to make a further call for an open and independent inquiry."
"There seems to be a view that, by asking for the truth to be established, we are in some way taking sides against the Uzbek authorities."
"The EU has human rights and international law at the centre of its value system and it is our responsibility to call for the truth behind this tragedy."
"To date, there are three versions of the ‘truth’."
"Firstly, the official Uzbek and the President Karimov version, according to which the killings were ‘a measured response to an Islamist uprising where 187 criminals were killed’."
"Next, there is the media and NGO version, which reports a bloodbath where women and children were mowed down by armed police, bodies were dragged to a school nearby and left lying there until the following day, some of them not dead, and then taken to hospital."
"We do not even know the numbers that were killed."
"Reports vary between 500 and 1500 people."
"Thirdly, there are the locals in Andijan, most of them silenced or suffering from amnesia, basically afraid to speak out because some who have done so have disappeared."
"The EU must insist on an independent inquiry and we must take action that will ensure that, if we are refused that, it will have implications for the relationship between Uzbekistan and the European Union."
". The President of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov is openly and blatantly ignoring the international community's desire to reveal the whole truth about what happened in Andizhan in May this year."
"He is creating his own version of the truth."
"President Karimov is creating this truth by openly violating human rights, erasing traces of killings and neutralising witnesses and their relatives."
"It seems that there can only be one truth in Uzbekistan the one thoroughly censored by the authorities."
"Terrorism and economic crime these are the two vague labels which are used to conceal the open and violent treatment of so-called enemies of the state."
"Nevertheless, I believe that there must be a distinct line between ensuring security and repression."
"Since it was banned, the opposition has taken on a radical form."
"Social injustice and the repression of diversity of opinion encourage religious extremism."
"It can be acknowledged that Uzbekistan is an appealing target for Islamic extremists; however, such actions by the authorities do not stop Islamic radicalism, as only democracy and an independent judiciary can help to fight radicalism, not repression."
"Mr President, Members of Parliament, I urge you to vote for the resolution today, as I believe it is a further investment in trying to encourage diversity of opinion among the citizens of Uzbekistan, together with free speech and human rights."
"This is the true road to democracy."
". Mr President, it was not only in Ukraine, Georgia or Kyrgyzstan that authoritarian regimes took power following the collapse of the Soviet Union, but this was also, and especially, the case in Belarus, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan."
"There, it was not democracy that triumphed, but rather a group of people who had gained experience in the old state apparatus and the intelligence services."
"Having no objective other than to stay in power, these people turn state enterprises into their own private property, manipulate the electoral results, give oppositions as little room as possible, hamper free organisations, restrict the press and, if need be, use violence against their own people."
"Uzbekistan is ready for radical change, but the initial impetus in this direction by demonstrators was nipped in the bud on 13 May, with brute force that claimed hundreds of lives."
"Ever since, the outside world has remained conspicuously silent."
"Might that have something to do with its economic and military interests?"
"Is the dictatorship in Uzbekistan to be allowed to stay on because it proved itself useful in the military intervention in Afghanistan?"
"Are we leaving its inhabitants in the lurch?"
"Europe must not make their rights and freedoms secondary to other considerations."
"The draft resolution helps us to adopt the necessary position."
". Mr President, it is an unfortunate fact that the historic breakthrough which in Poland led to the formation of a democratic government in 1989, and which subsequently brought about the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of the entire Moscow-led Communist bloc, did not lead to the emergence of a democratic regime respectful of human rights in all the former Communist bloc countries."
"The transformations we witnessed in Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary, during which systems based on respect for human rights were established, did not initially take place in Ukraine."
"We are still awaiting such transformations in Belarus, and unfortunately there is no sign of them in Uzbekistan either."
"The events of 13 May 2005 were a measure of sorts of the current conditions in Uzbekistan."
"The attitude of the government, which refuses to allow foreign observers to investigate the causes of the many deaths, as well as intimidating journalists and preventing external monitoring, means that Parliament must take a firm stance on this issue."
"It is for this reason that we are calling for investigations to be carried out into all these issues, and for democracy to be established in Uzbekistan."
". Mr President, Uzbekistan is an ancient cultural landscape which, having brought forth such states as the Khanates of Bukhara and Kokand, fell victim to aggressive colonialism."
"Today, we have been discussing European colonialism in Africa, but in this instance the colonialism was Soviet and Communist in character, following on the heels of Tsarist colonialism in Central Asia."
"It was only in 1989, with the overthrow of the Communist regime in Central Europe, that this colonialism was brought to an end – something I would like to say for Mr Kohlíček’s benefit."
"We are under the obligation to consider the situation there in a realistic light."
"These countries were punished by being turned into monocultures, they were plundered and bled dry, and now they have set out on the laborious road to statehood."
"One has to have a certain sympathy for their situation, and they also need all the intensive help we can offer."
"That does not mean, however, that we can turn a blind eye to human rights abuses."
"What we call for is clear and unambiguous: we demand that the Uzbek Government should cease from obstructing the investigations that are already overdue, that it should release all detainees and grant fundamental and human rights."
"If we are to make any headway here, though, it will be by dialogue and not by treating the other party as a child."
"We have to be aware of the presence of terrorists and destabilising elements throughout the region, not to mention the continuing influence of Moscow, which has recently been supplying Uzbekistan with large quantities of plate mines, which we have often had cause to discuss in this House, and which are intended, among other things, for the further fortification of the borders."
"Russian troops are still present, acting as if this were still colonial territory."
"That is something else that we cannot accept just like that, since this is a region in which the powers’ vital geo-strategic interests collide, not least in the energy sector."
"So let it be said loud and clear that, in this area, there are two opposites: human rights and open and fair partnership on the one hand, and colonialism in whatever shape or form on the other."
". Mr President, today’s resolution condemns the Uzbek Government’s denial of any transparency in connection with the investigation into the events of May 2005, and it stresses how important it is that there should be an independent international commission of inquiry, one that is in a position to bring the details to light without delay and to observe ongoing processes without interference."
"Precisely how many people lost their lives on those May days in Andijan is something that the global public has until now been unable to find out."
"Human rights organisations’ figures vary between 500 and 1 000, while the Uzbek Government gives the number of victims as 176."
"Over and over again, President Karimov uses Islamism as a blunt instrument with which to put his political opponents – of whatever stripe – out of action."
"That is why it is vital that we should press home our demands for the setting at liberty of those human rights activists, journalists and members of the political opposition who are still in prison."
". Mr President, anyone who has observed the brutal violations of human rights in Uzbekistan would expect trenchant criticism of the regime in Uzbekistan, rather than these to be played down, as we have just heard Mr Posselt do."
"Instead, Uzbekistan is enjoying the closest possible cooperation from an EU Member State."
"That Member State is Germany, which, in Termes, is operating a military base of crucial geopolitical importance, particularly in terms of military operations in Afghanistan."
"I am told by NATO that it is not one of their bases, even though it is used by NATO states, and also by the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the United Kingdom, France, Greece and Spain – all of them EU Member States."
"Germany is granting Uzbekistan extensive economic and military aid, said to amount to EUR 2 billion, along with weapons factories, old weapons and so on."
"The EU’s human rights policy is hypocritical if, on the one hand, the brutal human rights violations come in for justified criticism, while, on the other, geopolitical considerations mean that the regime in Uzbekistan receives military and economic aid."
". Mr President, in the run-up to the parliamentary elections in Uzbekistan, which have been called for December, the European Parliament is once again holding a debate on human rights violations."
"Uzbekistan is a former Soviet republic, yet although it has achieved partial independence from the Communist regime, power continues to be exercised in the same way."
"Islam Karimov, the former Communist First Secretary who holds the position of president, has proved himself to be a dictator."
"He is attempting to placate the rival powers of Russia, Europe and the United States, with the latter having used military bases in the country until recently."
"Uzbekistan is a region of strategic political and economic importance for both Russia and the United States, which makes the situation in the republic even more complex."
"Since 2001, the country has been one of the USA’s key allies in the fight against terrorism in Asia."
"Together with Russia, Uzbekistan is also a member of the Shanghai Five, a forum aimed at combating terrorism in Asia."
"Moscow uses the threat of Islamic fundamentalism as a means of scaring Uzbekistan into remaining within its sphere of influence."
"Uzbekistan is a country with abundant natural resources, including oil and gas."
"Mainly due to US aid, it has chalked up a certain amount of economic success."
"It is also a country where ethnically diverse populations of Islamic, Orthodox and Catholic faith previously lived together peacefully."
"In recent times, however, as a result of clashes between foreign pressures and Karimov’s authoritarian practices, the country has been witness to human rights violations and persecution of the opposition, in particular the Islamic opposition."
"On 13 May, a demonstration in Andijan was violently suppressed, and it is thought that several hundred civilians may have died."
"In spite of protests, the perpetrators of the massacre have not been brought to justice, and the press has passed over the tragedy in silence."
"Reports from foreign observers, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch talk of unprecedented and barbaric torture perpetrated in Uzbek prisons against the regime’s opponents, of human rights violations and of the persecution of the independent journalists and political activists who uncovered the truth about the events of 13 May."
"Following a number of unsuccessful attempts on his life, President Karimov now refers to Muslim critics as fanatics and terrorists, in so doing justifying the persecution of independent political thinkers in the opposition."
"The Holy Father, John Paul II, reminded us that freedom is always a challenge."
"He also said that power is a challenge to freedom, and that it can only be wielded by serving others."
"The international community and those in positions of power should always give human dignity and human rights precedence over economic interests."
"It is for this reason that we are calling for an end to persecution, respect for human dignity and compliance with the basic obligations arising from the Charter of Fundamental Rights and democratic principles."
". Mr President, following the Andijan massacre and Uzbekistan's persistent rejection of an independent international inquiry into these events, the European Union has taken a very firm stance vis-à-vis Uzbekistan through the adoption of the Council conclusions of 3 October, following the earlier conclusions adopted since May."
"The package of restrictive measures includes the partial suspension of the partnership and cooperation agreement, an arms embargo, a selective visa ban as well as consideration of actions in the framework of the United Nations and the OSCE."
"That is a very clear and strong political signal by the Union to Uzbekistan."
"The Commission fully supports the Member States on the imposition of the visa ban, the arrangements for the implementation of which are currently being finalised."
"The Commission equally fully supports the implementation of the arms embargo and has prepared the legislation for the Council to be effective immediately."
"In terms of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), the Commission has immediately suspended all further technical meetings with Uzbekistan."
"That means that we have suspended the Subcommittees on Trade and Investment and on Justice, Liberty and Security, along with the Cooperation Committee."
"Although the initiative for the Cooperation Council meeting rests with the Member States, the Commission takes the view that the meeting could be maintained in order not to sever our political dialogue with Uzbekistan altogether."
"The Commission takes note of the decision to postpone the Sixth EU-Uzbekistan Parliamentary Cooperation Committee meeting and regrets that the delegation would not be allowed to travel to the Andijan region nor to have unrestricted access to members of the opposition, non-governmental organisations and the independent media."
"With reference to Community assistance, the Commission has agreed to a reduction and reorientation of EU assistance from EUR 11 million to EUR 9.25 million in this year, and from EUR 9 million to EUR 7.25 million next year."
"In spite of those cuts, we strongly believe that targeted EU assistance should continue."
"It should focus on poverty reduction in the Ferghana valley and the development of a civil society, as well as on legal and judicial reforms and on the development of higher education."
"I should like to take this opportunity to stress that the human rights situation which existed before the events in May was already very bleak and a source of deep concern to the Commission."
"To name but one of our concerns, the Commission would very much welcome a public commitment in support of President Karimov's condemnation of torture."
"In addition, the Commission will continue to press the Uzbeks to establish an immediate moratorium on all death sentences before the abolition of the death penalty in 2008."
"The Commission is also concerned about reports of the detention and harassment of people including human rights defenders, journalists and local activists who have questioned the authorities' version of events."
"The Commission will continue its efforts in the fight against drug trafficking, improving border management, energy networks and transport networks."
"The exclusion of Uzbekistan from such regional programmes would damage Uzbekistan's neighbours more than Uzbekistan itself."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 4 p.m."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche(1)."
". Mr President, one of the last great Tibetan lamas, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, has spent the past 20 years engaged in efforts to protect Tibetan culture."
"As a leading religious figure in Tibet, he has also played an active role in economic, cultural and social affairs."
"This Tibetan lama has long been a thorn in the side of the Chinese authorities, even though he has never taken part in political demonstrations."
"As a spiritual leader who is wholeheartedly committed to key social measures such as the construction of schools for orphaned children, hospices, local roads and help for older people, he is a leading advocate of peace, whose actions are not in the least aggressive."
"His popularity led to him being labelled a threat to the local Chinese authorities, however, and the latter arrested him on the pretext that he had allegedly helped to organise a number of attacks."
"He was accused of terrorism and sentenced to death, without any evidence or a fair trial."
"He has been held in inhumane conditions for many months awaiting execution, and his current poor health is a direct result of prolonged torture."
"In view of the above, we are calling on the Chinese authorities to improve the conditions in which he is held."
"We are also calling on the Chinese government to undertake efforts to improve the conditions in which other prisoners are held, to abolish torture and, most importantly, to abolish the death penalty."
"As part of the international community we must make it quite clear that we will not consent to people being imprisoned if they have not been proven guilty."
"China must respect international human rights standards, human dignity and civil liberties."
"I would therefore also call on international organisations to bring pressure to bear on China to engage at long last in constructive dialogue with a view to settling the Tibet issue once and for all."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time that we have had to discuss the terrible case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche and take note of China’s unwillingness to go down the road of reconciliation."
"Far from it: no more than before is he guaranteed a transparent and fair trial, and what is even worse is that torture and the inhumane conditions under which he is incarcerated – without, let it be noted, due process of law – have now brought him to the point where his life is in danger, and this is something about which we absolutely must speak out, and not for the first time."
"We in this House owe it to ourselves to take action now, for we have already demanded fair treatment for this man who is almost at the point of death, and whose only crime was to be a beloved teacher and spiritual guide."
"Now is the time for us to take action and press anew our demands on the Chinese Government."
"What makes this all the more necessary is that it would appear that, the greater the appetite the Member States and their governments have for the Chinese market, the more cautious they are about raising human rights issues with their Chinese partners in dialogue."
"At a time like this and in a context such as this, we owe it to ourselves to defend our values."
"It is we Members of this House who must do what our governments are failing to do."
"In a situation in which Tibet is autonomous only on paper and not in reality, in which the dialogue with the Dalai Lama, having begun so promisingly, is either not continued or deferred again and again, and in which China still does not guarantee human rights, we must speak up and speak out, demanding that this state of affairs be brought to an end and that order be restored."
"Mr President, the resolutions we adopted on 18 November 2004 and 13 January 2005, combined with massive diplomatic protests and the actions of human rights organisations did have some results, for they did bring about the commutation of the death sentence passed on the respected Lama Tenzin Delek Rinpoche to one of life imprisonment."
"The Chinese authorities regard him as a criminal, accusing him of undermining the security of the state, and – without any evidence – of involvement in bomb attacks."
"They continue to refuse him a fair trial with international observers present."
"Where I am in full agreement with both the previous speakers is that the real reason for his imprisonment is his great influence on the Tibetan people and his support for the Dalai Lama."
"The death sentence may well have been annulled, but it appears to be being carried out by other means; having endured torture and solitary confinement, he is now unable either to speak or to move, and his life is hanging in the balance."
"All this House’s political groupings call on the Chinese to delay no longer in improving the conditions under which he is held and to comply strictly with the terms of the UN Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners."
"We insist that Manfred Nowak, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, be given free access to Tenzin Rinpoche; he will be arriving in China on an inspection mission in three weeks’ time."
"The European Commission, the Council and the Member States must establish a close connection between the ongoing fate of China’s political prisoners and the maintenance of the arms embargo imposed on that country."
"The embargo must remain in place, without any relaxation, for as long as human rights abuses continue."
"The Chinese Embassy in Brussels has attempted to intervene, claiming that these are internal matters, and that no external organisations or individuals have the right to interfere."
"These oppressive utterances constitute yet another example of the unsatisfactory outcome of the EU/China Summit of 5 September and of the failure of the human rights dialogue to yield tangible fruit."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to stress the need for international standards and values to be maintained."
"What does send a powerful signal to all those who are persecuted for political, religious or cultural reasons is the European Union’s insistence on cooperation with any country being conditional – without any exception – on its respect for human rights."
"Those who want confrontation to give way to cooperation must uphold human rights and refrain from violating them, for human rights are universal in their application."
". Mr President, it is not our place to say whether Tenzin Delek Rinpoche is innocent or guilty."
"However, it is our place to point out human rights violations when we see them."
"There are real concerns about his detention, trial and sentencing, which were, I believe, miscarriages of justice."
"In a news bulletin of 24 October, the Chinese Government said that it was an internal affair for China and that we had no right to interfere."
"If it is a matter of human rights, we have every right to interfere; that is our job."
"It is unclear whether he had full access to legal advice throughout the trial process."
"The Chinese said that he had two lawyers."
"My sources said that he had no defence counsel whatsoever."
"My sources also said that he did not confess and he has never confessed to this alleged crime, despite the torture he allegedly suffered for several months before his trial."
"When he was tried three years ago, there was international outcry, and at that time I understand that the Chinese Government promised a retrial in the Supreme Court."
"That has not happened."
"He must be given a fair trial in full accordance with international fair trial standards or released forthwith."
"There is no other option."
". Mr President, oppression in Tibet is often on this House’s order of business."
"China sees that country as a virtually blank canvas that has to be colonised and made accessible, after which it can be further developed in the modern Chinese manner."
"At the moment, everything is about discipline and economic growth without any leeway for different opinions."
"This is at odds with the culture, the traditions and the interests of the Tibetans who have learnt to survive in their inhospitable country and want to be left in peace."
"This problem is also reflected within China among other peoples with a different language and culture, such as the Uighurs, who are related to the Turkish peoples in the former Soviet Republics in Central Asia, but, ever since the Dalai Lama’s escape to India, most of the attention has been focused on Tibet."
"We cannot really see any improvements in the way in which China deals with the Tibetans."
"Even though our statements in this House have definitely not had the results that we intended to achieve, it is still right that we should carry on relentlessly."
"China should not be given the impression that Europe has accepted the status quo for the sake of its own economic interests."
"Finally, capital punishment in China has to go, just as it has to go in the USA and the rest of the world."
"We should fight this point globally and fight for human rights."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Tibet is once again the subject of debate in this House."
"During today’s debate, we must ask ourselves whether the measures taken by Parliament and the Commission have been effective."
"Unfortunately, the fact that we are holding yet another debate on this issue would suggest not."
"Certain Members of the House have claimed that such matters come under the heading of China’s internal affairs, and indeed this is the line taken by the Chinese Embassy in Brussels."
"This is not the case, however."
"The concept of internal affairs, which is used to justify all crimes against one’s own nation, is a doctrine espoused only by tyrants, and one that has never been held in civilised Europe."
"In centuries gone by, the Catholic Church and other religions demanded that citizens be treated properly, and they opposed the notion that rulers could do whatever they wanted with their own citizens."
"International organisations nowadays never fail to emphasise the fact that internal affairs that violate basic moral principles concern all of humanity."
"We must be aware that this issue is about more than just one monk."
"It is about nothing less than the destruction of Tibet and the Tibetan culture and nation, for no other reason than that this peaceful nation exists."
"The existence of a nation that differs from their own in cultural, historical and social terms is sufficient reason for the Chinese authorities to attempt to destroy it."
"Instead of welcoming the completion of a railway link between Tibet and China, we should be alarmed by this development, since one of its purposes is to destroy Tibet further by inundating it with Chinese people and entrepreneurs."
"Parliament is very active in this field, and its Intergroup for Tibet has a very committed and energetic president in the shape of Mr Mann."
"We must do more, however."
"I would remind the Commissioner that it is high time that the Commission took decisive steps to settle the problems in China once and for all, since its status as a powerful EU body means that it is undoubtedly in a position to do so."
"Its first step should be to come to the rescue of this poor Tibetan monk."
". Mr President, the human rights situation in Tibet is of constant concern to the European Union and it features very high on the agenda of the EU-China human rights dialogue."
"In that context, the European Union has always addressed the rights of minorities, especially in Tibet, and urges the Chinese authorities to preserve the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people."
"The case of the Tibetan monk Tenzin Delek Rinpoche has regularly been brought to the attention of the Chinese authorities in the course of this dialogue."
"In addition, the EU troika has made three approaches to the Chinese Government, twice last year and in the early part of this year, when the troika met Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan."
"In all those instances, the European Union voiced its urgent demand for the abolition of the death penalty in China, expressed the hope that Tenzin Delek Rinpoche would not be executed, and asked for information about the conditions of his arrest and his state of health."
"Whilst welcoming the decision by the Chinese authorities on 26 January 2005 this year to commute Tenzin Delek Rinpoche’s death sentence to life imprisonment, the European Union remains deeply concerned about the persistent doubts surrounding his trial and the heavy sentence handed down to him."
"The European Union is fully committed to continuing to follow this issue very closely in the framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue."
"On a more general level, as part of its overall policy on Tibet, for many years the European Union has called for and will continue to call for the establishment of a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities as the only realistic way to find a lasting solution to the question of Tibet. The third visit of the Dalai Lama’s special envoys at the end of last year was an encouraging move that should be pursued further."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 4 p.m."
"I am all in favour of free trade, but the question we need to ask ourselves is whether we should trade freely with a country that pays no regard to freedoms of other kinds. I do not believe that cultural diversity is any justification for China’s actions."
"The death penalty is unacceptable in any culture, since it is an insult to the very nature of humanity."
"China is proud of its new railway line to Tibet, which is the highest in the world."
"It is worth pointing out, however, that investments in infrastructure are not the only mark of a great civilisation."
"If China can build railways of this kind, then it could also improve the living conditions of its prisoners."
"All it needs is the political will to do so."
"It is crucially important that the arms embargo against China be maintained, because the fate of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche is ample proof that the country has not learnt its lesson from the events of 4 June 1989."
"This is a significant date for people in both Poland and China."
"It is a symbol of hope for the former, since it was the date of the first partially free parliamentary elections."
"In China, however, this date has become a symbol of repression, since it is the anniversary of the Tiananmen tragedy."
"Back in 1989, I wore a badge bearing the Chinese words for freedom and democracy."
"These two values are what I would wish the Tibetan and Chinese people today."
"Mr President, on at least five occasions during this part-session, the earphones – and thus the interpretation service - for the whole of the row behind me where I normally sit have not worked."
"Nor has the microphone worked, so that it has not been possible to complain about the situation to the President."
"We have shown great flexibility during the votes and continued with these from the row concerned. Next time, however, many important matters are to be dealt with, including REACH, so we need to ensure that the technology works."
"Otherwise, the part-session may be interrupted in the most inopportune way. I hope, therefore, that you can resolve this problem by next month."
"Unfortunately, this is a recurring problem."
"We shall be looking into this carefully and trust that it will not happen in the next part-session."
"The next item is the vote."
"The vote is closed."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 27 October 2005."
"I would like now to make a statement at the opening of this plenary sitting on the attacks in Amman."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 9 November, the terrorists struck again, demonstrating their full horrific capabilities, this time in Jordan."
"On behalf of all of us – on behalf of the European Parliament – I immediately expressed the emotion we felt as a result of this attack to the Jordanian authorities and I asked them to communicate our condolences to the families of the victims."
"We will have the opportunity to debate the phenomenon of terrorism and the most effective way to tackle it at the meetings that we will hold on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona Declaration."
"Terrorism today is a problem that not only affects Europe."
"Terrorist attacks also take place in Casablanca and in Jordan."
"It therefore threatens both flanks of the Mediterranean and they must tackle it in a joint fashion."
"This issue will certainly be on the agenda and will figure in the debates that we will hold in Rabat on 20 and 21 November, at the extraordinary meeting of the APEM, and also in Barcelona, on the 27th and 28th, at the Summit of Heads of State or Government."
"At this point, however, I believe that we must make it very clear that, for us, these barbarous acts demonstrate the extent to which the attacks are not aimed at people with different religions or skin colours; this has nothing to do with the lethal strategy of the terrorists."
"It is urgent that Europe should cooperate in order to make progress with the ‘alliance of civilisations’, that will enable us to avoid the ‘clash of civilisations’."
"For all of these reasons, I would ask you to stand and observe a minute’s silence in memory of the victims of the attacks in Amman."
"The final version of the draft agenda for the present part-session and the November II part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 10 November pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"A slight amendment has been proposed."
"The Council has asked me to reverse the order of the two items scheduled for Wednesday morning."
"The proposal is that we first hold the debate on the situation in Iraq, in the presence of Lord Bach, and then the joint debate on climate change."
"This change to the agenda would allow Mrs Beckett, the Minister responsible for this issue, to be present in the House."
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, I should like to express my concern at the comments recently made by the EU Commissioner for Trade, Peter Mandelson, regarding the negotiations taking place under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation."
"I believe that one of these comments, which he made during a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the EU Member States held in Luxembourg on 18 October 2005, had a particularly ominous ring to it."
"Amongst other things, Commissioner Mandelson said at this meeting that the European Union must make concessions to other countries during the WTO negotiations, since on balance the European Union would gain more from exporting industrial goods than it would lose from reducing protection for agriculture."
"What this may mean is that the Commissioner wishes to sacrifice the interests of EU agriculture during the December summit in Hong Kong, in favour of nebulous gains in other fields."
"I believe that the Commissioner has clearly overstepped his authority with this comment."
"If his ideas were put into practice, around 1.2 million jobs could be lost in the EU in the agricultural and related sectors."
"I would call on the President of the European Parliament to bring these concerns to the attention of Mr Barroso, the President of the European Commission."
"Thank you very much, Mr Kuźmiuk."
"I shall do so the very next time I have the opportunity to speak to him."
"– Mr President, I should like to refer briefly to the recent riots by young people in the French suburbs, a matter which I believe concerns every European country."
"We saw children of 10 to 20 years old turning in blind rage on their fellow citizens and against the material symbols of a society which we believe to be organised and prosperous."
"So is it right for us to dismiss these children as social outcasts and to hand them over to just any sort of repression?"
"Children are the future of our societies and it is only logical to wonder why these young people are being abandoned."
"Basically, this is creating confusion as to what the prospects of Europe should be from now on."
"We all have an obligation to give everyone the chance to live in dignity."
"We should safeguard, especially for children, access to education and employment and to humane living conditions in which our governments do not intervene to punish but to assist development."
"I would like to point out that it is the twenty-year anniversary of the infamous disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on 26 April next year."
"That was a devastating catastrophe for the region and an immeasurable threat for Europe as well as the lives and health of Europeans."
"Tens of thousands of young people in the former Soviet Union participated in rescue operations aimed at eliminating any harmful effects on the environment as soon as possible."
"Among them were citizens of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia."
"Today these are independent states and Member States of the European Union."
"I would like to urge the governments of those three States to pay greater attention to the victims of the Chernobyl accident, many of whom are dying, suffering from disease and facing other numerous problems."
"Speaking of the new neighbourhood policy, I invite you, Mr President, to address the Governments of Ukraine, Russia, Moldova and Belarus, urging them to develop special programmes for the victims of Chernobyl, that is, those people who contributed significantly to ensuring the safety of Europe."
"– On 7 November, a 100-tonne metal structure supporting a concrete structure collapsed, killing six Portuguese workers and one worker from Galicia."
"This workplace accident took place in the South of Spain, during the construction of a flyover of the Mediterranean motorway."
"In Portugal, in my region of Oporto district, this tragedy was felt very deeply. It has left families without their father, husband or son, the man who guaranteed a livelihood for the family at a time of high unemployment in Northern Portugal."
"I should therefore like to ask you, Mr President, to ensure that expressions of sympathy and solidarity with the families are backed by suitable financial support. Furthermore, steps must be taken to improve safety at work, an issue that is as important in Spain as it is in other EU countries, so that tragedies of this nature can be prevented in the future."
"Mr President, I shall speak about the same matter that was addressed just now by our fellow Member, Mr Sifunakis, but I shall do so a slightly different way."
"We obviously do not have the same view on the events taking place in France, but the extraordinary thing is that it is not possible to talk about them in this Parliament."
"If these events were taking place in Latin America, Africa or Asia, resolutions would be drafted in their regard."
"Since these events began, 9 000 fires have been started intentionally: buses and bus depots, schools, crèches, nursery schools, libraries, sports centres, youth clubs, health centres, social centres and even churches are all being set alight."
"Police officers are being attacked, but so too are the fire fighters who risk their lives, bus drivers, underground train drivers, not to mention the two innocent lives that have been lost, respectable French citizens who were lynched in front of their families."
"Meanwhile, the European Parliament is refusing to let us talk about the matter."
"Such a ‘rule of silence’ is unprecedented in an assembly calling itself a Parliamentary Assembly and in which it is possible for points of view, although quite different and quite conflicting, freely to be expressed, as they are expressed on the subject of other countries throughout the world."
"– Mr President, one of the darkest sides in Europe is the question of paedophilia."
"It has spread throughout Europe."
"What goes on via the Internet is disgusting."
"There is a legislative vacuum, in my country at least, and material can circulate freely on the Internet from one person to another."
"A few days ago, twenty people were arrested for trading in hard core paedophilic material – children of two, four, five and six years old, bestiality and such abject things – and not one of them was named."
"They were not allowed to be named on television. We protect them under the banner of individual rights."
"What individual rights can a person have who commits sodomy on a child of three or four or five?"
"When a thief is arrested, all his details are made public immediately."
"A paedophile is arrested and is protected by the principle of the protection of individual rights."
"We cannot turn a blind eye: we experienced it here in Belgium and now we are experiencing it in Greece."
"It is time we protected children from paedophiles."
"Mr President, I wrote to you at the end of last week to inform you of the recent events with regard to human rights violations in Tunisia, but my letter is already out of date: one undoubtedly has to be prepared for anything and everything to happen in that country."
"On the eve of the opening of the World Summit on the Information Society, political activists who supported key social and political figures campaigning for the fundamental right of expression and currently on hunger strike, have been violently beaten."
"Among them was Mokhtar Trifi, the chairman of the Tunisian Human Rights League, with whom you are acquainted and who attended our most recent part-session."
"Last Saturday, a journalist working for the newspaper was stabbed after he had published details of the violations of rights in Tunisia."
"This is therefore a tragic situation, and I believe that, even if our ad hoc delegation is completely up to speed with the situation and is preparing to support both the alternative summit and civil society in Tunisia, we perhaps also ought to make the Council sit up and take note of the situation in Tunisia, by specifically calling for the Council urgently to gather together an Association Council enabling us to assess the agreement that links us to this country which, without a shadow of a doubt, is more and more disappointing each day."
"Mr President, Russia’s announcement of its decision to ban the import of meat and certain meat products from Poland as of 10 November, and to ban the import of plant products as of 14 November, is a source of great concern for Polish farmers and food producers."
"Poland is a leading producer of meat, in particular pork, and it is experiencing major problems in terms of grain surpluses."
"The Russian market is extremely large, and its loss will place many farms at risk of bankruptcy."
"Since Poland joined the European Union, Polish farmers have endured almost nothing but losses."
"It is no longer so profitable for them to grow crops such as cereals, fruits, vegetables, potatoes and industrial crops, and they have been told they will have to reduce the acreage under cultivation and the price of sugar beet."
"Polish farmers have put up with a great deal, but they are no longer in a position to put up with delays or injustice on the part of the EU where the Russian blockade is concerned."
"The fundamental question that must be asked at this point is whether the EU is intended to benefit everyone, or only a chosen few."
"If the former is the case, then I would like to ask what measures will be taken to protect Polish agriculture, which is an integral part of the agricultural market in the EU as a whole."
"Mr President, I should like to thank you for visiting the Scottish Parliament last week."
"Your words were much appreciated."
"However, there is an issue that many of my Scottish constituents are growing increasingly concerned about and that is the situation of the victims of the Pakistan earthquake."
"Already 80 000 people are dead and 3 million people are homeless."
"The WHO is concerned about health and outbreaks of diarrhoea and, with winter approaching, there is the additional concern of how people will keep warm."
"The UN needs USD 550 million to be able to do a decent job and it has just USD 135 million."
"Although the EU has given EUR 93.6 million as an aid package, we need to do more."
"I hope this House will back me in calling for more action to be taken to help the survivors of the Pakistan earthquake to rebuild their lives."
"Time is pressing."
"We need urgent action before more people die due to the onset of winter."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Stihler."
"I have sent two letters to the Pakistani authorities in relation to the issues you have mentioned."
"Mr President, I would like to inform the House, and for that matter the Commission, that the new Ambassador of the United States of America to the European Union, Mr Boyden Gray, is a lawyer with a special interest in public finance."
"He has been fully briefed about the level of fraud and corruption here and is now fully acquainted with much of the detail published last month in ."
"At a time when public accountability – and not just concerning financial management – is a big issue on both sides of the Atlantic, his arrival here and his appointment are to be much applauded."
"While I am on my feet, I should also like to point out that not a single word on EU fraud and corruption published last month has yet been challenged or refuted."
"In its October session, Parliament discussed Eva Klamt’s report on the EU approach to managing economic migration."
"Parliament voted to reject an amendment motion committing the European Parliament to the view that measures dealing with economic migration cannot be adopted until all citizens of the European Union have been guaranteed equal rights in respect of free movement."
"For citizens of the new Member States this means that the European labour market will be more accessible to migrants from third countries, who will enjoy a more favourable position than the citizens of new Member States."
"This parliamentary decision has met with a particularly negative response in the new Member States."
"All available studies indicate that labour markets have not been flooded with workers from the new Member States, and that the economic effects have all been on the positive side."
"Nevertheless, instead of shortening the transition periods, Parliament has taken a decision that I consider to be extremely disturbing, since it exacerbates discrimination against citizens of the new Member States."
"Mr President, I am very concerned about the fate of Mr Labouani, who was recently arrested in Damascus upon disembarking from the flight that had brought him back from a trip to Europe and the United States."
"Mr Labouani is a symbolic figure in Syria."
"He had been imprisoned following the ‘Damascus Spring’ in 2001."
"He served his full sentence, namely three years in prison."
"He had denounced the corruption taking place in relation to procurement procedures for the mobile telephone sector."
"He founded a liberal, secular party."
"I purposely said secular, for the opposition today in Syria often allies itself with the Muslim Brotherhood."
"I saw Mr Labouani three weeks ago, when his flight was leaving for Washington."
"I shared my concerns with him at that time about his freedom of speech and expression."
"He replied that he was not afraid because he had right on his side."
"Then, as soon as he returned, he was arrested."
"Out of consideration for this kind of democratic opposition in Syria, I should therefore like our Parliament to stand behind Mr Labouani and you, Mr President, to write a letter, for example to the Syrian authorities, in order to draw attention to our concern and our disagreement."
"Thank you very much, Mrs De Keyser."
"We shall do so as soon as we can examine the facts you refer to."
"Mr President, there are states or quasi-states defined as ‘non-democracies’ or dictatorships with regimes unauthorised by the people’s free will."
"Therefore, they are illegally imposed by usurpers of fundamental human rights."
"One could call these regimes ‘illegal’ when considered in the light of values shared by free nations in democracies."
"Nevertheless, we agree that a law passed by a dictator is still called a law."
"A court which is subordinated to the will of usurpers is still called a court."
"Despite being written by a bloody hand, a penal or procedural code is still called a code."
"Even dictatorships are already referred to and treated as democracies of a special sort, sometimes being referred to as ‘real democracies’, although they are different from the formal ones."
"We know of the consequences of the great European tyrannies of the last century."
"Nowadays, tyrannies also exist in Cuba, Iran and Belarus."
"In the latter country, a neighbour of Russia, the moves made by an increasingly authoritarian state against its citizens are still defined as being made in a court of law."
"Mr President, the history of Europe since World War II has been marked by singular events that have underpinned European unity, and that today form part of the moral and political foundations upon which the European Union is based."
"These include the letter sent by the Polish bishops to their German counterparts in autumn 1965, in which the former addressed the German people, through the Roman Catholic bishops of Germany, with the famous sentence, ‘We forgive and we ask for forgiveness’."
"It took real moral courage to write this sentence 20 years after the war, when the suffering that Poland had experienced under Nazi occupation was still fresh in people’s minds."
"The letter helped bring about the reconciliation between Poland and Germany, and it was one of the factors that led to the conclusion of the historic treaty on the border between the two countries, which was signed five years later by Willy Brandt in Warsaw."
"Speaking before the House today, I should like to pay homage to the Polish bishops."
"I should also like to commemorate the author of the letter, the Archbishop of Wrocław Bolesław Kominek, who was a Silesian, a Polish patriot and a great European."
"Mr President, the head of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, has offered France immediate assistance to the tune of EUR 50 million to help repair the damage caused by the riots in the country, which have gone on for many days now."
"The money is to be earmarked for the creation of new jobs."
"While I believe that President Barroso means well, I find it regrettable that neither Poland nor Slovakia has ever received such extraordinary sums of money for job creation, despite having the highest levels of unemployment in the European Union."
"Mr Barroso has announced that France could ultimately receive an extra EUR 1 billion for this purpose."
"Should Poland and Slovakia, or the other new EU Member States, organise riots on a similar scale in order to ensure that they receive comparable funding for job creation?"
"The other possibility, of course, is that this is yet another example of the way in which the European Union is divided into a first-class and better-off Europe, which receives more subsidies, and a second-class and worse-off Europe, which receives fewer."
"The way I see it, President Barroso is effectively encouraging Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Baltic States to instigate such riots as a way of gaining additional funding from Brussels."
"Mr President, the burning cars in France have acted like a torch, revealing the presence of discrimination and social exclusion."
"And our hopes of reaching a swift, immediate solution to the complex social and societal problem that has triggered this lawless behaviour in the ghettoised suburbs of French cities have also turned to ashes along with those thousands of burnt-out vehicles."
"Those who merely bemoan the material losses are testifying to their complete failure to understand what is happening and to see the relationship between cause and effect here."
"Rationally thinking citizens will be prompted to ask many questions, not only as a result of any threat to their material safety."
"They would be right to feel that the social equilibrium has been undermined, and that any communication or movement betweeen the different sections of society and ethnic groups has ceased."
"Moreover, this is far from being a question of law and order or an issue of public safety, and this is why it cannot be remedied using the customary instruments of law and order."
"The crisis is the result of bad decisions made as part of a bad policy."
"Third-generation immigrants, squeezed to the fringes of society, do not feel at home in their new homeland, they have no jobs and no goals to aspire to; they cannot see a future for themselves."
"Mr President, ‘those who die are lucky’: those are the words of a Palestinian woman I met in Gaza last week who has worked for 20 years for peace and for women’s rights in that area."
"Her hope has been shattered by Israel’s continued intransigence in refusing to allow the economic development of Gaza by the free flow of people and goods into Egypt from the Gaza Strip via the Rafah crossing and the refusal to allow the development of an airport or a port."
"Half the population of Gaza is under 25 years of age and there is 60% unemployment in the area."
"Israel must be persuaded by Europe that frustrating the economic development of Gaza is counterproductive for Israel’s own security; it should also, in my view, be counterproductive for Israel’s trade relations with Europe."
"The imprisoning of Gaza’s population behind walls and barbed wire fences must end immediately if a political and security disaster for the Palestinian people is to be averted."
"The situation is grim and it is urgent."
"I would urge you to impress on the Commission and the Council that Israel must be persuaded to end its veto on the development of the Gaza Strip."
"In its Accession Treaty, the Slovak Republic made a commitment to decommissioning – and I stress the word ‘decommissioning’ – two reactors of the V1 nuclear power plant at Jaslovske Bohunice."
"This will lead to a 19% drop in electricity production for the Slovak economy which will affect other sectors of the economy as well."
"To help Slovakia in coping with this demanding task, the European Union promised to provide adequate financial assistance."
"For the 2007-2013 budget period, the Commission proposed a contribution of EUR 237 million."
"Decommissioning costs were calculated on the basis of data from 2000, according to which the actual costs were expected to reach EUR 750 million."
"The EUR 237 million proposed by the Commission, in addition to the EUR 180 million that has already been paid, represents less than one third of the actual costs."
"I would urge my esteemed colleagues to consider this matter carefully and to lend their support in voting for the sum of EUR 400 million proposed by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"Mr President, there is an urgent need to guarantee constitutional rights to 18 305 citizens of the former Yugoslavia, who were unlawfully erased from the register of the inhabitants of the newly independent Slovenia in 1992."
"I wish to report on the most unusual case of one of those ‘erased’ people, Mr Ali Berisha, a Roma from Kosovo, who came to Slovenia as a young man in 1985, and until 1991, was legally employed and had permanent residence there."
"When he lost his rights of domicile in Slovenia, he settled in Germany, where he lived and worked for 12 years."
"He married and had four children."
"Owing to regularisation of the situation, the German authorities recently deported him to Kosovo, a country he left 20 years ago."
"The family returned to Slovenia, from where the parents and four children are to be deported to Germany on 18 November."
"I call on the Slovenian Government to restrain from executing the deportation decree on the Berisha family until such time as the Slovenian Court of Justice has ruled on the complaint."
"Mr President, I rise in relation to the Seventh Framework Research Programme currently being considered by the institutions."
"Research is, of course, an area where it makes sense for all our Member States to pool their resources: to have a common programme is much more effective."
"Part of the programme relates to public health."
"That has come under pressure from those who argue that it does not meet the priorities of economic competitiveness as defined in the Lisbon Agenda."
"I should like to refute that argument and call on all those who are considering this programme to refute it."
"Health research is not only worthwhile in its own right. It is also worthwhile in relation to its economic merits, especially research on respiratory health, which is currently lacking from the programme."
"Respiratory health problems are Europe’s second biggest killer, accounting for one in four deaths."
"That costs our health systems EUR 102 million per year and is the major cause of absenteeism from work."
"We must make sure that area of research forms part of the programme."
"Mr President, my country, Flanders, too, has been the scene of terror on the streets over the past few weeks, with gangs of North African immigrants giving full vent to their hatred towards our Western society and taking it out on public and private property."
"Whilst the violence was more limited in its extent than in France, where several people were killed, the politically correct left still prevents us from using the term riffraff or scum – in French – and would prefer to shoot the messenger than address the problem in an environment without any taboos."
"Those problems are first and foremost rooted in an immigration policy that has gone off the rails, in the formation of ghettos, the refusal to assimilate and an aggressive Islamic fundamentalism in the suburbs."
"Certain media, however, prefer to describe the scum who tipped fuel over a disabled lady in order to set fire to her only as rascals."
"Innocent rascals apparently, are also the scoundrels who, in Noisy-le-Grand, pulled two women out of their car and dragged them through the streets by the hair."
"No doubt it was also disadvantaged young people who kicked Jean-Jacques Lechenadec to death, but the policeman who protected citizens and property from looters risks being put in prison."
"Those whom Mr Sarkozy rightly describes as scum, however, can count on subsidies and red-carpet treatment."
"I take pity on Europe and France."
"– On 15 May, a general election was held in Ethiopia."
"One of the reasons why people cast their votes was that they trusted the international observers, which included the EU."
"Since election day, massacres have taken place – on 8 June, for example – and yet the Ethiopian Prime Minister has been received by the G8 and took part in the Africa Commission."
"Recently, on 1 November, there was dreadful violence and repression in Ethiopia and all opposition leaders were arrested."
"At this very moment, there are tens of thousands of people in jail and dozens have died. Even so, the Ethiopian Prime Minister has been received in Germany."
"Mr President, on 13 July, Parliament adopted a very clear resolution on the situation in Ethiopia."
"I call on you to write to the Ethiopian Government and European governments, drawing their attention to the fact that it is impossible to conduct ‘business as usual’ with a country that is under repression and in which elected opposition leaders are incarcerated."
"Mr President, the European Commission has written to the Swedish Government and asked it to intervene in the work of the Supreme Court."
"The basic principle behind a democracy is the distribution of power."
"It is constitutionally impossible for the Swedish Government to intervene in the work of the Supreme Court."
"I think that this is a serious attack on our constitutional principle."
"It would therefore be helpful if Parliament could explain to the Commission that it too must follow the ground rules in each country."
"The Supreme Court is the highest independent body in Sweden."
"We have no constitutional court or other possible ways of monitoring government power."
"If the Commission now calls on our government to influence the Supreme Court, this would damage our constitution and the ways in which our country and our democracy operate."
"It would be unfortunate if such a request were made again."
"Mr President, I want to raise the Irish Ferries shipping company’s plans to replace over 500 employees with low-paid slave labour provided by agency workers, many from outside the European Union."
"This practice of social dumping is wholly unacceptable and the European Union has a responsibility to protect the rights of all workers, including seafarers who work European waters."
"The wage rates and secondary benefits afforded to seafarers must be in line with those applicable in the relevant Member States."
"Irish Ferries must honour its agreements with workers and trade unions in the company."
"There is no case for breaking these agreements."
"We need a European ferries directive to ensure that Irish Ferries and other companies like it cannot ride roughshod over the rights of workers present and future."
"This Parliament must actively oppose the ‘race to the bottom’ approach to employment and working conditions which is now rife within the European Union."
"Mr President, evictions are a very emotive issue in Ireland given our long and painful history, so it is with some regret that we have seen the question come to the fore again in recent times, particularly last week on the streets of Dublin."
"This poster reads ‘Stop Mandelson’s evictions’ and it represents the voice of 5000 farmers last week."
"A colleague spoke about it earlier."
"There is a real fear that what is happening at the WTO will mean the death knell for many farmers, not just in Ireland, but throughout the European Union."
"I have three messages for the Commission at WTO level."
"Any deal on agriculture cannot come at any price: it must be balanced and fair."
"Where there is increased market access we must be sensitive to some products; if the markets are to be destabilised we have to bring in mechanisms to control that destabilisation."
"And I would suggest that the EU should only import food produced under the standards it demands of its own producers, and not accept lower standards in relation to animal welfare, food safety and the environment."
"Mr President, thank you very much for the speaking time I have been given, but are you aware that, since 1999, five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor have been held in prison in Libya?"
"They were sentenced to death in 2004 because 400 Libyan children and teenagers had been contaminated by the AIDS virus in Benghazi Hospital."
"Everyone knows that neither the Bulgarian nurses nor the Palestinian doctor were responsible for this contamination but, in spite of everything, they were taken hostage and since May 2004, have been sentenced to death."
"They will learn tomorrow whether or not their appeals have been accepted."
"We have often brought up this issue within the European Parliament but we really need to participate in any possible moves to free these people, who are victims of a policy that is completely beyond their and our understanding, in the same way that we need to try to help the Libyan children who have been contaminated."
"Mr President, last week was the 16th anniversary of the end of the division of Germany."
"This year is the 31st anniversary of the division of Cyprus; almost half of Cyprus is occupied by Turkey."
"Until 16 years ago, Germany was divided by Russian Communism."
"Today Cyprus is divided by Turkish Fascism, and Turkish occupation is continuously being strengthened."
"Recently, after threatening UN observers, the Turkish forces extended their grip into the UN buffer zone in the region east of Nicosia."
"I managed to lower the Turkish flag from a new military post being built in that area and brought it here today in order to remind my fellow MEPs, once again, that an EU Member State is occupied by a candidate country and yet the EU seems strangely able to tolerate this absurd situation."
"I wish to hand this flag to you, Mr President, and request that you send it to the Turkish premier telling him that our patience has run out and that he must, without further delay or excuses, get his occupation troops off Cypriot European Union soil."
"Thank you, Mr Matsakis, but you will understand that I am not going to send the flag to the Turkish Prime Minister."
"You may do so directly if you wish."
"Mr President, this House frequently and properly raises its voice in support of the victims of terrorism."
"I invite it to do so again."
"After decades of IRA- and other terrorism in Northern Ireland, we have hundreds of unsolved murders, many of whose perpetrators have fled the jurisdiction."
"Now, in a quite appalling legislative move, the British Government, in delivery of a sordid deal with the IRA, is proposing to afford amnesty and sanctuary to those on-the-run terrorists."
"The rights of their victims to have justice is to be shamelessly denied, while a farcical process is put in place whereby the terrorists need not even attend court, will not be required to serve a single day in jail and will never be permitted to be questioned again about their abominable crimes."
"This legislation is a gross affront to justice and the human rights of victims; it is a stomach-churning illustration of how low governments can stoop when they set about appeasing terrorism."
"I call on this House and the Justice Commissioner to speak out against this wretched legislation."
"During the last year, the population in some new EU States has decreased to an alarming extent, most of all in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia as a result of emigration to the old EU States."
"The free movement of persons is one of the fundamental accomplishments of the EU."
"However, new EU States are painfully losing their most gifted and well-educated people to older and much richer states."
"In Lithuania, the education of a student costs on average EUR 7 000 and of a medical student as much as EUR 26 000 and of a pilot EUR 60 000."
"Naturally, attracting specialists from the new countries is less expensive and more convenient than training them locally."
"But this seems more like poorer countries making charitable contributions to prosperous ones."
"Prohibitions and restrictions will not help."
"We need to develop a system for the registration of young specialists working permanently in other EU states and establish fair ‘rules of the game’."
"We need a special fund to alleviate the painful consequences of ‘brain drain’ in the name of solidarity, the essence of the European Union."
"That concludes the one-minute speeches."
"The next item is the report by Mihael Brejc, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the social dimension of globalisation (2005/2061(INI)) (A6-0308/2005)."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Brejc, for his report, which is of key importance."
"Debates on globalisation and its impact are high on the agenda, both in the European Union and on a global scale."
"The report contains a great many proposals, which the Commission intends to examine in detail."
"I should, however, like to make a few preliminary remarks on a number of the report’s demands and proposals."
"I am delighted that Parliament has lent its support to the initiatives the Commission has proposed and developed with a view to strengthening the social dimension of globalisation."
"The Commission has adopted a proactive approach in order to help ensure that the benefits of globalisation are shared more widely, and to reverse its negative effects."
"The European Commission backed the talks held by the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation, which was established by the International Labour Organisation."
"The communication of 18 May 2004 contains the European Commission’s original proposals, and expresses clear support for the implementation of the World Commission’s final report."
"Since that time, these proposals have gained wide support, especially among the members of the European Council, the Council of Ministers, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions."
"Your report and motion for a resolution contain a great deal of information that is of crucial importance for the Commission."
"If the social dimension of globalisation is to be promoted in the European Union and elsewhere, joined-up measures that will command widespread support are needed."
"The Commission welcomes the outcome of the UN summit held in September."
"I would remind the House that the Commission played a part in the preparations for this summit, in particular by acting as a coordinator at EU level, and by making use of its contacts within the UN and the UN’s specialised agencies, such as the International Labour Organisation."
"The UN summit’s final declaration makes express reference to fair globalisation and decent work on the basis of fundamental social rights."
"As well as laying down principles, the declaration also stresses that the promotion of decent work and fair globalisation should be incorporated into development strategies at global and national levels."
"This UN backing is of crucial importance for the European Union’s external actions in all areas, whether in terms of enhancing our cooperation with the International Labour Organisation and other international organisations, or in terms of bilateral cooperation with other regions and countries."
"Mr President, thank you very much."
"I should like to begin by saying that I much appreciated Commissioner Špidla’s speech in this Chamber today."
"The greatest challenge we face in our common future is that of how we in Europe can help make globalisation a real opportunity for social progress in the developing countries."
"I have just returned home from China, and let me tell you all that the Chinese are very concerned about the future of Europe. I told those to whom I was talking in China that I too was very concerned."
"I am concerned if we cannot stand united and work with the aim of making a contribution to the world that can maintain a balance."
"I am concerned if we cannot stand united in the world in order to fight for social justice and social progress in the developing countries."
"I am, moreover, concerned on behalf of India, Africa and China and on behalf of all the developing countries if we cannot stand together in order to keep to this objective, for if we cannot maintain the objective of greater social progress and justice, the whole world, including Europe, will lose out."
"It is therefore crucial to strengthen basic workers’ rights, as agreed by the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation."
"As draftsman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I entirely support this conclusion, and I know that my colleague Mr Christensen, who acted as PSE shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, also supports this conclusion."
"I have focused on three main issues in my speech."
"Firstly, we cannot promote greater flexibility without providing our workers and children and women with greater social protection in exchange."
"Secondly, Europe must not compete in terms of social dumping."
"Europe must compete in terms of the best and not the worst. Nor should Europe export social dumping."
"Thirdly, Europe must have a role as the world’s social conscience in relation to development, the environment and employees’ rights."
"That is something I also know we agree with Mr Christensen about."
"Tomorrow, I shall report on the views taken of the social growth programme of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
". Madam President, Commissioner, we ought to thank the European Commission for having taken on the challenge of the social dimension of globalisation."
"I should, however, like the European institutions and the national authorities also to give some thought of their own to the matter, using the actual conditions in the Member States as a starting point."
"The social dimension of globalisation requires us to adapt the structures of society to the commitments made, but without for all that sacrificing what underpins society."
"To begin with, I should like to address the social dimension of globalisation from the perspective of citizenship."
"Nothing cripples citizenship more than the feeling of inferiority generated by the daily onslaughts of poverty, subordination and dependency."
"Consequently, all our efforts should be aimed at ensuring that all those men and women who are today excluded from progress because of unfettered globalisation can hold on to, or regain, their dignity."
"My second remark relates to one of the greatest challenges of globalisation: poverty."
"Last month, on 17 October, we commemorated the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty."
"We said that, in order to combat poverty, we needed to enter into a close partnership with the poorest people."
"Unfortunately, the European Commission has not yet heard these calls."
"That is why I pray that the European and national institutions might take the contributions of the poorest families and citizens seriously."
"These people are the real experts when it comes to understanding the social dimension of globalisation."
"My third point relates to the contribution of women to this debate."
"The Lisbon Strategy anticipates that at least 60% of women will participate in the labour market in 2010."
"I am convinced that this objective has already been achieved."
"All that is required is for recognition to be given to all of the work done by women that is not officially recognised at present by the national and European authorities."
"What do we really know about the commitment made by women in leading intergenerational support networks and in being the driving force behind other forms of informal work?"
"Society as a whole benefits from this."
"I encourage the services of the European Commission together with the Member States to recognise the work done by women that is not yet officially recognised, and to do so irrespective of the social status of these women."
"This also forms part of the responses to the social challenge of globalisation."
"Madam President, thank you for giving me the floor."
"I should like to begin by saying thank you to the rapporteur, Mr Brejc, for his work on the report on the social dimension of globalisation and for cooperating with us so constructively in this connection."
"Globalisation has given many people in the world considerable advantages."
"It is just that the advantages are not distributed equally across all countries and all groups in society."
"This is something about which the EU clearly has a duty to do something."
"I am therefore pleased that the report focuses on, and gives rise to a debate about, the social aspect of globalisation."
"We all have a responsibility for finding new answers to the challenges."
"We must ensure that the people of Europe do not associate globalisation only with companies transferring their operations abroad, dreadful conditions of work and mass redundancies."
"Globalisation must, on the contrary, be associated with more and better jobs, more opportunities and increased prosperity for all."
"We must do away with the harmful consequences of globalisation and ensure that the positive aspects of globalisation are more evenly distributed."
"It is precisely in this area that the EU can play an important role."
"It must ensure that it creates good conditions for people in the EU so that they can cope successfully with international competition."
"It must not only focus on the market economy and the free play of market forces."
"It must also invest in people."
"If everyone is to be in a position to cope successfully with global competition, the fact is that more and better education is needed, together with an active labour market policy."
"Lifelong learning and the development of people’s skills are necessary if everyone is to be able to give a good account of themselves in the face of global competition."
"The second answer to the challenges of globalisation is that the EU must increase and promote the use of the social dialogue in both the EU and the rest of the world."
"Close cooperation between the two sides of industry can facilitate restructuring, just as increased information can reduce the fear of globalisation."
"In the rest of the world, the social dialogue will mean that labour market conditions are improved, for the EU also has an obligation to bring about social progress throughout the world."
"It is not only in the EU that globalisation must benefit people."
"In this connection, I should also like to thank my colleague, Mr Rasmussen, who has done some constructive work in drafting the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs so that the report also focuses on the EU’s external policies."
". Madam President, I believe that bringing a social dimension to globalisation is one of the fundamental problems posed by this process."
"I am delighted that the Commissioner, on behalf of the European Commission, has expressed a similar view, and I hope that this view is also shared by the Council of Ministers, even though the seats reserved for the Council are empty, as I see they are."
"In our opinion, it is crucial for the European Parliament to pursue this matter, and thanks are due to the rapporteur for the motion for a resolution he has tabled."
"Although there are many different aspects to this issue, I should like to highlight two that I believe are particularly important."
"Firstly, the significance attached to the social dimension of globalisation depends to a large, if not decisive, extent on the emergence and consolidation of a civil society in every country."
"This is especially true in the case of those countries that are making insufficient progress in democratic and economic terms."
"The European Union should support civil society building in all the countries with which it cooperates, and particularly in developing countries."
"The second issue I should like to highlight is the role the European Union must play in monitoring globalisation and promoting its social dimension."
"Globalisation is inevitable, and it is a necessary, not to say indispensable, process."
"At the same time, however, we are all aware of the significant social risks it poses."
"Globalisation therefore needs to be controlled in such a way as to ensure that any negative effects are kept to a minimum."
"This may well be the very foundation upon which the social dimension of globalisation is based, and I believe that the European Union can and should play a key role in this respect."
". Madam President, this report touches on many issues of social policy, and it is to be hoped that the business sector will take these fine principles on board far more than it has previously and will actually put them into practice."
"If it does not, the mocking proverb according to which ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions’ would no doubt have to be recast in a version for the EU, which would read: ‘the road to neo-capitalist globalisation is paved with the EU’s fine words on social policy’."
"The report is still far too vague about the correlation between poverty, business and the destruction of the environment; to take an example, the International Energy Agency’s ‘World Energy Outlook 2005’ paints a frightening picture of worldwide CO2 emissions increasing by 52% between now and 2030."
"There is a clear trade-off between the destruction of the environment and the reduction of poverty, and it is above all the poorest who suffer from it."
"One of the functions of policy is to set clear boundaries for business; multinational conglomerates must accept much more responsibility for society and the environment, and the Triple Bottom Line approach is one example of how they can do so."
"The public can be guided towards more responsible ways of being consumers, and eco-label is one way in which this can be done."
"Consumers have the right to be told whether a product was manufactured fairly and in line with ILO standards or if exploitation was involved."
"Let me say something else about the WTO."
"I am perturbed by the excessive respect in which that organisation is held."
"Many politicians’ attitudes towards it suggest that they see it as some sort of force of nature."
"The WTO must become more democratic."
"Elected institutions must redefine its objectives and monitor its activities."
"This is another area in which the EU must bring much more influence to bear."
". – We are all aware that the process of neoliberal globalisation is serving to exacerbate economic and social inequality and to widen the gulf between rich and poor. It is also exacerbating environmental imbalances, both between different countries and within individual countries, as demonstrated by the UN’s figures and reports."
"High levels of unemployment, inequalities in the distribution of wealth, poverty and social exclusion are also causing rising social tension, something to which we in the EU are not immune."
"It is therefore not enough simply to observe the current situation; what is needed is a clean break from the political, economic, monetary and international trade policies that have led to this situation, both at world level and at EU level, in order that the strategic objectives for sustainable development can be met and living standards throughout the world can be raised."
"The proposals for amendments that we have tabled are aimed at stressing the importance of changing some of these policies, as a matter of urgency, in such a way that the social dimension is given due prominence."
"Practical measures must urgently be taken to combat financial speculation in the world’s capital markets, for example, by taxing the movement of capital and stock market capital gains."
"This will serve to reduce the volatility of the capital markets and the risk of financial crisis, to boost investment and wealth creation in the real economy, and, in so doing, to promote social inclusion and ensure respect for human rights."
"It is moreover vitally important that the Lisbon Strategy and the Stability and Growth Pact be replaced with a European strategy of real solidarity and sustainable development, aimed at promoting equal rights and social protection for all, eradicating poverty and social exclusion, solving problems of precarious work, and strengthening the social rights of workers, the unemployed, the elderly and children."
"Universal access to high quality public services, in areas such as water supply, health, education and housing, is of fundamental importance. Accordingly, the EU, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation and GATT, must not give precedence to liberalising services."
"– Madam President, the concept of globalisation is not new, it was not introduced recently."
"It started from Rome as ecumenism, last century the communists tried to impose it as internationalisation and, today, globalisation is the answer of capitalism."
"I should like to ask anyone in Europe – the tradesman in Cologne, the artisan in Marseille, the farmer in Greece: are they happy with the results of globalisation?"
"The only people who are happy are the Chinese with 12% growth."
"What do we get out of it?"
"What is going well in Europe?"
"Countries with a strong economy, such as Germany, are now in deficit."
"What do we get out of it?"
"Unemployment is increasing and we cannot get it under control."
"What do we get out of it?"
"Everything comes from China."
"Is it not true that everything comes from China?"
"Is it not true that we are trying, now that the horse has bolted, to find a way to stop the whole of China coming here?"
"This is the reality."
"The third countries took our factories and we get their inhabitants."
"That is why we have these incidents in France, with those whom Mr Sarkozi called 'scum'; and of course I disagree with the term used by the French Minister for Home Affairs."
"However, these people do not have work, because the factory where they worked left for North Africa or the Balkans."
"So globalisation does not benefit us Europeans, but we are so clever."
"We took our currency and revalued it against the dollar by 50%."
"How can we do anything with the euro so high?"
"How will we be able to address globalisation?"
"How can we safeguard viable pensions?"
"Do you know what the average pension is in Greece?"
"It is equal to an MEP's per diem."
"The EUR 270 which we get here today is more than a Greek farmer gets in a month."
"Can we safeguard a viable European pension?"
"Can we safeguard work for all Europeans?"
"Can we safeguard cotton, which is in warehouses in Greece, which Europe does not take so that it can take cotton from third countries?"
"Can we safeguard Spanish oil, which Europe does not take so that it can take oil from Tunisia?"
"This is the reality."
"What globalisation are we talking about?"
"What are the results?"
"I repeat, what does Europe get out of it?"
"What are we safeguarding for European citizens?"
"We have played the game of the United States of America so that big business can reap the benefits."
"The only ones who are happy are Carrefour and Lidl, and how so?"
"By exploiting people."
"I went to Lidl here in Strasbourg and bought a few things."
"I bought the same things in my own country three times more expensive."
"The same product, the same name, the same quantity."
"How can small retailers survive?"
"How can artisans survive?"
"That is why we are moving towards a shrinking economy, towards a problem which we will have to face."
"Beware; I do not know if this heedless enlargement of Europe will be its downfall, but its biggest problem will be the economy."
"Globalisation will seriously damage the future of Europe."
". Madam President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his work."
"All too often, when we talk about globalisation, our comments and concerns centre solely on trade, rather than on the social aspects of globalisation."
"In fact, the European Union can play a very significant role in disseminating best practices through what we have achieved in the Union itself."
"Despite the faults that exist within the European system, there are also many good and positive things."
"I wish to give just one example of this."
"Two weeks ago I was in Nairobi."
"In one of the slums there I visited a school which has 1 690 students and 22 teachers."
"The principal of that school was earning the equivalent of EUR 150 per month."
"The only reason there were so many children going to the school was because they were given food donated by the European Union and the World Food Programme."
"They were being encouraged to learn but were also being fed."
"I am reminded of the saying ‘give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, but teach a man to fish and you feed him for life’."
"One of the most important aspects of the social aspect of globalisation is education, because no matter how many trade issues you deal with or how many preferential trade deals you give to developing countries, the people in those countries will never be able to climb out of the pit of poverty to which so many of them are consigned unless they are given proper access to education and healthcare and an understanding of how systems operate."
"Our role, our duty and our responsibility, be it in world trade or in the United Nations, or even within our own development aid actions, should be to ensure, first and foremost, that when we speak about globalisation we place people at the centre of the debate."
"It is not just about trading blocs."
"It is not just about economic returns."
"It is about ensuring that the world itself is a better place for future generations."
"That can only be achieved if we invest in the people themselves."
"Madam President, this report states that the European Union can make a significant contribution to the process of globalisation by developing its social model and promoting it internationally."
"Yet, with 20 million unemployed people in Europe, what social model are you talking about?"
"The Lisbon process, which is a failure?"
"The debt of those Member States that are on the verge of bankruptcy? Social precarity, crushing taxation and the new type of poverty of Europe’s Fourth World?"
"Do you believe that all of this might constitute a social model that we can export?"
"If you want to have an accurate view of the social dimension of globalisation, I invite you to go and be a tourist in the 300 French towns that, for the last 18 days, have been the scenes of social uprisings, ethnic riots and anti-French hatred, with burning cars and destroyed schools, creches, gymnasiums and hospitals, and all this without mentioning the systematic and widespread attacks on fire fighters and law enforcement officers."
"You will thus assess the tangible and visible consequences of the extreme ultraliberal, ultra-internationalist and ultra-immigrationist economic policy carried out for the past 25 years by the European institutions and the Member States, with France at the helm."
"Your social model of integration is, in fact, an out-and-out model of disintegration: economic and industrial disintegration, social disintegration, cultural disintegration and institutional disintegration."
"In addition to businesses relocating to countries with low social costs linked to production, the populations of poor countries are relocating to countries with high levels of social protection."
"Widespread social dumping brought about by globalisation is just what is needed economically to bring about social decline."
"Your economic globalisation is, in fact, globalisation of social dumping and of migration."
"Foreign populations are entering Europe en masse, while businesses are leaving Europe en masse."
"Today we have to tolerate not only the rioters in our suburbs, but also the economic looters plundering our industries, combined with the political and institutional bandits pillaging our national identities, our national units, our sovereignties and our values of civilisation."
"Enforced economic and migratory globalisation will end up imposing on the people of Europe a multi-community and multi-ethnic society, positive discrimination, obligatory racial mixing and a level of social protection equal to that of Communist China."
"That model is clearly not ours, and it is crucial today to defuse that ticking timebomb."
"I should first like to extend my apologies to you for my late arrival which was caused by a delayed flight and traffic jams in Strasbourg."
"The report being discussed today includes an account of measures relating to the social dimension of globalisation."
"The report also constitutes a first response of the Commission and of the European Parliament to the dimensions of globalisation and, of course, to the report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation, set up by the International Labour Organisation (ILO)."
"There are a number of definitions of globalisation."
"The basic idea behind globalisation is the progressive integration of economies and societies."
"It is driven by new technologies, new economic relations and national foreign policies of various entities, ranging from governments to civil societies."
"Globalisation is a process which does not carry an ideological content, neither that of the Left or of the Right, neither that of the Liberals or the Greens."
"It is a process which entails positive and negative consequences."
"For that reason we may consider it from various viewpoints, the economic, financial, technological, environmental and so on."
"The social dimensions of globalisation constitute the subject matter of this report."
"The Commission communication emphasises the social dimension of bilateral and regional relations within Europe which encompass bilateral and regional agreements, political dialogue at the regional level, the European Union neighbourhood policy, respect for human rights and democratisation in the third countries, migration development and so on."
"I would also like to mention the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which, amongst other things, place emphasis on the cooperation policy, on ensuring that the trade policy fully underpins social progress giving developing countries access to the markets of developed countries, and on the support for a specific initiative for social progress and the transposition of good practices."
"In my report, I have tried to place particular stress on the following: we have to strengthen the factors of globalisation which act in a positive manner and we have to create conditions for a reduction in the negative impact of globalisation."
"The Member States of the EU can set the good practices they have developed as an example for other parts of the world to follow and should endeavour to make the revised Lisbon Strategy a success."
"We have to promote a climate which supports enterprise, investment and social progress."
"We need, however, a more flexible labour market, less bureaucracy and greater personal responsibility."
"To maintain the competitiveness of the European economy and social progress, we need large investments in human resources and for this reason I welcome the efforts of the Commission in that direction."
"The European Parliament has to support the so-called Core Labour Standards and the ILO’s Decent Work Agenda."
"We have to seek to attain observer status for the ILO at the World Trade Organisation with a view to improving the quality of interinstitutional dialogue."
"We should stress the significance of a united front within international institutions, develop Corporate Social Responsibility and urge enterprises to use appropriate measures and good practices."
"In this context, I would like to mention the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises."
"We should also highlight the important role of educational institutions and the media in the process of keeping the public well informed about the impact of globalisation."
"Furthermore, I note with interest the idea for a Parliamentary Group to be set up to oversee the coherence and consistency between global economic, social and environmental policies and to provide a holistic overview of the most important international organisations."
"The consultation on the Commission communication and my report has provided a fruitful ground for a number of amendments, none of which concern the social dimension of globalisation."
"While I would like to urge you to restrict this consultation to the social dimensions of globalisation only, I do understand my colleagues who would like to highlight other aspects in this context."
"As a result, we have received amendments concerning the common agricultural policy, environmental aspects, oil and gas trading and so on. Some of the amendments are far–removed from reality and would be better placed in the dustbin of the history of socialism than in the context of the modern welfare state and I cannot, therefore, lend them my support."
"I would like to use this opportunity to thank the Commission for drafting an excellent communication and extend my gratitude to all my colleagues who have made an important contribution in shaping the report of the European Parliament on the social dimensions of globalisation."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to be able to speak directly after the rapporteur."
"There is no doubt that globalisation results in increased economic output, as well as reducing costs and the differences between corporate cultures."
"That is the good thing about it."
"It does, though, also lead to far keener competition, which can entail serious job losses and be a source of serious anxiety for workers."
"Mr Christensen is quite right to say that the benefits of globalisation are not equally distributed, but it does bring progress, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in favour of using that progress and getting to grips with solving structural problems."
"If we want to look forwards and compete – as we must – then there must be reforms, but we must, at the same time, find innovative ways of responding to social challenges."
"In June, my colleague Mr Brejc put together an excellent report, which was even-handed enough, concentrated on the essentials and came up with crystal-clear solutions, but its 17 compact paragraphs were suddenly inflated into 39 by the desire of certain Members on the Left of this House to introduce a whole new dimension into it, which they believed to be necessary."
"I have to say that I do not agree with them!"
"In the twinkling of an eye, they make effective institutions into instruments of regulation; one can almost feel the bureaucrats breathing down one’s neck."
"They urge the Commission to monitor the compatibility of fisheries partnership agreements with the Millennium Development Goals, and stress the importance of such issues as the threat of eco-destruction and the loss of biodiversity."
"If the subject were ‘the ecological dimension of globalisation’, then that would be all well and good and we could talk about it, but the report is about ‘the social dimension of globalisation’."
"There are times when one has to concentrate on the matter in hand if one is not to end up in considerable difficulties."
"It is grotesque that demands should be made for such things as measures to deter businesses from relocating in order to obtain EU subsidies."
"Where a business is to be based is not decided at short notice and with payments from Brussels in mind; it is a long-term process involving major financial transactions and long-term decision-making by management."
"Let us cut through the tangled growth of repetitious verbiage, irrelevant matter and high-flown ideological posturing; what the own-initiative report called for was in fact perfectly clear, namely extensive investment in human capital, improvements in countries’ educational systems, the promotion of professional expertise – which is more urgently needed than ever – and the creation of high-quality jobs in line with the Lisbon Strategy."
"What, then, of the ILO?"
"I agree with the rapporteur, and with some of those who have already spoken, that the ILO must concentrate more on humane working conditions."
"We must carry on struggling to prevent social exclusion, to do away with child labour and to win the war on poverty."
"What the ILO needs is observer status within the WTO, and we would welcome an institutional multi-stakeholder forum on corporate social responsibility."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises need to be better inter-connected if they are to be enabled to actively participate in a globalised economy and if new jobs are to be created, and the social partners need to be involved in all decision-making processes if the social dimension is to be strengthened."
"Madam President, I am grateful to my friend Mr Mann for demonstrating that we are back in step once again."
"The WTO’s sixth Ministerial Conference is due to be held in Hong Kong this December, and it will be yet another of the kind at which there will be no discussion of a ban on child labour, or of the abolition of forced labour, not to mention freedom of association or the right to set up trade unions."
"The examples I have just given are core labour standards, and there can be no fair trade without them."
"The Commission communication that we are discussing today sets out the things that the Community can do to make the globalisation process fairer for everyone, and, with that in mind, I would like to draw the House’s attention to a negotiating mandate for the 1999 WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle, which expressed the EU’s desire for a conference at ministerial level on the subjects of trade, employment and core labour standards."
"At that time, the Commission – and it is the Members of the Commission that I would like to remind of this – undertook to hold such a conference in 2001."
"If you, Members of the Commission, want to take action, then I suggest that you make a start by doing what you undertook to do years ago."
"I expect of you no other than this, that you hold this conference at long last, for fair trade is more live an issue than ever, if – as you now should – you take the social dimension of globalisation seriously."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Brejc’s approach to a topic with extremely sensitive ramifications – the social implications of globalisation – is a particularly effective one."
"This is a matter of great topical interest and was also the subject of a lively debate during the recent informal meeting of Heads of State or Government held on 28 October at Hampton Court."
"Globalisation is a complex process, a source of both opportunities and challenges, and therefore needs to be managed in such a way as to deliver all its benefits while simultaneously minimising its concomitant social and economic imbalances."
"Here, the Union has a positive contribution to make by promoting its development model at international level."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur’s proposal to relaunch and reinforce the Lisbon Strategy, which stresses the interdependence of the economic, social and environmental dimensions."
"I also agree with him on the vital importance of investing in human resources, professional training and research and innovation, which are all vectors for development focused on social justice."
"However, that is not enough by itself."
"As recent events in the French suburbs have shown, even the Union’s most industrialised countries have serious social imbalances, which leave whole swathes of the population feeling marginalised."
"Good global governance is not enough to solve these problems; the demands of the country also need to be better understood."
"To survive and prosper, a globalised economy needs a more solid foundation; it must promote more extensive and more inclusive social action and must be compatible with local requirements."
"This is why we need to think globally and act locally."
"In my view, the keyword is ‘’."
"The European model, therefore, needs an overhaul which, without compromising the important social progress achieved in the 20th century, will help it to get closer to the people and thereby respond more effectively to the demands of a constantly-changing society and of an economy now operating on a global scale."
"Europe must look to the future with courage and cannot afford to fail the test of globalisation."
"– Madam President, the process of so-called globalisation highlights the barbarity of capitalist development and the imperialist imposition of the choices of big business, with painful consequences on the working classes, grass-roots society and the environment."
"Globalisation is the central ideology of the urban and opportunistic ideological movements of various hues, but with a common ambition to try and camouflage capitalism and its class structure."
"The communication by the European Commission on the social dimension of globalisation analyses the phenomena from the point of view of the interests of big business and tries to obscure the real reasons for modern problems."
"At the same time, for the new economic and social reality which is being shaped, it proposes as a strategy at regional and international level the alleged need to accept and reform the imperialist unions."
"Capitalist restructurings are the answer of the European Union, with the promotion of competitiveness as their main feature."
"The Lisbon Strategy and the success of its updated expression are the basic parameter of the Commission's choices and proposals in the contribution of the European Union to the process of globalisation."
"An evaluation of all the data shows that the term 'globalisation' is a misnomer."
"It covers the nature of and the crisis in the system."
"The era we live in is not an era of globalisation; it is an era of imperialism."
"The working classes and the workers in general reject the reactionary process and the course of so-called globalisation and are fighting for radical changes and grass-roots prosperity."
"Madam President, this report has been prepared at a time when the residents of the European Union Member States are harbouring ever-increasing concerns about the processes caused by or imputed to globalisation."
"The fact that the challenges relating to European Union development are often perceived by the public as a globalisation process is very worrying and is yet another key argument that calls for us to formulate appropriate policies in order to endow the processes of globalisation with a social dimension."
"The process of globalisation, as is rightly emphasised in the report, also brings with it significant positive benefits, but equally the positive results of globalisation, which, objectively, is essential throughout the world, may not be achieved if attention is not paid in good time to social aspects."
"The outcome of the globalisation process will depend on the capacity of its participants to adapt in rapidly changing circumstances, and for this reason support should be given to the importance of implementing the Lisbon Strategy, as the report stresses on several occasions, so that the European Union may be able to derive maximum benefit from the globalisation process and to win public acceptance of that process in the Member States."
"In my opinion, however, the report has here departed from the current reality in the European Union."
"The endless debates about the reform of the common agricultural policy demonstrate that at the moment the European Union can only agree on a budget structure that meets 19th century needs."
"We are witnesses to the struggles here in the European Parliament on the Services Directive."
"We know the importance that this directive has for the European Union’s Lisbon Strategy: it is one of the strategy’s cornerstones."
"Therefore, in my view, it is actually here, in the extent of our willingness, that the greatest threats of globalisation lie hidden, since public opinion in an increasing number of European Union Member States is not ready for the challenges of competition even within the European Union itself."
"Madam President, globalisation is irreversible."
"Fortunately, however, it also represents a great opportunity for people from all continents, countries and regions."
"One need only look at the booming Chinese economy to see proof of this."
"In the same way that socialism was needed to take the edge off 19th century capitalism, however, the globalisation of today needs a social dimension, without which it will be nothing but a wasted opportunity for humanity."
"At a time when the EU must speak out with one voice in favour of globalisation with a human face, it is painfully obvious that the EU itself lacks integration, a common foreign policy, a strong budget and a services directive capable of boosting the economies of the new Member States."
"Workers have no freedom of movement within the EU, unlike capital, and the common agricultural policy is unjust."
"All the more praise and recognition is therefore due to the rapporteur, who has temporarily overlooked the unjust division into old Member States and new Member States, instead advocating a fair division of goods on a global scale."
"The European social model, as set out in the Lisbon Strategy, should become our calling card and our leading export."
"The accumulation of goods has now reached such levels that the most important task facing the world is the decision to divide these goods up fairly, while ensuring that everyone can live and work in dignity."
"The outsourcing of human rights and workers’ rights must follow on the heels of the outsourcing of capital."
"We should set up institutions that support the work of the WTO and that endeavour to bring a social dimension to globalisation, such as the Council for Human Development mentioned in the report."
"Madam President, I first want to thank my colleague, Mr Brejc, for his work on this report and for his efforts to direct it towards the really important issues."
"I must say, however, that, if there are no changes to it, it will be difficult to support the report in the form it has been drawn up following the committee’s reading of it."
"In its present form, the report states that globalisation leads to gulfs and imbalances between countries and within societies."
"That is emphatically not the case."
"If there is anything at all that globalisation has provided, it is well-being and prosperity for the poor parts of the world."
"We see today how poverty has been combated in large parts of Asia."
"We see how people in Taiwan, China, India and ever more other countries are slowly obtaining progressively more dignity and increased prosperity."
"Globalisation has helped do away with poverty of a kind that, for centuries, characterised large parts of the world in which we now see wealth and well-being increasing, as well as respect for the individual."
"It is important to state that, directly contrary to what is stated in the report, it is, in actual fact, precisely in those parts of the world not reached by globalisation that we have stagnation and poverty, for example in those parts of Africa and Asia in which free and open trade are not practised and in which people are excluded from globalisation."
"It is the lack of globalisation and participation in the global economy that produces indigent people, poor living conditions and undignified working environments."
"It is also easy to see that this is the case, for where do we find the worst working environments and the worst social conditions?"
"It is not in developing countries, but in those countries that belong to the lost world and that are excluded from the global economy."
"It may also be worth asking whether we should be better off if the poor parts of the world were not being developed."
"Would we be better off if the Chinese or Indian economy had not been developed?"
"For a number of different reasons, the answer to that question is of course ‘no’, partly because it is good that life is progressively improving in these countries and partly because these same countries constitute our growing markets."
"Europe is a continent that, to the very highest degree, thrives on globalisation."
"Our well-being, prosperity and high wages depend on our having companies that can operate and develop throughout the world by offering high-quality products and services."
"If we try to put a stop to globalisation, we ourselves are affected."
"If we try to impose our rules on other countries, they, for their part, are then hit."
"It is free trade that, both historically and in the present time, creates increasing well-being and respect for people."
"That is the basis on which we must proceed when making policy."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank our fellow Member, Mr Brejc, for his report."
"It is timely, with only a few weeks to go until the opening of the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Hong Kong."
"The form of globalisation that we know today has always been presented to us as a positive phenomenon that creates wealth."
"It certainly has its winners but - to plagiarise the former Prime Minister of France - globalisation is a new aristocracy of money and power, which today accumulates profits and relegates a majority of losers to the sidelines."
"We are not only noticing an increase in the inequalities in North-South relations, but we are also discovering that these inequalities are reflected today in South-South relations and within the very heart of a Western society in which the gap between the richest and the poorest has become dramatically more pronounced over the last few years."
"The pursuit of social globalisation has the effect of endangering social rights and creating disgraceful working practices and dangerous imbalances."
"This new situation forces us no longer to view the world with the same detachment."
"We have to take note of the fact that this process of liberal, non-transparent and unfettered globalisation is of concern to our fellow citizens."
"Yet, who can hold it against them if they are afraid for their jobs, their future, their democracy and the environment of the planet on which they live?"
"No one."
"For what have we done to respond to these legitimate anxieties?"
"If I were to take the most recent example, that of the last UN Summit in New York, the results were disappointing."
"They were disappointing in terms both of the concrete commitments made towards the poorest countries and of the reform of the international institutions."
"Europe has to act in a coherent and credible fashion."
"Doing so at multilateral level is exemplary behaviour."
"That is why incorporating strict social and environmental standards into the rules of trade and checking that these standards are upheld in the bilateral agreements we sign, are priorities."
"Europe also has to act as an example internally."
"To do that, it has to improve its model, put in place a system of upwards social harmonisation, put a stop to the dismantling of public services and reject a market Europe."
"Europe provides an opportunity and a hope."
"It has to be the main actor in a different form of globalisation."
"Madam President, Commissioner, while I do agree with many of the views expressed in the report by our Slovene Member Mr Brejc, I am not with him every step of the way."
"You say that the Lisbon agenda will, in bringing together the social components, enable us to meet the challenges of globalisation."
"It will do no such thing!"
"The year is 2005; the period is halfway through."
"We have conducted a mid-term review, and expressed the criticism that these methods will not work on their own."
"To a large degree, globalisation has helped to create wealth, but – and this I say to Mr Hökmark – it has, equally, contributed to greater poverty, more exclusion, and to more social division, which does not, indeed, add up to equality and justice for all."
"Secondly, we should have more to say about the Gothenbourg Summit, for that is where the economic, social and ecological triad – to which I would like to see the protection of consumers added – was set in stone, for that, in fact, is our fundamental concern."
"Trade must, by definition, be free, but liberalisation alone will not move us forward, for we need environmental, labour and social standards, and it is only if we include these and take them on board that we really do have a chance of making trade fair across the globe."
"That is a world away from your approach, and it is for that reason that Hong Kong will, unfortunately, be a repeat of what we have seen before."
"If we get fixated on trade and take no account of the other social components, we will get nowhere."
"I think we would stand a chance if we were to enforce the global standards that already exist and limit imports into the European Union to those goods manufactured in accordance with them."
"To do so would help us and reverse the trend."
"Madam President, we live in a global environment and many of our political problems are tackled within a multilateral framework."
"This is clearly, therefore, the structure we should use in addressing global problems such as poverty."
"I welcome – as most people do – the recent initiative by the G8 to implement further the process of debt relief for the Third World."
"This is only right and proper, as debt relief is presently crippling many countries in the Third World."
"The Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative achieved moderate success in tackling debt relief for the 42 poorest countries in the world, but this was only an initial effort by the developed world to tackle the problem of debt relief itself."
"The European Union is the largest contributor of development aid in the world and therefore must continue to show real leadership when it comes to addressing humanitarian and development aid problems in the world."
"I also believe that the WTO is the best structure to open up competition in the industrial services and trading sectors."
"It is in all our interests that a multilateral framework be put in place to govern the trading relations of the 150 different members of the WTO at this time."
"It is therefore evident that tough decisions will have to be taken if a deal is to be reached in time for the Hong Kong ministerial round next month."
"I do not want to see a repeat of the Cancun round of WTO talks, which was a lost opportunity and, indeed, set progress back in this regard by at least two years."
"– Madam President, globalisation is an indisputable reality and an ongoing process."
"Congratulations to the Commission because it contributed to the setting up and the work of the committee which drafted the report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation and because it expressed the intention of making an efficient contribution to the monitoring of its work."
"The Commission communication for the report of the World Commission covers a broad spectrum of issues relating to the internal and external policies of the European Union, when it operates at global level."
"The rapporteur of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Brejc, deserves our praise because, in commenting on this communication, he has produced a basic report which has turned into an extended list of wishes and admonitions in order to highlight the basic objective of the two previous texts."
"The objective, of course, is the fairer distribution of the benefits of globalisation between the peoples of this planet and better forecasts of the costs which are often connected with sudden global changes."
"This broad wish list, both in the communication and in the Commission's report, must be incorporated by the Member States on a daily basis, both in their legislative and in their executive work."
"It rightly emphasises that the entire spectrum of education in developing countries is the basic means for creating quality jobs which will safeguard a better life for people in their country of birth, because another issue, apart from poverty, child labour and overworking by women, is the concern being expressed about the brain drain from developing countries, especially in the health professions."
"Let us, as European institutions, help to create the means of overseeing the multilateral system of the global economy and addressing cohesion and consistency between global economic, social and environmental policies."
"We here also take a positive view of the global action of social organisations in order to promote honest social governance and, more importantly, in connection with the guidelines of the OECD for multinational companies, which the Commission supports."
"The global area has a familiar name in Greek; it is called 'ecumene', a word from which the term ecology, care of the environment, is derived in numerous languages."
"However, its main, original meaning is the concept of the space populated by man and it reminds us of our obligation to link globalisation with compliance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the need for the basic labour rules of the International Labour Organisation to be mandatory."
"We have five years in the European Union to achieve the Lisbon Strategy, to make Europe the first power in the knowledge economy, with respect for the environment and promoting a new social model which we can propose globally."
"Madam President, business people like to talk about a win-win situation, a situation where everyone stands to gain."
"For millions of people in Europe and throughout the world, though, globalisation is not one."
"Some benefit, while others suffer its adverse effects – a win-lose situation, in other words."
"Although critics may question this, I think that we must try to turn globalisation into a win-win situation."
"Mr Brejc’s report contains a number of interesting proposals in order to achieve this."
"I endorse his appeal to use EU funds to alleviate the adverse effects of globalisation."
"It should be clear what is meant by this."
"We must not pump funds around needlessly and must not keep alive at all costs those industries that are doomed to fail anyway."
"Instead, we should free up funds to ensure that people who lose their jobs through globalisation are given the opportunity to find a job in another sector."
"It follows that the funds should be used to create new opportunities, rather than to needlessly prolong the suffering of insolvent sectors."
"In so far as that is what it is intended to do, I am pleased with the Commission’s proposal to set up a globalisation fund."
"This need not necessarily involve new funds."
"We could examine how existing funds could be redirected in order to get this globalisation fund off the ground. Clearly, something must be done."
"If we do nothing for the people who lose their jobs through globalisation, they will end up in a lose-lose situation."
"I am indebted to Mr Brejc for this report, which I think will galvanise us into action."
"We should put our money where our mouth is."
"Madam President, globalisation is here to stay and it is here to bring benefits."
"It is the role of legislators not to resist globalisation but to make sure its benefits reach as widely and deeply as possible."
"In this respect we should acknowledge and welcome the proactive role of the Commission in supporting the UN conclusions."
"I share with Mr Kułakowski the regret that the Presidency of the Council does not, apparently, regard this debate today as important enough to command the presence of a minister."
"The social dimension of globalisation is highly important, because globalisation brings with it change and all change is a challenge."
"Our role is surely to help our society equip itself and adapt to meet that challenge much more strongly."
"As Mr Crowley said so eloquently this evening, this is all about people."
"The original Brejc report addressed the subject sensitively and sensibly."
"Sadly, as so often in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, it now embodies amendments that are less sensitive and certainly less sensible."
"That is why we have to trouble the House to vote tomorrow to get closer to the original report and delete most of those amendments, except of course my own!"
"We cannot support the sudden suggestion to make CSR – corporate social responsibility – compulsory."
"We cannot support calls for exporting the EU social model as a condition of opening up world trade."
"We cannot support calls for increasing the EU budget."
"The PPE-DE Group has therefore put forward a number of amendments to remove these and other muddled messages."
"I very much hope that the House will support those revisions."
"If it does not, the UK Conservative delegation would agree with Mr Hökmark, as well as many other colleagues, and reluctantly vote to reject this report as it stands."
"We want to get back to a report about the social dimension, not just the Socialist dimension."
"– I am sorry for my colleague, however he is going to hear more about the socialist dimension, because that is what we want to see, that the people become the centre of attention."
"In Malta, my fellow workers are going through disastrous changes."
"Everyday they face a lack of work, and now, all of a sudden, we had the news that a factory employing eight hundred and fifty people to produce jeans is going to leave to start manufacturing outside the European Union."
"This means that in a small country like ours, with the thrust of a knife, suddenly we have 0.5% of our workforce losing their jobs in one single day."
"About two years ago these people had read in brochures that, if we entered the European Union, God willing, we would solve all the problems related to the challenge of globalisation, they promised them what they used to call a 'new spring'."
"Maybe we were not so popular because we used to tell them the truth, that we had to work everyday in order to be competitive."
"Now that we are members of the EU, though, we have to see that we put people before profits, that persons come before directives."
"Some would say that this cannot be done because of our rules; in that case, Commissioner, we have to change the rules."
". Ladies and gentlemen, this debate has brought home how complex and multifaceted the issue of globalisation is, and how difficult it is to find clear-cut solutions to this problem."
"I believe that the debate has also provided clear confirmation of something that we had in fact all suspected, namely that globalisation has been underway for a relatively long time, or in other words at least 300-400 years."
"It is also apparent that this process will continue apace, and that an interconnected world whose inhabitants are in close contact with each other has become a part of our lives."
"There is therefore an urgent need to give globalisation a human face and a social dimension."
"There is also no getting away from the fact that it is impossible to find a straightforward solution or a single initiative that could solve the entire problem."
"Nevertheless, I believe that it is crucially important that the European Union has decided to turn its attention to the social dimension of globalisation, and to promote it in close cooperation with the United Nations and, in particular, the International Labour Organisation."
"This approach is capable of delivering results, and I believe that it is very much the right one to take, even though the results may only be incomplete in certain cases."
"It was with great interest that I listened to this debate, and I will also be very interested to follow developments regarding the report that has been drafted and the structure of the amendments that will be adopted."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Globalisation – the expanding network of relationships and increasing interdependence among the peoples of the modern world – is having the effect of bringing the world ever closer together due to the rapid development of technology, transport, telecommunications and computer science."
"People say that the world is getting smaller, and that it will soon become one village, although others believe it would be truer to say that a very narrow section of the social elite of the world are growing closer to each other, while the majority are increasingly excluded from opportunities."
"It is debatable whether what we are seeing is globalisation or an increasing divide between richer and poorer sections of society on a global scale."
"Globalisation can be turned to both good use and bad."
"However, a detailed analysis of economic processes reveals that the poorest peoples of the world are those who are excluded from the process of globalisation, while countries that claim their share in the international division of labour have seen an increase in their national income."
"Given that two of the most populous countries of the world, China and India, are among the latter, globalisation has in fact helped the majority of the world’s poor to achieve a higher standard of living."
"All indications suggest that isolation from globalisation brings greater risks in terms of poverty effects than if a country participates in globalisation."
"Globalisation must benefit everyone."
"For this to happen, strong international institutions are needed to ensure sustainable development."
"What is needed in Europe and throughout the world is to establish clear roles linked to clear deadlines."
"The external and internal policies of the EU, its social model and its development at international level could also serve to other regions of the world as a model of ethical globalisation with a positive impact."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (O-0083/2005 B6-0333/2005) by Mr Chichester and Mrs Barsi-Pataky, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the digital switchover."
". Mr President, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy of the European Parliament has been following very closely the process of switching from terrestrial analogue broadcasting to digital broadcasting in Europe."
"As a vitally important resource, the frequency spectrum must be utilised efficiently."
"Europe must not lag behind in this regard."
"In other words, if we want to achieve the Lisbon goals and be a part of the innovation in this area too, then we must not lag behind with the switchover."
"We therefore support the fact that the Commission has proposed 2012 as the target year for switching off analogue broadcasting throughout Europe."
"The European Parliament therefore calls upon the Member States to give their full support to this schedule, while at the same time aiming to keep the transitional period of ‘simulcasting’ as short as possible."
"The digital switchover will be a success if it is carried out in a coordinated manner."
"We therefore propose that the Commission establish a European Digital Working Party – perhaps within the existing structures – with a view to ensuring that the switchover takes place in as coordinated a manner as possible."
"We propose that this Working Party have the task of monitoring the progress of Member States and coordinating their objectives and regulations."
"It should initiate discussion and consultation between Member States and market players."
"The European Parliament believes that the digital switchover will bring tangible benefits if the additional frequency spectrum released as a result of the change in technology is reallocated on a flexible basis and at European level."
"We need to make a timely start as regards working on the question of how to make the best use of the frequency spectrum dividend."
"In this context I am also referring to the potential it offers for new pan-European services, as in the case of the transport sector, to mention only one of many examples."
"The aforementioned Working Party would provide an appropriate framework for this."
"In order to ensure that the switchover has the desired results, it is impossible to overstate the need for technological neutrality and interoperability, which is one of the pillars of European innovation in this field."
"We also call upon Member States to ensure that the switchover process and reallocation of the spectrum dividend are impartial, transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory."
"The European Parliament believes that the transition will be a success if European citizens have access to the most advanced technology for receiving digital broadcasts, for example technology comprising a Multimedia Home Platform or an open Embedded Panel Interface (EPI)."
"This will help prevent vertical bottlenecks."
"In order to ensure access to these technologies for all European citizens, it may be necessary to subsidise them at national level, in accordance with Community law."
"We must ensure that a digital divide is not allowed to develop between different regions of Europe."
"Indeed, we must ensure that the opposite is the case."
"We call upon the Commission to publish and present models of best practice with regard to financing aspects."
"The switchover will not only bring economic dividends, but also better and more sophisticated services for European citizens if the social and cultural challenges relating to it are met."
"For instance, public service platforms could be the standard-bearers of the digital switchover."
"We propose that the common position we need to agree on at the Regional Radiocommunication Conference in 2006 (RRC06) should include a provision making the transitional period for third countries as short as possible."
"The European Parliament is confident that the December meeting of the Council will take Parliament’s views into consideration in arriving at a decision on the tasks that lie ahead."
". Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has undertaken to accelerate the transition to digital broadcasting at EU level, and to structure this process in such a way that there is no distortion of competition."
"The aim is to switch off analogue signals by the beginning of 2012 at the latest, and to ensure that the spectrum released by this switch-off is used in such a way that society will derive the maximum possible benefits."
"Furthermore, the Commission aims to ensure that society can begin to use this spectrum for hybrid television and telecommunications services, or for services that are unrelated to radio or television broadcasting."
"The transition to digital broadcasting is gathering pace in the European Union."
"Spain recently brought forward the date for switching off analogue terrestrial television signals by two years, from 2012 to 2010, while Germany has brought it forward by three years, from 2010 to 2007."
"Ten Member States have set a date of 2010 or earlier for switch-off, whereas a further 10 have set a date of 2012."
"Five Member States, as well as Bulgaria and Romania, have not yet decided on a date for switch-off, and Poland, Ireland and Bulgaria have now indicated that they may find it difficult to achieve switch-off in 2012."
"On the basis of this information, the Commission expects that transition in the European Union as a whole should be well underway by the beginning of 2010, and that the overwhelming majority of Member States should have switched off analogue terrestrial television signals by 2012."
"With regard to the prevention of interference from analogue systems based outside Europe, the Commission is in favour of reaching an international agreement to abolish legal protection for use of the analogue broadcasting spectrum by 2015."
"Such prompt action should encourage countries that do not belong to the European Union either to switch off their analogue systems or, at the very least, to re-open negotiations with neighbouring EU Member States in order to keep interference with digital systems to a minimum."
"The international community’s future approach to planning should ensure that new broadcasting and non-broadcasting services can operate in the same bands."
"From the outset, the Commission has called for maximum technical flexibility, and for consideration to be given to the possibility of making part of any spectrum dividend available on a pan-European basis for future innovative services."
"Europe lends its full backing to research and development through its IST Framework Programmes, which fund research into new supporting technologies that will facilitate the implementation of convergence services."
"To cite but one example of a newly implemented service, the Community has funded a number of research and development projects on interactive television."
"The latter has been used as a basis for providing e-government information services to Italian citizens."
"Furthermore, the development of digital radio came about thanks to a consortium set up under the aegis of an EU research programme."
"Digital radio signals can now broadcast in all analogue spectrum bands, and several digital stations can be broadcast in hi-fi quality in the same spectrum that was previously used for one analogue station."
"If I may, I should like to comment briefly on the motion for a resolution."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament is in favour of accelerating the transition and setting the beginning of 2012 as the date by which analogue broadcasts should have been switched off in all Member States, as proposed by the Commission."
"In view of the fact that you are adopting this resolution today, I cannot now respond directly to all the issues dealt with in detail in this extensive document."
"The European Commission will give careful consideration to the scope of its competence with regard to policy formulation on new and innovative services that will be operated in the spectrum bands originally used for analogue services."
"At present, the majority of highly innovative services in this field are still at the research and development stage, and as such are supported through the Commission’s research programmes."
"In the long term, there will be a considerable need for assessments of the technical and commercial viability of these services."
"Spectrum-related issues will be a major focus of the Commission’s work in this field."
"Such issues will also be the subject of thorough debate with the Member States as part of the ongoing work of the Communications Committee, its sub-groups for radio and television broadcasting, the Radio Spectrum Committee and the Radio Spectrum Policy Group."
"Problems relating to vertical integration and significant market power are dealt with under the regulatory framework."
"The wholesale market for the transmission of radio and television signals has been translated into a list of relevant markets, and appropriate regulatory measures are being taken to address SMP problems."
"The Commission is currently drafting a communication on the interoperability of interactive television, which it intends to adopt by the end of the year."
"Within the framework of its decisions on state subsidies, the Commission also issues guidelines on certain aspects of the funding of the transition to digital broadcasting."
"EU legislation makes a clear distinction between the regulation of electronic transmissions and the regulation of their content."
"Parliament believes that this clear distinction should be maintained, and the Commission considers this approach to be extremely helpful."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will allow me, in the short time that is available to me, to draw your attention to two aspects of this digital switchover, starting with the open standards, to which, obviously, Mrs Barsi-Pataky has already made reference."
"I would remind the Commissioner that the Commission itself decided, in March, that the national governments should foot the bill for pilot projects, for example, but also for the purchase of set-top boxes for individual consumers."
"I wonder if you should not make this more specific in the sense that you need to indicate that such financial support, or subsidy, is only possible for set-top boxes with a so-called open standard, mainly to avoid two things."
"The object should be to avoid putting consumers to great expense twice and also to avoid one or other industrial partner deliberately engineering bottlenecks, because if one thing is clear, Commissioner, it is that this new way of watching television digitally will push up the cost for the consumer."
"That is why it is crucial that we agree on a basic package of channels that are accessible to everyone both now and in future."
"I take it that you share our view that providers must, in future, be required to offer their customers the basic channels of the national stations."
"What is known as must-carry should not get in the way of the digital switchover; on the contrary, it is, in our eyes, a guarantee for maximum distribution."
"Secondly, with regard to pluralism and diversity, there is, as you referred to a moment ago, the risk that the switchover to digital technology will result in the new markets being controlled by dominant players."
"That is why, in the draft resolution adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, we explicitly ask you to ensure that the new digital market will not fall within the exclusive control of one or other multinational."
"The text reads as follows: ‘the majority, or an appropriate part, of the new broadcasting possibilities and broadcasters should not come under the exclusive control or decisive influence of multinational media undertakings’."
"This should become one of the Commission’s priorities in this whole process of change."
"There is no need for me to make the link to the directive on television without frontiers, as we will be discussing this either by the end of this year or the beginning of next."
"In that area too, it is important to ensure that the national markets do not get into the hands of one dominant player to a disproportionate, and therefore unhealthy, degree."
"In that debate, Commissioner Špidla, the Commission must side with the consumer."
"I truly hope that you will not resort to the argument of subsidiarity all too easily in order to avoid your responsibility, because that argument is, to my mind, a totally inappropriate one to use."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group endorses this own-initiative motion, and also the question to the Commission, to which a clear answer has been given, and I hope that this common strategy will enable us to make headway."
"I have been a Member of this House for quite some time and can remember many attempts being made at this."
"I also recall the problems to which Mr Belet has just referred."
"Technological neutrality is a very important term where competition is concerned."
"We had this sort of problem several years ago, when we realised and addressed that the importance of frequency interference with analog broadcasting, could even, to some extent, hamper our development."
"I believe we must give a great deal of attention to ensuring that it does not do so."
"Along with our group, though, I think it very important that the point again be made that we have to succeed in informing the consumers, the public in the European Union, in a transparent, frank and fair manner, and in good time, for it is they who are meant, in due course, to buy and use this technology, and it is their fears that need to be allayed and their resistance that has to be overcome."
"If you go, as I do from time to time, into the relevant shops, you can see what the manufacturers have on offer, for the digital television sets are there already."
"The customers have a look at them; they watch a digital-format DVD and enthuse about the picture quality, and then they see an analog TV programme on the same screen and are astonished at how great the difference is."
"I believe that, if the public are told about the benefits and are given details of when this changeover is to take place, and if the industry aims for market penetration by charging fair prices for these devices, I am optimistic that we will, by 2010, have caught up with our competitors in this field in other parts of the world."
"What I do see as important, though, is that we make sure that we do not miss the boat when taking our people into the digital era."
"Quite apart from that, let me say how grateful I am for the customary warm, close and good cooperation with Mrs Barsi-Pataky."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate concerns an official sector which relates directly to the Lisbon objectives."
"Europe must bridge the gap which separates it from its competitors."
"The Commission proposal for a common target date has precisely this objective."
"Nonetheless, I see the following dimensions or problems:"
"The first dimension, the cross-border dimension, was also highlighted by the Commissioner."
"Given that digital switchover in our neighbouring countries affects European digital integration, due to frequency coordination problems, my question is: what measures does the Commission intend to take and what agreements does it intend to conclude in order to help neighbouring countries, so that they too can make the digital switchover?"
"Similarly, within the framework of accession negotiations with candidate countries, will the intention of these countries to proceed with the necessary measures, agreements and commitments be examined?"
"The second dimension is the geographical dimension."
"The choice of technology, the cost of installation and operation and the implementation timetable also depend to a large degree on the geography of a country."
"For example, coverage of mountain and island areas entails more difficulties than coverage of plains."
"Consequently, does the Commission consider that there is a need to promote digital cohesion actions in order to bridge the so-called digital divide?"
"My final question is: can we justify subsidising specific technologies, such as set-top boxes, rather than other available technologies?"
"Does this not contradict the principle of technological neutrality?"
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it hardly pays for us to doubt these benefits, but do not let us forget the problems."
"Something I wish to address is the tangle of problems relating to public institutions."
"What will happen in our schools and hospitals?"
"What will happen in old people’s homes?"
"In some places thousands of televisions or digiboxes may have to be replaced."
"Moreover, the social sector is one where resources are never enough."
"My country will have moved into the digital age by 2007."
"That is a considerable advantage."
"In some countries these large public institutions are finding it hard to face up to this situation."
"It is unthinkable that the sick or elderly would have to give up their televisions as a source of entertainment, even though they might not always need new digital services."
"Schools, too, are in difficulties."
"If schools are not so progressive as to have broadband, via which they can receive digital services, then they are going to have problems."
"In other words, by that time all schools would have to be digitalised."
"Technological development is normally seen as an economic benefit and not a social or cultural one, something I have a problem with."
"Our society has changed."
"If we look at schoolchildren, their world of play is quite different from what we ever did."
"If, on the other hand, we consider young people, they are certainly interactive, but with the world, and not necessarily with their neighbours."
"Consequently, our knowledge-based economy may become an economy of incomprehension, because of us, not because of young people or children."
"Mr President, here in this House, we have a lot to say about issues relating to technology."
"What we are talking about now, though, is broadcasting. Broadcasting is not just technology; it is fundamental to three areas in our society that should be important to us: culture, social cohesion and the development of democracy."
"That is why it is not enough to talk only about technology."
"Technology is very important; being the engine of the digital revolution in broadcasting, it is also the engine for the creation of urgently-needed jobs with good prospects."
"It is for that reason, though, that broadcasting is both a cultural and an economic asset."
"I appeal to the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to take broadcasting’s ambivalence and duality more seriously than it has done in its previous papers and communications."
"It is for that reason that I welcome the resolution from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and very much hope that we will, in future, be able to develop cooperation between it and the Committee for Culture and Education."
"The resolution is a very good basis on which to do that, and I urge the Commission to take it seriously if it really does want to accomplish the changeover in the next few years."
"There is a pressing need for policy goals setting out how this is to be done, not only in terms of the technology involved, but also of cultural, social and democratic cooperation."
"If you really do want to empower the Member States to do that, then issues of subsidies and of European competition law need to be resolved as a matter of urgency."
"It will be apparent to the House that we take this resolution very seriously, and we urge the Commission, for the public’s sake, to do likewise."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like, in this debate, to stress what I consider to be important and what has not yet been said: the European Commission must lead the research and development activities of the new innovative services, so that we can place Europe in a position of technological leadership on a pan-European scale."
"That is why I believe it is so important that we establish political objectives that clearly define the guarantees, so that the services we are talking about can become as widespread as possible, but, above all, for the benefit of the citizens, of the consumers and also, of course, economic development."
"It is therefore important to maintain the date of 2012 for the changeover from analogue to digital, so that Europe is not left behind, because our competitors have set much earlier dates: the United States, 2009, South Korea, 2010, and Japan, 2011."
"This requires that we coordinate our efforts so that the countries are genuinely committed."
"As you have pointed out quite rightly, my country, Spain, has brought the date forward, as have certain others, but we must all continue to work in the same direction, because, the longer the transitional period lasts, the more harm will be done to the television broadcasters, the receiver industry, the manufacturing and marketing industry, the distribution sector and, above all, the citizens themselves."
"I would finally like to stress that, if the conversion is to be a success, it is very important for the Commission and the Member States to ensure two things in particular: on the one hand, that the significant digital divide in our society is closed, and on the other, that there should be no monopolies, because, if there are any, this transformation will not be possible."
"Mr President, my household is a fairly typical European household: we have a TV set in the sitting room, one in the kitchen, one in our bedroom and one for the grandchildren when they visit."
"We subscribe to Sky Digital by satellite, which costs around GBP 40 – EUR 60 – a month, and we pay our TV licence for the BBC public service channels."
"Even though there are hundreds of digital channels, we will be able to view only one digital channel at a time on all these sets because we have only one viewing card."
"At the moment, while my wife watches ‘Extreme Makeover’ and our grandchildren view the cartoon channel on digital, I can still get the news on one of the five analogue channels."
"After the switchover – which is only two or three years away now in the UK – we will be stuck with only one channel at a time unless we pay for extra decryption boxes and cards."
"To cover all the interests in a typical household, this could require up to four or five cards."
"The cost could be GBP 200 – EUR 300 – a month; GBP 2 000 – EUR 3 000 – a year over and above the licence fee."
"It is essential that the Commission ensure that the digital service providers, such as Sky, allow multiple-channel choice in each household at reasonable cost and that they do not make the multiple choice that digital can offer so absurdly expensive that it cannot be availed of."
"I therefore ask the Commissioner: what will you do about the availability and cost of multiple channels in each household?"
"What will you do to ensure monopoly positions are not unreasonably exploited and what will you do to mitigate the cost of even a single set changeover from analogue to digital for the less well off and the socially vulnerable?"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, digital television offers a series of benefits to viewers: improved picture quality, better sound, better reception of the picture through mobile and portable devices and interactive services."
"At the same time, digital television improves access for people with special needs, such as people with impaired hearing or vision, by providing auxiliary services such as better subtitling, sound commentary and sign commentary."
"That is why it is imperative to make the switchover to digital television by no later than 2012, so that we do not fall behind our main competitors, the United States of America and Japan, countries which intend to stop analogue broadcasting in 2009 and 2011 respectively."
"However, apart from this, the switchover to digital television and the concomitant cessation of analogue broadcasting will also result in the freeing of analogue frequencies, which can then be used for new, innovative services."
"The freeing of frequencies must be accompanied by policies which aim to increase pluralism, especially cultural diversity, in the retransmission of European and independent productions."
"Our objective must be television programmes which will highlight in a qualitative manner the educational, cultural and informative mission of television."
"Mr President, I very much welcome this initiative by Parliament and by our colleagues in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"I asked to make a short statement at the end because last Friday I was invited to participate in a conference held by the British regulator Ofcom under the auspices of the Presidency."
"One of the major issues on the agenda of that conference was spectrum regulation and management, particularly in the context of the so-called digital dividend – in the phraseology that some will have used this evening – which relates to the releasing of high-quality radio frequency spectrum as a result of the switchover to digital television."
"Parliament needs to pay far more attention to the issue of how radio spectrum will be allocated and managed across the European Union, because it is clearly important that we have some alignment of goals there."
"Member States are already making decisions about how that digital dividend should be spent."
"Some people, including the last speaker, have talked about the fact that there will be a unique conjunction of events, in that the same pieces of spectrum will become available in every European country."
"In the interests of creating a more active market for digital content and breaking away from some of the artificial constraints that we have at the moment in relation to national boundaries for digital content, there are certainly opportunities that we must take, but in order to do so we need to generate ideas that will encourage Member States to take advantage of them."
"We are not seeing many such ideas bubbling up so far."
"I think there is a lot of work for this Parliament to do."
"I therefore welcome Mrs Barsi-Pataky's initiative in the Committee on Industry, but I hope you will agree that this is just the beginning."
"First of all we must disseminate the importance of digital switchover; secondly, we must sensitise our colleagues to its fundamental economic importance and, thirdly, we must start to tackle politically the issue of how we deal with spectrum allocation and the digital dividend."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for the debate."
"The word ‘revolution’ cropped up during it, and quite rightly so in my opinion, since the transition to digital broadcasting is a revolution of sorts, and any major technical transition on a similar scale has widespread consequences."
"The development of human civilisation has after all been closely tied to developments in the field of information processing."
"Traditional forms of information were followed by the written word, which in turn was followed by the mass dissemination of information."
"The latest stage in the process, and the one we have currently reached, is the electronic dissemination of information, but we are already moving towards the next steps, one of which will unquestionably be artificial intelligence."
"Each of these radical changes has had or will have a wide range of consequences, and you approached this possibility from a great many angles during the debate."
"There are two points I should like to highlight."
"Firstly, the approach adopted by the Commission is based on the scope of its competences."
"The aim is therefore to find a technical and organisational solution to the problem at hand, rather than to deal with the issue of content."
"It is generally acknowledged that this solution will increase opportunities and improve quality, and it is also likely that it will cut costs."
"I expect, and indeed take it as read, that the various stages of this debate will continue until 2012."
"We place a great value on this process, since it is impossible to take up a position or to find a flexible solution for a change of this magnitude without genuine democratic debate."
"For all that, I believe that the keynote phrase which the Commission has used and which I used in my introductory speech will continue to hold true, namely ensuring that the spectrum released by the switch-off of analogue transmissions is used in such a way that society derives the maximum possible benefits."
"Pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received one motion for a resolution at the end of this debate(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on this motion for a resolution will take place on Wednesday."
"The next item is the Commission statement on ‘Secret detention centres’ in Europe."
"Mr President, following allegations, reported in certain influential newspapers, of the existence of clandestine jails run by the CIA in some European Union Member States and also in some accession candidate countries, the Commission would like to point out that a significant number of Member States and candidate countries have issued public statements categorically denying the accusations."
"There has not, so far, been any confirmation or legal proof of such allegations."
"This type of situation – and here we need to be perfectly clear – would, if it proved to be true, constitute a serious breach of the European Union’s principles, not to mention the laws, including the criminal laws, of Member States, which prohibit events and situations of the type described."
"The Commission would like to point out that, under Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the Union was founded – and operates – on democratic principles and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the rule of law, of course."
"These principles are also universally shared by the national legislations of the Member States, whose criminal laws forbid the violation of fundamental and human rights."
"It is therefore obvious that the Member States are required to comply with these principles; however, they are also bound to respect international legal obligations, especially those arising under the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and under the Convention for the Prevention of Torture."
"It is also clear – as we are all aware – that when a candidate country completes its accession process, the State concerned, in order to qualify for EU membership, must have achieved a level of institutional stability which guarantees total respect for democracy, the rule of law and human rights, and the safeguarding of all fundamental freedoms."
"This principle was established by the Copenhagen European Council as far back as 1993, and therefore constitutes one of the pillars of the so-called Copenhagen"
"In view of these principles, we obviously consider it vital that Member States and candidate countries investigate the grounds for these press allegations in an appropriate manner, using all legal means available."
"The Commission welcomes the recent decision of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly to examine the allegation that secret jails exist in Europe, and we have asked the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly to keep us informed of future developments in this extremely serious and sensitive matter."
"The Commission will continue to monitor these allegations closely."
"We shall do this at the level of Member States as regards compliance with European legislation, and at an international level, with particular reference to any initiatives the US authorities may decide to take in relation to this whole matter."
"I can conclude by giving my personal assurance and that of the Commission that Parliament will be kept informed and engaged in dialogue at all times in relation to developments on this issue."
". – Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Frattini, I very much appreciated your speech and in particular your assurances to the Chamber that no EU country is involved in this outrage."
"You will understand, however, that we shall not feel safe until we are certain that no EU country is involved in the disgraceful decision to host detention centres in which detainees are subject to inhuman acts of cruelty and torture."
"Let there be no doubt: we all stand shoulder to shoulder with countries that have suffered directly from violent acts of terrorism, such as the United States, Spain, the United Kingdom, or any other."
"We share the determination to combat international terrorism, but feel that every step must be taken in respect of human rights and the primacy of the rule of law."
"Contrary to what some people might think, this is not a sign of our weakness, but rather of our resoluteness. It lends international legitimacy to the fight against terrorism, by setting out clearly what separates us from the terrorists, namely respect for human life and for people’s fundamental rights."
"Mr Frattini referred to the international axis, to which all EU countries are committed."
"The international rules in the various conventions are clear on the circumstances of detention, and on the obligation to give prisoners a fair trial, in front of a competent, impartial and independent court."
"It is disturbing that almost four years after the UN first requested access to the Guantanamo prison to investigate human rights, this continues to be refused by the US authorities or subject to unacceptable conditions, as reiterated by Mr Rumsfeld a few days ago."
"Once again, as we saw with regard to the Echelon report, there is a difference between the behaviour of the US administration and the Senate."
"Mr Frattini rightly praised the Council and the initiative of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"At this point, I should like to highlight two US Senate initiatives that I wholeheartedly welcome."
"The first is that of Senator John McCain, which strengthens prisoners’ rights, and the second was proposed by Senator John Kerry, to launch an investigation into the revelations of secret prisons in which torture is apparently permitted, something that we condemn in the strongest terms."
". Mr President, Mr Frattini, a few national newspapers have, in actual fact, addressed this problem including, in particular, ‘The Washington Post’, which recently announced in its columns that secret prisons, run by the CIA, were allegedly located on EU territory and, more precisely, in Eastern Europe."
"The newspaper did not name the countries concerned, for security reasons, but let us note that an investigation led by the Human Rights Watch organisation indicated that, in 2002, a number of ‘ghost’ prisoners were in fact detained by the CIA."
"Let us recall that the US Congress has also published a report referring to dubious practices employed by the United States when transferring prisoners to third countries with a view to having recourse to acts of torture during interrogations."
"Moreover, we are extremely concerned by the recent allegations indicating that the Bush Administration wants the US Congress to exempt the CIA from the ban on all forms of abuse of detainees."
"We need these revelations to be placed under an intense spotlight."
"As you have said, it is not acceptable, in fact, to have areas of lawlessness in Europe and in the world."
"Hence we, in this Chamber, have always opposed the use of a legal vacuum in relation to the treatment inflicted on the Guantanamo Bay prisoners."
"Under no circumstances can we therefore allow such prisons to exist in Europe."
"If the allegations are proven, then what is going on needs to be stopped immediately."
"If they are not proven, then the evidence needs to be gathered in order to silence the rumours."
"We therefore call on the Commission to carry out an investigation into these allegations as, I might add, you recently pledged to do in front of the press, Mr Frattini."
"The results of this investigation must, as I think you will agree, be presented to the Members of the European Parliament."
"What measures does the Commission intend to adopt in order to ensure that the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and in particular Article 4 thereof, are properly upheld throughout the territory of the European Union?"
"The best way to combat the fanatics and the terrorists, as we have already said – and it is not a useless exercise to repeat this – is indeed to pit our values of freedom and of the protection of fundamental rights against them."
". Mr President, as Human Rights Watch recalled a year ago, disappearances were a trademark abuse of Latin American military dictatorships in their dirty war on alleged subversion."
"Now they have become a United States tactic in pursuit of al-Qa’ida."
"Illegal detention without charge or trial in Guantanamo Bay or Iraq is bad enough, but secret detention, where people are kept incommunicado with no access to lawyers and at the mercy of mistreatment or torture, is the blackest of black holes."
"We see the US Congress now seeking to bar claims for habeas corpus and President Bush and his henchmen trying to stifle the McCain Amendment which would ban inhuman treatment of US detainees."
"In those circumstances, if a credible newspaper and a credible human rights NGO allege that secret war-on-terror jails exist in Eastern Europe, and specifically in Poland and Romania, what do we do?"
"We all agree that it would be devastating to the EU’s reputation and credibility if those allegations were found to be true."
"Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty stipulate the need to respect human rights and the rule of law."
"Commissioner Frattini says there is no evidence, but what has he done to try and find out?"
"When the allegations came out ten days ago, we were told that Member States would be informally questioned, that technical experts from the relevant directorate would be in contact with their counterparts in the 25 Member States, plus 4 candidate countries."
"Then we learned that such an examination did not amount to an investigation."
"I am not impugning the good faith of the Polish and Romanian governments, but we know that secret intelligence services sometimes have their own agenda."
"I am left with a sense of unease and residual doubt when respected organisations have made allegations, but we cannot honestly say they have been thoroughly investigated."
"All our mechanisms in the EU for ensuring that human rights standards are respected are frankly inadequate: no peer review, no monitoring, no enforcement."
"The weakness of your Commission, Mr Frattini, was brought out in your remarks."
"The precedents are not encouraging."
"The EU failed to establish a common stance, let alone any joint initiatives, to press the US to release our own citizens from Guantanamo Bay."
"The US went around Eastern and South Eastern Europe penalising countries with loss of military aid if they refused to sign opt-outs from the International Criminal Court for US personnel."
"The EU did not offer to pay the difference."
"I want you to insist that this matter be put on the agenda of the next General Affairs Council and of the summit in December."
"This matter needs to be taken up at a political level in order to ensure that the legal guarantees that the EU is meant to offer are fully respected."
"Mr President, I believe that we have done well to instigate this debate, because what Mr Frattini has told us is slightly different from what was initially announced and because you will at least recognise that, if such mysteriously named places – black sites, salt mines containing ‘ghost prisoners’, etc. – do actually exist, then Article 6 of the Treaty and the Treaty itself would be given short shrift."
"The debate is a first step."
"I believe that you will be called on to take further steps as regards this issue."
"Why?"
"Because this is an extremely important issue."
"It is a question of people who have allegedly been detained, without first having been tried, for an unspecified length of time and without any appeal whatsoever, and who are therefore in all likelihood subjected to torture and inhumane and degrading treatment."
"We therefore have potential violations here of Articles 3, 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as potential violations of the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights."
"The latest news is that two countries, one belonging to the European Union and the other in the process of joining the EU, are cited as having housed such centres."
"I say ‘having’ housed, since these countries are today denying these acts of which they are accused and because the reports in question date back to 2002 and 2003."
"What they are denying is taking place today could therefore be compatible with the facts presented in the reports, and particularly in the report by the Human Rights Watch, but the fact of recognising that the potential existence of such centres can constitute a violation of the Treaty on the European Union and Article 6 thereof calls for you to do more than just issue statements, Commissioner."
"You say that you are leaving the matter in the hands of the Member States."
"You say that you are going to examine closely the investigation expedited by the Council of Europe;"
"I will tell you, by the way, that the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights has already decided to invite Mr Marty as soon as his work has been handed over."
"You say that you are waiting to see what the United States itself decides on this issue and you have expressed your desire for investigations to be carried out at a technical level."
"I, for my part, believe that all that is far from adequate."
"Quite simply, Commissioner, you must expedite an investigation in order to shed light on this situation, which is detrimental to the foundations of the European Union and to its credibility on the international stage."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-President Frattini reminds me – and this is not intended as an insult – of those famous monkeys which see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil."
"He has spoken, however, although he did not even have the courage to say that what is really at issue are not hidden jails in general, but genuine torture chambers made available to the CIA and the United States by some European countries."
"Commissioner Frattini, you are denying the obvious."
"You are denying something that even reliable US sources have admitted."
"We want you to conduct an investigation, but if there is no desire to find the evidence, the evidence will never be found."
"Commissioner, you are perhaps unaware that in Milan, on 17 February 2003, Abu Omar, the former Imam of the mosque in via Jenner, was kidnapped, and that the magistrates in Milan, having found incontrovertible proof that the CIA was directly responsible, have requested the extradition of 22 US intelligence agents."
"What stand did the Commission take when faced with this evidence?"
"What did it actually do, in the light of this breach of sovereign rights, to force the US authorities to comply with the conventions on human rights and torture?"
"The Commission did nothing."
"In the light of this experience, I am not optimistic about the results of any future action that the European Commission is likely to take."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it may well be the case that the issue we are debating also concerns my own country, Poland."
"The Polish Government has issued an official statement denying that there are any prisons of this kind in Poland."
"It says a lot that the statement makes no direct reference to the past, however."
"Further investigation is therefore needed into the matter."
"The former Minister for National Defence has denied reports that al-Qaeda terrorists are being held in special prisons in our country, but he did so during a radio interview in a manner once favoured by the Soviet news agency TASS."
"Anything denied by the latter was effectively confirmed as true."
"At the same time, however, I would call on the Members of the House to keep a sense of proportion during this debate."
"The war against terror is essential and we must be unyielding and resolute in fighting it, but it must be guided by public opinion."
"There are two extremes that I firmly believe we must avoid."
"The first of these is the attitude that the end justifies the means, and that even democratic values and human rights should be sacrificed in the fight against international terrorism."
"This must not be allowed to happen."
"Yet we must also ensure that the Western world and the values we uphold are not left in a state of paralysis."
"I believe that these two extremes should be eschewed, and it would be regrettable if either were to gain ascendancy in the European Parliament or in any EU institution."
"I believe that this Chamber is the right place to say loud and clear, without hesitation, that the war on terror will be fought hard and ruthlessly, but that it will be guided by public opinion."
"In this way it will gain a public mandate and public legitimacy in the free West."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view a complex and multi-faceted problem such as terrorism cannot be tackled with a single, one-dimensional strategy."
"Citizens of a sovereign State or States have a legitimate right to live in peace, devoting their lives to their work, to their families and to their freely-chosen lifestyle."
"Wars have been – and still are – critical periods in the life of society; they upset all the normal benchmarks, but they involve precise military positions, clearly-delineated battlefields, a visible enemy and rules of engagement."
"Terrorism, on the other hand, does not follow the rules of official war, does not only involve the military and does not operate on the battlefield."
"It uses underhand tactics to strike the innocent at home, when and where they are least expecting it, with no specific aim, no social purpose and no values."
"It is obvious that everyone must respect the rules, laws and sovereignty of the State."
"It is undeniable that we all need to uphold not only the most elementary human rights but also the principles underlying all civil society and all relationships between nations."
"However, before levelling accusations at what are undoubtedly democratic countries, we must firstly have full knowledge of the facts and circumstances."
"We also need to think of the families of the defenceless victims of terrorism in recent years, and of the millions of citizens who are still living under the threat of attack."
"We cannot use kid gloves to fight terrorism, but nor can we throw accusations at democratic countries solely on the basis of conjecture."
"Faced with a choice between terrorism and democracy, I believe we would all choose democracy."
"Mr President, we should allow the courts to do their job without looking for grounds to ascribe blame to countries which certainly do not deserve it."
"I agree with the position of Commissioner Frattini and hope that, here in Parliament, we shall only make decisions in this matter once we can be sure we are acting democratically."
"– Mr President, the CIA keeps a network of secret detention centres throughout the world."
"At the same time, the United States have accepted the use of a 'renditions' policy, in order to take people, even European citizens, for interrogation at locations of which we are ignorant."
"The president of the USA is today threatening to veto the bill adopted by the American Senate in order to impose what was – until a few years ago at least – the obvious; in other words, the fact that international law must be applied to persons arrested by the United States anywhere in the world."
"All this in 2005, by a large country, by a country with a long democratic tradition, by a country which insists every year in publishing a report on human rights and lambasting other states around the world for violating them."
"The policy of the USA affects us all, irrespective of whether these centres are located on European territory."
"The terrorist argument of double standards in European societies is something they pray for so that they can enlist new terrorists, so that they can undermine our policy."
"Shall we allow them to do so?"
"What were inconceivable questions before the discovery of the US detention centres must be asked."
"One of these questions is: are there today Member States of the European Union or candidate countries which keep such centres?"
"Secondly, are there today Member States of the European Union or candidate countries which send their detainees to US detention centres?"
"Where do they supposedly wash their hands, while using this network for their detainees?"
"This must be answered."
"Thirdly, have the USA sent people snatched from Europe to these detention centres?"
"In fighting terrorism, the objective is not to sanctify any means."
"Let us Europeans not create a European-inspired Frankenstein which we cannot control and let us not allow any other country to do the same."
"Mr President, Commissioner, all of this information is overly detailed and convincing, and you too speak in such a convincing manner that it is almost tempting not to believe you."
"The commitment you have made here to investigate this situation is therefore laudable, but it does not reassure us."
"We expect the Commission and the Council to act firmly and not to be content with nothing more than fine words or denials by politicians expressed at cocktail parties."
"We expect genuine action and investigation."
"Commissioner, on the orders of the public prosecutor, the police on the island of Mallorca are investigating the illegal transportation of prisoners; it has taken great efforts to do so, but nevertheless, all of the police investigations are moving in exactly the same direction as previous journalistic investigations."
"And all without any support from the United States."
"I would ask you to demand similar investigations by all of the countries which may allegedly be involved in this situation."
"I would insist, political denials using vague words about the present, that say nothing about the past and which are simply intended to evade responsibility, are not enough."
"We want a genuine investigation and a commitment to a police and judicial investigation that provides evidence to prove that there is no truth to these allegations.p"
"It is extremely repugnant to us to see this from a country that has been our ally for a very long time."
"To see it on European soil, to see centuries of civilisation and moral progress in the fight against crime, or, in this case, against terrorism, renounced is profoundly repugnant to us."
"Furthermore, Commissioner – and another speaker said this a moment ago – I entirely agree: countries must be innocent until proven guilty."
"But the fact that they are innocent until proven guilty does not mean that you are not required to investigate."
"The very credibility of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice is at stake."
"Since that is your responsibility, you cannot rely on explanations given by others."
"You must take the appropriate measures and also demand that the Council do so."
"Mr President, for a secret service, the CIA is in the news an awful lot."
"Germany and Italy are up in arms about reports of its alleged abduction of radical imams in both countries and, as my fellow Member said a moment ago, an enquiry has just been launched in Spain into the transit of suspects via Majorca."
"It is a matter of rumour in Europe that there are also secret camps, where detainees, deprived of their rights, are kept."
"In the first case, the European countries involved are infuriated, but in the second case, they are partly to blame."
"You have said as much; you have said that this is in contravention of human rights and of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, but I am very curious as to what you will actually do about it."
"When the Council of Europe mounts an enquiry, your response to that is just to ask to be kept informed."
"That strikes me as a very narrow interpretation."
"The European Union, as a community of values, cannot afford to look away now, and I want you to take an active part."
"I want you to check not only with governments, but also with NGOs and the press whether certain statements are true."
"I want you to talk to members of parliament, and I want to hear you say that, if those statements are true, there has been a contravention of Article 6, at which point an Article 7 procedure is supposed to kick into effect."
"I want to hear you say that Article 7 is applicable, if the statements are true, that is!"
"This is not, however, a merely institutional issue."
"This is not simply something the Commission has to do, although I do think that it should play a far more active role."
"It is also, and above all, a political issue."
"A few moments ago, a Polish Member of this House rightly said that such matters should also be discussed at national level, and I think that we should all go back to our sister parties at national level, for this is something that must be broached with them too."
"We should not simply place the responsibility with the Commission, but we should, via our own sister parties, ensure that these things are checked to find out whether or not they are true."
"Mr President, it is not only dictatorships threatened with extinction that keep people detained in an unacceptable manner."
"Since the use of the Guantanamo Bay military base as a prison where non-Americans can be kept without trial and without support from a lawyer, we know that human rights are violated to that extent by NATO’s most powerful member state too."
"In Europe, we expect virtually everyone to reject such practices, even if this involves people whom we think are a threat to our lives in peace and democracy."
"If secret prisons are located in one of the current or future EU Member States, or in states that benefit from our neighbourhood policy, then that is a stain on the European claims of democratic rule of law and protection of human rights."
"It is therefore necessary that the Commission and Council make every effort to put an end to the possible existence of such prisons."
"Commissioner Frattini now reports that the Member States involved flatly deny their part of the responsibility."
"He then goes on to refer to the Council of Europe that is already taking care of this matter."
"If such prisons exist, it has always been the intention to keep their existence secret for ever."
"Their denial is the first instrument to protect this secrecy."
"This denial does not convince me or certainly those who have drawn your attention to this."
"The European Union must check out for itself whether there is an American network of secret prisons and whether some of them are located in Europe."
"I can endorse the procedural points mentioned by Mrs Buitenweg."
"Instead of simply denying their existence, we must get to the bottom of this matter."
"Mr President, Mr Czarnecki and Commissioner Frattini have already referred to the fact that the Polish Government has denied allegations that camps exist in Poland."
"I cannot vouch for the accuracy of this statement myself, of course, since I have not scoured the forests around where the suspect plane is reported to have landed in Poland."
"Even if a CIA-owned Boeing had in fact landed there in 2003, however, it would not constitute any kind of proof that such camps existed or still exist in my country."
"We do not know what reason the plane had for landing."
"It may have been to refuel, to carry out repairs of some sort, or maybe to take someone on board."
"We do know, however, that this Boeing also landed in the Czech Republic and Sweden in 2003, and, more recently, in Palma on the island of Majorca."
"Yet no one is accusing these countries of housing such camps, or voicing suspicions along these lines."
"One can only ask whether this is because it is mistakenly assumed that there is no such thing as freedom of the media in Poland, and that journalists would not immediately have been hot on the trail of such a sensation."
"Logically speaking, I would be astonished if the Americans had decided to use an EU Member State for this purpose, thus forcing the country in question to violate the Treaties and EU legislation, instead of using American military bases or countries where freedom of the media really is non-existent or limited."
"Examples of such countries include Egypt and Thailand."
"One possibility is that we are participating, at our own behest, in the deliberate sending up of a trial balloon to gauge the reactions of the new EU Member States, by putting the strength of the transatlantic alliance to the test."
"Another possibility is that someone is keen to point out new targets for al-Qaeda terrorist attacks, and to ensure that these attacks are carried out against Poland and Romania."
"I therefore believe that we should exercise great caution and avoid reading too much into the facts, as certain people have done."
"In so doing they not only contrive to ensure that Europe’s real problems are pushed to one side, but also place the Polish people at real risk of terrorist attacks."
"I am delighted that there is a possibility that the Council of Europe will carry out a thorough investigation into this problem, and the sooner this happens the better."
"In response to Mrs Buitenweg’s suggestion, I should like to make it known that I would be more than happy to invite the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to Poland in order for them to investigate the matter for themselves."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid that the denials referred to by Vice-President Frattini in relation to the countries involved are extremely formal and unconvincing."
"In the top-secret CIA documents, which virtually the entire European press is currently discussing, the clandestine jails in Poland and Romania, referred to in the and , even have a name – ‘black sites’."
"They are a sort of no-man’s land, beyond the law and beyond the right of habeas corpus."
"If proven, these allegations are serious and present us with a difficult problem – the need to find the delicate balance between protecting citizens’ rights and combating terrorism."
"I should like to underline a contradiction – the fact that shortly, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament will tackle the issue of data retention and will again attempt, with a great sense of responsibility, to find common legal and political ground to reconcile rights and emergency situations."
"We need to protect the rights of citizens and to use all available means to combat terrorism, at the very time when we discover that European countries have become the CIA’s own back yard."
"Mr Frattini, what is really serious is that we do not even have the right to be surprised."
"Two years ago, as the current legal investigations – of which you are well aware – have shown, Community and non-Community citizens were kidnapped in European countries by the US secret services."
"Once again, however, we appear to be turning a blind eye."
"We have noted your final comment, namely that if the episodes we are discussing today were proven, they would constitute serious violations of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union."
"That, I believe, is an important statement and one we would ask you to develop further, by launching an exhaustive and in-depth investigation into the events we have been discussing this evening."
"Mr President, contrary to our Polish friend’s opinion, there are not, in Europe, two legal doctrines as to whether the end justifies the means."
"The law is unambiguous and binding."
"Terror may not be fought with terror."
"There is nothing problematic or uncertain about this issue."
"Deprivation of freedom, abduction, enforced transportation, torture, abusive treatment, solitary confinement, and disregard of the presumption of innocence are crimes and themselves constitute acts of terrorism."
"That is not Europe’s way."
"You refer to comments in magazines, and say you have no evidence."
"I can assure, you, Commissioner, that this is but the first of very many debates until such time as this matter has been settled, and settled beyond doubt."
"There you have them: the numbers of the flights, the airports involved, the flight times, the companies and firms that operated the flights, the destinations to which they flew; you have statements from detainees, evidence from a dozen international organisations, investigations by the CIA itself, albeit into the breach of secrecy rather than into the crimes themselves."
"The Austrian military authorities are conducting investigations into CIA aircraft’s flights through Austrian airspace, and enquiries by the justice authorities in Spain, Italy and Germany are also underway."
"I call on you to wake up, perform the duties of your office and take responsibility."
"Mr President, last Friday Condoleezza Rice, the US Secretary of State, ordered the highest level enquiry into the leaks to the Washington Post and Human Rights Watch."
"Clearly the United States Government believes there is some veracity in these allegations."
"Today the Commissioner has, on the one hand, told us that the Copenhagen criteria might have been breached by Romania and that Article 6 may be being breached by Poland, but we already knew that."
"The Commissioner has come here today and told us that there is no evidence of these breaches."
"Well, both Poland and Romania issued official government-level denials last week, so we knew that."
"We asked the Commission to investigate the leak that the United States itself is concerned about – the highest level leak to the most credible of sources. newspaper and other bodies are repeating these allegations."
"These are not radical newspapers or non-credible organisations."
"Mr Lambrinidis said we already knew that the CIA operated black sites and torture centres in other parts of the world."
"We want to know if it is happening in the European Union."
"We want to know if it is happening in the candidate countries."
"As you said, Commissioner, it is the most serious breach of treaty obligations."
"You are not investigating it."
"We need an investigation which brings credibility to this House so that we can leave this debate knowing whether this is true or false."
"Mr President, we as Europeans must clarify whether CIA detention centres exist in Europe, how many there are and where they are located, etc. As a citizen of the Balearic Islands I have a special interest in this."
"The end does not justify the means."
"We must defend our values."
"We may be fighting terrorism, but we cannot do so with arms that are not democratic."
"We understand why US organisations and institutions, including the CIA, are being closely protected, especially in Eastern Europe, where so much hope for change has been pinned on the United States."
"However, not placing limits on the means we employ makes for a terrible contradiction, since democracy and transparency are fundamental to the maintenance of law and order and to democracy itself."
"Human rights are applicable to all human beings, including terrorists and suspected terrorists."
"I therefore call on the Commissioner to investigate this issue."
"– Mr President, some time ago, information led to the discovery of the huge barbarity of torture chambers at the Abu Graib prison in Iraq and at Guantanamo prison in Cuba."
"Today reports, although not yet confirmed, have nonetheless not been denied by the American authorities."
"I am worried that, in the name of combating international terrorism, we are on the brink of a new Middle Ages."
"We are on the brink of a direct threat to democratic culture in Europe and, more importantly, the European governments and European institutions cannot remain impassive."
"I wish to highlight in particular the direct reaction of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe."
"Unfortunately, we did not see this direct reaction by the Council of Europe on the part of the European Commission."
"Today, the guarantees and statements made by the competent Commissioner, Mr Frattini, were not in my opinion at all reassuring."
"What needs to be undertaken by the European Commission and by Mr Barroso, by Mr Frattini and by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, as the competent Commissioner for transatlantic relations, is an investigation in all directions, in order to ascertain where, by whom, how and when these black places were created."
"The European Union has a political and moral obligation to cooperate with the American Congress."
"We already know about the initiatives by Senators John MacKein and John Kerry in this direction."
"The same initiatives must also be taken by the European Parliament."
"The promotion of transatlantic relations is inseparably bound up with respect for democratic values and the principles of international law."
"This is a message which needs to be sent clearly to the American leadership."
"Mr President, on 2 November an article by Dana Priest positing the existence of secret CIA prisons in Eastern Europe was published in the ."
"I should like to make two points in this respect."
"Such ‘secret CIA prisons’ operate outside of any judicial system."
"I refer not only to that implemented by international institutions, but also to the US courts, civil and military alike."
"This alone constitutes a violation of the fundamental democratic and liberal values upon which America, the European Union and the transatlantic alliance are founded."
"There is a great deal of public opposition to secret CIA prisons and the interrogation methods used in detention centres for suspected terrorists."
"This attitude is shared by many Republican politicians in the USA, as evidenced by Senator John McCain’s recent initiative to abolish the use of torture or methods akin to torture in such centres."
"My second point relates to the possibility that secret CIA detention centres are located in EU Member States or in countries that will join the EU in the near future."
"This state of affairs undermines the fundamental principles of the EU Treaties."
"The European Union has every right to demand that its Member States, including my own country, Poland, take these accusations seriously, that they look into the matter again and that they investigate all the circumstances surrounding the landing in Poland of a CIA-owned Boeing carrying prisoners."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank those who have spoken and to say that everyone here is in agreement with a principle which I personally underlined in my introduction."
"There is unanimity on the basic principle of the European Union, namely total respect for the life and dignity of every individual."
"Therefore, everyone here in Parliament agrees with the view that, if the allegations prove to be true, we shall be faced – as I have already said, but it is worth repeating – with a serious breach of the Treaty on European Union, a violation which, if it were confirmed and proven, could lead, as you all know, to the application of serious political sanctions against a Member State of the European Union."
"That is only the start, however, because it is obvious that, in addition to the serious violation – and I have drawn attention to Article 7 of the Treaty – there is also a second consideration: if these allegations proved to be true, they would constitute criminal activity."
"Someone mentioned this fact, a large number of you emphasised it and I am fully in agreement."
"It is therefore clear that the national legislatures of the Member States have the duty to investigate situations of this type."
"In Italy, as everyone is aware, an investigation is in progress into certain serious allegations of unlawful acts committed in Italy by CIA agents, which, if proven, would constitute a serious crime."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the problem is that legal means must be used if they give us every opportunity to achieve the result that we, both Commission and Parliament, are seeking."
"Let us therefore look at what actions the Commission has taken, is taking and will take in the future."
"Many of you asked this question and I may have failed to cover this point adequately in my introduction."
"I believe the most appropriate way to describe it would be as a political action involving continuous requests to Member States and accession candidates."
"I am referring to possible actions such as debate and discussion with NGOs, which obviously have information they supplied to the media and which they could certainly provide to the Commission as well; also dialogue with other institutions that hold further items of evidence and with bodies able to supply information to the European Commission; and, finally, intense and continuous discussion with the authorities."
"I refer, in particular, to the United States Congress and Senate, which have decided to conduct investigations, the results of which could be passed on to the European Commission."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am not someone who minces words and I would ask you to forgive what is perhaps an excess of frankness."
"However, I believe that the indignation we all rightly feel at these serious crimes – these absolutely disgraceful situations – will not suffice to alter the rules of the Treaties."
"When some Members refer to an ‘investigation’, they are not just referring to the approach the Commission is intending to adopt – and will adopt – namely to conduct a political enquiry."
"They are also thinking of inspections, the taking of evidence and the obtaining of documents, even where such documents are not spontaneously volunteered."
"Even if Parliament voted that the Commission should exercise such investigative powers, it would be unable to do so, because the Treaties do not give it that authority."
"When we use the word ‘investigation’, we need to understand what we are talking about."
"Do we have the power to question the Interior Ministers of the candidate countries and Member States referred to?"
"No, we do not."
"Do we have the power to obtain classified CIA documents if they are not handed over?"
"No, we do not."
"Do we have the powers of the Council of Europe?"
"No, we do not have those powers."
"That would require a change in the Treaties."
"I should be very happy if the European Constitution had already come into force, because it gives the European Commission wider powers than those it currently possesses."
"When someone here referred to the powers of national courts, they may have imagined that I have powers identical to those of a public prosecutor or examining magistrate in one of the Member States."
"However, there is no comparison between the power of a national judge and that of the European Commission."
"We may not like it, but those are the rules of the Treaties and, therefore, when we talk of an ‘investigation’ we need to use the word in its legal sense and, above all, within the meaning defined in the Treaties."
"To sum up: I intend to use all powers of political investigation, because these are permitted under the Treaties."
"We are allowed to ask the question, but if a Member State replies that it has never had clandestine jails in its territory, I shall need to have proof, as in the case of Abu Ghraib – photographs, evidence and testimonies."
"At present, we do not have these items."
"I am not saying we may not have them in future, but I do not have the authority to summon anyone, or to order the interrogation of someone who refuses to testify, because these powers are vested in other bodies."
"I am talking, therefore, about a political investigation, an action aimed at obtaining information and collecting evidence, where it exists."
"Important information may also be obtained from Members of Parliament, of course, because these are political actions."
"They are not legal actions; they are actions which, if the allegations are proven, could lead to political sanctions."
"That is what complying with the rules means – and it is something I have always done, even when I may not have liked it."
"In this particular case, I do not like having limited powers, but these are the powers vested in me under the Treaties, and they are the political powers of investigation which I intend to use."
"Colleagues, I have to draw your attention to the fact that we have among us Observers from both Romania and Bulgaria, and they are very welcome."
"Since Romania has been mentioned frequently during this debate, one of the Observers wished to take the floor."
"I pointed out that this could not happen, but he has passed a note to me expressing his concern about some of the attacks made upon Romania and stating that the Romanian authorities would welcome any inquiry into the allegations made in the ."
"I state that for the record."
"I do not want to set a precedent, but the Observers are among us and they obviously have strong feelings about these matters."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the Commission statement on banana import arrangements."
". Mr President, I should like to thank you for this opportunity to share with you our current thinking on the new import regime for bananas."
"Needless to say, we are very disappointed at the second arbitration award issued on 22 October 2005."
"The current import regime for bananas was agreed at Doha in 2001."
"On this basis we obtained a waiver from our WTO obligations for granting a preference to our ACP partners."
"It was also agreed at the time that we would move to a tariff-only system not later than 1 January 2006."
"For this purpose we opened negotiations with our main trading partners for modifying the concessions in our schedule on bananas and went through arbitration as foreseen in the annex to the Doha waiver."
"The relevant benchmark set out in the annex to the Doha waiver is whether the rebinding of our tariff on bananas maintains market access for most-favoured-nation suppliers."
"Following a first negative award on 1 August 2005, the arbitrator determined in a second award issued on 27 October that the European Community had failed to rectify the matter with its proposal for a new most-favoured-nation tariff rate at EUR 187 per tonne."
"This was a very disappointing result."
"Our calculations were done in an objective and transparent manner and were supported by thorough economic and legal analysis."
"The aim has always been to ensure a neutral modification of the import regime with a most-favoured-nation tariff that provides equivalent market access conditions to let in American suppliers – as the current quota regime does – and keeps an equivalent level of ACP preference."
"Throughout this process we had consultations with our trading partners but there were no common positions from their side that could have been the basis for a negotiated solution."
"Where does that leave us now?"
"The arbitrator’s award does not indicate what could be an appropriate tariff level."
"In deciding on the import regime for bananas there are a number of considerations that need to be taken into account: most importantly, our responsibility to all the different stakeholders."
"We have considered the interests of Community producers and the management of the common market organisation for bananas with a view to its future reform."
"We have our commitments towards the ACP partners in the Cotonou Agreement to maintain their tariff preferences."
"In the light of all the above, we need to move to a tariff-only system from 1 January 2006 and we must move quickly as our operators need legal certainty."
"At the same time, I am fully aware of our responsibilities towards all stakeholders, which we take very seriously."
"The Commission will therefore be making a proposal very shortly on the level of the tariff starting from 1 January 2006."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I have been draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development for successive reforms of the COM in bananas, and I have spoken in all the debates we have held, on 13 April 2000, on 13 December of that same year and on 4 September 2003, to mention just the most recent."
"Before leaving his post, Commissioner Lamy informed us, on 21 April 2004, that he intended to propose a tariff of EUR 230 per tonne of bananas imported."
"Since then, since the new Commission took office, both you and your colleagues and the Commissioner for Trade have sought to reach an agreement."
"You must acknowledge, Commissioner, that what you have said tonight does not shed much light on the direction you intend to take."
"You must clearly take the decision to apply a tariff from 1 January and we shall see how high it is."
"Nevertheless, you are very well aware – the Commission is very well aware – that that decision guarantees you a new dispute with the producer countries of the ‘dollar area’ within the WTO almost immediately if that tariff exceeds their expectations."
"In other words, we shall gain a few months of time at the expense of creating certain risks for the ACP group of countries and new uncertainties for our European producers."
"In the end, provided that nothing unexpected emerges from the imminent Hong Kong Summit, the Commission will have to seek a negotiated solution with the Latin American banana-producing countries."
"The legitimate question I would like to ask is why the Commission expressly gave up the search for that agreement during the months of March, April and May, when there is reliable evidence that, via various diplomatic channels, the Latin American producers sought an agreement, though of a transitional nature, on a temporary extension of the system in force which would provide a margin for the negotiation of a more stable and lasting solution."
"Commissioner, I believe that the Commission did not pay any attention to these wishes because, at that time, it was confident that the arbitration within the World Trade Organisation could agree to the establishment of a tariff of EUR 230."
"That was our first setback."
"Then a new tariff of EUR 187 was proposed, with identical results."
"You have confirmed here today that you are very disappointed by the result of the second arbitration of 27 October."
"At that time, the comments of certain officials, and your own comments, Commissioner, showed the same perplexity and disappointment that you have expressed today."
"You said then that it was necessary to prevent the banana dispute from being included on the Hong Kong agenda."
"I believe that this is another mistake, Commissioner."
"All it needed was for a country such as Honduras, which may be many good things, but is hardly an all-powerful giant of a country, to ask that the banana dispute be included on the agenda of the Hong Kong Summit, in order to achieve what the Commission wanted to prevent at all costs."
"You may feel reassured to know, Commissioner, that, during this final stage of the negotiation, with so much disappointment and bad news in terms of our interests, you have not been alone."
"You have been accompanied by certain national governments, such as that of my own country, and the governments of certain banana-producing regions."
"You have also had the understanding of certain representatives of the European banana producers, who appear to be resigned to awaiting a solution, which you have mentioned in your speech, involving a magic formula such as the one achieved in the so-called ‘Madeira Agreements’, which for the moment just has the air of a Portuguese , which, as you know, Commissioner, is more a song of nostalgia and sadness than one of hope."
". Commissioner, I would like to point out a few aspects to you."
"You showed how disappointed you are, which is no surprise after a second negative arbitration decision."
"That is no pleasure, but I can tell you after looking at the website that the story of bananas is a never-ending one; so you should not be too disappointed."
"I am sure this issue will be with us for many more years to come and even if this is resolved, another one will come up."
"That seems to be inherent in the case of bananas."
"Maybe you could be a little more precise and explain the timeframe for action."
"There is not a lot of time left, but I would like to know what timeframe you have in mind."
"Secondly, what are the different scenarios you are evaluating?"
"For the Committee on International Trade, it would be more than relevant to know what you have in mind."
"Finally, as my colleague said, I wonder whether this is not going to overshadow Hong Kong."
"I would like to know how you are going to make a situation that is not easy in any case – given that sugar and many other difficult issues are on the agenda – look a little more positive."
". Mr President, Commissioner, this debate provides evidence of how important socio-environmental criteria are in the argument about international trade, and how important it is that the Commission should bring these quality criteria into the WTO negotiations."
"The same can, I might add, be said of sugar, which is a good example, although here in Europe – with the possible exception of our peripheral areas – we produce hardly any bananas."
"The situation is, then, better than it was at the time the Soviet Union disintegrated and Germany was united."
"When the central and eastern European states acceded to the European Union, West Germany’s former suppliers – the producers of dollar bananas – thought they could now supply the rest of the EU."
"‘With this common market organisation’, they thought to themselves, ‘which was not there before, there will now be free trade in bananas, and we will be able to offload our dollar bananas throughout the EU’s territory, and let the others look after themselves.’"
"This House, at the time, debated this in depth."
"In those days, the Commission was on our side, and we worked out a proper market organisation, which is now becoming the subject of recurrent debate."
"It is not the case that the dollar bananas have done anything like cede any of the market and that the Americans are doing less business; the very opposite has happened, and their share has increased dramatically."
"If, though, we had not introduced these criteria and had no quotas, the ACP countries, with their so-called small bananas, would have been out of business ages ago, and hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of small banana farmers would have lost their livelihoods."
"They are not yet exactly out of danger, but at least we have, by holding this debate, made our contribution."
"What I would welcome from you – and I am also thinking of sugar here – is that this debate should go forward in the European Union, and that, instead of liberalisation being simply proposed as a quantative solution while policy and social and environmental concerns are disregarded, the Commission, as an advocate for these quality criteria, should speak up clearly and ensure that social, labour, and environmental concerns should be brought to bear on global trade relationships and be taken into account in them."
"That is most particularly the case where the use of quotas is concerned."
", . Mr President, bananas are not only produced in plantations run by powerful international undertakings that employ large numbers of badly paid workers; more and more small farmers are growing them too."
"Since the 1980s, cooperatives of small farmers in the developing world and non-commercial import organisations in Europe have struck up good working relations."
"Over half the bananas eaten in Switzerland originate from imports based on fair trade."
"The key factor is not the country of origin, but the method of production that protects man and the environment."
"In contrast to Switzerland, the success of fair trade in the EU is hindered by a tradition of quotas and levies."
"This means that it is difficult to import bananas from countries other than those in Africa, the Caribbean or the Pacific Ocean, or, to put it another way, those countries that were colonies of the Member States up to half a century ago, unless they fall within the scope of import licences held by a number of big undertakings in Europe and America."
"I have a question I would like to put to the Commission. Will it, after this arbitration, create room for a transition to the Swiss model or will volume restrictions only be replaced by higher import tariffs, which means that little will change, if anything?"
"In that case, the Latin American countries will regard Europe as being in breach of its agreements."
". Here we go again."
"Another EU import tariff scheme has come unstuck: recently sugar, now bananas, and all for pan-EU harmony."
"This scheme is hampered by the origins of Member States, many of whose former colonies produce bananas and whom they now rightly wish to assist."
"Although complex, the three-tariff system helped, with the C quota reserved for ACP countries to export up to 750 000 tonnes annually to the EU at zero rate."
"Hence the problem: because non-EU countries, especially Latin America, now want parity."
"I suggest two solutions."
"We can go to tariff only, as proposed for 2006."
"In October 2004, EUR 230 per tonne was suggested, but that was too low for ACP and too high for dollar countries."
"However a common tariff is set up, it will disadvantage ACP countries, causing loss of production and unemployment."
"Already the Windward Isles report that 24 000 small producers have dropped to 7 000 under dollar-country pressure."
"In many ACP countries bananas grow in terrain unsuitable for other crops, so unemployment grows massively."
"Will these people migrate, some to Europe adding to our 20 million unemployed, or will they take to crops like cocaine that will grow on the former banana plantations?"
"I suggest an alternative solution based on the repeated statements that we are supposed to be in an EU which retains its individual Member State status."
"Mr Barroso recently claimed that regulations might be cut."
"Combine the two: ditch the banana import scheme and make individual Member States sort themselves out with their own arrangements."
"After all, we are all grown-up democracies."
"EU countries would buy on the open market or support their former colonies just as they wish, without repercussions on the world market."
"The UK operated Commonwealth preference up to 1972 without great problems."
"If that sounds a little nostalgic, well, why not?"
"We owe these former colonies."
"What is wrong with a little humanity in trying to maintain employment in the Third World?"
"Rather that than the arid scratchings of the bureaucratic Brussels pen-pusher."
"Mr President, the 2001 agreement with the United States and the Latin American countries, to which the Commissioner referred earlier, and which we thought could put an end to the banana war, now brings with it a radical change to the Community import regime from January 2006, a change that the European sector will have to face in a situation of great uncertainty."
"In 1993, the Union decided to establish its own import regime and a common organisation of the market for bananas that is completely different to the common organisation of the market that governs the rest of the fruit and vegetable sector."
"The Union therefore gave the banana sector special treatment, almost favourable treatment, and this is even more justified today, because this fruit is only grown in the European Union’s outermost regions."
"I would remind you that, because of their island and outlying status, these regions are treated differently, and this is necessary, above all, if we want to continue to maintain their agricultural activity."
"Given that my government, the Spanish Government, has forgotten this – as has the Government of the Canary Islands it would appear – I will point out that bananas play an essential economic and social role and the new import regime could jeopardise the survival of Community production if the European Union does not have sufficient funds in the future to compensate for a drastic reduction in prices as a result of the possible establishment of too low a border tariff."
"The essence of the problem is ultimately an accounting adjustment on which the future of the banana sector in the European Union depends."
"The lower the tariff, the greater the financial effort required to compensate European producers will be."
"But that effort has a maximum limit and that maximum limit should determine the European Union’s room for manoeuvre in terms of giving in to international pressures in international negotiations."
"The Union has already sacrificed a significant proportion of its agricultural production for the sake of opening up to international trade, a sacrifice which unfortunately always impacts on the same people, on the producers, and which benefits just a few, in a very small number of third countries."
"In the case of bananas, moreover, the big multinationals would benefit, while local producers will hardly notice the change."
"– Commissioner, firstly let me say it is regrettable that the Commission chose the path of litigation rather than that of negotiation, which would probably have provided a much more practical solution and might have produced a more satisfactory result."
"The reality – as others have said – is that, for instance in the Windward Islands, bananas provide employment for over a third of the working population and account for 50 to 70% of export earnings."
"It would be extremely serious if that were to be jeopardised."
"As you suggested, Commissioner, preferences for countries such the Windward Islands harm no one and are not aimed at damaging the trade of Latin American exporters or of any other exporters."
"The best approach would be to find ways of postponing the single tariff, and to negotiate and agree to a fair solution that allows all suppliers to continue to trade."
"Arbitration has obviously been a failure, but the Commission must try to ensure that the trade can continue until such time as you, in conjunction with the Development and Trade Commissioners, can find a viable way of ensuring that other sources of income can be found for poor farmers in the Windward Islands so that they continue to have a future."
"Finally, I fear that bananas and sugar will be well and truly on the agenda in Hong Kong as far as the ACP countries are concerned."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for Agriculture for what she has said."
"I would like to point out that banana production in the European Union is currently significant, that thousands of European Union families living in the outermost regions live from it and that, if banana production were to disappear, we would be abandoning some of Europe’s islands to their fate, despite the fact that, although they are far away, they are as European as the place from which I am speaking at this moment."
"Secondly, I believe that we must bear in mind that the panels of the World Trade Organisation cannot choose arbitrarily."
"According to the principles of the Charter of the World Trade Organisation, an equivalent tariff must be sought, and that equivalent tariff is not arbitrary; it must provide us with at least the same level of protection that we enjoyed previously."
"I do not know to what extent the Commission is considering this factor."
"Thirdly, time is running out."
"1 January is just around the corner and I very much fear that, as a result of the ‘trial and error’ procedure being employed by the panels of the World Trade Organisation, we will not have a tariff on 1 January."
"Should we not consider the possibility that, at least during the transitional period, the regime in force could be maintained?"
"Can the Commission negotiate in any way with the third countries to suspend or interrupt the negotiation, with a view to reaching a reasonable solution?"
"I am finally going to make a comment on the things my compatriots from the Spanish Peoples’ Party have said."
"Until last year, the Peoples’ Party was in power in Spain and until a few months ago, before its expulsion by the Head of the Government, it was in power in the Canary Islands."
"The question I wanted to ask is whether, until that time, the Peoples’ Party had been doing anything differently to the current governments of Spain and the Canary Islands."
"In any event, Commissioner, I hope that you will defend the interests of these hundreds of thousands of European citizens whose ability to maintain their living conditions depend on you."
". Mr President, when I look back in time I find that the issue of bananas has always stirred emotions."
"1992 was the first time I really heard about this discussion, which has lasted for so many years."
"We have not yet actually finalised this issue."
"Addressing some of the remarks made here today, firstly, it was a priority for me when we started these discussions immediately after I came into office last November to reach a negotiated conclusion on this issue."
"Yet it soon turned out that even within the Latin American countries there is no common agreement, so it was not possible to reach a negotiated conclusion on the issue in January."
"We tried over and over again to see whether it was possible."
"I will not go into details about the various big companies in the Latin American countries that hold completely opposite views on how this is will end, but do not believe those who say that negotiation possibilities have not been explored."
"It is quite right that Honduras has put bananas on the agenda for the Hong Kong ministerial conference."
"I can only say that we will do our utmost to ensure that this issue does not unduly disturb the whole process."
"To this end, we are counting on our approach being reasonable, on our continued preparedness to discuss with our partners and on the support of the ACP countries."
"Regarding sugar, which has also been mentioned, it is my intention to try to reach a political compromise in the Council at the meeting before the Hong Kong meeting, so that this will not be an issue."
"As regards the timeframe and the different scenarios, there is currently a proposal on the table before the Council for moving to a tariff-only system and this will be the basis for further discussions."
"At this stage I cannot go into details, because this is issue will be dealt with and negotiated with the Council before I put all the figures and ideas on the table in Parliament."
"Of course our target is to get fair trade on this banana issue."
"The fact is that at the end of the day it is the consumers who decide what is going to be on the supermarket shelves, so those who have a huge interest in this issue should use any opportunity to encourage consumers to make their choice."
"As a number of speakers have mentioned, it is clear that we have to find a balance on this very delicate issue."
"In deciding on the import regime for bananas there are a number of considerations that need to be taken into account and, most importantly, as I said previously, our responsibility to all the different stakeholders."
"We also have to consider the interests of Community producers and the management of the common market organisation for bananas with a view to the reform that we will hopefully achieve with the Council during the second half of 2006."
"I can only assure those of you who have an interest in this difficult, long-lasting issue that we will do our utmost to arrive at a positive outcome so that the tariff-only system enters into force on 1 January 2006."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission on the ‘Reasons for the poor implementation of the Occupational Pensions Directive by Member States’, by Ieke van den Burg and Othmar Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (O-0094/2005 B6-0338/2005)."
". Mr President, I would like to say a few words on our reasons for raising this oral question."
"As we explained in the text, many Member States have not implemented this directive."
"Discussions are taking place between the Commission, the services concerned and the Member State representatives, and in the context of CEIOPS."
"However, Parliament as co-legislator should also claim to have a role in interpretations if there really are problems with the directive."
"This is why we asked you to come here to discuss this with us, Commissioner."
"Reading between the lines, you will also note our concern that Member States are not taking implementation of the directive seriously."
"We also urge you to make an important issue of the Pensions Directive – because it is a separate issue specifically concerning financial markets and social policy – particularly where respect for national, social and labour laws are at stake and where host country rules, rather than the country of origin principle, are prevalent."
"We are eager to be involved closely in the outcome of the implementation and the possible interpretations."
"We raised two other issues: the involvement of CEIOPS and the state of affairs regarding the prudential rules, as well as possible additional quantitative rules added by Member States, but I will not go into details on those."
"A very important point for me, not just as spokesperson for the PSE Group, but also as a Dutch delegate, is my concern over developments in occupational pension schemes due not only to financial market developments but also to regulatory developments: there is a trend to move from defined benefit to defined contribution systems."
"This is a very fast-growing development in the UK and Ireland, where in particular new participants in schemes are not given a defined benefit system."
"That is not possible in the Netherlands because we have collective systems and obligatory systems in most cases, and we are very attached to them."
"I do not agree that a shift from defined benefits to defined contribution is a necessary development, let alone a desirable one, because the quality of pension schemes is a major asset of the European social model."
"The first pillar in the Netherlands would be incomplete and insufficient without a second pillar of such high quality."
"It is also important that this tradition give the best overall results."
"Therefore, these blurred borders are also a concern for us and we would invite you to clarify your interpretation of these developments and how you will debate this issue further with us."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs van den Burg has already said, we are concerned – concerned about the lack of seriousness with which this directive has been transposed since it was adopted two years ago."
"There are two sides to this directive: one has to do with the internal market, which the directive makes stronger for all service providers in the field of occupational retirement provision, and the other has to do with social security for workers, with more dialogue between employers and workers when occupational retirement schemes are set up and in the course of their further development."
"Boarding the airliner this morning, I was handed a magazine. The headline on the cover stated that there would, in future, be no getting away from occupational retirement provision."
"As you, Commissioner, will have seen from having read the new German Government’s working agreement, two substantial paragraphs of which are devoted to securing the old age pension system, this has become no less important an issue in the years since the directive was drafted and adopted."
"There is still not enough risk capital in the European Union; in the USA, as we are well aware, it is the pension funds that do most to create it."
"The internal market and the financial services sector still offer potential."
"The pension funds – the businesses that deal with occupational pension provision – do not yet enjoy a complete single internal market."
"Much is at present being said about the European lifestyle model and the European social model."
"Occupational retirement provision, which involves more of the market at the same time as social security – is an essential precondition for workers’ mobility and flexibility, as well as for the securing of our systems of provision for old age and of securing a comfortable old age in a society in which people live for longer and longer."
"What this directive also makes clear is that there is an imbalance in powers and responsibilities, an imbalance between single market competence and social security systems."
"This is something that the directive attempts to rectify, but it is also the very reason why we are putting this question, for it is the Member States that are empowered to transpose this directive and to take account of those aspects that we have addressed but that are not set down in law; they are also responsible for doing so."
"From your speeches and from the facts, we know that, to date, only six Member States have notified their transposition measures; six more have done so in part and 13 are unaccounted for."
"As things stood on 23 September 2005, 13 states had not done what they were supposed to do."
"That, Commissioner, is why we are asking you what action you propose taking if, by the end of the year, not all the Member States have transposed this directive."
"What is it that makes it so difficult for them to do that?"
"Unless I am misinformed, there were meetings of the Member States and the Commission in October 2004 and April 2005, at which it became evident that its provisions relating to social security and labour law were the source of the most problems."
"We have to face up to the tension between these two; the one must not be an excuse for a blockade by the other, whether in the single market or in the necessary security measures that we have addressed in our directive, and so we also ask you what conclusions you draw from this, whether you believe that more measures will be needed and what effect the disparities in tax legislation have on the transposition of this directive."
". Mr President, the Member States that have not or that have only partially communicated implementing measures to the Commission will be subject to infringement proceedings for non-notification under Article 226 EC."
"It should be emphasised that such infringement procedures concern only the communication of national measures and do not refer to the quality of the implementation."
"Once complete notifications have been received, the Commission will examine the national implementing measures, which might at a later stage lead to infringement proceedings due to incorrect implementation of the directive."
"The directive does not confer any comitology powers on the Commission."
"It is not a ‘Lamfalussy’ directive."
"Therefore, no mandates are given to the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors – CEIOPS – nor will any implementing measures be adopted by the Commission."
"As there is no practical experience with the directive yet, it is too early to take a position on the need for comitology and, therefore, on the role CEIOPS could take in this."
"However, CEIOPS has an important role to play in the context of Article 21(2) of the directive and supervisors have the duty ‘to collaborate closely with a view to facilitating supervision of the operations of institutions for occupational retirement provision’."
"In that respect, CEIOPS’ Occupational Pensions Committee is currently drafting a multilateral cooperation protocol, such as already exists for insurance."
"A draft is out now for a second open consultation with stakeholders."
"It is expected to be adopted by the CEIOPS members’ meeting in February 2006."
"In the past two years, the Commission has organised two meetings with Member States in order to help them implement the directive."
"To that end, the discussions focused on issues identified by Member States, the Commission and other stakeholders as a potential source of difficulty for the transposition and which may give rise to a diverging interpretation by the Member States."
"On the basis of those meetings, the Commission has concluded that although some articles appear to cause problems, that is not the case for all Member States."
"Hence it is difficult to define any particularly problematic provisions."
"This is not surprising, since Member States’ pension structures and arrangements differ significantly."
"Nonetheless, there is reason to believe that the implementation of Article 20 – cross-border activities – causes problems for many Member States."
"However, it is too early to assess whether the origin of those problems lies in the formulation of the legislative proposal as adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, or just in different interpretations in the various Member States."
"In 2006, a first meeting will be organised to discuss further some of the issues which have been identified as problematic and essential during the examination of the national implementing measures."
"The in-depth analysis of the national measures transposing the directive has not yet begun."
"At this stage the work focuses on the quality of the partial or full notifications."
"An indication as to the extent to which Member States have adopted additional quantitative investment rules and elements that might jeopardise the proper functioning of the directive can only be provided once most Member States have notified."
"As the Commission expects a large number of Member States to communicate their legislation to the Commission before the end of this year, such an indication can only be provided in the course of 2006."
"A number of defined benefit pension schemes took advantage of the 1990s bull market to reduce the level of contributions or even take contribution holidays instead of building up their financial reserves."
"When the inevitable market downturn occurred, some of these reserves were found to be insufficient."
"In response, sponsoring undertakings and Member States’ supervisory authorities employed different solutions: increased contributions, top-up payments, reduced indexation of pension rights, changes in the pension schemes’ rules and the closure of schemes to new entrants."
"Irrespective of the remedies applied, all stakeholders again realised that a pension fund involves a long-term commitment to employees and pensioners."
"This recognition has only been reinforced by other developments, including the application of IAS 19 for sponsoring undertakings and stricter rules for the supervisory valuation of technical provisions."
"Sponsoring undertakings have realised the need to achieve improved cost control and more stable earnings in order to match their pension promises."
"A shift from traditionally defined benefit final pay schemes to pension schemes whose cost can be more easily controlled can indeed be observed."
"However, there is clear evidence that this shift has not been solely towards purely individual defined contribution schemes."
"Hybrid schemes combining defined benefit and defined contribution elements are also available."
"The rationale behind all these changes is better cost control and more stability in earnings for the sponsoring undertaking."
"There is a trend towards some blurring of the borderline between the three pension pillars, not just between the occupational second pillar and the individual third pillar, but also between the second pillar and the statutory first pillar."
"This is not a problem, as the pillar structure is only a general classification system, and schemes where assets are allocated to individuals are to be found in all three pillars."
"This is not the case in every Member State, as pensions reflect specific cultural and historical situations."
"Thus, although the basic differences between the first, second and third pillars will remain, the solutions envisaged may be equivalent."
"Different choices have been made in the 25 Member States as to the existence, level and funding of state schemes, occupational schemes and individual arrangements."
"There is not one EU-wide answer to the challenges of the ageing society."
"Appropriate solutions must be adapted to Member States’ different pension systems."
"Therefore, the final responsibility lies with Member States."
"The Commission could be of help to Member States by ensuring that the European regulatory framework for financial services supports the emergence of secure market-driven responses to retirement financing."
"Bottlenecks must be removed so that assets earmarked for retirement can be managed as efficiently as possible, thus allowing Europeans to enjoy the highest possible payouts and annuities on retirement."
"The directive fulfils this objective."
"In the second half of next year, the Commission will present a white paper in the field of UCITS, which also play a role in the pension arena."
"Other initiatives that aim at improving European pension provision include the recently adopted proposal for a directive on improving the portability of supplementary pension rights, and the ongoing infringement cases in the field of equal tax treatment of pension contributions."
". Mr President, Commissioner, that was a highly technical description of something that is going nowhere."
"That there is such dragging of heels when it comes to the transposition of the directive on occupational retirement schemes is not only disappointing but also – or so I believe – negligent."
"Occupational pension schemes are burgeoning within the European Union, and the directive itself offers nation states enough scope to be able to organise them properly."
"The population statistics are changing dramatically, and many states are, for ideological reasons, progressively withdrawing from retirement and healthcare provision, the idea being that private provision should step into the gap."
"If pensions are to be secured in future, other areas of capital-building retirement provision will have to be promoted and managed with vigour."
"If occupational pension schemes are to be a stable means of making additional provision for old age, there must be a guarantee of the risks to employees being reduced in real terms, for they already risk losing their jobs and must not also risk their own voluntary contributions, and the contributions made by the companies they work for, being put in jeopardy."
"That is why there must be an explicit separation guaranteed between the businesses and the institution for occupational retirement provision, so that, for example, the entitlements acquired are not lost in the event of the business going bust or the employee changing job of his or her own accord."
"A single market for occupational retirement provision organised on a European scale would mean more mobility for workers, and that is precisely what they want."
"Alongside the decoupling of the risk of job loss from the risk of employees’ claims on the amassed capital in the event of the business going into administration, there must be minimum standards for occupational pension institutions, which must involve explicit information rights for both the supervisory authorities and the employees."
"Both those entitled to benefits and those actually in receipt of them must be entitled to receive information on the way in which their scheme’s capital is invested or on the state of the stock market."
"Employees should also, if possible, have a right to be consulted by their companies when the choice of these institutions is made."
"If the objectives named in recitals 18 to 23 are achieved, that not only puts the workers in a more secure position, but is also what modern stock market supervision in the Community requires."
"Now, Commissioner, is the time for action, and action is what we are used to getting from you."
". Mr President, we all agree with the Commissioner that increasing the uptake of pensions is of paramount importance, especially in relation to voluntary pensions, whether by virtue of this directive or through any other means."
"However, incentives to take up pensions, as he has quite rightly said, remains a competence of the Member States as these may be linked with the tax and benefits systems."
"I am not proposing that there should be any change to that."
"Nevertheless, it is important to share best practice."
"Could the Commission therefore indicate whether it is already monitoring incentives or has plans to do so?"
"Can it envisage a mechanism through which best practices can be shared and encouraged?"
"In the context of cross-border provisions, which we want to encourage in order to achieve a better and more vibrant pensions market, public confidence in all regulators and underlying guarantees – and not just in those of one’s own state – is very important."
"It is also important, especially for schemes relating to the self-employed, that it is understood that the information provided by the different countries should be comparable."
"Article 9 of the directive requires that members be given sufficient information on risks."
"Article 10 requires that the annual accounts should give a true, fair and comprehensive view."
"Other articles provide that members should have access to those accounts."
"However, this raises the question of what constitutes sufficient information, and whether account will be taken of the differences between prevailing practices in Member States, or at least whether potential investors will be alerted to the differences that may exist in areas in which they are not comparing like with like."
"Clearly it is also important for the solution found to this not to result in a multiplication of regulation and for CEIOPS to take that into account in any forthcoming protocols."
". Mr President, perhaps the Commissioner could explain what he means by a ‘tird’ pillar."
"It sounds rather unsavoury to me."
"Is not the real problem of the implementation of the directive on occupational pension schemes that there is no political will for its implementation?"
"In western Europe there is a serious demographic problem as the population grows ever older, with the birth rate continuing to fall in the leading industrial countries of the European Union."
"There is a major pensions crisis, which national governments are simply failing to address."
"In the case of final-salary schemes, as indeed with public service pensions, the concept is that young people pay for the old; that one generation supports the next."
"It is not only the demographics that are against the old economies of western Europe, but also the so-called social model."
"This much prized social model seems to consist of 40% youth unemployment, welfare dependency and the break-up of the traditional family."
"Thanks to the economic absurdities of this place, as well as of national government, we cannot rely on the generational support system any longer."
"Indeed, in the United Kingdom, it is politically even worse: there are over GBP 800 billion of unfunded public service pensions, with recruitment in the public sector out of control."
"Pension funds in the private sector have been taxed since 1977, taking over GBP 5.5 billion every year out of ordinary people’s savings, whilst politicians enjoy privileged pensions at the expense of the hard-pressed taxpayer."
"Indeed, if public companies now fail to show pension liabilities in their accounts, the director would face prison, yet national government finance ministers flout the rules daily."
"In my own constituency there is a company called Ballast Nedam which has simply abandoned its pensioners in a most disgraceful way and set up a new company to avoid its responsibilities."
"This is quite against the directive, which has failed to be implemented."
"Is it not interesting how keen governments are to standardise car heaters, windscreen wipers and spirit bottles but, when real people need help, as usual the European Union is found wanting?"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, first the operating framework and the advantages of occupational pension funds must be clarified."
"They are financial market institutions and cannot be connected to or it cannot be implied that they can gradually acquire such scope that they can even partially replace the social security systems."
"The social security systems must continue to guarantee general coverage of workers and they are public systems; in other words, if the insurance fund cannot pay pension benefits and liabilities, the state must meet their financial liabilities."
"By contrast, if occupational pension funds are unable to meet their liabilities, there is no financial intervention or guarantee by the state."
"However, I clearly support the fact that these funds are useful as credit institutions which undertake to guarantee auxiliary pensions, insofar as they are decided within the framework of collective agreements."
"Of course, it must be emphasised that they only provide a retirement income in the case of workers, creating a degree of discrimination against those who do not have stable employment or who work part time."
"It should also be emphasised that these credit institutions, these funds, only have the facility for cross-border cooperation with countries in the present eurozone."
"On the basis of these characteristics and the development of the application of the legislation to the Member States, it is advisable for the directive to be promoted in all the Member States, but to become more flexible."
"What we want is to integrate the directive into national law and, most importantly, for it to be accepted by the social partners, by employers and employees."
"In this direction, it does not seem to make sense to use averages in order to ascertain the breadth of coverage of the workforce by the funds in question or the capitalisation of these funds and their accumulated reserves as a percentage of GDP or per insured."
"On the contrary, highlighting the factors which contributed to the development of the institution in specific individual countries, where the confidence of the workforce attains an average of 45%, also appears to be of exceptional importance."
"The parameters which contribute to the serious disparity in the application of this directive in the various Member States need to be abolished."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, having already had the experience yesterday lunchtime of the entrance to the Parliament building being blocked by Strasbourg’s taxi drivers for three-quarters of an hour, I made the discovery this morning that German taxis, evidently on the instructions of our head of security, Mr Suarez, were no longer being allowed to drive onto Parliament’s precincts, so that passengers had to alight from them outside. Moreover, one taxi driver told me that no reason had been given for this."
"I regard this sort of thing as an absolute scandal, and as discrimination, and I call on the House authorities to withdraw the order that people are no longer to be allowed in."
"I will also be ascertaining, in an hour’s time, whether taxis are again being allowed to drive in."
"I really do wonder how it has come to pass that we in this place should give in to pressure from the street yesterday and prohibit taxis from driving on to Parliament’s precincts in the way they used to."
"The first thing I can tell you about that is that the possibility of some sort of instruction from within Parliament can be ruled out with absolute certainty."
"We cannot exclude the possibility that the French taxi drivers’ organisations have been up to something."
"There will be official consultations about this, and the administration will be able to deal with it immediately."
"The next item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors’ annual report for 2004."
". Mr President, let me thank you, on behalf of the members of the European Court of Auditors, for the invitation to the debate on the Court’s report – its 28th – on the financial year 2004, which I presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control yesterday evening."
"In this, my first year in office as the President of the Court, I am glad to be able to be present at the commencement of the annual process of giving discharge in respect of the handling of the EU’s Budget."
"Among the main sources for the annual report are the financial audits and checks on legality and propriety that the Court has carried out."
"By way of contrast, the general practice is to publish the Court’s findings on financial soundness in the form of special reports."
"What made the financial year 2004 noteworthy was the accession of 10 new Member States, which meant that the estimates for payments rose from EUR 98 billion in 2003 to EUR 105 billion in 2004."
"Improvements in planning and in management made possible a marked increase in the use of funds in comparison with previous years."
"The surplus in 2004 – EUR 2.7 billion – was significantly lower than that in 2003, being, indeed, half the amount."
"I would now like to consider the main statements in the Court’s Statement of Assurance, also known as the ‘DAS’, starting with the statement on the reliability of the accounts."
"When considering the financial year 2004, the Court came to the conclusion that the consolidated financial statements gave a faithful picture of the income and expenditure for the year and of the financial position at its end, with the exception of the entry for ‘sundry debtors’."
"As was the case in the past, the accounting system used to draw up the annual accounts for 2004 is not equal to the task of listing all the assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, although it has to be said that the Commission made distinct progress in introducing accrual accounting in time for the financial year 2005."
"At the time of the audit, though, it did appear to the Court that further progress would be needed, as the figures needed to draw up the opening balances for 2005 had not yet been validated by the Commission’s authorising officers."
"If appropriate action is not taken by the end of this year, the reliability of the accounts for 2005 may well be compromised by the defects highlighted by the Court."
"As regards the lawfulness and regularity of the underlying transactions, the Court stated, in its Statement of Assurance, that consideration of the financial year 2004 led the Court to the conclusion that the supervision and monitoring systems that had been installed were operating effectively and that the underlying transactions, considered overall in relation to receipts, commitments, administrative expenditure and the pre-accession strategy as part of the payment appropriations were lawful and regular."
"As regards the other appropriations – agricultural expenditure, structural measures, and both the internal and external policy areas, the Court again finds itself unable to give unreserved confirmation."
"The supervision and monitoring systems were not yet fully installed, were not yet operating effectively, and payments continue to be largely blighted by errors."
"The Court is able to report, and for the first time, that the efforts by the Commission and the Member States in connection with the introduction of the Integrated Administration and Control System– abbreviated to ‘IACS’ – which covers 59% of agricultural expenditure, have had a positive effect."
"When properly used, IACS is a highly effective instrument for reducing to an acceptable level the risk of irregular outgoings."
"I would now like to discuss in greater detail the specific assessments of the individual areas of activity as contained in the Statement of Assurance."
"The Court came to the view that transactions relating to receipts were conducted lawfully and in good order, but systemic faults were discovered in the handling of GNI own resources, both within the Commission and at Member State level."
"In the same way as in previous years, the Court has found more evidence indicating that errors are still endemic in expenditure under the common agricultural policy as a whole."
"Although the Court has stated that IACS is effective when used properly, there is, in the case of agricultural expenditure not made under IACS or for which IACS was not used in an appropriate manner, a higher risk of irregularities by reason of weaknesses in the monitoring systems."
"The Court, having conducted spot-checks on the structural programmes, again found weaknesses in all of their administration and control systems at Member State level."
"On auditing the Member States, the Court found such weaknesses as the failure to carry out checks or to document them, the failure to check eligibility criteria for funding and lack of evidence of the co-funded services having been performed."
"The Member States’ returns of expenditure, on the basis of which the Commission makes payments, have revealed frequent errors."
"The Court examined a spot-check of 167 projects and discovered a broad spectrum of problems, including a large number of cases in which expenditure was reported on projects not eligible for grants."
"In the internal policy areas directly administered by the Commission, the Court discovered that the supervision and control systems – despite the progress achieved in some areas – did not operate in an appropriate manner, and that there was a high incidence of errors in the underlying transactions."
"The complexity of regulations is a frequent cause of error."
"It seems likely that the risk of error will remain high for as long as the legal framework remains unchanged and procedures are not simplified."
"The main cause for this state of affairs, which shows no improvement over against previous years, was, in the main, the entry of excessive or non-eligible costs or the absence of documentation, for example evidence of services paid for having actually been rendered."
"Turning to expenditure on external policy areas, the Court found that the systems had been improved and that few errors were being made in the underlying transactions at delegation level, but weaknesses were again found in the internal monitoring systems of the organisations tasked with the implementation of projects, along with a fairly high incidence of errors."
"Overall, the Court was able to pass a favourable verdict on the pre-accession strategy, as the underlying transactions were essentially lawful and in order."
"The supervision and monitoring systems in the central Commission offices, the delegations and the certifying authorities are fundamentally reliable and function well in practice."
"The Court did, however, uncover weaknesses at national level in the systems of the implementing organisations in Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and other Sapard countries."
"The underlying transactions in the area of administrative expenditure were essentially lawful and regular, and the supervision and control systems generally worked in an appropriate manner."
"What are the most significant statements that can be made on the basis of this?"
"The Court has established that there were, again, fundamental illegalities and irregularities in much of the payment appropriations at the level of the underlying transactions."
"These were attributable to the risks inherent in the transactions themselves and the fact that the supervision and monitoring systems fail to limit the risk of irregularities with an acceptable degree of effectiveness."
"It was, however, evident that improvements had been made to the systems, particularly to IACS, the most important system for supervising and monitoring agricultural expenditure by the Member States, but also to the systems in the Commission, where the process of reforming the administration and finance systems, initiated in 2000, has produced good results."
"Much, however, remains to be done, particularly at Member State level."
"The legislation, rules and procedures applicable to expenditure are still often over-complicated."
"There are, in any case, risks inherent in much of the expenditure, the sole evidence for which is to be found in statements by its recipients."
"It has to be said that the European Union has itself expanded to a considerable degree, and has undergone major changes, since the DAS was introduced in 1994."
"In the eleven intervening years, annual expenditure on payments has risen from EUR 60 billion to EUR 100 billion, whilst the number of Member States has increased from 12 to 25."
"It follows that management has expanded and become more complex with the involvement of an ever-increasing number of authorities and organisations."
"This, in turn, makes ever more effective systems for supervision and monitoring necessary."
"In its Opinion No 2/2004 on the ‘single audit’ model, the Court proposed the creation of a common internal audit framework including every level of administration, whether Community institutions, Member States and recipient countries."
"The Court’s Opinion on the ‘single audit’ model was a contribution to policy debate on the improvement of administration and control of Community funds."
"The Commission has gone even further by adopting what it called a roadmap for the creation of an integrated internal audit framework."
"This roadmap will serve as the basis for the extension of the reform to the management of all types of funds, notably to those areas of administration that are shared with the Member States; it is here that cooperation between the Commission and the Member States is indeed crucially important."
"The Court welcomes this initiative on the part of the Commission for a roadmap."
"In its capacity as the EU’s external auditor, the Court will closely observe progress and assess the effects of these changes on financial management and the control of the EU’s finances over the coming years."
"It has to be said that the Court’s position on another issue, that of the future of the finance, management and control of the common agricultural policy and the structural measures, should be taken into account in the final formulation of these important pieces of legislation."
"The provisions relating to the retention of documents in the present draft Regulations on structural measures would make it impossible for the Court to audit some of the items of expenditure concerned."
"The Court is well aware of its need, in a constantly changing Union, for continuing self-improvement and for the best possible use of its resources."
"We aim to work for the interest of the European Union as effectively and efficiently as possible."
"Although the view is sometimes expressed that the Court should give no further ammunition to those in whose interest it is that the EU should be depicted in a poor light, I am firmly persuaded that the public interest is best served by the intervention of an external auditing body, one that is capable, objectively and independently, of making clear and even-handed statements on the basis of objective facts."
"There are those who see the latest events – the voters’ rejection of the draft constitution in two referenda in two Member States, and the difficulty of coming to any agreement on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective – as indicating a lack of confidence on the part of the public in the European Union and its institutions."
"I am quite convinced that the EU’s legitimacy can be guaranteed only if our institutions function smoothly and if management – whether in the making of policy or in its implementation – is of high quality."
"The Member States, too, must discharge their responsibilities in connection with the administration and control of much of the EU’s Budget."
"The Court of Auditors has a key role in this respect: it must convey an independent, professional and objective picture of the way in which the EU’s finances are managed and help to ensure that change is in the public interest."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the President of the Court, Mr Weber, for the fair presentation of the 2004 annual report and the Members of the Parliament for giving me the opportunity to give the Commission’s first reaction."
"The Court’s report is fair and balanced: it says that the Commission is having success in implementing tangible improvements in its management systems, but that many areas still need to be improved."
"The Commission welcomes the Court’s positive opinion on the reliability of the accounts, which faithfully reflect the revenue and expenditure of the Communities for the year and their financial position at the year-end."
"The Court has only one reservation, which has been resolved through the introduction of the accrual-based accounting system in 2005."
"This means that the accounts met their primary objective and that the accounts have been drawn up according to the provisions of the Financial Regulation in force."
"The Court gives a positive assurance on the accounts, on revenue, on commitments, on pre-accession aid, and on administrative expenditure."
"It is also satisfied with EDF development aid, some EUR 2.4 billion outside the budget."
"The Court also notes two key improvements since last year: in a large part of the common agricultural policy and in aid to candidate countries to the EU."
"The system used to check much expenditure under the common agricultural policy – the integrated administration and control system (IACS) – is considered an effective control system in limiting the risk of irregular expenditure, when properly applied."
"This system will be applied to an even greater percentage of agricultural expenditure in the coming years."
"So simplifying greatly, in addition to the several positive assurances I have already mentioned, the Court is now reasonably satisfied with the systems of control and spending in an increasing part of the EU budget, roughly estimated to represent one third of the budget."
"This is tangible and quantifiable progress towards a positive statement of assurance."
"The conclusions of the Court have not always been fully understood by the general public and the media."
"I liked very much the remark in the President of the Court’s speech that makes it clear that the Court’s qualified opinion on certain areas cannot be interpreted as meaning all transactions of the 2004 payment budget are affected by error, nor can it be interpreted as an indicator of fraud."
"We must all understand the comprehensive nature of this large budget discharge exercise."
"This procedure shows that the Commission is accountable to directly elected Members of Parliament."
"This may be the eleventh consecutive non-positive Statement of Assurance, but I hope it is clear from my initial remarks this does not imply that we are not making progress."
"Members of Parliament have pointed out repeatedly that the Commission alone cannot ‘produce’ a positive DAS."
"The 2003 discharge resolution gave very valuable guidance on how to further improve, and we are working to do that."
"As you know, this Commission has proposed a ‘roadmap to an integrated internal control framework’, looking for support in Parliament and Council."
"While I am very grateful for Parliament’s support on the roadmap, the ECOFIN Council’s statement of 8 November was not as radical as the Commission had hoped it would be; political declarations at national level were not accepted."
"But a cascade of operational management declarations by payment and similar agencies is not an impossible goal, though a national synthesis report for each sector, similar to that which the Commission draws up on the basis of the annual activity reports of its directors-general, will be more difficult to achieve."
"We will go ahead with our proposals."
"Our action plan towards an integrated internal control framework will be published next month."
"It is based on the results of the ‘gap assessment’ between the control framework in place for all types of budgetary expenditure and the general principles defined by the Court in its opinion No 2/2004 on a single audit."
"We hope that the legislation being finalised for the new series of programmes in the years after 2006 will reflect the new thinking."
"The proposed revisions to the Financial Regulation and the implementing rules also reflect this thinking."
"Court sampling reveals substantial errors that we are of course concerned to reduce to a minimum."
"To do so, we are focusing and seeking assurance on the procedures for managing the risk of irregularity."
"This is the way to ensure, within a limited resource base, that the costs of extra controls provide added benefits in terms of reducing risks of error."
"I would especially mention here two quotations from the speech made by the President of the Court: ‘in structural matters, the Court found weaknesses in the management and control systems in the Member States across all programmes’; and the second quotation: ‘in the area of internal policies the Court notes that the errors often stem from complicated rules’."
"Certainly I agree with these remarks."
"Need for simplification of rules was repeated yesterday at the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control but, if I look for the individuals who are responsible for the large number and complexity of the programmes and rules, I find hardly anyone."
"Everybody talks about the need for simplification but, when business goes into detail, it is not so simple any more."
"A large part of the complexity often comes not from the officials but from clients, policy makers, politicians in Member States and Members of the European Parliament."
"The changes are often resisted by the same players."
"I use this opportunity to call on all policy makers, when the creation of another goal, plan and programme is under consideration, to look critically at aspects of fiscal management and the need to control and audit these programmes."
"There is a lot more to be said, but the budget discharge process is now only at the beginning and within the coming months Members of Parliament will have all the answers to their questions."
"Parliament and the Commission will work together to finalise the process of discharge of the 2004 European budget."
". Mr President, this is the eleventh time that we have been given a non-positive Statement of Assurance."
"I no longer know whether I should say that this is scandalous; it has become customary."
"Efforts have clearly been made all over the place, but, at the end of the day, this is an unachievable goal following the 11 examinations of the accounts by our Court of Auditors."
"Things are improving, but not to a sufficient extent."
"What is the political consequence of this non-positive Statement of Assurance?"
"Well, for our House, for our officials who have to take decisions, it is highly demoralising."
"It seems a pointless effort to try to comply with the rules, because we never achieve a positive Statement of Assurance."
"There is a lack of will to take responsibilities and all of the officials are tempted not to spend, in case there is any doubt and they have any problems."
"It is therefore demoralising on the inside."
"And on the outside?"
"A great loss of credibility."
"What are the European citizens going to think if our Court of Auditors, for the eleventh time, says that the accounts are not managed here properly!"
"A scandal."
"More of the same."
"Very bad."
"Even when there is a change of Parliament, a change of Commission, a change of make-up of the Council, things carry on in the same way."
"Perhaps we should cast our minds back to the Santer Commission, which had to resign as a result of this kind of problem: it does not matter, things remain just as bad."
"And the Member States?"
"Where is the British Presidency?"
"The Council spends 80%."
"Where is the British Presidency?"
"It is not here: this really is scandalous, because the Council spends 4 out of every 5 euros but is not even attending this presentation of the accounts."
"This really is scandalous."
"The Member States are happy."
"While their national courts approve their accounts, it is not their problem whether the Union, the money of all the Europeans, is managed properly or not."
"There may even be some Member States that actually feel quite happy and say to themselves, ‘my money is getting to the farmers, although I am not conforming precisely to the requirements that the Court of Auditors is demanding of me’."
"They are pleased with themselves."
"They are not even here."
"Mr President of the Court of Auditors, as you know, at the last discharge, this European Parliament called for national statements of conformity on the part of Finance Ministries."
"The objective was to help the Court to publish a positive Statement of Assurance."
"The ECOFIN of 8 November, as Commissioner Kallas has said, has rejected such national statements."
"I would like to ask you, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, about what you think of the usefulness of these statements to your work, in terms of your relations with the national authorities, and about the future without such statements."
"Finally, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, it is of no use to us for you to say that the average across a class of 25 Member States is a fail."
"Tell us – and this well help you – which are the three best Member States and which are the three worst."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor. I should also like to thank the Court of Auditors for a constructive annual report."
"One of the areas in which the EU has the biggest image problem of all is specifically in relation to the issue of how the Community’s money is managed."
"We know from numerous opinion polls that Europe’s populations do not have a particularly high degree of confidence that their money – that is, the money they pay in taxes – is properly managed."
"This distrust is partly justified and partly based on misunderstandings."
"I wish to thank the Court of Auditors for an annual report that helps us MEPs fulfil two objectives: firstly, that of eradicating the misunderstandings and, secondly, that of coming up with good advice and helping solve those problems that do in actual fact exist, for problems there undoubtedly are."
"With regard to myths and misunderstandings, anyone who takes the trouble actually to read the Court of Auditors’ annual report will be able to see that the scare stories circulated by the press and also by the opponents of the EU here in Parliament are not credible."
"It will become apparent that all these stories are based on myths and misunderstandings and that matters are not as bad as the frequent horror stories would suggest."
"Particularly by highlighting the agricultural sphere, in which we have now reached a point at which approximately 60% of the resources are managed properly, the annual report documents the fact that big improvements have taken place."
"That is obviously a good thing."
"Some praise is in order, because progress is being made."
"That being said, it must naturally be emphasised that the mere fact that improvements are taking place in certain areas does not of course mean that we can live with the overall picture."
"It is simply not good enough."
"I agree with the previous speaker, Mr Pomés Ruiz, who said that it is scandalous."
"That brings me, of course, to the second task."
"The first task was to explode myths."
"The second task is, of course, more important, for it consists of finding out how we are to solve these problems."
"I quite agree, moreover, that, on this subject, a clear picture emerges."
"It is in those areas in which there is shared administration – in other words, in which the Member States have just as high a degree of responsibility for managing the money – that the problem area in fact lies."
"The Member States are simply not complying with their responsibilities and are not doing enough."
"I agree that we must do further work on the recommendation made last year to the effect that there is a need for what have been called political statements from the finance ministers of each individual country every single year."
"Over the next few months, we must debate the annual report in more detail and implement the discharge procedure."
"I can now already see that the responsibility of the Member States is one of the issues on which we must focus most of all."
". Mr President, I too would like to add my thanks to the President of the Court of Auditors for his report."
"I can only echo the sentiments that have already been expressed by other speakers, namely that it is extremely regrettable that, for the eleventh time in succession, a positive Statement of Assurance has not been forthcoming, and that is something that will stick in people’s minds."
"We must work on turning the DAS into a positive one, and as far as I can see, the root of the problem lies with the Member States."
"It is unfortunate that the President did not take the trouble to be here today."
"The other benches are also exceptionally devoid of representative of the Member States this morning."
"I do not know whether that is symptomatic of the interest in financial control as a whole."
"To me, the essence still is last year’s resolution in which we insisted that the highest financial authority of each Member State – and I am pleased that these are listening so intently – should be called to account every year about the spending of funds."
"This is something to which most of the Member States are opposed."
"This is, I think, something that this House must continue to work on."
"The suggestion mooted in the Court of Auditors’ report, namely that certification bodies be established for all the components of the budget other than agriculture, strikes me as one that needs further exploration."
"It is to be welcomed that a positive DAS can be given for pre-accession aid."
"In 2004, experience in the new Member States had not yet been taken into consideration."
"We hope that in future, the control mechanisms will remain in place in the new countries too."
"I welcome the peer review, which the President of the Court of Auditors did not mention this morning, but did announce yesterday, about the running of the Court of Auditors itself."
"No institution can be without criticism, without constructive criticism that is."
"If the Court of Auditors’ work over the past few years were to be assessed, that could, to my mind, benefit the whole functioning of the Court of Auditors in Europe."
". Mr President, this debate is kick-starting the 2004 discharge procedure."
"An initial cursory reading of the annual report tells us that the Commission has organised itself more effectively since the fall of the Santer Commission and since the start of the reform process."
"The good news is that spending of the European budget has improved for the third year running."
"The bad news is that, for the eleventh time in succession, the Court of Auditors has failed to issue a positive Statement of Assurance (DAS)."
"There is therefore no certainty about the reliability of the figures."
"The reason is clear: the monitoring and control systems have either not yet been implemented, or they are ineffective, or the payments show up errors of significant importance."
"We are talking about the agricultural and structural policy, as well as the internal and external policy, which involve more than 4/5 of the entire European budget of 105 billion."
"A central problem in this connection is that 80 to 85% of the management and supervision is shared with the Member States."
"The Finance Ministers refuse to accept their part of the responsibility in this respect, which is an absolute disgrace."
"They want money from Brussels, but not the accountability that goes with it."
"Once again, the annual report calls attention to the problem of export restitutions which account for EUR 3.6 billion, or 7.5% of the agricultural budget."
"In terms of value, though, they account for 26% of the irregularities reported to the Commission."
"The Member States should physically check 5% of the export restitution dossiers, but they fail miserably in that respect too."
"I was pleased to see that point 4.30 and note 20 of the annual report contained the recommendation to have the inspection take place at the level of the final beneficiaries, and I quote: ‘such a reach would form a stronger and clearer chain in terms of accountability for CAP spending.’"
"That is why I would make another urgent plea to make the lists of final beneficiaries public."
"That is precisely what Estonia, Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands did."
"Flanders and Belgium, on the other hand, opted for mock transparency by lumping all the figures together, which made proper analysis impossible."
"We can, however, learn a great deal from those tables in terms of anomalies in our agricultural policy."
"For example, over the past five years, Philip Morris, the tobacco giant, has received EUR 6.5 million in the Netherlands for adding sugar to cigarettes."
"Given the high sugar price at EU level, Philip Morris has been compensated for this."
"Similarly, the KLM catering service received EUR 646 000, because it uses sugar, dairy products, vegetables and fruit on flights outside of the European Union."
"They are considered as exports and are therefore eligible for export restitution aid."
"Surely that is too crazy for words, but it is only the tip of the iceberg."
"Europe, the European Union and the European agricultural policy will be acceptable to its citizens only if these excrescences are addressed."
"I wish all rapporteurs in the discharge procedure, and particularly Mr Mulder, much success and I hope that in the next few months, we will be able to carry out our work effectively and issue sound discharge reports in the April part-session next year."
". Mr President, here we go again."
"I stood here nearly a year ago to comment on the tenth anniversary of the European Court of Auditors’ refusal to sign off the EU accounts."
"I said then and I will say again that it is time to admit that this form of European government is an abject failure and that it should be abolished."
"The nation states would be far better off looking after their own interests."
"Personally I would not trust the European Commission, past or present, to look after my grandchildren’s pocket money."
"Three weeks ago I made a speech in this House calling for the 2006 budget to be rejected on the grounds that this Parliament has no business authorising further expenditure when we have the shame of a decade of dodgy unapproved accounts behind us."
"Well, this is year eleven; it is a shameful situation that cannot continue."
"The Court’s latest report is another litany of the failings of European Commission bureaucracy."
"We were promised that a new computer system would close all the loopholes."
"The reality is that that the accounts will still be about as watertight as a colander."
"The Members of this institution should feel a strong obligation to the taxpayers of Europe, for it is their money that is pouring through the holes of the colander."
"The British Government is under an obligation to spend taxpayers’ money wisely and yet it goes on tamely writing the cheques to the European Union."
"Make no mistake, I shall go on being the conscience of this institution."
"I shall keep pointing out what a disaster it is."
"My conscience is clear."
"Is yours, I ask?"
"Incidentally, I look at the attendance of Members here today as an indication of the importance they attach to the handling of the taxpayers’ money by the European Union."
"Enough said."
"Mr President, what Europe could really do with, particularly under present circumstances, is a Court of Auditors like a dynamic tiger, prowling through the landscape and pouncing where necessary."
"This annual report, though, is yet more evidence that it is not, perhaps, really a predator, but rather a toothless creature sitting in a cage."
"It is toothless because it is impossible that such an institution should have teeth."
"If you compare the powers of the European Court of Auditors with those of its Bavarian counterpart, the two are worlds apart."
"I know of only one institution constituted as a Court of Auditors that is even worse equipped in terms of theoretical and practical powers than the European one, and that is the Audit Office in Vienna."
"Whenever discussion turns to how it might act transnationally, the constant refrain goes like this: ‘I can assure you that the Court of Auditors welcomes any debate on potential improvements to the audit procedure.’"
"What I suggest is that you should be constructive."
"Put out a memorandum in which you, the Court of Auditors, cannot really discharge your duties because you lack the powers, because there are things that you are not allowed to do, and because the way in which your staff are selected – which, politically speaking, is what makes everything happen – means that you are not in a position to perform your functions."
"Do that, and you really will be doing Europe a service."
"That would be a first step towards transparency and towards making monitoring possible, both of which we need if we are to help this Union of ours regain its credibility."
"Mr President, listening to the UK Independence Party talking about the Commission not being able to manage its grandchildren’s pocket money, I must say that I would rather have the Commission managing it than the UK Independence Party!"
"In any case, I would like to make three main points, firstly a general point, and then two points aimed at the Commission and then the Council."
"My first and general point is that I think this is a good report."
"The aim of the report is to improve the control environment as it stands, to make the use of money more transparent and more understandable and to get rid of fraud and mismanagement."
"There have been some improvements but, as many have said, a lot remains to be done."
"Having said that, I do not think any company would receive a positive Statement of Assurance – DAS – using the method that the Court of Auditors does."
"My second point is that I would like to congratulate the Commission."
"I know that it gets a lot of flak for the way in which it uses the money at its disposal, some of which is justified, but most of which is not."
"It has made a lot of improvements."
"I like what it has done on establishing a roadmap to a positive DAS and what it has done on accounting."
"My final point is a criticism of the Council, not merely of the fact it is not present today but of the fact that – just as the UK Independence Party was doing a second or two ago – it is trying to create the illusion that everything is the fault of the Commission or the other EU institutions."
"That is simply not the case."
"Eighty per cent of the money used in the European Union is used in the Member States."
"That is why I condemn the fact that, at the Ecofin Council two weeks ago, the Finance Ministers once again refused to sign a declaration of assurances."
"I think we could go very much further in this whole process of the management of finances if the Finance Ministers were to take their responsibility."
"To sum up: one, we are improving the system; two, the problem is not the Commission, but the Member States; and three, I am optimistic that in five years’ time we will have a positive DAS."
"Mr President, 2004 was the year of enlargement, so the 2004 annual report is the first that relates to all twenty-five Member States."
"This is another reason why it is good that the report before us gives a positive, realistic and balanced statement regarding how European Union money was spent in both the old and new Member States."
"The Court of Auditors’ Annual Report 2004 shows the impact of the reforms launched last year."
"This was the aim of the report produced by my colleague, Terry Wynn, and adopted by Parliament by a large majority; it is also the aim of the integrated administration and control system announced by the European Commission and Commission Vice-President, Siim Kallas."
"The reform is based on mutual trust and close cooperation between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Court of Auditors."
"In addition to these, to bring the reform about the Council would need to intervene to introduce declarations of assurance at national level, but there seems to be continued resistance to this."
"Without it, however, we cannot move forward; we need a declaration of assurance from the Council too."
"Reviewing the results of the audit of the Community financial accounts for the year 2004, I am delighted to see that the auditors’ evaluation in respect of the administration of pre-accession funding allocated to my homeland, Lithuania, has been positive."
"Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the general evaluation of the status of EU accounts."
"A paradoxical situation has arisen where the beneficiaries are unable to access the funds appropriated to them since the various supervisory requirements are overly-complex and disproportionate in relation to the benefit obtained, while the auditors maintain that such requirements do not provide sufficient grounds for debate."
"It is obvious that the current support accounting system prevents the attainment of the main fiscal objective of the EU – to transparently and efficiently use the funds of the EU budget."
"Therefore I would like to call on the European Commission and the auditors to urge the implementation of the reform plan and speak more decidedly of the problems that constitute vast and inexhaustible resources."
"I am optimistic in believing that the reforms and an integrated internal control system may be instrumental in coping with the outstanding problems."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by issuing a protest against our having to debate the Court of Auditors’ report without having access to it in advance, a state of affairs that puts us at a big disadvantage."
"Fortunately, we recognise more or less everything from previous years."
"We could perhaps have read last year’s report and put forward the same views."
"What we have here are the same problems and the same accounting deficiencies, and we learn that the problems will remain."
"We are told that the Court of Auditors ‘cannot guarantee’ etc."
"The talk is of dicey transactions, defects in the monitoring systems and hosts of errors etc, etc. There is a road map for an internal monitoring system, which I greatly welcome, but matters are mostly as they were before, that is to say in a bad state."
"I wish nonetheless to point out that the European institutions are of course audited by the European Court of Auditors, while the national systems are obviously audited by various national auditing bodies."
"As in so many other areas, there applies, in this context too, a rule whereby an 80/20 ratio applies according to which a fifth of the cashflows may be controlled here and the remaining portion on a national basis."
"It is incredibly important for us to put forward a proposal concerning the way in which we can produce some structured cooperation on this issue. Otherwise, the Court of Auditor’s task will continue to be impossible in practice."
"The main problems we see stem from the common agricultural policy, the Structural Funds and the Committee of the Regions."
"There is good cause for abolishing the agricultural policy, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee."
"These are all things that belong to another era and perform no function in today’s EU."
"Instead, amounts from the Structural Funds should begin to go directly to the EU’s poorer Member States."
"All the problems about which we are now talking would then largely disappear."
"– At a moment when Europe is not going through a good time in public opinion it is not easy to explain to the people that the European Union, which for many is a model of how things should be done well, is in fact not only not perfect, but it needs to do much more to guarantee that the money passed to it is in fact being used as it should."
"The report we have in front of us is a case of déjà vu; it told us again that the Court cannot be sure that every Euro spent was in fact spent in a completely regular way, although the report notes as well that some progress has been made in a problematic sector such as agriculture, which after all takes up an enormous share of the budget."
"However it would be a mistake if we give up looking for a more effective system of budgetary control."
"On the one hand, we feel a sense of sorrow when we hear that there are still a lot of shortcomings in the control system, however, on the other hand there is the frustration that it looks like we are always seeking further perfection, a perfection represented by the DAS system, up to a perfection which year after year we are continually realising that yes, we can come closer to it, but that we will surely never reach."
"Now we can either play the game of those who want to make everything look black or else admit that nobody is perfect and everybody shoulder their responsibilities."
"This applies both to us at the European Parliament, as well as to the European Commission, but also to the Member States themselves."
"Mr President, I very much want to congratulate the Court of Auditors on this report."
"In the short time in which it has been available to us, it has become evident to me that it contains much data that provides us with outstanding criteria for what is, in the final analysis, our task – that of giving or withholding discharge."
"So often has it been said that the finance ministers have to sign their accounts, but let us consider the areas where it is the Commission alone that has responsibility for what is spent: it is there that we will see terrible things."
"In the internal policy sphere, six out of eleven Directors-General are unable to give an unconditional guarantee."
"Show me a minister of finance who would do so in their position!"
"I have never come across one yet."
"This outstanding report leads me to press on the Court of Auditors the urgency of our focusing on the directly-managed expenditure and trying to get that absolutely right."
"If we do that, we will be much more successful in our dealings with the Member States than we are at present."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can echo what Mr Bösch said."
"I think we are oversimplifying things if we say that, as 80% of funds are administered by the Member States, it is for them to see to it that everything is in order."
"We have indeed had problems over recent years, and it is true to say that they led to the Commission standing down in 1999, but none of them had to do with resources managed at national level – all of them, on the contrary, were administered by the Commission itself."
"We, in the Terence Wynn report – and let me make this quite clear – said that we wanted to involve the national and – where they exist – provincial Courts of Auditors in the discharge procedure."
"Looking today at the way in which things are done at the national and European levels, it is clear to me that the two are incompatible."
"Do not misunderstand me: I object to the idea that what we in Europe do, those things that you are there to do, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, should be handed over to the national systems; instead, we should be giving some thought, where the auditing framework is concerned, to doing things the other way around."
"There is room for improvement in Europe, too, and we can certainly learn from the Member States."
"What is needed is for the Heads of State or Government to be astute enough and wise enough to provide the legal framework that is needed to make that possible."
"It is not your problem, Mr Weber; it is a problem for those from whom you receive your mandate, and that is not us, but rather the Heads of State or Government."
"Speaking, among other things, as a Member of the Committee on Budgets, let me say quite plainly that we need to denounce the attitude they adopt, of not wanting to pay anything into the EU, of wanting their own countries to get as much back as possible out of it, while not wanting to let anyone in Brussels see what is going on. It is this attitude that we have to deal with; that is where we have to make a start."
"If we do, we will really have done something for Europe, for its credibility and for its people."
"The Court of Auditors’ report is important, but not crucial; what is crucial is what we in this House do with it."
"I look forward to the debates in the Committee on the Control of Budgets and to the discharge procedure, which will be completed early next year."
"Mr President, a week ago the Ecofin Council rejected Parliament’s proposals for national declarations, which in effect means that we will not see a positive DAS in the foreseeable future."
"The Ecofin proposals are a poor substitute for real action and came out of a two-day panel of experts meeting which I attended."
"It was a meeting that reminded me of Margaret Thatcher’s comments at a similar meeting when she complained of being surrounded by people who found every reason for not doing things and not changing things rather than giving her solutions to the problems she had."
"Parliament needs to know which Member States agree, and which disagree, with its position."
"In all seriousness, the comment from the UK Independence Party should not be disregarded."
"Why, indeed, should we agree a new financial perspective when supervisory and control systems are so blatantly flawed within the Member States?"
"That is a message that must be conveyed to the Council loudly and strongly."
". Mr President, our being able to present our report to policymakers, among them the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Kallas, makes this a great day for the Court of Auditors."
"We are grateful for the responses our activity elicits from policymakers."
"Our report shows that considerable improvements have been achieved."
"Without doubt, there is a certain amount that remains to be done in some areas, not only by the Commission, but also by the Member States."
"The importance of the declarations has already been mentioned, and I can only agree with that, but they are not everything."
"What we really should be doing is pressing on to find the source of the errors and seek there the incentive for reforms."
"Hundreds of times over, we have done spot-checks and examined transactions."
"We have discovered hundreds of errors – errors both of form and of substance."
"The Commission knows about these errors, and it will deal with them."
"The Member States know about them too."
"This is where we should start."
"I believe – and I am saying this also for Mr Martin’s benefit – that our mandate is an excellent one; we are satisfied with it, and we need no other."
"International comparisons show us in a very good light."
"What matters is that our conclusions be taken seriously and acted on in good time."
"It is not enough for us to bring in a new system; we also need to make use of it and make it practicable."
"What has also become apparent is that the legal framework needs to be simplified."
"There are many areas in which no improvements will be made if procedures continue to be so complicated."
"I also have to say that, if we apply such rigorous standards to the offices and departments we audit, then we cannot complain if the same standards are applied to us."
"It is planned that this should be done through a peer review."
"We are always being told that the Court of Auditors wants more audits."
"On the contrary, we want no such thing."
"We do not want more audits; we want more effective, more efficient audits, from which lessons can be drawn in due course."
"That concludes the debate on this item."
"– It is disappointing and frustrating that the Statement of Assurance should once again be negative."
"This means that there is still no guarantee that spending is legal and above-board and means that doubts persist as to the reliability of the accounting practices."
"Who should be held responsible for this?"
"The Member States, for the methodology used and for the poor implementation of the payment system? The Commission which, in accordance with Article 274 of the Treaty, is responsible for executing the European budget?"
"Let us draw some lessons from the observations made by the Court of Auditors: it is vital to make the national administrations aware of their responsibilities so that the European appropriations may be properly accounted for."
"The Court also has to provide a clear outline of the practical measures that the Commission has to adopt in order to achieve a positive DAS."
"In Europe’s present context of disrepute, the weak points in the management and control systems must not allow the Eurosceptics to undermine the fundamental principles and main policies of the Union, which are aimed at strengthening territorial, economic and social cohesion."
"The Commission and the Member States must enhance their efforts in order to achieve a positive DAS."
"The credibility of the Union and the people’s confidence in it depend on this being done."
"The next item is the Commission Statement on the Legislative and Work Programme for 2006."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2005 has not been an easy year for Europe."
"Europe has had to face terrorism, social uncertainty and natural disasters."
"As for the institutions, we have had to face all these difficulties without the help of a Constitution and, until now, without having a multiannual budgetary framework."
"The Union has been led to wonder about the integration process itself, but we are convinced and our Commission is convinced that there has never been such a need for the European Union as there is today."
"We are proud of the determined and clear response that the Commission has been able to give to this situation."
"Working closely with Parliament, we have all been equal to the challenges."
"Here are some examples of what we have accomplished together: the renewal of the Lisbon Strategy; a revision of the Stability and Growth Pact that will strengthen the credibility of Europe’s economic governance; more solidarity, thanks to the adoption of a renewed social agenda; full recognition of the key role played by social dialogue and the actors involved in this dialogue; the fight for a cleaner environment, by means of the adoption of thematic strategies and the pursuit of our international action in the sphere of climate change; greater security thanks to the implementation of our ambitious Hague Programme in parallel with a large number of other initiatives, in particular our proposal on data retention; the promotion of European values worldwide – in this regard, let us cite the commitment made to double EU aid for developing countries and the adoption of a strategy for Africa; strengthening our partnerships with our strategic allies such as the United States and pursuing an open dialogue with new and important partners such as China; and, finally, opening accession negotiations with Turkey and Croatia."
"The Commission has assumed its responsibilities."
"Our guiding principle was, and remains, the general European interest."
"The set of initiatives that we developed in 2005 is the first tangible expression of the strategic objectives that we set ourselves over five years."
"The programme that we are presenting today remains faithful to the objectives that we adopted at the start of our mandate: prosperity, solidarity in an enlarged Europe, security and a strengthened role for Europe in the world."
"These objectives remain pertinent."
"They are shared by the three institutions which derive their main impetus for action from them."
"I can see there a sign of the partnership for European renewal that I wanted to place at the centre of our action."
"The framework agreement is a tangible expression of this partnership between our two institutions."
"It is a qualitative leap in the development of the policy initiatives."
"It has enabled a close and targeted dialogue to take place between the parliamentary committees and the Commissioners on the best way to translate the annual policy strategy into practical initiatives."
"I am keen to tell you that this dialogue has made a positive contribution to the programme that I am presenting to you today."
"I hope that you will recognise your ideas, including those that you expand upon in today’s debate, in the action that we plan to carry out in 2006."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, releasing Europe’s full potential is the approach maintained by the Commission in drafting its legislative and work programme for 2006."
"What are the key actions for 2006?"
"First of all, action to bring about prosperity."
"2006 will be a crucial year for the implementation of the renewed Lisbon Strategy."
"The Commission will fully undertake its role in instigating, managing and supporting the Member States’ efforts."
"The Member States’ national reform programmes, which we are already analysing, will play a fundamental role in this process."
"We need to link these programmes to our political priorities, to improve the Union’s economic governance and to strengthen national and European efforts in relation to reform and investment – an investment at national level, but also at European level with a view to tomorrow’s economy, to innovation, to knowledge and to new infrastructures."
"These two types of investment – at national and at European level – must go hand in hand."
"We have to support these efforts by means of other initiatives, such as the proposals aimed at supplementing the single market, the promotion of geographical and professional mobility and, for example, the creation of a European Technology Institute."
"I emphasise in particular the proposals on the single market made by Parliament itself in its resolution on the work programme."
"I should like to highlight, in this context, the importance of the measures aimed at providing a framework that supports the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the main source of jobs in Europe."
"The second aspect relates to solidarity."
"Solidarity remains a fundamental part of European integration, and I should like to speak in this Chamber about solidarity between employers and employees."
"I should also like to speak about solidarity between generations, through sound management of natural resources, including marine resources, and the implementation of a new strategy for sustainable development – by the way, we shall present this new strategy in December."
"Solidarity between generations is also brought about by creating jobs for young people and by seeking fair solutions for pension funding."
"Let us not forget, either, solidarity between men and women, solidarity between the most prosperous Member States and the less prosperous ones and solidarity between the European Union and the rest of the world, in particular with regard to developing countries."
"2006 will be a crucial year for attacking on all these fronts."
"On the subject of security, priority will be given to improving coordination in the fight against terrorism and organised crime."
"We saw how much influence Community legislation had in these areas."
"By way of example, I can assure you that one of those accused of having carried out the London attacks was extradited from Italy to the United Kingdom within less than 50 days."
"Such a procedure would undoubtedly have taken several years in the absence of Community instruments."
"This is therefore an area in which the people, including people from the countries least enthusiastic about European integration, are clearly asking more, and not less, of Europe and the European Union."
"Furthermore, we will be doing a great deal of work in the area of illegal immigration, as we have said."
"The problems encountered by some of our Member States are not exclusive to these countries: in reality, such problems affect the whole of Europe."
"We have to stand firm in fighting against this scourge, in collaboration with the Member States."
"Of course, the immigration issue is not just a security issue."
"It has a security dimension, admittedly, because illegal immigration has to be fought against."
"Yet, it is our responsibility to act at the same time with regard to development aid in the countries of origin."
"We have to combine our approach to immigration with our approach to development and, at the same time, we have to do everything possible to ensure the harmonious integration of communities of foreign origin in our countries."
"We also intend to carry out our action in the area of health protection and consumer protection, an area that also comes under the broader sphere of security."
"One crucial element will also consist in the development of a rapid reaction capacity on the part of those responsible for civil protection."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 96 priority initiatives that we are presenting to you are together the proof of our commitment to these objectives: prosperity, solidarity, security and the promotion of Europe in the world."
"Yet, the credibility of these objectives will also depend on their quality."
"That is why the Commission will be rigorously enforcing the enhanced methods contained in its ‘Better lawmaking’ programme."
"These methods are not an end in themselves, but a means of turning the intentions, which we share, into a reality; a reality that our people will really be able to experience in their everyday lives."
"Our ambition for 2006 extends to Europe’s becoming a more influential global partner."
"On this subject, furthermore, 2006 must also provide tangible results: tangible results as regards the enlargement process and the stabilisation and association process; tangible results for our neighbourhood policy, which represents a very important policy for stability in Europe and in its closer geographical context; tangible results as regards the fight against poverty, with our promise to double the amount of aid transformed into a tangible reality; and, finally, results as regards promoting European values in the world, in particular through support for the political transition and reconstruction in Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine."
"One issue will dominate the international economic agenda in 2006: the completion of the Doha Development Round."
"Pascal Lamy said that adjusting expectations for the ministerial in Hong Kong next month does not mean lowering our ambition for the Doha Development Round."
"I agree."
"The round is important to opening markets and freeing up trade."
"In the European Union strong exports boost our growth."
"We want the round to succeed."
"That is why we made our recent strong and conditional – and I should like to underline ‘conditional’ – offer on agriculture."
"Europe has done more than anyone to keep this round on track."
"Our commitment remains but now others have to move."
"The focus of the round must be broader than just agriculture, important as it is."
"There must be balance."
"Therefore I call on our WTO partners to engage in a full negotiation, including on goods and services."
"Europe does not need more lectures from countries that close their markets to the poorest and, in some cases, keep tariffs on agricultural products higher than our own."
"I do not accept that some people put the blame on Europe because of this round."
"In the European Commission we believe that these negotiations cannot simply be conducted for the benefit of a few large farm exporters in very rich or fast-developing countries."
"There is a huge difference between the very poorest developing countries and those that are growing rapidly."
"It is time to stop lecturing and start negotiating."
"The costs of failure are high, not just for all trading nations, but also for the fair, rules-based international trading system we have worked so hard to create, as well as for global business confidence."
"The international economy now needs some good news, especially because of the high costs of energy."
"So we have an interest in this round succeeding."
"That is not only in our interest, it is especially in the interest of the poorest countries."
"That is why the Commission will put forward ideas before Hong Kong on how to make sure this really is a development round."
"Tomorrow we will discuss the follow-up to Hampton Court."
"The new consensus that began to emerge there links up with our debate today."
"We saw, at the informal summit, a confirmation of the Commission’s analysis on how to safeguard our values in a globalised world."
"If we want to preserve our values we must modernise our policies."
"We saw an agreement on areas where people want Europe to lead: science and innovation, higher education, energy, border management and immigration."
"We also need a more coherent Europe as a global actor."
"So many of our internal Community policies now have an external element: environment, migration, transport, energy and others."
"That is why the Commission will present ideas next year on improving the coherence of the European Union’s external actions."
"We are now preparing a concept paper on that matter."
"The European institutions must play a central role in this process, rebuilding a consensus and reconnecting with citizens."
"That is why I have announced today that the Commission will come forward with a new truly European energy policy in 2006."
"It is good that at all levels in the European Union people now understand that it makes no sense to go it alone when dealing with energy challenges."
"Even those who were most reluctant now see that this is a European issue and that we face the same challenges, such as rising prices, falling reserves, increasing dependency on a few parts of the world, and also the need to protect our environment."
"We need a coherent energy policy for the 21st century, one that looks at all these issues and options in a calm, determined way."
"We often forget what a remarkable accomplishment European integration is."
"It is all too easy to forget that one of the achievements of 2005 was to make an enlarged European Union work and much of the credit for that must go to the new Member States."
"I think we can, and will, do even better in 2006."
"Very often we forget that now our Europe is not the ‘’."
"Now Europe consists of 25 Member States that are free, independent and living in peace and democracy."
"The challenge is to make this enlarged Europe work."
"This year we made a very important contribution to meeting that challenge."
"At the end of this week I am going to Prague and Budapest to see and support this new enlarged European Union."
"I am confident, because there is a growing understanding that the endless debates about widening or deepening and about the market or social protection are at an end and that even in the middle of the difficulties we know, there is a growing awareness that we need a more European dimension if we want to solve the problems facing us."
"A new consensus is emerging that a powerful, dynamic Europe cannot have 25 mini-markets in services or 25 mini-markets in energy, but that a single market also needs a powerful, dynamic political and social Europe."
"The market alone is not enough."
"The market alone cannot address concerns such as air safety, global warming or the integration of immigrants."
"Yes, this is about pragmatic Europe, but pragmatism with principles, adding value in areas where we can make a difference, shaping policies that provide an answer to globalisation and meet the challenges and opportunities of our ageing population, a Europe that is part of the solution and not of the problem."
"I see a parallel with the activity relating to the period of reflection in which you, as Members of the European Parliament, are heavily involved."
"We must show as institutions that we are listening carefully to our citizens and that we are addressing their concerns."
"That is why we will implement our Plan D for dialogue and democracy and count on open cooperation with Parliament."
"I have left perhaps the most important message about the 2006 work programme until last."
"Let us be frank."
"The plans for 2006 will count for little without agreement next month on the financial perspectives."
"That agreement is the test of whether Europe is on the move."
"How can we deliver for our citizens on prosperity, solidarity and security without the means to achieve them?"
"Agreement on the financial perspectives is a key to unlocking Europe’s potential in 2006."
"An enlarged, more diverse European Union needs more investment."
"We have a duty of solidarity to the new Member States that look to the European Union for support in their rapid and remarkable progress in modernisation and reform."
"We need a fair sharing of this burden."
"No Member State can do enlargement on the cheap."
"I trust in the common sense of the British Presidency to deliver a fair and balanced agreement next month."
"I hope that it will do so by strengthening, not reducing, the ambition the Commission and Parliament share for an enlarged Europe."
"I hope and believe that the proposals which I presented to you last month can help to unblock the negotiations."
"My call to you today for 2006 is that we consolidate and build on this new consensus, that we restore that shared sense of purpose that will get Europe back on its feet; a united Europe acting collectively on matters that most concern our citizens."
"In my view this is the best possible response to the ‘no’ votes to the Constitution earlier this year."
"It is also what lies at the heart of the Commission’s programme for the second year of our partnership."
"I hope it finds your active support."
"I can think of no better signal to our citizens that Europe is working for them."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, the programme that you are presenting to us is aimed at the key priorities of security, competitiveness, social justice and the internal market, and we emphasise your desire to translate the Lisbon objectives into actions."
"It is still necessary, though, to provide ourselves with all the resources to achieve these objectives."
"My fear, however, is that there is a lack of ambition to meet the expectations of a Europe in crisis."
"Your plan D methodology promoting democracy, dialogue and debate is also interesting, provided, however, that it does not become the plan of demagogy or of disappointment."
"For something is missing in this plan D, namely determination: your determination to find practical solutions."
"What concerns me, Mr Barroso, is knowing what jobs we will have in Europe in five years’ time."
"Not only jobs in the service sector, but also jobs in industry."
"What jobs will we still have in Europe in five years’ time?"
"Growth, employment and security are the three pillars on which Europe has to construct its policy."
"Yet if we are to do that without a Constitution, we need a policy initiative, bringing together the Council, the Commission and Parliament, so that the measures required for the European institutions to operate can be made effective."
"Under no circumstances is it a question of flouting the outcomes of the referenda."
"Quite the contrary. You know that the future enlargements are of concern to a large number of Europeans."
"Although it is undeniable that Europe has to support our closest neighbours’ efforts to promote democracy, you must nonetheless not give the impression of moving too quickly and of wanting constantly to enlarge the Union when we have resolved neither the problem of our institutions nor that of Europe’s finances."
"Mr Barroso, we reiterate our ambition to be able to rely on a strong European Commission."
"We will support you, but it is up to you to listen to us more."
"The Council is not the only institution with which you liaise."
"It would, I might add, be pertinent to enhance the cooperation between the EU Presidency and our Assembly."
"During the most recent summit, at Hampton Court, the Council called on you to give fresh impetus to issues relating to migration and internal security."
"We are delighted by this initiative because, until now, the Council has to some extent put a brake on the judicial cooperation requested by our Parliament."
"These issues relating to internal security and the fight against terrorism must not only be addressed at intergovernmental level."
"That is why we are awaiting strong initiatives in this regard and are thus calling for the actions relating to Internet protection to be completely revised. These actions will enable us to establish cyber security, without for all that restricting the freedom of the Internet."
"‘Better regulation’ does not mean ‘do nothing’, but ‘do better’: target the EU’s intervention better."
"Before making proposals, we need to give a great deal of thought to Europe’s plus points."
"Doing so is important, among other things, for supporting research."
"We therefore welcome the creation of the European Technology Institute."
"This plus point also consists in making sure that the European texts are properly enforced."
"Each Commissioner should issue on a quarterly basis a clear and precise account of the state of play."
"We also need to review the comitology procedure, just as we also want to be more involved in the essential process of simplifying legislation."
"The Commission not only wants to tackle the problems faced by Europeans today, but also the issues at stake tomorrow."
"Two aspects seem to be particularly important."
"The first relates to demography and the ageing population."
"In this regard, a more family-oriented environment needs to be created."
"Although it is one of the Member States’ powers to create this environment, the European Union can try to gather together the best initiatives within the 25 Member States and propose effective solutions with regard to health policy."
"The other aspect relates to the sustainable management of natural resources and, in particular, the impetus given to energy policy."
"The proposal for an action plan in respect of energy efficiency and the proposal concerning the draft Green Paper, aimed at guaranteeing safe, competitive and sustainable energy sources, are along the right lines."
"We will see to it that these objectives are reflected on the ground, particularly in terms of the development of biofuels and of inland waterway transport."
"Finally, Europe will become all the stronger for putting pressure on international negotiations."
"We know that we cannot hope for much from the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting, but we call on you not to question the reform of the CAP, decided in 2003, and to continue to support multifunctional agriculture."
"Our future prospects will, however, come to nothing if we do not have any financial perspective before the end of the year."
"How could we possibly function with annual budgets?"
"Mr Barroso, you yourself said that 2006 would be a crucial year for turning words into concrete actions."
"You know that a good number of projects are awaiting this budget."
"Parliament has done its duty, by means of the Böge report."
"It is up to you to put pressure on the UK Presidency to break the deadlock in Europe."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, there is certainly much in the programme and in what President Barroso said today that we can endorse, particularly – and I am picking up on a point made by Mr Barón Crespo when I say this – Commissioner Mandelson’s attempts at keeping the Hong Kong round of talks fair and balanced."
"Despite his scepticism, I hope that will be achieved."
"Your programme, Mr President, in which you express the desire to unlock Europe’s full potential, is a very ambitious one, but I have to say, on the basis of our group’s consideration of it, that there are a few essentials missing from it."
"Let me start with the riots in the French cities."
"Those are certainly French events, but deeper causes underlie them."
"Perhaps you now understand why our group has always highlighted the importance of social cohesion, for where people are unemployed, where they are not integrated, where they are isolated and discriminated against, upheavals of that kind are not far away."
"This programme also, in this regard, lacks any clear statement about the importance of public services, which are especially important, particularly in cities, as a means of accommodating and helping people who have fewer chances in life."
"Something else you referred to, Mr President of the Commission, was the energy issue."
"Although I have a high regard for the Energy Commissioner and work well with him, I have to say that we have often pointed out how important it is, in view of current developments, that the Commission as a whole should give a clear commitment to a policy on alternative energy."
"It is also vital that you should introduce to Europe what is an almost universal practice in America, of obliging the big corporations to plough back more of their disproportionate profits into research and development."
"We are curious as to what the Green Paper – which should have been available some time ago – will contain, and it will certainly be the subject of vigorous and serious debate."
"Thirdly, there is Europe’s research potential, and this we must awaken."
"We are currently debating the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, but does the Commission have any overall scheme for implementing it?"
"To give one example, your programme makes only vague and cautious reference to the European Institute of Technology, yet this is where there is a need for more boldness and determination on your part, and for you to put forward an overall concept for European universities."
"We must stop subsidising the Americans by exporting young researchers to them."
"We educate them and then let them go to America, because they have too few opportunities in Europe."
"There is also the need for a scheme whereby access to research resources may be improved for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular."
"That, too, is an absolute necessity."
"I agree with what you had to say about ‘better lawmaking’; it is in the interests of many large businesses, of small and medium-sized enterprises, and of the individual citizen, that we should accomplish this."
"While we support the Vice-President in what she plans to do, better regulation is also a task for us in this House."
"We must do far more than we have before to explain, defend and justify every single law-making initiative to the public, and we need to be sensitive in the way we do it."
"We need to act with a greater sense of purpose."
"This is not so much about the Commission examining individual measures in terms of their legality, but about whether the Member States are able to achieve the objectives associated with European legislation."
"You were right to make reference to social issues, but it is far from clear enough from the programme that economic and social development must go hand in hand."
"What I would like to see is for you, on behalf of the Commission, to produce a report next year on progress with enlargement – which is a topic to which I should like to return, although I would perhaps attach another meaning to it."
"There is a great deal of scepticism on the part of the public; many people in the old Member States get the impression that enlargement is being used to lower social standards and cut taxes."
"Thinking back to the debate that we had with you, Mr President of the Commission, and with Commissioner McCreevy, I do not think we were able to get across just how important this social issue is to us."
"Now that I read in the – the Commission’s principal mouthpiece – that Commissioner McCreevy is absolutely opposed to tax harmonisation, I find myself wondering whether it really is our aim to keep cutting direct taxes and make ourselves incapable of funding our social and other infrastructure services."
"Do we want a single, shared Europe with far lower social standards?"
"We – and by that I mean the old and new Member States together – must aim to accomplish a social Europe."
"I would like to see the Commission produce a report on that next year."
"According to a recent report in the , many of the statesmen of major countries – Schröder, Chirac, Blair – can be expected to stand down in the next few years."
"Poland now has a completely new government."
"At a time when new governments and new Heads of Government are coming to power, the Commission must take on a leadership role in this Europe of ours, with which these new people are perhaps less familiar, if the European ideal is not to fade still further."
"If you assume such a leadership role, we will support you, but, if you do so, please make a social Europe one of your objectives!"
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the work programme for 2006 is not just any old programme."
"It must be a programme that makes the EU visible once more to every citizen, and, moreover, visible in a positive light."
"The EU’s problems with credibility and acceptance may no longer be the stuff of newspaper headlines, but they have, of course, still not gone away, and they can be back on the front pages at any moment."
"It is because they are far from having been overcome that the challenge for the EU is all the greater: its policies must show the public that it really is worth it."
"That will be achieved through comprehensible policies that produce results, and the best possible results at that."
"What that does not mean is producing as much legislation as possible with the maximum impact on the maximum number of people."
"On the contrary, the big issue for the politics of united Europe must always be about how we can get Europe to the top."
"That is where the title of the work programme, ‘unlocking Europe’s full potential’, gets it exactly right."
"I might add that that was the keynote of the Liberals’ election campaign in 2004, and I am glad to see you making use of it."
"It is for that reason, too, that I am glad that the work programme was put together in cooperation with Parliament’s committees."
"Putting together a common programme for all the EU institutions is a step in the right direction."
"The fact is that everything else is fragmentary, and the public no longer regard it as justifiable."
"The four core areas – to which reference has already been made – are very definitely the right ones."
"It follows that the claim that this policy is close to the public’s concerns is still very far from being backed up."
"Neither in structure nor in content, alas, does the work programme meet this requirement of being close to the public; at any rate, it cannot be called better regulation if the two parts presented have nothing whatever to do with one another, so that the programme does not hang together."
"I would like to highlight a few areas that are of particular importance to us Liberals and Democrats."
"It is a very good thing that the highest priority is given to the Lisbon agenda; a consistent policy aimed at education, research and growth will create more jobs and thereby make the EU competitive."
"That does of course involve the realisation of the single market for services, including financial services."
"It is also important that we should be ambitious in driving forward the reform of agricultural policy by, among other things, reallocating more funds to agricultural research and technology."
"Where internal security is concerned, we believe that two aspects have to be accorded equal importance, one being the need for security and the other respect for freedom."
"The fact is that we will be no more secure, nor will terrorism be vanquished, if the freedoms of the EU, against which terrorism is fighting, are themselves curtailed."
"Europe is an example, unique in the world, of how lasting peace can be established between countries that were formerly enemies."
"It is also unique in its peaceful export of the market economy, democracy and human rights."
"Great though this is, if we are to remain successful, it must point us all in one single direction, and, as the question is what that will be, we, as Europe’s legislators, are under an obligation to come up with comprehensible, reliable and prompt answers."
"That must be part of our workaday lives; it must become our daily labour."
"Over the coming weeks, with this work programme for 2006, we must set an example of how to do that."
"Over and above that, though, there must be a single dream to unite us as Europeans."
"It was Victor Hugo who once said that nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come."
"Europe was such an idea, and it still is one."
"The work programme can be a stone in the mosaic of this idea, but it must fit into the picture of a Europe that wants to move forwards, and, most of all, to become stronger."
". Mr President, Mr Barroso, Commissioners, on listening to you, Mr Barroso, and on reading the Commission’s text, the first feeling that comes to my mind is one of wishing you well in your work and of wishing us all well in our work because, for each of the projects, Parliament will, of course, have its say and because Parliament will have power of codecision."
"When I listen to you say ‘prosperity, solidarity, security’, that has a nice ring to it."
"There are other kinds of triptych: liberty, equality, fraternity."
"Another term to be found, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, is dignity, together with the term justice."
"One concept is missing, however, and that is sustainability."
"I, for my part, said to myself: the word ‘sustainable’ in English actually has a nice ring to it."
"The French equivalent, , has much less of a nice ring to it."
"While the strange term sounds even worse."
"Perhaps another triptych could be: live, move and love."
"Just a suggestion!"
"On a more serious note, where is the urgency?"
"On listening to you – and you are an eloquent speaker – one says to oneself: ‘He is right’."
"Something is missing, however, and my group permanently feels somewhat uneasy."
"This uneasiness would, if I might picture it once again as something visible, truly disappear if the sustainable development strategy that you are announcing for December did not prove to be the poor child of Daddy Barroso because, you know, that notorious image of your three children remains engraved in our memories."
"I should like to try to make myself understood: you constantly refer to the US economy, but are you aware that the ecological footprint of the US economy is six times greater than what the planet can bear, while for the European economies, this footprint varies between three and four times what the planet can bear?"
"That is what a study carried out by the World Wide Fund indicates, and it would be interesting if, as part of this sustainable development strategy, the Commission were to tell us whether it recognises this finding and if it draws any conclusions from it in terms of European public policies."
"As regards the issue of businesses and competitiveness, ecologists are absolutely convinced that businesses are not the main, but the crucial, actors in terms of sustainable development."
"That is why, in knowing that businesses are torn between the duty to be accountable to their shareholders each quarter and the need to draw up strategies on sustainable development and long-term investment, my group, together with the European Parliament, constantly emphasise the need to set objectives backed up by figures."
"We therefore want 20% to 25% renewable energy by 2020 and we want cars that consume 2.5 litres of petrol per 100 km by 2020, because 70% of oil consumption is linked to transport in the European Union."
"As far as the economic and social issue is concerned, Mr Barroso, it would be wise to convince the people that the single European market cannot be constructed on the basis of social dumping."
"Let it be known from this moment on – by doing so, you will not exceed your prerogatives – that the compromise put forward by Mrs Gebhardt on the country of origin principle can be acceptable to the Commission."
"Let the new Member States and, above all, the governments know too that the restriction clauses imposed on labour law for all EU citizens are useless and unacceptable and that, on 1 May 2006, they can be removed."
"There you have a number of suggestions that I wanted to share with you."
"I do not have time to continue but, if you like, I could speak to you about them in another context."
"– Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of the parliamentary term I said in this House that this Parliament resulted from elections in which all the government parties were defeated – starting with your country, Mr Barroso, Portugal."
"That was the sign of an economic and social crisis that was also related to European policies, that is to say free-trade policies."
"We needed decisive action but did not get it – not even after the referendum results in France and the Netherlands rejecting the Constitutional Treaty."
"In fact there was a temptation to ignore the people, instead of changing the policy."
"We then had the presidency of Mr Blair, who presents himself as the answer to Europe’s problems when it is clear that he is an integral part of these problems."
"Indeed, his presidency is coming to an end and we have not even reached agreement on the budget."
"This is a failure for which you, Mr Barroso, must carry equal responsibility with Mr Blair, in that you and your Commission have gone along with all the stages of the crisis as it unfolded and indeed have ended up by making things worse."
"What can we say about your most recent proposals, when you spoke to us about a simplification that in fact would mean not doing the good things, such as the REACH directive, but instead doing the bad things, such as the Bolkestein directive?"
"The point is that the free-trade route is taking Europe down a blind alley."
"The problem is exemplified not by Europe or by enlargement or by Turkey, but by free trade; and today you have once again suggested that we go down this blind alley."
"Instead we need something quite different."
"We need to draw up a plan to revive qualified development and a form of social cohesion that would be capable of reinstating the European social model as an alternative to the North American model, not as a poor copy of it."
"To do this we need a sounder budget that is not pared down to the bone, and a package of regulations that would promote upward harmonisation and not the social ‘dumping’ of the Bolkestein directive."
"We need cooperation within Europe and with other countries to relaunch qualified development, not senseless competition or the ruinous dictatorship of the World Trade Organisation."
"We must give priority to innovation and the environment, not to the absurd and disastrous revival of nuclear energy."
"We need communication networks that promote respect for the environment and do not connive at its destruction."
"We need to give citizenship to immigrants and ensure that there is no repetition of the episodes we have seen in Lampedusa and Melilla."
"We must guarantee democracy and not the so-called security packages that adversely affect democratic rights and have furthermore been rejected by the UK Parliament."
"We must choose peace, not war."
"We should give preference to a democratic Parliament, not just one more bureaucratic authority."
"Finally we need governments of the Left which look to change and not to large, unacceptable coalitions."
"We propose an alternative European Left, more and more closely linked to a European society that wants change."
". Mr President, I congratulate Mr Barroso for producing this remarkable document."
"Mr Barroso, your determination to create a unitary state of Europe has not been diminished by anything as inconvenient as the referendum results in France and Holland."
"I even wondered whether Mr Blair’s drive to have less regulation and to scrap unnecessary laws might slow you up a little bit; but no, undaunted you have produced the most ambitious work programme ever seen in the history of the European Union."
"What a pity that the British Presidency could not be bothered to turn up this morning to listen to you!"
"On top of the extension of powers over justice and home affairs, the establishment of EU visas, everything down to regulations on children’s toys, I notice that on the budget you say that there must be adequate audit and control systems."
"That is pretty rich in the very week that the Court of Auditors is refusing to sign off your accounts for the eleventh year in a row."
"You lost the Constitution and you are now treating the voters of France and Holland with contempt."
"Many French people will have felt that by voting ‘no’ they would have stopped the flow of European bureaucracy."
"However, just as their faith in the Maginot Line failed them in 1940, once again the enemies of free, independent states are coming in around the side and engulfing all."
"You proved from this work programme that you have learned nothing and that you simply do not get it."
". Mr President, I wish to thank President Barroso and the entire Commission for being here this morning."
"It is a pity that Parliament could not reciprocate with an equivalent level of attendance."
"One of the key factors in assessing the work programme is to verify that the ideas and proposals put forward in it respond to the current needs of the citizens of the European Union."
"I should like to refer briefly to one or two points President Barroso made in his presentation."
"He rightly spoke about the importance of the Doha Round and the impact that will have, not just within Europe but around the globe, on increasing trade and also on delivering on aspects of social justice, though not a comprehensive package of social justice."
"However, despite President Barroso’s reassurances, I am somewhat concerned at the attempts being made by people within the Commission and within this Parliament, in preparation for the Hong Kong round of talks, to demand more of European farmers."
"Farmers are being asked to make further reductions and sacrifices, despite being told that the 1999 reform constituted a final settlement on the CAP."
"They were then told, in 2003 and 2004, that further adjustments had to be made to take account of the approaching World Trade Organization talks."
"Suddenly we discover that even more demands are being made on the European agricultural sector."
"These are demands that cannot be met if we want to maintain a viable, sustainable agricultural sector within the European Union for the future."
"This is not just about protecting farmers’ interests; it is also a very clear and important issue regarding food security, security of food supply and of the standard and quality of food, and security as regards ensuring that biodiversity and the available alternatives are maintained in the rural areas of Europe."
"Moving on to the various proposals within the work programme, I welcome the initiatives now being taken on a communication on children’s rights."
"It is high time that the European Union took the rights of children seriously, as they constitute over 40% of our population but have no standing or status in European policies or ideas, except in the words we use to express our will to protect them."
"Owing to technological progress, those ideas on children’s rights must now also be linked into cyber security, as we have seen the Internet – despite its wonderful intent, brilliant innovation and the opportunities it presents to us all – being used by people who wish to corrupt innocent minds and pervert the use of the Internet through trafficking in paedophilia and child pornography."
"With regard to sustainability, the rising price of oil and fuel in recent months has sent shockwaves through each and every economy, as well as shocking private consumers."
"Let us not forget that the price of oil has an impact not just on the economy as a whole, but also on you and me and all individual consumers, not only in the fuel we put into our cars, but also in the price of goods in our shops, our journeys to and from work and so on. The time is ripe to move towards a common European market in energy in which we can utilise the collective strength of the 25 Member States to lever a better price, and to bring together the minds, intelligence and innovation available in those 25 countries to look into alternative fuel supplies, and in particular to look into new ways and new mechanisms for conserving energy."
"That is why the proposal for a biofuels directive is also to be welcomed."
"However, greater focus should be placed on solar, wind and water energy, as this can also contribute a great deal towards a final energy plan."
"Lastly, no matter what anybody says, the financial perspective is the only game in town."
"If we do not have the money, we cannot undertake the actions and policies we want."
"However, in determining what the financial perspective should be, the onus must be on the Member States to come up with a package, because once again they are the paymasters of future European Union action."
"The decision as to whether to contribute monies to the funds we need to implement these important measures rests with them."
"The fact that the governments have so far failed to reach agreement on this is unacceptable to everyone."
"In fact, it is ironic that the governments of the new Member States are the ones giving the lead on how to resolve the financial perspectives issue."
"However, we must not use this failure to secure an agreement as an excuse to block, hinder or stymie the efforts that can currently be made."
"I welcome the opportunity to work with you, President Barroso, and with your Commission to deliver on this programme."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, the Ceuta affair has come and gone, the Melilla affair has come and gone and now it is the suburbs that are on fire."
"The worldwide media is asking questions and, as for us, what are we doing?"
"Drafting a legislative programme."
"To deal with what?"
"Global warming, for example, which seems logical; when cars and schools are on fire, there is indeed a problem in terms of global warming and, therefore, in terms of respecting the Kyoto protocol."
"Alongside Mrs Fischer-Boel, we could, moreover, do slightly more to destroy our agriculture, such as it is; Mr Mandelson would obtain an agreement in Hong Kong and, for our part, we would have slightly higher levels of unemployment."
"Let us adopt a few more directives, and the mountain of legislation will end up rendering us quite powerless."
"I would even go so far as to propose a title for Mr Barroso’s legislative programme: ‘Operation smoke and mirrors’, for the programme is a smoke screen, concealing nice ideas, but ones that only mask tragedies."
"One final word, Mr Barroso: one Christmas day in the fifth century A.D., the Rhine froze over following a climate change."
"Thousands of chariots of fire crossed the Rhine, and Rome was plundered."
"Do you know what the Roman Senate was doing during that winter of 483?"
"It was drafting a legislative programme."
"– Mr Cohn-Bendit, please refrain from commenting."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, with 96 priority projects, 32 of which are legislative in character, this Europe of ours cannot be accused of not making plans, so respect to it, especially when one bears in mind the fact that the list does not even include the legislative programming that actually should be a priority for 2006, in the shape of some 50 legal bases for the multiannual programmes for the 2007-2013 period."
"Basically, then, the package we are discussing today gives little outward indication of its true contents, and what has become of subsidiarity or of the test for it?"
"The Council, which today is conspicuous by its absence, has, once again, embarrassingly failed to take part in this planning work, let alone set priorities for it."
"The two presidencies for next year, Austria and Finland, have even, in a letter dated 19 October, gone so far as to announce their own work programme for 2006, so that is something for us to look forward to, as also to seeing how all these things can be brought together."
"It was the Council that could, by means of and in the course of this consultation procedure, have given a fine indication of its commitment to subsidiarity by involving the national parliaments in the manner provided for by the Constitution."
"It could have left its mark on this procedure, by approaching Parliament and the Commission, instead of leaving us all in the dark about what is meant to happen next and what proposals the Council itself is going to make."
"Parliament has set up a reserve for posts in the Commission, which will be paid out only if the work programme is agreed to."
"It would be a good thing if this work programme really were to include all the projects that we know even now to be on the agenda for 2006, and if it paid greater heed to the idea of subsidiarity as regards procedures and substance."
"Mr President, the Commission said that the Lisbon Strategy was reflected in this work programme."
"It is indeed partly reflected in it, but not fully."
"You perhaps remember that we had a debate about the balance in the Lisbon Strategy."
"We in Parliament expressed the view that social policy, social justice and social cohesion should not be seen as add-ons after growth and employment."
"I believed we had agreed that we should see social policy as an integrated part of the Lisbon Process."
"This is not reflected in this work programme."
"The social dimension is very small."
"We have talked about the fact that better legislation does not by definition mean less legislation."
"I note that, in the social area, there is no legislation at all."
"There are three communications and a Green Paper, and these are things I welcome; but there is no legislation at all."
"It is not the case that Parliament has not come up with proposals."
"Allow me to discuss a couple of these."
"The first concerns the new forms of employment: what are known as the atypical forms of employment, of which there is now an avalanche and which involve less security, reduced influence and probably more stress in workplaces."
"We have demanded a directive that addresses these new forms of employment."
"Secondly, you, Mr Barroso, and I have been at a conference on restructuring."
"I understood that we were agreed that, if we were to be able to carry out the restructuring, we had to do it in a way that involved employees in the process."
"We have instruments at European level."
"We have the European Works Councils, and we in Parliament have demanded an overhaul of the European Works Councils."
"We have seen nothing of all this."
"Finally, I just want to address the issue of a programme for integrating people with disabilities. This would be a non-discrimination programme, applicable not just in the labour market sphere, but everywhere."
"That too is conspicuous by its absence."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the President of the Commission for delivering the Commission’s programme very much in a political context."
"I want to take up one small point: when I arrived in this House six years ago, unlocking the potential of Europe’s internal market was seen in the context of taking full advantage of e-commerce and the arrival of the euro."
"To that end, there were many initiatives in the field of civil justice, ensuring that where we give the possibility to move, to do business, to work, to innovate, to trade and to buy, we deliver the balancing legal framework that would give security and access to justice."
"The war on terrorism has intervened and the whole criminal justice area has become paramount, but should it be to the exclusion of civil justice, which merits just one paragraph and no new initiatives or even consultations in this programme?"
"You only have to look at our postbags to see that we are not delivering in the area of civil justice."
"You need only look at the agenda of the Committee on Petitions."
"The lives of more of our citizens are blighted by the lack of access to civil justice or cross-border redress mechanisms than, fortunately, are directly touched by terrorism."
"Please concentrate on civil justice."
"I have familiarised myself with the document from the Commission."
"My conclusion is unambiguous: a lot of talk and not much action."
"Globalisation, which is in reality an updated version of capitalism, is taken as a given, as if it were a law of nature."
"EU legislation promotes the notion that European work should become cheap labour, the export of jobs abroad and flying the flag of convenience in the Member States’ job markets."
"I searched the work programme with interest for a legal basis for the President of the Commission’s announcement that France is to be given an additional subsidy of EUR 50 million on account of the vehicles that have been burnt in the streets in recent weeks."
"I do not believe that the current legislation is a legal basis for this form of financial assistance and nothing like it is being proposed in the Commission’s work programme either."
"Is the intention to bribe France to adopt the EU’s financial plans using illegal subsidies?"
"The Commission proposes to manipulate public opinion in such a way that it takes a more favourable view of it."
"This is propaganda and indoctrination, although the Commission speaks of a communications deficit."
"In the way it disseminates information, the Commission represents dictatorship by the majority, or democracy is measured by the attitude the majority adopt when lending an ear to the minorities."
"In any case, the majority in the referenda in France and the Netherlands voted against the Commission’s communication and propaganda dictatorship."
"Rejecting the Constitution was democracy and did not drive the EU into a crisis."
"The failure to adopt the financial framework for 2007-2013, however, is holding up the work of the EU."
"As this is possibly a state of emergency, the Commission should start drafting one-year Structural Fund programmes and other programmes in other words plan B."
"Mr President, the national and regional parliaments should now go through the whole of the annual programme and, under the heading ‘Less and better’, monitor it on the basis of the principles of proximity and proportionality."
"We want to tackle fewer subjects and, in return, do better-quality work."
"The EU should only adopt binding legislation in cross-border areas in which the national parliaments themselves cannot legislate effectively."
"In that way, voters would have nothing to lose but everything to gain, and we should have the right of codecision instead of being powerless."
"If, however, the EU arrogates power to itself in areas in which the national parliaments themselves can legislate, we lose in terms of both influence and democracy."
"Monitoring on the basis of the principle of proximity should begin in Parliament’s specialist committees, so that the social committees deal with proposals in the social sphere and the transport committees with transport proposals etc. – a procedure adopted in Denmark’s European Affairs Committee last Friday."
"Subsequently, the European Affairs Committees should issue opinions and meet at the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees of Parliaments of the European Union (COSAC) in order to adopt the annual programme and to do so, preferably, in such a way that we can see who has voted for what."
"The annual programme should then be respected by, and debated in, the European Parliament and the Council."
"Only then shall the Commission be invited to prepare legislation, which would then have support from the bottom up. This would contrast with the present situation in which the Commission itself assumes the power and uses its monopoly on initiatives, its 3 000 secret working parties and its access to the Court of Justice to centralise ever more power in Brussels."
"There is nothing so bad that it is not good for something."
"Centralisation has fortunately led the voters to withhold their assent, as we saw in the Netherlands and France."
"The annual programme nonetheless contains a lot from the rejected Constitution."
"The ‘no’ votes should be respected."
"Everything from the Constitution should be excluded."
"Thank you, Mr President – if there is, in fact, anything to say thank you for."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"Europe is faced with demanding, clear and urgent challenges."
"There is no doubt that the 20th century has seen the old continent achieve levels of freedom, progress and prosperity that had never been previously reached."
"Nevertheless, this remarkable growth has also created new problems that give rise to inequalities, dangers and tensions."
"The recent events affecting the French suburbs are a clear signal that security problems no longer relate solely to dangers originating outside our frontiers."
"Once again, in fact, current events force us to look at what is happening on our own doorstep and invite us to seek solutions to everyday problems that are so frequent and familiar that all too often they escape our notice."
"Our present age is one of remarkable development coupled with infuriating stagnation; of possibilities that open up a better future but also of threatening germs; of an increase in wellbeing that nevertheless has led to the emergence of new diseases."
"It therefore seems clear that we still have a long way to go."
"We agree with the salient points of the proposal that we are considering."
"The Commission’s work programme, presented accurately and with conviction by Mr Barroso, is rightly centred on certain key objectives: prosperity, solidarity and security as well as the role of the Union as a global partner."
"These are issues that require unremitting commitment, an effective strategy and by extension adequate resources for measures that will have a genuine impact on the European socio-economic situation."
"Mr President, as my group’s coordinator in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I would like to welcome the attention given by the Commission to completing the internal market in a number of important areas and to thank the Commissioner and his team for that."
"We will follow it up very closely."
"Having said that, I am very critical of this document overall."
"It is a strange document."
"Colleagues were talking about priorities."
"I just want to quote from it: ‘The top priority today is to restore sustainable dynamic growth and jobs in Europe’."
"That is on page 27 of the document."
"In what sense do we have any priorities when we have a disconnected list of 96 items assembled together in arbitrary order, not making it clear which is legislative and which is non-legislative?"
"In any case I say this to you, Mr Barroso, that in any sense of work planning I want to know what is already in progress."
"I do not just want to know about 96 things that you are starting, I want to know how you are getting on with the existing work we have asked you to do and what priorities you are allocating to that."
"There is another thing I want to know, because I have no sense of this whatsoever."
"It is great to see all the members of your Commission here, but we want to see you working much better together, in more integrated policy-making, in order to tackle that crucial issue that you yourself put at the top of your agenda, which is that of competitiveness, jobs and growth in Europe."
"That is not going to be delivered by 96 separate proposals, but by your Commission working together to tackle that."
"Why can we not see that in your programme?"
"I say that also to Mrs Wallström who is sitting here and who is supposed to be helping us communicate these things – to be helping us."
"How can I go to my constituents and businesses in my constituency to say that the Commission is going to work on competitiveness and jobs with this set of 96 disconnected proposals?"
"I would say, however, that it is worth looking at what is going on in Commissioner Verheugen’s work on cars in the context of an integrated competitiveness initiative."
"I want to commend him for this initiative and for many others."
"Let us see more of that type of work and not this shopping list of disconnected proposals."
"Mr President, various previous speakers have already drawn the comparison with the United States."
"I am involved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which also has many transatlantic contacts."
"What I have noticed is that there is a kind of reversal in the assessment of developments, particularly on the financial market."
"I do not know whether you saw the headline of this morning’s , which once again read that the United States envies us for what this House achieved in the last part-session."
"In October, we tackled an 800-page tome of regulations on the banks’ capital requirements, which is placing us well ahead of the United States."
"People are not sufficiently aware of this."
"I do not know whether you are familiar with the book by Jeremy Rifkin about but that book too indicates that our perception in this respect is sometimes incorrect."
"What strikes me is that the Commission lacks the awareness that we could do much more with the Lisbon Strategy and with macro-economic policy."
"In Europe, we talk each other into the doldrums when a number of things go wrong, but we forget that they also present us with opportunities."
"We could, for example, capitalise on the surrounding the Stability and Growth Pact in order to achieve better macro-economic policy now and we could use our advantage in the area of financial markets regulations to effectively deploy the investments that this could produce and get the Commission to steer this macro-economic policy."
"I am afraid that the attitude that the market will manage on its own is also attributable to your liberal view."
"I think that the Americans could help you dispel this notion. The market cannot manage on its own."
"We will need to show the way, and in this we expect leadership from the Commission."
"European integration will not succeed unless it is founded on joint responsibility."
"It is not enough merely to establish a single market and single currency, even if they do further integration."
"The Commission’s priorities of prosperity, solidarity and security are important and right."
"There are 18.8 million unemployed in Europe – almost 20 million."
"What does the EU mean to them and what does it offer?"
"Not solidarity, prosperity or security at any rate."
"Mere words are not enough: we need concrete action."
"Mr President, the EU has to focus on the essential."
"The Commission’s decision to do away with unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy and simplify EU law should be supported."
"In addition, I hope that the principle of subsidiarity will at last be implemented."
"That would also bring our citizens closer to the EU and would provide the EU with a mandate to carry out its work."
"– Mr President, the Commission work programme reflects its honourable efforts to serve, in the best possible way, the imperialist interests of the European Union and the choices of big business."
"Despite the objections voiced in the Council, an agreement is being promoted with sweeping changes for the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013 at the expense of farmers and workers in general."
"The Commission is trying to adjust its legislative programme for 2006 to new circumstances not with changes of political direction, but on the basis of its commitments for its 5-year term of office and the choices of the monopolies."
"The main axis of its policy is communications policy."
"Corruption, bribery and class cooperation are becoming the means to encage the grass-roots masses and accept the most reactionary, anti-grass roots measures."
"More liberalisation of the markets, with electricity and natural gas in their sights."
"Integration of the internal market in services, post offices and so forth, privatisation of public utilities, new shipping policy measures and the promotion of new tax measures to the detriment of the workers."
"A uniform strategy to promote the anti-grass roots Lisbon objectives on the basis of the national action programmes and the promotion of anti-labour plans for young people women and the workers in general."
"This Commission programme is completely opposed to the ambitions and aims of the workers, which is why their struggles over coming months will escalate for the right to work, for a better standard of living, to defend grass-roots freedoms, for peace and for equality."
"Mr President, even though I am somewhat taken aback by the Commission’s indulgence in this kind of denial, and the fact that it is – to all intents and purposes – completely ignoring the blatant warning emanating from the French and Dutch ‘no’ at the European referendums, 2006 will, above all, be the year of the definitive start of the accession negotiations between the Commission and Turkey, which is further proof not only of the Commission’s complete insensitivity to the democratic will of the majority of the Europeans, but also of its willingness to disregard own legal rules, the otherwise so sacred ."
"I am in any event curious to find out what tricks, lies and falsehoods will be peddled by the Commission, despite the prediction by the former Commissioner for Agriculture, Franz Fischler, that Turkey would, ultimately, be capable of being integrated into European agricultural policy after all, and that the costs would not be intolerable."
"It will not stop us from reiterating that Turkey’s accession to the European Union is both untenable and undemocratic."
"Mr President, one of President Barroso’s themes this morning was the need for us to inspire the people of Europe, too many of whom have become disillusioned with the whole concept of our European Union."
"To do that, we need to give voice to the reasons for Europe in terms of how Europe is relevant to people’s lives and their worries, their hopes and their ambitions."
"We must help Europe rediscover its drive towards economic growth and competitiveness, ruthlessly cutting out waste and bureaucracy and concentrating on the prerequisites for that agenda."
"Those prerequisites are, admittedly, deregulation and lower taxes, but they are also healthier people living in a healthier environment."
"Above all, we must afford efforts to sustain those less able to cope with challenges and opportunities of life, those who live with disabilities or life-threatening diseases and poverty."
"Therefore, we look to the Commission to step up its responsibilities for health, health promotion, public health, health emergencies, mental health, disability, patient mobility and information for patients."
"We also need to press on with our agenda for the environment, with climate change, emissions trading, air quality, waste reduction, reuse and recycling, noise and the urban environment, the protection of wildlife and habitats, and a reduction in animal testing."
"What we have to say with regard to Europe is equally relevant to our policies for the developing world, but none of this is possible without adequate monitoring and enforcement or proper budgetary control."
"Those aspects so often let down our good intentions in Europe and contribute to the public doubts about Europe’s ability to be good news for them."
"Mr President, I would ask you to raise the question of the poor attendance today at the next meeting of the Conference of Presidents."
"I think we owe respect to the Commission: all the Commissioners who could be here are here."
"The poor attendance in this House is simply unacceptable and shows a lack of respect for the Commission."
"I will certainly bring that up in my own group tonight."
"Mr Barroso, the problem is not what is in your programme."
"In the little time available to me, I should like to outline the problem in a number of major points."
"In your oral presentation today, you said:"
"‘We need to link these programmes to our political priorities, to improve the Union’s economic governance and to strengthen national and European efforts in relation to reform and investment’ and you continued: ‘an investment at national level, but also at European level with a view to tomorrow’s economy, to innovation, to knowledge and to new infrastructures."
"These two types of investment must go hand in hand’."
"Good. Agreed."
"President of the Commission, let us make a deal today in which you tell this Parliament that, in the next weeks and months, you and your Commission will formulate a strategy to ensure that, when we meet at the European Employment Council in spring, we have this message as a common approach from the European Council."
"You, together with the Economic Affairs Commissioner and the Commission as a whole, will inspire the governments to make a deal, promising in the next two, three or four years to invest simultaneously and to be coordinated."
"I am not taking powers away from you."
"I merely want us to coordinate our investments so that we can use our economic interdependence proactively."
"In essence, my dream is the same as the Commission’s: this wonderful Europe could achieve further growth."
"Yes, we should reform, but we need more investment, growth and jobs, and that demands coordination, so let us make a strategy together."
"I await your response."
"As you requested, Mr Rasmussen, I will pass on your comments on the poor attendance here to the competent bodies of Parliament."
"Of course, the session Presidency appreciates the fact that the Commission is here in force for this important debate, even though the Council benches are rather empty."
"Mr President, a year ago, President Barroso promised us during the Buttiglione case that he would make European fundamental rights a key priority."
"That is just as well, for that is also what the public expects."
"Unfortunately, there is no trace of this promise in the work programme."
"There may be a communication in 2006 about gender equality, which we welcome, but what about the other categories of discrimination?"
"What has become of horizontal anti-discrimination legislation?"
"All citizens must be able to have their rights upheld before the court; if not, the EU anti-discrimination policy is not worth the paper it was written on."
"Why, in fact, has the promised feasibility study into new Article 13 legislation not been included and what is the latest on the proposals requested by Parliament with regard to the free movement of married same-sex couples?"
"Will President Barroso’s Commission really promote fundamental rights?"
"Will we get a real Union of values or will we not move beyond empty promises?"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Members of the Commission, I am here representing the Committee on Legal Affairs, and I have to say that, even in terms of our Committee’s very modest expectations, the Commission’s legislative and work programme is undemanding and highly disappointing."
"In all the areas in which we have made our interest known, and which you, verbally at any rate, have declared to be priorities – among them civil law, copyright, human rights, children’s rights, consumers’ rights – none of the proposals are legislative in character."
"In some areas on the importance of which we always agree – patent law being one of them – we can see no initiatives that are likely to get Europe any further forward – even though we have always agreed that patent law is crucial to innovation."
"Nor can I see any initiative being taken on services of general economic interest."
"At the same time, though, we cannot fail to note that you are withdrawing proposals for legislation that matter a great deal to us, although we have to admit that there are problems with them, for example the statute on companies established on a mutual basis, and European law on voluntary associations."
"We have, for years now, been endeavouring to endow the commercial sector with European statutes of its own, yet we are evidently denying the cooperative sector, the social economy and civil society the reliefs that European law could provide."
"We have ourselves proposed areas in which we can withdraw legislation and in which we do not regard European regulation as necessary, yet the Commission has not responded to our proposals."
"One example that springs to my mind is mediation, where we were given a draft directive to examine even though we had said, when the Green Paper came out, that this was an area to which subsidiarity applied and there was no need for legislation on it at European level."
"My overall view is that you have listened too little to what this House has been telling you in the preparatory phase."
"Mr President, I welcome many aspects of the Commission programme but I am disappointed that there is not more reference to disabled people or elderly people."
"I would have like to have seen a specific disability directive that outlawed discrimination in access to goods and services and similarly one on age."
"With regard to health and safety at work, I would also like to see an amendment to the 2000 biological agents directive, to protect health workers from contracting HIV and Hepatitis C from needle-stick injuries."
"There are over one million such injuries across the EU every year."
"However, I welcome the Commission President’s commitment to cutting down on unnecessary legislation, which of course is a burden on business."
"In that spirit, could he look again at the 2004 electromagnetic fields directive and the serious impact it could have on the use of state-of-the-art MRI scanners and see his way to bringing forward an amendment to this directive to make sure that MRI scanners will be protected in the future?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate Mr Barroso on the report he has given us this morning."
"However, like many of my colleagues I too ask him to bring together its priorities, so as to define clearly the package of proposals and the objectives that we wish to achieve during the next five years."
"We all remember that the previous Commission under Mr Prodi managed in the event to achieve only 50% of what was initially envisaged in its programme."
"I do not think that initiatives of that type are useful, especially for a Europe that needs to believe in itself."
"The first thing that I should like to suggest is that you should collate and prioritise the objectives that we wish to achieve as soon as possible."
"Next we must certainly dedicate ourselves to other important issues."
"A great many points are addressed in the report that you presented this morning."
"Speaking as the internal coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I should like to emphasise one point in particular on which you are no doubt committed to doing something important: namely the creation of a ‘road map’ on gender equality."
"As well as this point, I should also like us to consider the theme of work."
"As you know, there is a conflict in Europe today between those who have more rights and those who have fewer, those who have jobs and those who do not, those who have access to good schools and teachers and those who have no such access, as is the case in the suburbs of Paris."
"This is a problem that affects one country today, but could affect others tomorrow."
"In this connection the role of women in the Community and above all the role of women in the workplace is of fundamental importance."
"It is therefore necessary, in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, to address the issue of the under-representation of women in the workplace and the fact that they are often forced into badly paid jobs that require no qualifications."
"Mr President, I also wish to welcome the presence of the whole Commission and deplore the absence of many colleagues, which is in part because we all have TV monitors in our offices and it is so easy to watch the debates whilst working in your office."
"However, it would be far better if Members were here."
"Nevertheless, what is being said is not being lost, of course: it is being heard outside."
"I welcome the reference in the Commission’s work programme to Plan D for democracy, dialogue and debate."
"That is not the focus of our discussion now."
"We must remember that this work programme is very important but that it is taking place in a wider context, which is a profound debate about where our European Union is going, what its future is."
"We are in a period of reflection – and in a period of reflection about the Constitution – which has begun not on the text but on the context."
"This work programme is part of that wider context."
"The future of our social economic model with the special summit at Hampton Court is part of that context."
"The need to find in December that crucial deal that we were close to in Luxembourg on the medium-term budget is part of that context."
"If we can get the context right, including the work programme, then we will be able to come back and look at the text of the Constitution in one or two years’ time and see how we can best move forward on that."
"Let me quickly take up one other point: better regulation."
"We are all behind you on that, Mr Barroso."
"However, in the context where those anti-Europeans in my country and others portray the European Union as one massive bureaucracy-producing machine spewing out regulations, it is incumbent upon all of us to point out that, when we get it right, European legislation is an exercise in cutting red tape, relieving burdens on business, providing one set of rules for the common market, one patent, one registration for a trademark, one form to fill in, one fee to pay instead of 25."
"Good European regulation cuts bureaucracy and red tape."
"That point must also be made in this debate."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Commissioners, today’s debate proves that a real culture of dialogue has been established between the Commission and Parliament."
"With regard to the programme, which, far from being a bureaucratic or statistical exercise, is a vital political element – and I, as the Chairman of the Conference of Committee Chairmen, am delighted by that – I would like to thank Mrs Wallström for her many appearances before our Conference, and I also thank the Commissioners who conducted bilateral discussions with the relevant parliamentary committees throughout the procedure."
"Of course, some improvements are still needed, including in Parliament, as regards our attendance in this Chamber."
"Subject to the analysis of the work programme that the political groups proposed and will conduct, with a view to adopting a proposal for a resolution, during the part-session in December, I think I can say that this programme contains the principal priorities set out by the parliamentary committees in its main chapters, namely priority, solidarity, security and external responsibility."
"On the other hand, two points of fundamental disagreement have come to light concerning the area of freedom, security and justice with regard to human rights."
"Certain proposals have not been retained by the Commission."
"However, the important thing is that Parliament, as co-legislator, must be kept fully informed of the reasons why the Commission, in exercising its right of initiative, has not followed up on Parliament’s wishes."
"I would also like to mention the objective of the Lisbon Agenda: with regard to employment and competition, cohesion and research, we need a budget and a financial perspective."
"Finally, the programme represents only one aspect of a broader agenda under the rubric ‘better regulation’ and, in this regard, we attach considerable importance to the transposition and simplification of European legislation."
"A decent solution is required in terms of comitology and I would like to stress the need, next year, to include simplification measures and withdrawal proposals in the legislative and work programme, in order to give this exercise greater visibility and transparency."
"I am delighted with the commitment that Mrs Wallström made in this regard during our last meeting on 13 October and I am convinced that all of the parliamentary committees will be active in ensuring that this programme is implemented."
"Mr President, the Commission programme represents an attempt to assess the situation of Europe and the European Union, and to identify the threats we are facing."
"I suggest that we should therefore take a look at what is new and original about the Commission’s proposals."
"They relate to the achievement of prosperity through knowledge, of solidarity through work, and of security through the restriction of civil liberties and law enforcement."
"I would ask whether this is an appropriate plan of action for an institution that acts as the guardian of the Treaties, and whether these are in fact your priorities, or rather a series of promises and pipe dreams that you hope will be self-fulfilling."
"I should now like to get down to business, and to begin by examining the Commission’s proposals concerning the Constitutional Treaty."
"In the programme description, the Commission regrets that the Constitution will not be ratified in the foreseeable future."
"It goes on to say that it intends to play an active part in national debates, and to support these debates."
"Mr Barroso, this approach leaves much to be desired."
"It is not enough to express one’s regret and to wait for national debates to provide a solution."
"The Commission needs to provide an impetus."
"The second issue I should like to focus on is better lawmaking."
"We all want better legislation that is more effective and also easier for citizens to understand, but I have my doubts as to whether this is in fact what the Commission is likely to achieve."
"For example, it is patently obvious that withdrawing 68 legislative proposals will not make the remaining legislation initiated by the Commission better or more comprehensible."
"It will not bring it closer to the citizens either."
"This is not what is meant by simpler legislation."
"My final point is that in my opinion the Commission’s stated intention to set up a ‘new structure’ responsible for implementing better legislation has an ominous ring to it, since it would mean replacing the current system, where proposals are judged on their content, by a formal procedure."
"My impression is that the Commission is acting in accordance with Parkinson’s Law, and following the principle whereby a new institution is set up every time the course of action becomes unclear."
"Mr Barroso, we expect fewer lofty words, fewer promises, and a greater number of courageous and effective actions."
"It is not just the Members of this House who expect such things, but also the citizens of the European Union."
"Mr President, the European Commission’s work programme for 2006 is going in the right direction as regards social responsibilities, labour law and jobs."
"This can certainly be said of the initiatives relating to working hours, delocalisation and people who are disadvantaged for a variety of reasons, and the initiatives in the area of health and safety at work."
"At the same time, however, we must see that citizens, the players in economic life, object to the excessively bureaucratic procedures."
"We must therefore make sure that we give small and medium-sized enterprises the most effective help possible, namely by simplifying the legislative environment for SMEs in the European Union and making it more transparent."
"I was very pleased to hear Commission President Barroso’s clear commitment to creating a unified market for services."
"I believe this is necessary in equal measure for competitiveness and success, and for creating new jobs."
"At the same time, I would also like to add that the Commission will have a special role to play when, in the course of the year, it assesses experiences relating to the free movement of labour."
"We are confident that it will not simply produce an objective analysis, but it will act as a genuine engine and catalyst in ensuring that transitional restrictions are lifted as soon as possible."
"This step is an important one in terms of completing the single market and will lead to the creation of many new jobs."
"We are therefore confident that the Commission will make progress simultaneously in the areas of competitiveness and of creating an internal market that will guarantee growth, and also in terms of developing a legislative environment in the social sphere based on European values."
"These are the most important challenges."
"We need balanced policy in these areas to ensure that we do not miss the 2012 express connecting service for Lisbon."
"Mr President, the work programme for 2006 gives the European institutions a great opportunity."
"It gives us the chance to show the people that we have understood them; that we have understood that the negative outcomes to the referendums in France and the Netherlands had something to do with Europe’s habit of over-regulating and denying people their right to take decisions as adults; that we have understood that all that Europe is meant to do is to set the framework conditions and that it must not get obsessed with detail and interfere in the nation states’ powers and responsibilities."
"I welcome the Commission’s promise of better regulation in 2006."
"I welcome the references in the introduction to the work programme to better regulation, subsidiarity, cost-efficiency and impact assessments."
"I do see the beginnings of good things in the work programme, notably in the fields of growth and security policy, but the overall impression that I get from it is, unfortunately, more of ‘business as usual’ than of ‘better regulation’."
"There are three things I would like to mention."
"The first is the Financial Perspective."
"I find it regrettable that the Commission is taking no active part in resolving this conflict."
"I regret the absence of proposals as to how we might, even with less money, pursue an effective structural policy, perhaps with joint funding by the private sector or by means of interest rate subsidies."
"Secondly, there are the new directives on the protection of the environment and on the saving of energy."
"There are over a dozen items of European legislation on energy efficiency alone."
"We ought really to delete three old directives for every new one planned, but nothing is being done along these lines."
"Why, thirdly, is Europe laying claim to more and more powers in social matters?"
"Do we really need a European Green Paper on the rights of married and unmarried couples, such as the one that is planned?"
"That will make us look ridiculous in the eyes of everyone from Lithuania to Greece."
"Despite the many positive approaches that it contains, I have to say, with regret, that work programme does not give the overall impression that we have understood the signals that the people of Europe have been sending."
"I call for a more in-depth debate on the legitimacy of European legislation, and for a real start to be made on making over-regulation a thing of the past."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, we are here to discuss the work programme on which we want to embark in 2006."
"The first thing I want to say – and I say it not only to the Commission, but also to my fellow-Members of the European Parliament, is that less and better regulation, which we put on our own agenda and demand of ourselves, is also something that we should take seriously in our demands on the Commission as regards what it is due to present on the subject of the internal market and efficiency."
"We must not regularly frustrate our own demands by calling for the European legislator as soon as we decide something is needed, so a bit more self-discipline is called for."
"As far as better regulation is concerned, although the Commission’s first actions are very positive and constitute a first step in the right direction, we would ask it to be more consistent in its future actions and to set a benchmark for comparison of transposition in the countries that are notorious for ‘gold plating’, so that it may be made perfectly clear which are transposing European legislation effectively and well and which are imposing additional burdens."
"I have another request to make of the Commission: our response to the Basel II report was to set up the ‘Friends of the Presidency’ to work on comitology and bring about agreements on Parliament’s rights between the Commission, the Council and Parliament itself."
"This work is now beginning."
"The forthcoming legislation will, as regards the comitology especially of financial services have essential clauses permitting it to lapse."
"It is at this point that I will ask the Commission – for Commissioner McCreevy has done some preparatory work on this – to help us reach an agreement to make the comitology between Parliament and the Council more manageable."
"The Council is in the sort of position in which it does not always show itself to be particularly cooperative."
". Mr President, I will start by making a few general comments, and I will then try to answer the specific questions that I have been asked."
"First of all, I am delighted, as Mr Daul said in his capacity as Chairman of the Conference of Committee Chairman, at the cooperation that has been established between the Commission, on the one hand, and Parliament and its various committees, on the other, during the preparation of this work programme."
"This is important, because we have endeavoured to respond to many of your expectations."
"We must recognise, as one Member of this Parliament said, that this has resulted in 96 specific measures."
"You thought that this was too many, but, listening to you all this morning, it seems that some of you would have liked even more."
"On this subject, we must be honest."
"We must reach a balance, and this balance means that, whilst setting ourselves clear priorities – and we have clear priorities for the renewed Lisbon Strategy – we must respond to the very varied nature of the expectations expressed here in our discussions with you."
"I have called on the Commission as a whole and all of the commissioners to be serious, realistic and objective in preparing this programme."
"I want a much higher implementation rate than in the past, and I am proud to be able to tell you that, this year, we are already going to achieve a much higher implementation rate than in the past with regard to the Commission’s work."
"We have concentrated on certain objectives that we really want to achieve."
"Of course, our general programme extends over five years."
"We are now going to present the programme for 2006."
"Not everything will be achieved in 2006, but what I would ask is that you analyse our work in terms of realistic, concrete objectives."
"I would also like to thank you for the generally favourable reception that our initiative on ‘better regulation’ has received."
"This is a concern, as has just been said, that is not restricted to the Commission, but must be shared by all the institutions, including Parliament."
"Now, ladies and gentlemen, I will turn to your specific questions."
"With regard to the sustainable development strategy, Mr Jonckheer, I must tell you that it is not my poor child, quite the opposite."
"When, at Gleneagles, I, on behalf of the European Commission, submitted to our US partners and to others the importance of climate change as a major priority, it was certainly not a poor child to which I was referring."
"When we announce a new strategy for sustainable development, which we are going to present in December, that also shows our commitment to this problem."
"When we adopt, as we have just done, a set of thematic strategies for the environment, that once again shows our commitment to environmental protection."
"That, therefore, is what we are going to do."
"We will do so whilst of course attempting, as I have already said, to make our various objectives compatible with each other and to ensure that they reinforce each other."
"Mr Swoboda, you raised, amongst other things, two questions: one on tax harmonisation and one on the European Institute of Technology."
"On tax harmonisation, we must of course respect the consensus reached between our Member States: namely that we must work to draw up a common tax base."
"That is why we are endeavouring to reach an agreement on a common base for taxation in Europe."
"We are convinced that this will enable us to make significant reductions in the costs of business and investment in our countries, whilst still giving each Member State the freedom to set levels of company taxation."
"That is the European Commission’s position."
"With regard to research, we believe that centres of excellence in research must be strengthened throughout the EU."
"We believe that European universities should be at the top of the global rankings in terms of research, education and innovation."
"We must work to make our universities more attractive so that the best minds in the world turn to Europe, instead of going to the United States, as is the case today."
"We can have centres of academic excellence in Europe."
"That is why we must establish a stronger mechanism for cooperation between European universities, so that we can make the most of the potential of knowledge in Europe."
"That is why the efforts invested in creating a European Institute of Technology constitute an important aspect of our strategy for growth and jobs."
"With regard to the questions you raised on enlargement, Mrs Grossetête, we respect the commitments made unanimously by the Member States, by the European Council."
"That said, I want Parliament to know that the Commission will be rigorous and systematic in its evaluation of the progress made by all the candidate countries."
"With regard to the policy on demographics and the family, we are the ones who put this subject on the agenda of the Hampton Court summit and we now have a clear mandate from the European Council to contribute to these considerations, or, even better, to the specific measures that we are planning to announce."
"Thus, we will be taking action in this field, too."
"Coming to the concerns expressed by many of you, especially Mr Crowley, regarding agriculture and the multilateral negotiations, I can assure you that Europe will not allow itself to be forced into a defensive position in this context."
"We do not think that we need to take any more lessons on the opening up of markets from those whose markets are much more closed than ours, which is one of the most open markets in the world, if not the most open."
"We will be there to defend the interests of Europe."
"Children’s rights were also a problematic matter brought to our attention by Mr Crowley."
"We are fully committed to this agenda."
"Vice-President Frattini is now preparing proposals – to be discussed in the Commission very soon – for a communication that we hope to present in March 2006."
"Admittedly, the legal basis for legislation in this matter is not very clear, but we believe that we should not refrain from looking forward to better coordination between the European Union and Member States on children’s rights."
"You can count on our commitment to children’s rights and on all issues relating to civic rights, including the non-discrimination concerns that you have expressed."
"I should like to comment on Mr Rasmussen’s remarks."
"We agree that we need both elements: economic reform and investment."
"Indeed, we are starting to do that, and Hampton Court was a first important step in that direction."
"Member States, at the highest level, agreed there that we should now choose some specific areas for investment and a coordinated approach at European Union level, trying to combine the European Union level with the Member State level, for instance on energy and research."
"We now have some areas in which we can give a strong signal of commitment and a coordinated approach towards economic governance in Europe."
"We agree on that."
"The difficulty, Mr Rasmussen and colleagues, is largely that we are now working in the last year of the financial perspectives for this period."
"Now it is impossible to rearrange all the priorities for this year."
"As regards our analysis of the national reform programmes of the Member States, what we are doing now and – I promise this to you – what we will be doing is within the framework of the new Lisbon Strategy; we are trying to forge ahead not only based on an approach that reinforces our efforts in terms of economic and structural reform, but also based on a more common and integrated approach for investment so that we can boost growth and employment in Europe."
"I want to underline it because it is a good example of an approach at European Union level bringing added value to the efforts of the Member States."
"This idea of partnership between the Member States, the Commission and Parliament is the very basis on which we want to continue working with you for a renewed, stronger, more committed European Union project."
"Parliament would like to thank the President of the Commission and all of the Commissioners, who, as I said, are here in force."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on 14 December 2005."
"Mr President, having just come through, I find myself momentarily rather beside myself because there is, in the passageway from the Winston Churchill building – through which I have just come – an exhibition that lumps together the termination of pregnancy and concentration camps."
"I am outraged that such a thing is again being allowed in the European Parliament."
"Even if this exhibition has been authorised, I ask that a stop be put to it at once."
"There are pictures there that dishonour all women, and I ask that they be removed right now."
"Thank you, Mrs Gröner."
"I promise that, to the extent that it lies within the competence of the Bureau, we shall pass on this request immediately to the office of the Quaestors, in order to establish first of all whether this exhibition was officially authorised and to ascertain whether, given its contents, there are grounds for requesting its immediate removal."
"Mr President, I beg the indulgence of the House in bringing to its attention the latest appalling developments in the case of the Bulgarian nurses imprisoned in Libya."
"This morning, the Libyan Supreme Court delayed a decision on their case until January 2006."
"Colleagues will know that this is a most appalling case."
"The nurses have been in custody for more than six years now, and have been under sentence of death for over a year."
"It is disgraceful that this case is dragging on in the way that it is."
"I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to do everything within their powers to exert pressure and influence on the Libyan authorities in order to bring this case to a satisfactory conclusion and secure the release of the Bulgarian nurses, and indeed of the Palestinian doctor."
"We accept the motion pursuant to the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I shall keep this very brief."
"As what Mr Van Orden has described to the House is something that affects all the groups equally, I would like to give him my wholehearted backing and ask not only the Commission, but also the President of this House, to act at once to help secure these nurses and the Palestinian doctor their freedom at long last."
"Mr President, further to what Mrs Gröner has said, I would like to ask the Bureau not to exercise any kind of censorship, but rather to give us the opportunity to have a look at this exhibition – with which I am not familiar – and then take a majority decision tomorrow, as is customary in a democracy."
"As far as the last speech is concerned, I assure Mr Posselt that the Bureau has no intention whatever of exercising any form of censorship."
"We merely have the duty of verifying, through the Quaestors, whether the practices and procedure for authorisations have been effectively complied with and if so, whether the initiative and the exhibition conform, in content, form and pictures, with the rules of Parliament and with the practices that we follow on every such occasion."
"I imagine that the Quaestors will carry out this verification meticulously without transforming themselves into censors."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is my duty to inform the House that agreement on this text has been reached with the Council, if it is to be adopted in its present version. It could therefore be adopted at first reading."
"I nevertheless call upon the Commission to take account, in its work on other regulations, of some amendments tabled by members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats which, for legal reasons, we have not been able to include in this phase."
"They are amendments that relate to birth and adoption allowances and thus to the possibility of introducing these forms of social support within the Union and promoting mobility of labour."
"I therefore request that these topics, on which a common position has already been reached, should be included in the next regulations."
". Mr President, it is a special honour to present this report to you."
"It is an own-initiative report, and, moreover, a very justified one in view of the fact that eel stocks in Europe have dwindled by 95%."
"Even without a European constitution, we in the Committee on Fisheries can ensure that an own-initiative proposal such as the one before us now is translated into a directive."
"I thank the Commission for having given this its prompt attention."
"At the moment, a new directive has been tabled on the basis of this report and it shows that we in the Committee on Fisheries are given the opportunity to achieve decisive policy for European fisheries and to ensure that eel stocks remain steady, that the exports of glass eel to Central Asia are restricted and that control measures are put in place so that Member States can finally address this problem."
"Mr President, I have a one-word oral amendment, which has the support of the rapporteur and hopefully other parties and which I hope is not controversial."
"It concerns corporate social responsibility."
"The current amendment reads: ‘Supports the Commission’s efforts to raise awareness among multinational companies of their social responsibilities, which have as yet had little effect’."
"The oral amendment is to change the word ‘little’ to ‘limited’, so it would read: ‘... which have as yet had limited effect’."
"That concludes the vote."
". Given the enormous importance of the wine market to Portugal, both politicians and those more directly involved should give this issue the prominence that it deserves."
"I voted in favour of this proposal, as Portuguese farmers have not raised any underlying objections to it and there is broad support for it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the technical amendments that the Daul report proposes to introduce in the regulation concerning the common organisation of the market in wine is to develop further the practices relating to the treatment of wine. In my opinion, therefore, the amendments seem to lead, as I would wish, to a major increase in the European supply of products in this sector."
"We have furthermore a mandatory obligation to protect the consumer, now that fraud and imitations of foodstuffs are on the increase despite the efforts of the institutions and relevant control bodies. We must also safeguard the competitiveness of European products, which can hold their own in the international market only by rising to the challenge of quality."
"I also approve of the proposed derogations concerning sparkling wine production since they favour not only the Italian wine market but also culture and rural tradition, both of which I shall continue to defend vigorously."
"Finally, I consider that the proposal to add to the information on product labelling is very useful."
"I have therefore supported it and have also requested the Non-attached Group to support Mr Daul’s excellent report."
"We have voted against the three Daul reports."
"True, they involve fewer alterations to existing regulations."
"We wish, however, to emphasise our opposition on principle to common organisations of the markets in seeds, hops and wine."
"The whole of the common agricultural policy is an absurd creation and must be abolished."
". I support my colleague Mrs Berès' report amending the Agreement establishing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) enabling the bank to finance operations in Mongolia."
"I had the opportunity in May this year to visit Mongolia for the first time as a participant in the Socialist International's Asia-Pacific Committee in Ulan Bator."
"In Mongolia since the fall of Communism, unlike in many of the other countries of Central Asia, we have seen the establishment of a vigorous democracy where political power was transferred from one party to another on several occasions in a peaceful manner."
"It is a poor country where recent droughts have posed enormous problems."
"It urgently needs help with the current government's ambitious development programme."
"Today's vote will help this process and I strongly support it and hope it will mean funds will flow."
". The Athens Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2004 were the first to take place in an EU Member State, part of the Schengen area, without internal border controls."
"Regulation 1295/2003 was therefore adopted aimed at simplifying both the procedures for applying for and issuing Schengen visas for members of the Olympic family participating in the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Athens."
"In practical terms, it was designed to enable them to enter the territory of the State where the Games were held without being subject to other procedures or formalities, and to hold an Identity and Accreditation Card, alongside passports or other official travel documents."
"The report on its implementation in Greece concluded that the derogation system was successful and constituted a flexible and efficient process, which would not compromise the level of security required in the Schengen area."
"I therefore lend my backing to this proposal, which adopts an almost identical system, albeit this time by the codecision procedure, with some changes designed to adapt it to the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in Turin."
". The adjustment of visa requirements for athletes taking part in the 2004 Athens Olympics to allow Greece to meet both its Schengen requirements and its obligations to respect the Olympic Charter proved a great success."
"I am delighted to see this proposal to grant the same conditions to the athletes taking part in the 2006 winter olympics and the paralympics."
". We voted in favour of this report, which improves upon the Commission’s proposal to update Regulations Nos 1408/71 and 574/72 to take account of changes made in national social security legislation, particularly those introduced in the new Member States after the accession negotiations had been concluded."
"It also seeks to update the list of provisions of social security agreements which continue to apply and have not been replaced by Regulation 1408/71, and proposes technical modifications."
"Broadly speaking, the proposals that have just been adopted improve upon the existing legislation, guarantee legal certainty until the new regulation enters into force, and help to enhance the protection extended to workers who opt for mobility within the EU."
". I supported this report which, although of a technical nature, draws attention to circumstances which can inhibit the fundamental right of free movement which EU citizens supposedly enjoy."
"While I am not in favour of the EU having competence over Social Security provisions, I do believe that more could be done to facilitate the portability of certain entitlements."
"For example, disabled people are effectively denied their right to free movement - to seek employment for example - because the level of support currently provided may not be available in a new location."
"This is one of many issues which require to be addressed."
". The object of the amendment of Regulation 1408/71/EEC is to carry out an annual update in order to improve EU citizens’ standard of living and the conditions under which they work."
"I voted in favour of it."
"We must not, however, forget to consider the substantive amendments that are so urgently needed."
"It is, then, to give one example, contrary to the spirit of the Regulation for German employers to be required to grapple with an intolerable amount of red tape in order to remit to Poland social security contributions totalling 47.85% (20.64% from the employer, 27.27% from the employee) of the earnings of Polish seasonal workers, particularly when, under German law, no such contributions were payable in respect of their work prior to the accession of Poland to the EU."
"For the businesses that employed them, the outcome has been dramatic increases in costs, liable to put the businesses’ continued existence at risk, and which they cannot offset by increasing prices."
"For their part, the seasonal workers will be unwilling to work for net wages reduced by 27%."
"The consequence is that few of them are recruited, and that has a negative financial impact on the development of the new Member States."
"Experience has shown that the demand for seasonal labour cannot be met on the German labour market, and so people are losing out on every side."
"The simplification that is so urgently needed could, with the Commission’s help, be accomplished either directly, by means of bilateral agreements, or by a derogation completely removing such traditional seasonal work as helping with the harvest from the scope of Regulation 1408/71 or its successor, Regulation 883/2004/EC, and that of the implementing regulation that is yet to be adopted."
". While this report is largely a technical adjustment it should not be underestimated in terms of its importance to obtaining genuine free movement of individuals in the internal market."
"The report will assist with the simplification of regulations concerning social security schemes across the EU."
"Its purpose is also to complete the simplification of procedures on receiving medical care abroad by extending some of those modifications to the identical procedures regarding benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases."
". As the explanatory statement to this report rightly points out, ‘the regulation plays the important role of establishing one of the four fundamental freedoms of the EU, namely the free movement of European citizens."
"The possibility of living, working and moving freely within the EU, and the removal of as many financial and administrative obstacles to doing so as possible, is indeed a tangible benefit conferred on the citizens of Europe by EU membership’."
"This is indeed the case."
"The inherent possibilities in the social protection afforded to citizens of EU Member States has been a key factor in the promotion of genuine freedom of movement."
"The issue here is not one of social security models or the rules governing different systems, but is, rather, one of adapting and updating what needs to be adapted and updated in the current regulation. I voted in favour, given that this adaptation is consistent with the objectives and principles of the regulation in question."
". I voted in favour of the Maat report with a degree of disappointment as it really fails to go far enough."
"In the Forest of Dean, which I represent, 40 years ago elvers (glass eels) were fished in abundance by the local population and sold on the streets for consumption as part of a traditional breakfast with bacon and eggs."
"More recently, while stocks have declined, demand from primarily the Far East, the Baltic states and the rest of Europe have removed elvers from the local menu as they have been exported to eel farms."
"This is unlikely to change, but a small but important industry can be helped and aided."
"The major problems seem to be: first, a lack of scientific information on the life cycle of elvers - we are not even sure where their breeding grounds are, although the Sargasso Sea is the prime suspect; second, increased levels of pollution and barriers to the eels accessing the streams, rivers and ditches where they flourish and grow."
"Stocks of elvers wax and wane even if there is a downward overall decline."
"What works best is not clear."
"What is wanted is more research."
"I hope this report will ensure that the European Commission finally starts to do what it can to help."
". In recent years, eel stocks in Europe have declined dramatically."
"Given the European eel’s complex reproduction process, it is crucial that steps be taken to reverse the increasingly apparent trend towards the extinction of this species."
"Alongside a number of emergency measures that need to be taken immediately, there is also a range of medium- to long-term measures that should also be adopted, in order to ensure that eel stocks are first recovered and then properly managed."
"To this end, this report puts forward a range of proposals, which have my wholehearted support."
"We welcome the Community action plan to support the recovery of eel in the form in which it is proposed. The plan takes account of the need for socio-economic measures to help fishermen, the Community financing of measures – note, with their own budgetary heading – reliable data on the state of fish stocks, and research into other reasons behind the decline in stocks, such as pollution."
"These are measures which, as we have been proposing, should be transposed to form part of the wider body of recovery programmes, a move that was incomprehensibly rejected by the majority in Parliament."
"With regard to the national plans in individual Member States, however, we should like to emphasise three aspects:"
"- the precautionary nature of the plans, given the lack of scientific knowledge regarding eel stock numbers and the spatial distribution of successive generations of eel;"
"- the need to integrate practical measures to combat the development of physical obstacles that may hinder or limit the migration of eel in waterways;"
"- the need for increased scientific research and gathering of data on fish, aquaculture and exports."
". This report outlines the dramatic decline in European eel stocks."
"This does not appear to be the result of over fishing but linked to environmental factors."
"It is clearly important to know the precise cause be it pcbs, global warming or fish diseases."
"We need this information not just so that action can be taken to protect eel stocks but because of the wider environmental concerns and problems this might highlight."
". Under the pretext of protecting European eels and legitimately ensuring that they can migrate to the sea, following a reduction in stocks, the European Commission presented, on 1 October 2003, a management plan for yellow eels and silver eels."
"In France, for example, 399 tonnes of eels were caught, compared with 2 064 tonnes in Egypt."
"On top of that, though, came eel farming in the Netherlands, with production of 3 800 tonnes. It is quite understandable for Mr Maat, as a Dutchman, to take an interest in this and to produce a report."
"However, given that Dutch eel farms live off alevins and glass eels caught in the coastal lakes of the Mediterranean, we have cause for concern."
"The fishermen of Languedoc-Roussillon, for example in Palavas or Pérols, are worried that they will see their traditional practices, which conserve future stocks, brought into question."
"They want to fish for adult eels, not glass eels, the ban on the fishing of which 10 years ago enabled stocks to recover."
"The bureaucratic proposals on controls, restrictions, supervision, declarations and fishing bans are threatening the survival of traditional fishermen."
"I therefore oppose this report to save this free men’s trade."
". The issue before us is of major importance to Portugal and to Portuguese fishing communities, and I share the concerns voiced by the rapporteur."
"Among other equally important points, I feel that there are valid reasons to support the presentation of proposals on forms of socio-economic compensation for those affected by fishing restrictions and limits on exports of European eel."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"Mr President, I have a request to give an oral explanation of vote on the Gargani report."
"The criminal division of the French Court of Cassation, which more than ever is living up to its name, has committed what can only be described as an absolute abuse of authority."
"The judgment delivered by the president, Mr Cotte, by the court reporter Mrs Caron, and by council members Mr Le Gall, Mr Pelletier, Mr Corneloup, Mrs Ponroy and Mrs Koering-Joulin, seriously and deliberately ignores Article 26 of the French constitution on parliamentary immunity by refusing to grant this immunity with regard to the illegal phone tapping committed against our former fellow Member Mr Marchiani."
"It goes without saying that I make no comment on the background to the case."
"By acting in this way, these judges have seriously and deliberately violated the Protocol of 8 April 1965 and the Act of 20 September 1976, both of which are international treaties that, in accordance with Article 55 of the French constitution, take precedence over Acts, even internal ones."
"The judge’s shameless disregard for the law must be condemned as such and we hope that the unanimous resolution by Mr Gargani and the Committee on Legal Affairs will play a part in this."
"Mr President, I would like – if at all possible – to make an oral statement on the way I voted on the Brejc report."
"It was we who created the political conditions that made globalisation possible in the first place; we did so by our constant dismantling of trade barriers, combined with the advance of communications technology and reduced transport costs."
"Of all the goods transported around the world, one-third is accounted for by traffic between different workshops belonging to the same companies."
"We have been zealous in using EU funds to support their transportation across Europe, which has had such adverse effects as damage to the environment and danger to people along the transit routes, and, while so doing, have culpably neglected small and medium-sized businesses, which are Europe’s real providers of work."
"What I also regard as objectionable is that the Commission should set up a globalisation fund while seeking to curtail support for farmers, who are also affected by globalisation’s negative impact."
"Globalisation will continue to have us by the throat for as long as we, by means of our support programmes, send far too much money up in smoke, make it inevitable that jobs will go elsewhere, fail to apply proper sanctions to those who refuse to play by the rules and turn a blind eye to its real causes."
"It is for that reason that I voted against the Brejc report."
"Mr President, the Brejc report is yet another somewhat Utopian document and yet another typical example of the documents emerging from this institution and seeking all the answers in new international standards within new international institutions."
"In this respect, we cannot help but wonder if we have not got enough of these as it is and who will continue to pay for them all."
"Moreover, on a practical note, I note that this year, we will be conducting accession negotiations with an Islamic country where child labour and discrimination against women is the norm."
"I think it would be better if we were to continue to focus on this instead of expressing noncommittal views about the social dimension of globalisation."
"If we have to talk about this, we should actually mention China, that country we are so chummy with, that country from which parliamentary institutions of all European countries merrily travel back and forth."
"Well, that country belongs to the World Trade Organisation but rides roughshod over all fundamental social standards and rules whilst not being hindered in this in any way."
"It is a falsehood that we would be able to transform the social dimension of globalisation while we choose to do nothing about China."
"That will be the day."
"Mr President, I shall be brief."
"I voted against the Brejc report for the very reasons that some of my colleagues have outlined."
"This House does not appear to read its own documents."
"The common agricultural policy has been radically reformed, and this morning’s vote basically gives truth to the lie that if we reduced all EU agriculture subsidies the poor in Africa would be better off."
"Nothing could be further from the truth, and I have therefore voted against this report."
"The Swedish Conservatives have today voted against the report on the social dimension of globalisation because its basic approach to globalisation is wrong."
"Globalisation is an ongoing process of change that helps bring about freedom and prosperity for ever more people."
"Globalisation provides better preconditions for economic growth through free trade, increased international investment and the transfer of knowledge."
"Together with democratic development, opportunities are created for the developing countries to emerge from poverty."
"The EU is a positive example of globalisation, involving the free movement of goods, services, people and capital."
"Dictatorships perceive the transformative power of globalisation as a threat to their own closed societies."
"We Conservatives welcome globalisation and its role as a catalyst for democracy."
". Unfortunately, the majority in Parliament rejected our most important proposals, which would have improved upon a report that was riddled with inconsistencies and deeply unsatisfactory, on an issue as important as the social dimension of globalisation."
"Our proposals aimed at changing the current neoliberal economic and monetary policies in the field of international trade, and the proposal to combat financial speculation in the world’s capital markets, whilst promoting investment and wealth creation in the real economy were thus rejected."
"Our proposal to condemn the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the Stability and Growth Pact, which have been instruments within the EU to foster liberalisation and privatisation of public utility services, to make labour markets more flexible and more adaptable, wage moderation and to open up most areas of social security, such as pensions and health, to private firms, was also rejected."
"Nevertheless, the proposal emphasising the need for a social policy agenda geared towards development of cities focused on inclusion and cohesion, implying measures to foster sustainable development and respect for workers rights was adopted in part."
"Hence our abstention from the final vote."
"The resolution on ‘the social dimension of globalisation’ contains proposals that, in most cases, would lead to the EU being given more power."
"We object to this routine EU centralisation, carried out without proper analysis or justification."
"A common EU policy on ‘the social dimension of globalisation’ cannot be drawn up because the EU Member States are so different from one another."
"This is true where, for example, tax levels and social protection are concerned."
"Instead of being forced to carry out a policy imposed from above, the EU countries should instead learn from each other through institutional competition."
"We believe that reforms need to have grass-roots support in each country."
"We also believe that the less developed countries can be given the right to regulate their imports of agricultural products for the time being."
"In view of the above, we choose to vote against the resolution in the final vote."
"However, we support the amendments to the effect that the common agricultural policy must be radically reformed and that export subsidies must be abolished."
"We also support the proposal that the EU must open up its market to goods from less developed countries."
". I voted for the position of the Employment [amp] Social Affairs Committee, which had been improved by amendments at Committee stage."
"Today I also supported amendments which sought to make social and environmental reporting obligatory and supported the kind of reform of the CAP which would ""make poverty history""."
". The People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) delegation felt that it had to vote against the amended Brejc report concerning the social dimension of globalisation."
"One amendment adopted, tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left, urges the Commission and the Council to promote a social policy agenda at European level."
"The VVD takes the view that social policy is something that falls within the remit of Member States."
"The Dutch referendum on the Constitutional Treaty was further proof that interference from Brussels is not wanted."
"Furthermore, an amendment by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has been adopted in which a case is made in favour of the EU promoting socially responsible entrepreneurship."
"The VVD is convinced that this can be done far more effectively through the market, and EU action in this respect is totally unnecessary and, indeed, unwanted."
". I should like to congratulate Mr Brejc on his timely report on the Commission communication entitled ‘The Social Dimension of Globalisation – the EU’s policy contribution on extending benefits to all’."
"In the report, he advocates the idea that the EU model has always emphasised the strong social dimension in economic integration, as reflected in the Lisbon Agenda, and that, accordingly, certain aspects of good practice within the European social model should be transposed to other parts of the world."
"It agrees that the EU can make a valid contribution, through both its external and internal policies, by shaping the process of globalisation and making it fairer for all."
". I welcome this report on the social dimension of globalisation which is Parliament's initial response to the report by the World Commission on the social dimension of globalisation."
"It is important that those who are disadvantaged by globalisation are assisted to adapt to new circumstances."
"This applies to citizens of the EU as well as countries and citizens throughout the world."
"It is therefore pleasing to see this report recommend a number of internal and external policy actions."
". There are two possible approaches to the issue of globalisation."
"One is that it is an avoidable (and unwanted) reality, that if the workers of the 19th century had been more successful in their protests there would not have been industrialisation (which would have been a good thing), and that technological innovation is inherently a bad thing."
"The other, more realistic, approach is based on knowledge of history and an awareness of the responsibilities of each generation, and consists of making the most of the opportunities that globalisation brings."
"Globalisation is neither a good nor a bad thing in itself; it is a reality that can be used to positive or detrimental effect."
"In free and democratic societies such as ours, in which economic freedom prevails, the conditions are in place for globalisation to become an opportunity for worldwide growth and development; and not just an opportunity but a duty."
"This is the spirit in which globalisation should be approached."
"Mr President, this report is yet further crazy proof of this Parliament’s conceited, damaging and vacuous claim to be unaware of and far removed from the feelings of the ordinary people of Europe whom they claim to represent."
"Instead of ‘social dimension of globalisation’ it should read ‘defence of the criminal dimension of globalisation’."
"Rather than voting ‘No’, I should perhaps have simply left the room."
". I support the principle that the Common Agricultural Policy must be reformed, and that in line with the aims of the Make Poverty History campaign, which I strongly support, we must not export our own poor policies into the wider world."
"Of course, we must also safeguard the welfare of European farmers and the security of Europe's food supply, though this is compatible with a more sensible Common Agricultural Policy, the status quo is untenable."
". I fully support this report."
"The impact of globalisation has positive and negative consequences."
"We cannot forget the 20 million people unemployed in the EU at the moment, nor the fact that one in five children in the EU lives on the brink of poverty."
"We have a responsibility in this House to deal with these issues."
"I believe that Mr Wojciechowski wishes to speak in response to personal comments."
"Mr President, I am absolutely outraged at an incident that occurred in connection with the exhibition."
"I am deeply offended by the comments of both Members, and in particular by those of Mrs Gomes, who called myself and Mr Chruszcz ‘Nazis’ and ‘fascists’."
"Such a thing should not be tolerated or permitted in this House."
"My family was murdered by the Nazis in my home country, and I object to such comments being made in my direction."
"I understand Mrs Gomes’ point of view, but I must insist that comments of this kind should not be made in Parliament, whether they are directed at myself or at any other Member."
"This holds particularly true in situations like the exhibition."
"There really should be no question of such a thing happening."
"Thank you, Mr Wojciechowski, you have spoken in accordance with Rule 122 and your comments will be recorded in the Minutes."
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"- the report by Mr Sacconi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency and amending Directive 1999/45/EC and Regulation (EC) No .../... [on Persistent Organic Pollutants] (COM(2003)0644 C5-0530/2003 2003/0256(COD)) (A6-0315/2005), and"
"- the report by Mr Sacconi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 67/548/EEC in order to adapt it to Regulation (EC) No .../... of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (COM(2003)0644 C5-0531/2003 2003/0257(COD)) (A 6-0285/2005)."
"Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, let me begin this debate by congratulating all those committees, and their many individual members, who have participated in the discussions on REACH, which is one of the most far-reaching proposals that the Commission has ever adopted."
"The committees and their members have had an enormous amount of work to do in analysing its details and in drafting amendments to improve it."
"I am particularly obliged to Mr Sacconi, who, as rapporteur for the lead committee and as a stalwart defender of improvements to the protection of health and the environment, was open to the possibility of compromise."
"I also wish to thank Mr Nassauer, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and an advocate of competitiveness and innovation as goals for policy, who was equally open to reasonable compromise, and Mrs Ek, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and was equally active in putting forward the objections of industry, albeit without losing sight of the vital importance of protecting health and the environment."
"Not least in your House, this legislative project has made enormous demands in terms of organisation, and the Commission itself found it difficult to respond to over 1 000 amendments and come to an agreement."
"We will be able to explain in detail our position on the compromise package put forward by Mr Sacconi and Mr Nassauer, and also to respond in detail to the amendments that were handed well in advance of the deadline, but I do ask you to understand that the Commission will not be able to consider in full the amendments tabled immediately prior to the deadline for submission, and that, for this reason, I cannot yet give you the Commission’s position on them."
"We will, however, delay as little as possible in stating our position on those amendments that gain a majority at the vote."
"I will now turn to the fundamental questions to which the amendments refer."
"The Commission supports Mr Sacconi’s and Mr Nassauer’s proposed compromises on registration and on the exchange of information."
"We take the view that they strike a very good balance between the demands of our industry’s competitiveness on the one hand and advances in the protection of health and the environment on the other."
"On the subject of the exchange of information, I would like to stress that any such system must offer the maximum possible incentives, although there will be situations in which – for reasons, among others, of cost – it will not be in businesses’ interests to cooperate and in which the exchange of information could be detrimental to their essential interests."
"It is for that reason that I am grateful that a system has been devised for the conditions applicable to data exchange to minimise inconvenience for businesses and the Agency."
"There is, I would say, a threefold motivation behind the amendments relating to the regulation’s scope."
"One has to do with substantive clarification of it."
"A second has to do with creating a derogation from it for a number of other substances that are not regarded as presenting any risk, and a third has to do with the avoidance of duplication of rules."
"The Commission accepts the clarifications relating to derogations from the scope of the regulation, notably for waste, food, biocides and pesticides."
"We also accept the clarification to the effect that REACH cannot alter or circumvent the rules in the cosmetics directive for the avoidance of animal experiments."
"We accept the need for the requirements relating to specific substances – that is, minerals, ores, ore concentrates and chemicals occurring in nature – to be expressed with greater clarity."
"Turning to the requirements to be imposed on what are termed downstream users, the Commission is in favour of introducing a threshold of one tonne per annum where such users are required to submit a chemical safety report on their own account."
"This is necessary if they are not to be put at a disadvantage over against their own suppliers and also in order for the system to be made more compatible with their needs."
"It is evident that various committees are making strenuous efforts to enhance the Agency’s role in assessing risk."
"The Commission accepts that such an approach has its merits in terms of more even and more consistent application of the Regulation’s rules, although we must be very cautious as regards the tangible form that this will take."
"The fact of the matter is that there is only a limited reserve of expertise, much of which is to be found in the Member States – whether in their competent authorities or in their scientific institutions."
"It is vital that the best possible use be made of these resources for the common good."
"The authorisation procedure is one of the most important aspects of the whole REACH Regulation, if not, indeed, its cornerstone."
"On the one hand, we want to find an efficient way of giving businesses an incentive to substitute viable alternatives for substances of very high concern, but, on the other, we do not want to set up a system that puts chemicals producers within the EU at a competitive disadvantage."
"This affects a large number of high-tech companies, and the innovative benefit of chemical substances is crucial if they are to remain able to compete with those in the USA, China and other Asian countries."
"We must also be careful not to overstrain the Agency or the Commission to too little real effect."
"The risk element must remain crucial in the authorisation procedure if we are to continue to endeavour to monitor it in an appropriate way."
"Firms must also be able to demonstrate that they are succeeding in doing that."
"We can agree to a procedural step in which the Agency publishes information on its work programme for authorisation, that is to say, relating to its choice of chemicals to be proposed to the Commission as candidates for authorisation within a foreseeable timeframe."
"That is good for the industry, in that it will give businesses greater confidence in planning ahead."
"We can also accept the idea of attaching a review clause to the Agency’s authorisation of substances in individual cases."
"Discussion of substances in products, to which Article 6 relates, has been made difficult, not through its being in any way politically controversial, but because of the objective facts, in that it involves, on the one hand, creating equal competitive conditions for manufacturers and importers of products, and, on the other, countering the problems arising through the import of products the chemical constituents of which do not have to comply with the same conditions as products manufactured from registered chemicals."
"These include many components that European industry processes into end products."
"In the final analysis, compliance with the WTO rules requiring risk-based regulations is unavoidable."
"It is for this reason that the Commission is in favour of those proposals that are practicable and conform to WTO requirements."
"The intended rules for substances intended to be released from products appear to the Commission to be reliable."
"Other substances in products will require the creation of a system that companies will find easy to use and the primary purpose of which is the identification of risks."
"Moving on to the confidentiality of data, a number of amendments have as their objection the enlargement of the list of items of information that should always and in principle be regarded as confidential."
"Others seek to shorten this list and facilitate the publication of more information on the Internet."
"The Commission takes the view that, at the end of the day, its compromise proposal strikes the right balance."
"Our aim should be to ensure access to information that is really needed to protect public health and the environment."
"In the course of time, the Agency will have an important part to play in terms of communication and also in informing consumers, even though that is not the express objective of the REACH Regulation."
"On the other hand, we must not be naive."
"Both Europe and the companies have great knowledge and experience in the use of chemical substances, knowledge that would certainly be of great value to competitors outside Europe."
"Within Europe, too, we must ensure that the competitive position of individual enterprises is not undermined."
"We cannot therefore rule out the possibility of having to make a number of amendments to the text in order to bring REACH’s practical implementation into line with the provisions of the Aarhus Convention."
"I am thinking here, in particular, of the tight deadlines required for appeals decisions."
"The amendments also address many other individual issues."
"Although time does not permit me to mention them all, I would like to draw your attention to the amendments relating to the Agency, which cover a multitude of issues relating to its mandate, the way its committees work together within it, the composition of the Management Committee and the appointment of its Executive Director."
"The Commission’s view of these amendments is founded on a pragmatic approach."
"We have an open mind about, and will deal constructively with, proposals aimed at making the Agency more efficient, but we must avoid heaping additional burdens upon it."
"The more tasks we expect it to perform, the greater the risk that it will not enjoy initial success."
"Let me also emphasise to the budgetary authority that giving the Agency additional tasks must, self-evidently, be accompanied by a corresponding increase in its financial resources."
"The Commission hopes, then, that the compromise package presented by Mr Sacconi and Mr Nassauer is one to which Parliament will feel able to give its approval."
"We believe that this package can help to foster widespread support for a piece of legislation that is among the most problematic, complex and, certainly, most controversial in the history of the European Union."
"From the very beginning of the discussion of REACH, the Commission has always seen itself as having the role of helping to find a rational and pragmatic solution that struck the right balance between the demands of the economy and the objectives associated with health and the environment, and we do believe that these compromise proposals achieve it rather – and let me make this perfectly clear – than weakening the Commission’s original proposal."
"We believe that this compromise package makes the proposal more workable, more efficient and also more cost-effective; a better way, indeed, of achieving the environmental and health objectives."
"It is for this reason that the response from the Commission’s meeting today was so positive, and I hope that will also encourage the Council to adopt the whole package before the year is out."
"The proposals to which the Commission has given such a favourable response are watertight by comparison with those submitted earlier by the UK Council Presidency, so I do now believe that we have an extraordinarily good chance of successfully wrapping up this very difficult legislative package by the end of the year."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the European Parliament, which has worked very intensively on this proposal at first reading."
"I should like to congratulate in particular the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the committee itself and, of course, the rapporteur Mr Sacconi, whose untiring and consistently constructive efforts have made a decisive contribution towards promoting this proposal."
"I also thank the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and their rapporteurs, Mr Nassauer and Mrs Ek, for their constructive proposals."
"They have all worked together, submitted proposals and reached this compromise which they propose on one of the main elements of the REACH system: registration."
"REACH is a very important legislative initiative to improve environmental protection and human health and, when it is applied, it will significantly increase the knowledge which we have about chemicals, improve their safety and strengthen consumer confidence in the chemicals with which they come into contact. In addition, it will give impetus to innovation and will encourage the substitution of products by safer products."
"I am particularly satisfied by the fact that the European Parliament and the Council have finalised their positions on the proposal."
"In this way, the two Community institutions converged in their opinions and now have similar approaches to numerous questions relating to REACH issues."
"The compromise package on the question of registration proposed by Mr Sacconi and Mr Nassauer and countersigned by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe constitutes positive progress on one of the most complex chapters of the REACH dossier."
"The compromise package constitutes a balanced proposal."
"By focusing the proposal on the substances which have the highest risk level, this compromise improves the functionality of the REACH proposal, especially as regards substances produced or used in small quantities."
"At the same time, it safeguards a high level of environmental protection, by demanding more information where the risk is greatest."
"Despite the fact that the approach for substances produced or used in small quantities differs from the Commission proposal, it is nonetheless a significant improvement for the protection of health and the environment compared with the current situation."
"The Commission supports this package within the framework of efforts to find a compromise."
"The compromise package aims in the same direction as the discussions being held in the Council."
"Similarly, it has many points in common with the compromise proposal tabled by the British Presidency on 28 October, which was broadly accepted in the Permanent Representatives Committee last Friday."
"The Commission fully supports the objective of the British Presidency to achieve political agreement before the end of the year and to make every possible effort in this direction and to make a positive contribution to this objective."
"There are numerous important aspects in the REACH initiative but, due to lack of time, I should like to refer to two of them: the scope of the proposal and the provisions on authorisation."
"The scope of the proposal is fairly complicated, mainly due to the large number of Community legislative texts on specific products which contain chemicals."
"The Commission is in a position to accept several of the amendments proposed by Parliament, such as the exemption from registration of waste, food and ores."
"However, we cannot accept a number of other amendments which would create a vacuum in the application of the legislation."
"As far as authorisation and substitution are concerned, I see with satisfaction that the Members of Parliament have proposed a large number of valuable amendments which set time limits on authorisation and increase the pressure for substitution, thus strengthening protection of human health and the environment."
"The Commission agrees with the need to authorise substances which cause a similar level of concern about risk as the most dangerous substances referred to in the Commission proposal: carcinogenic, mutagenic, persistent bioaccumulative and very persistent and very bioaccumulative substances."
"We also agree with the setting of a time limit for authorisations, but this limit will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the European Chemicals Agency."
"At the same time, we believe that this arrangement, in conjunction with Article 52, as amended by the British Presidency, will have a positive effect on substitution, as there will be pressure on companies to step up their efforts to find substitutes and safer substances."
"To close, I should like once again to thank all the members of the European Parliament who have worked so intensively over the past nine months in order to make progress on the REACH proposal."
"In this way, the European Parliament is making a decisive contribution to improving the level of protection of health and the environment in Europe, while at the same time maintaining the competitiveness of European industry."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Members of this Parliament for their hard work on REACH, and in particular the key committees and their members."
"It is an honour to be invited here to speak on behalf of the UK Presidency."
"Firstly, I would like to emphasise that REACH is a very important dossier for the UK Presidency."
"This legislation offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to achieve proper protection for humans and the environment while at the same time being workable and maintaining the competitiveness of European industry."
"We all want to find a good solution on REACH, one that both enhances protection of public health and the environment and maintains industrial competitiveness."
"This objective can only be attained with the cooperation of all Member States, the European Parliament and stakeholders."
"REACH will feature strongly at the Competitiveness Council on 29 November, where we plan to hold a serious and substantive policy debate, so your views will be important in feeding into that."
"We recognise that we are very close to a deal, and we still intend to achieve political agreement before the end of the UK Presidency."
"I am heartened by the commitment shown by the European Parliament in having its first reading this week."
"We welcome the work done by the rapporteurs to achieve a balanced and workable compromise on the key aspect of REACH, namely registration."
"The main elements of this compromise, co-signed by the three main political groups, are very close to the ideas that the Council is working on. Therefore, adoption of a European Parliament opinion along these lines should pave the way for an early adoption of REACH."
"This would be good news for the environment and for industry, bringing an end to uncertainty, and indeed good news for everyone."
"It would finally provide a more effective system for managing the risks presented by chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment."
"The Presidency’s compromise text aims to represent a balanced consideration of the views expressed by Member States in the discussions to date."
"It acknowledges the concerns of industry and meets them."
"It maintains the objectives of REACH in the field of protecting human health and the environment."
"We look forward to taking on board contributions from the European Parliament once you have completed your considerations."
"In explaining the direction the Presidency is taking I hope to further inform this debate."
"Let me start at the beginning, with registration."
"The challenge for us all is to agree a registration package that collects the information necessary to assess the risks."
"At the same time it must be proportionate."
"We must avoid forcing companies to provide data just for the sake of it."
"We all share the same concerns and want to ensure REACH does not adversely impact on small firms."
"The following number among our shared proposals on registration: firstly, having a single pre-registration phase to simplify the procedure; secondly, requiring data sharing through ‘one substance, one registration’."
"This could deliver savings of up to EUR 600 million."
"We have also introduced flexibility by proposing clear criteria for companies to opt out of submitting a joint information package."
"It is generally accepted that the sharing of animal test data should be mandatory."
"However, to simplify the system, the sharing of non-animal data has been made mandatory only if requested by a potential registrant."
"Like Parliament, the Council is concerned about the impacts on small firms."
"To reduce these impacts, a proposal for targeted information requirements for low volume substances has been put forward."
"Below ten tonnes, a full data set only needs to be provided on a substance if it meets simple criteria identifying it as high risk."
"Under this approach, not as much information will be provided about the substances as in the original Commission proposal, but it does mean that we can apply a simplified risk-based approach for the 20 000 low volume substances, and focus on those of concern in the first instance."
"In order to reduce the burden on industry, and particularly on small firms, the Chemicals Agency will provide tools to facilitate the submission of data."
"We have reduced the cost of registration in the higher 10-100-tonnage band by removing an expensive test from the data requirements."
"This led to a saving of around EUR 80 million."
"In addition, the ability to waive certain tests under Annex VI has been strengthened to minimise the burden for testing at the higher tonnage bands."
"I want to emphasise that this can be done in a way that still delivers the necessary information about the hazards and risks of substances."
"I now turn to evaluation."
"Here the registration is checked for compliance or referred for further scrutiny."
"The compromise text gives the Chemicals Agency, based in Finland, a more central role in this phase of REACH."
"We want to ensure that evaluation is carried out more efficiently and consistently across the EU and that the Agency has the tools and resources to ensure this happens."
"Again, I do not think that the Council’s position is too far from that of Parliament on this."
"A similar approach has been taken in the reports from the parliamentary committees which have given their opinion."
"A key part of this proposal, of course, is the authorisation stage."
"REACH requires any substance of very high concern to be banned unless a strong case for authorisation is made justifying its continued use."
"In the Council, we have clarified the scope and have strengthened the authorisation provisions to provide a greater drive towards substitution."
"The compromise proposal retains the possibility of a first authorisation based solely on adequate control – that is, you can continue to use a hazardous substance if you can demonstrate that the risks are contained."
"But – and it is a big ‘but’ – adequate control must be tightly defined."
"It is now tighter in our proposal."
"It is clearer."
"It is right that all decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis."
"Therefore, an amendment has been introduced in our proposal to require all authorisations to be subject to a review."
"This would enable further consideration of the availability of alternatives in the future."
"In addition, substitution has been further encouraged in our proposal by the requirement to provide an analysis of possible alternatives."
"I look forward to the opinion from Parliament."
"If I have not managed to persuade you of the vital importance to all the citizens of Europe of securing an early agreement on REACH, then I have failed."
"I hope I have been able to give you an insight into the discussions taking place in Council."
"For our part, we will continue working in our role as the Presidency to do all we possibly can to get agreement this year."
"We believe we can."
"We look forward to receiving the contribution of the European Parliament."
"Let me repeat, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
"Let us not throw it away."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while listening to the speeches of the two Commissioners and Lord Bach, who represented the UK Presidency, I was reflecting on the distance we have had to travel in order to arrive at this point."
"You yourself have heard how close together the respective positions of the three institutions now are. I believe I can say that concerning the themes of registration, authorisation and other aspects that have been mentioned, there are no significant differences of opinion on points of principle."
"It is difficult to summarise this lengthy process in a few minutes, even though this is the longest time limit that I have been given since I became a Member of this Parliament."
"I shall therefore devote only a few words to two key concepts: balance and responsibility."
"These are words that came to my mind this weekend, which I spent almost entirely doing some soul-searching."
"Particularly in the light of the attacks last week on the compromise that I initialled, I wondered in truth whether I had taken the right decision and whether a balance really had been achieved; in all conscience I had to reply in the affirmative."
"We have not only safeguarded but also reinforced the balance between those two essential factors that are close to all our hearts: namely protection of human health and the environment on the one hand and the maintenance of industrial competitiveness in Europe on the other."
"It is easier to arrive at such a balance when one is approving a political resolution, since in that instance one is working solely with words."
"To reach a balance in a regulation of such importance, when so many often-conflicting interests are affected, is, in contrast, rather more difficult."
"In such circumstances, it is in fact also necessary to take account of technical data of considerable weight and importance."
"From this perspective I feel that my conscience is clear."
"As far as human health and the environment are concerned – and I will confine myself to quoting only a few improvements to the Commission’s proposal to which I attach particular importance – we can bring forward the registration of persistent bioaccumulative substances. Subject to Parliament’s approval, of course, we shall also introduce the chemical safety report for the lower tonnage band, if only for the most hazardous substances."
"If Parliament endorses on Thursday the positions adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we shall define an authorisation mechanism for the substitution of the most hazardous substances, very similar to the mechanism that the UK Presidency referred to a short while ago."
"I am particularly proud of this."
"As for enterprises, I shall mention only the most important things that have been done."
"While maintaining the burden of proof, we have made the registration mechanisms more flexible for the low tonnage bands and have introduced a very important feature for small enterprises: namely data sharing, which has become obligatory apart from certain mechanisms for opting out."
"I should also like to recall that, together with Mr Nassauer, we have at the eleventh hour extended the period envisaged for data protection and for research and development."
"I believe that these are all concrete actions that are moving in the right direction."
"In this connection, Mr Nassauer, may I say that during my weekend of reflection and soul-searching I was somewhat struck by the fact that, after the compromise we initialled together, you saw fit to table your earlier block of amendments as well."
"In this connection I must declare that should our compromise unhappily not be approved, I will naturally support the other block (number 2)."
"I am optimistic about this."
"I now turn to my second key concept: responsibility, to which I would add the word autonomy."
"We have been subjected to much pressure, albeit legitimate pressure, concerning the interests that we all have to represent in some way while seeking the best possible compromise that is acceptable to a majority in Parliament."
"We have come close to this objective; and meanwhile the positions of various institutions, in particular the two legislative ones, namely the Council and Parliament, have moved very close together."
"I believe that the ball is now in Parliament’s court, so to speak."
"We are aware that many aspects of European integration are in difficulty at present."
"Nevertheless Parliament could today send out a strong, clear message on such an important subject to its citizens, enterprises and trade unions concerning its ability to decide and to reach a compromise that would by definition be as representative as possible of the wishes of all interested parties."
"Mr President, my work comes to an end at this point."
"I will naturally pay attention to the voting list in the next few hours, but let us say that the greater part of my job is done."
"As Lord Bach and Commissioner Verheugen said earlier, we now have to seize the opportunity to speed up the decision-making and legislative process on this matter that has engaged so much of our attention."
"I said recently that an agreement is like a fruit: if it is not picked at the right time, when it is ripe, it rots and goes bad."
"Since this morning I have been carrying an apple in my pocket."
"It is not beautiful; it is small and covered with blemishes, because it was organically grown and contains no fungicides; but I think that it will taste very good and for this reason I shall eat it later."
"I accordingly call upon Parliament to pick this fruit; in so doing we shall also help the other institutions, especially the Council, finally to close this file and to send out the message that I spoke of earlier."
"Mr President, I have just a small point of order to raise."
"It has previously been the custom of this House that rapporteurs present the positions of their committees."
"As Mr Sacconi is in fact the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would have been glad if what he said had reflected that committee’s attitude."
"I would ask you in future to indicate from the Chair whether speeches are made in a personal capacity or in the capacity of rapporteur."
"You have expressed your concern, but the Presidency cannot treat it as a point of order."
"The order is established, the rapporteur has the right to the floor and he has spoken as he saw fit, and now the representatives of the committees concerned will speak."
"The order of the debate will not be altered as a result of your comment."
"Mr President, chemicals are important, indeed vitally so."
"They are part of our everyday life and basic to much of our modern human activity."
"At the same time, there is a general unease about chemicals."
"What are they doing to us and to our environment?"
"A certain concern is justified, and I am therefore pleased that we in Parliament are to vote through new European chemicals legislation whereby we shall get to know which chemicals expose us to high risks and which do not do so. I am also pleased that we shall be able to ban chemicals that we need to get rid of and that we shall be able to keep those that we need."
"We have helped make REACH give priority to having more attention given to those substances that constitute a serious threat, and we have obtained exemptions for substances we know are not hazardous, such as wood pulp and iron ore."
"This means that we shall avoid bureaucracy and unnecessary costs but, above all, it means that we shall use our limited resources to bring about the highest possible level of safety."
"In Europe, many goals are set which we do not in actual fact achieve."
"Decisions in this Chamber often promise more than they can deliver."
"The old chemicals legislation was an excellent example of this."
"It was supposed to make us safe but has achieved almost nothing."
"Sometimes, the failures are merely embarrassing but, in the case of chemicals policy, they may be highly dangerous."
"That is why we need REACH, but a REACH that manages to deliver what it promises."
"The great challenge for REACH is to design a policy that does not create barriers to trade and that does not limit other countries’ ability to sell their products on the European market."
"For it to do otherwise would be a disservice not only to the world around us but also to European consumers."
"It would be absurd if we in Parliament were to design legislation that was later declared unlawful by the WTO."
"I therefore hope that the Chamber will take on board the proposals put forward by the Committee on International Trade for reducing trade barriers."
"Quite a few members, including the Swedish Social Democrats, appear inclined to stand aloof from the proposal and to vote against it in its entirety while, in the next breath, they accuse the whole Parliament of not bothering about the environment."
"The Swedish Social Democrats’ most important newspaper even describes Mr Schulz, the chairman of the political group here in Parliament that it supports, as a defector."
"I find that accusation cowardly, and it does not help improve the environment."
"Instead, the Social Democrats should ask themselves why they are standing aloof from the proposal."
"The overwhelming majority, from the right of centre political groups – the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and now the Commission as well are in agreement, and it is we who shall keep the proposal afloat."
"I am very pleased to have been involved and to assume responsibility for voting new, firm European chemicals legislation into existence."
". – The objectives of reducing chemical damage to the environment and to health, raising awareness of the consequences of the use of chemicals, improving consumer access, gradually eliminating and replacing the least safe chemicals and banning tests on vertebrate animals all touch the lives of the citizens whom we represent in this Chamber."
"Parliament must therefore welcome the Commission’s initiative and play a proactive and constructive part in improving on what it is proposing."
"This is what we have done."
"That a broader undertaking in this regard has been achieved is down to collective responsibility and, more importantly, to Mr Sacconi’s outstanding report."
"Supporting these proposals will lead to a marked improvement in the Commission’s text and will facilitate its implementation."
"The core of the text remains intact, namely adopting the principle of responsibility, reducing costs for SMEs, focusing on the most problematic chemicals and the uses thereof, clarifying the Agency’s role, and giving greater precedence to assessing and monitoring the system."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Committees on International Trade and Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am delighted that many examples of consensus reached on the text to be submitted for the vote have been included."
"In this connection, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to draw your attention, and that of the Commission and the Council, to the fact that the EU needs to use its status as the largest trading bloc in the world, and the largest producer of chemicals in the world, to ensure that the rules it adopts internally on environmental and health protection are applied internationally and are seen as prerequisites for free trade."
"With regard to REACH, just as many other laws, it should be emphasised that Europe cannot continue to make laws on its internal market as though there were no such thing as globalisation."
"Unless we keep this in mind, we will destroy Europe as a productive base, destroy its jobs and, hypocritically, export environmental damage outside its territory to other more vulnerable parts of the world."
"This will be tantamount to shooting ourselves in the foot and Article 6 does not go far enough in addressing this problem."
"In this area, as in others, the agreement will fall short of being perfect; it will need to be improved gradually on the basis of practical assessment."
"This, however, is the agreement that we have managed to reach, and is sufficiently good to warrant Parliament’s clear support."
"This is the only way in which a balanced institutional solution in the short term can be guaranteed. I therefore lend my backing to it."
". Mr President, REACH, one of the most complex legislative procedures – and not just because it runs to 1 200 pages – kept ten of this House’s committees occupied, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, whose opinion I have drafted, was one of them."
"The chemical industry in the EU employs 1.7 million people, while some 3 million more are associated with it as suppliers."
"In order to get some idea of REACH’s effects on day-to-day working life, I visited 50 companies – not just in Germany – working in the fields of paints and coatings, ceramics, textiles, electrical goods, automobiles and chemicals."
"The unanimous view expressed by both managers and shopfloor workers was that there was no alternative to protecting health and the environment, and that a clear distinction had to be drawn between hazardous and non-hazardous substances, not least for the employees’ sake."
"It has to be said, though, that the costs stated in the Commission proposal are so high, and bureaucracy involved so extensive, that there is the threat of competition with non-EU businesses being distorted, and the possibility of businesses relocating is not to be excluded."
"It was our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that conducted the first of this House’s Hearing’s on REACH; this it did in October 2004, with 200 experts on labour law and health protection, not to mention representatives of the social partners, present."
"We were also – on 12 July 2005 – the first committee to vote on it, thereby, no doubt, giving important indications as to the future progress of deliberations in the European Parliament."
"We are in favour of pre-registration and prioritisation as standard."
"If there is a batch of core data relating to the actual risk rather than to the quantity of the substance in question, as well as categories for exposure and use, registration with the Chemicals Agency can be accomplished professionally and at no less speed, avoiding not only vast amounts of dead data but also needless red tape, to the benefit of small and medium-sized businesses in particular."
"Most of us voted in favour of derogations for substances used in research and development and for the new Agency’s powers to be extended."
"A modified REACH will make superfluous two dozen European labour law regulations in the field of health and safety at work alone."
"Priority has to be given to the drafting of safety data sheets and their precise use in places of work, thereby obviating accidents resulting from the improper handling of substances."
"Mr President, chemicals in Europe are regulated by very poor legislation in the case of the 30 000 or so older chemicals and relatively good legislation in the case of the approximately 3 000 new chemicals."
"The new proposal replaces 43 directives, as well as national legislation in 25 countries – legislation that varies a very great deal, from quite poor to quite good, in terms of quality and of the way in which its application is monitored."
"At the same time, it is 100 years since we had national markets that were closed."
"Swedes wishing, for example, to buy toys for their children will find that, although a few are produced in their own country, most are imported."
"For all these reasons, new chemicals legislation means a great opportunity for the environment, people and companies."
"The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was the first committee to take a decision."
"We were able to transform the draft Chemicals Directive – lifeless as it was, and very much called into question - into an opportunity actually to reach a decision."
"I wish to thank the members of the committee for their very constructive and helpful cooperation."
"The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has responsibility for industry, small enterprises and research and has therefore, in accordance with its remit, concentrated on changes that pave the way for new, modern technologies, innovations and modern environmental technology."
"In Europe, environmentally driven industry is growing twice as fast as industry as a whole and is an incredibly important tool for creating jobs and sustainable growth in a knowledge-based economy."
"If REACH is to be this engine of sustainable growth, the proposal needs, however, to be simplified, strengthened and made clearer."
"It needs to be simplified in order that small enterprises might survive; strengthened in order to bring about a better environment; and made clearer because, in certain respects, it is very unclear indeed."
"It cannot, for example, be the intention that every load of minerals be analysed individually."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have four major issues in the EU, including the fact that the financial perspective and draft Services Directive are each a mess and that the draft Constitutional Treaty is subject to a ‘period of reflection’."
"Following seven years’ discussion, we now in actual fact need a decision on the fourth important proposal, namely that concerning European chemicals legislation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, uncertainty is very expensive."
"Therefore, let us vote ‘yes’ on Thursday to the compromises that are on the table."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that the environment and the protection of the consumer stand to gain if this REACH law is adopted is not a matter of doubt."
"If it is, then we will, within eleven years, be in possession of knowledge and information that we have not been able to collect before on some 30 000 substances used by European businesses."
"That is what makes this such a crucial leap forward."
"What brings it about is the fact that we will, in future, be transferring to businesses the responsibility for obtaining information and carrying out tests, along with the costs incurred in doing so."
"Businesses will be responsible for the safe handling of the substances that they produce and with which they have dealings."
"That is the crucial change over against the law as it was before, and I think it has to be mentioned that it involves considerable costs, for these tests cost money – up to EUR 200 000!"
"Businesses would in future be required to bear these costs themselves in the interests of the environment and consumer protection, and that means that we have to give some thought to what effect this would have on competitiveness."
"Reference has already been made to the compromise that Mr Sacconi and I have been able to hammer out, and to which our respective groups have been good enough to give their approval."
"It makes the requirement for data in the range between one and one hundred tonnes, which is of particular importance for small and medium-sized enterprises, more dependent on the potential risk from a substance, rather than only on the quantity in which it is produced."
"That is a vitally important development for small and medium-sized producers and users;"
"I am very pleased indeed that we have been able to achieve it, and it does of course have our unconditional backing."
"We have tabled old amendments only against the possible eventuality of our not getting a majority for it."
"It has to be said, though, that this compromise relates only to registration, which is the most important part of REACH, and certainly not to the whole thing."
"Matters relating to authorisation and scope are still outstanding, and I hope we will manage to come to an agreement on them too."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the brief two minutes available to me, I shall have to focus on only a few points."
"I will start with a general comment on the package as a whole."
"Europe, with what will soon be a population of 500 million people, constitutes a considerable economic area, and it is right that we should be forerunners in giving this area a single binding legal framework in the field of environmental protection."
"Europe is not, however, some isolated part of the world and there is no intention that it should become one; on the contrary, it has to compete with other major industrial areas, and it is of no benefit to our objectives, of which the protection of the environment is one, no matter how good our intentions, if, in future, production is removed to other parts of the world with the potential for making their environmental problems even worse, for we would be no less affected by them while sustaining considerable economic damage as well."
"The economic damage to which I have referred affects by no means only the production of chemicals, but rather all goods in the production of which chemicals are used, and they are certainly not few in number."
"This aspect is also relevant to one important topic in the Regulation, that being the protection of intellectual property and of confidential data, which loomed particularly large in the Legal Affairs Committee, and about which I should like, briefly, to say something."
"The Commission proposal as it stands at present does not take adequate account of this and does not go far enough."
"Commission Verheugen did mention it earlier on, and, on the assumption that I did not misunderstand him, I think he got it broadly right."
"The fact is that guaranteed mutuality is completely absent."
"If European businesses disclose a lot of data, outsiders can see them and infer things from them; the reverse is not the case, and it is because that state of affairs goes against the idea of globally fair competition that the Legal Affairs Committee decided to adopt a series of amendments to take that into account."
"Some of them found their way into the overall package, notably the ones relating to the extension of deadlines, to which Mr Sacconi made brief reference earlier."
"Amendments aimed at improving the confidentiality of data – specifically Amendments 43, 45, 46 und 48 – did not make it, and I would like to take the opportunity to ask that they be incorporated now."
". Mr President, I do indeed intend to put forward the position of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality rather than do as some Members have done and misuse my speaking time to express my personal views."
"The Women’s Committee endorses, by a large majority, the Commission’s proposal on REACH."
"Women are particularly affected by chemical pollution, because the fat in their bodies more readily absorbs dangerous substances."
"Chemicals build up in the body and can cause cancer."
"The incidence of breast cancer has doubled in Europe over the last twenty years; one woman out of every nine in Europe suffers from cancer, and this is in many cases attributable to chemicals."
"Chemicals can also harm embryos and impair fertility; 15% of all couples want children but cannot have them."
"Men’s sperm quality has halved over recent years; genes can be altered and allergies triggered."
"Chemicals have an effect on children’s health, too."
"The incidence of cancer in children is increasing by 1% per annum, and it has become the second most common cause of death in childhood."
"Women, without wanting to do so, pass on the whole chemical cocktail to their children during pregnancy and breast-feeding."
"The Women’s Committee therefore regards REACH as a unique opportunity to better protect people and their environment from hazardous chemicals."
"Not only has it endorsed the idea that REACH should be clear, but it has made a particular point of calling for rigorous registration, going on, indeed, to propose that chemicals should be registered from a lower limit of 10 kilograms right up to one tonne."
"The Women’s Committee wants substitution to be made mandatory, and imported products to be registered as well."
"It is in no doubt about its desire for limited registration and demands a clear substitution ..."
". Mr President, the Committee on Petitions received the signatures of a million British women."
"Lord Bach, a million British women wrote to Parliament concerned about the effect of chemical substances on their bodies and on their lives."
"The European trade unions have called for a strong REACH, as have several million European health workers and doctors."
"You have said that this Regulation may be our only opportunity."
"Let us not spoil it."
"Nevertheless, I fear that we are going to spoil it, because there has been unacceptable pressure here, some shameful positions, which are turning their backs on millions and millions of Europeans who are expecting this Parliament, these institutions, to provide measures that have a positive impact on their daily lives."
"We cannot – as has been said – apply a system for the risk assessment of substances, according to the compromise proposal, when, as a result of that compromise, we will never know anything about more than 90% of the substances."
"Never."
"With all of the exemptions, with all the loopholes, with all the opt-outs, we will never have any information."
"This compromise only promotes ignorance and obscurity."
"Let us put an end to toxic ignorance once and for all, please."
"Today, this week, we have the opportunity to do so."
"We cannot spoil it."
". Ladies and gentlemen, chemicals legislation was supposed to protect the public’s health, but it appears to be turning into a great disappointment, a watered down result and a victory for the chemical industry lobby, using its enormous wealth as a weapon."
"The agreement between conservatives and socialists will mean that no chemicals in consumer products will be tested."
"This is a scandal, as we know that chemicals cause a third of occupational diseases and a significant proportion of allergies, asthmas, infertility and cancer."
"The role played by the Commission, and in particular by the Directorate-General that Commissioner Verheugen heads, has been truly curious."
"It has been like a Kinder Easter Egg: you never know what surprise will pop out this week."
"Nearly every week we have had totally conflicting messages in the name of the Commission: the Commission supports its original proposal, does not support it, does support it, does not support it."
"A lot of information has come from the Commission that runs counter to its official decisions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is not good management and it does not set a good example to Turkey, which is aspiring to membership."
"I would ask you all to support the proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the example set by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which would guarantee that chemicals used in consumer products have been tested."
"Then we would be creating a competitive edge for European industry."
"Everywhere in the world people would know that European products are safe, and small companies could also safely use chemicals protecting their own employees."
"Mr President, I will start by expressing my respect for the rapporteur’s – Mr Sacconi’s – working spirit and resolve, but I am also indebted to the tenacious attitude displayed by a number of Members, including Mr Nassauer, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, Mrs Herczog, Mrs Erika Mann, Mr Thomas Mann, Mr Langen, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mr Goebbels, Mr Manders and others, because without them as fellow fighters for a workable REACH, we would not have reached a result."
"In our modern-day society, chemicals are all around us."
"Chemical substances or techniques are used for body care, food and health products."
"Chemicals in Europe are of major significance, accounting, as they do, for EUR 440 billion of the GNP."
"Since 1.3 million workers are employed in 27 000 companies in that industry, it has a positive impact on the economy, but that does not take away the fact that there is a sense of unease among the European public about the effects and risks of chemicals on our everyday life, the work place and our environment."
"With this mammoth legislative project, we can instil renewed confidence and provide convincing arguments."
"The regulation as originally proposed by the Commission was too bureaucratic, involved too much documentation and was costly without it being able to actually improve the result."
"I think that we must offer guarantees for a workable project that in eleven years’ time will provide society with products that are absolutely safe."
"One thing still causes me concern. A number of compromises have been struck, and I welcome them."
"With regard to the authorisation, new compromises have been tabled, including some compromises by four of the groups."
"The Members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and possibly those of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament may think that there is a little more room to manoeuvre in those compromises, but nothing could be further from the truth."
"Rules have been stepped up in the compromises, so much so that in some respects, they are even stricter than those that were voted on in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"I would therefore ask you not to get the wool pulled over your eyes, but to have another good look at the documents."
"Mr President, I wanted to point out that Mrs Hassi was not presenting the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but solely her own personal opinion, on which it was not possible for a majority to vote."
". Mr President, let us review REACH calmly, being careful to avoid both naïve green optimism and industrial pessimism."
"Chemistry is neither left-wing nor right-wing."
"It is an indispensable element of the universe."
"Certain chemical compounds are harmful to humans, whether they occur naturally or are man-made."
"The most basic prudence demands a cautious approach to new chemical substances."
"I prefer prudence to the precautionary principle, which is too frequently used to evade all responsibility."
"According to the publications of organisations such as Greenpeace, the truly dangerous substances are already known, because they are condemned day in, day out."
"Why, therefore, do we want to make REACH a cumbersome, bureaucratic system; why do we not concentrate on attacking the extremely worrying carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic and bioaccumulative substances?"
"For all of these substances, the substitution principle is a necessity."
"The compromises drawn up by Mr Sacconi safeguard this objective."
"The flexibility condemned by some will still involve the responsibility of the European Chemicals Agency, whose powers will be extended."
"It is not giving in to the industrial lobbies to want to take account of the legitimate interests of SMEs and to limit expensive and often useless tests."
"Hence the need for the principle of ‘one substance, one registration’."
"The language of chemistry is universal, and each chemical formula is unique."
"Protection of the environment and protection of health remain prime objectives."
"However, whatever the fear merchants may claim, the natural environment in Europe is constantly improving and, each year, the life expectancy of Europeans increases by, on average, three months."
"Humans are, nevertheless, mortal."
"It is therefore wrong to claim that a stricter REACH system will save thousands of lives and create, so to speak, immortality."
"REACH is necessary, if only for the benefit of workers in the sector. It is a matter of protecting not only their health but also their jobs."
"The European chemical industry is the best in the world."
"The preservation of a competitive European chemicals sector remains an honourable objective, even though we need to remind the industrial lobbies that cleaner production procedures and non-problematic products would constitute a real competitive advantage on the global market."
"Faced with often extreme claims, our rapporteur, with the help of others, has been able to strike a balance between the imperatives of health, the environment and the economy."
"Even those who will not vote for the compromises proposed by Mr Sacconi cannot fail to recognise that Europe is in the process of developing, on the subject of chemistry, the most progressive and most ambitious legislation in the world."
"Mr President, the background to why we need new chemicals legislation in Europe has been eloquently described."
"I shall not therefore go into more detail about it."
"In the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, we have identified ten thorny political issues."
"I wish therefore, instead, to describe some of these."
"Credible evaluations of the draft legislation have been undertaken, and these have shown that there are special problems for small enterprises where 1-10 tonne volumes are concerned. There is therefore a need for simplified registration for small enterprises when it comes to non-hazardous chemicals."
"At the same time, stricter requirements need to be made of those chemicals suspected of being dangerous."
"The compromise means that further information is required about approximately 30% of the substances, while simplified registration is enough for the remaining substances."
"I think that this is a good balance – perhaps not perfect, but acceptable – and, when it comes to such important matters, something good should not be jeopardised by pursuit of the ideal."
"It is often said that what characterises a good compromise is the fact that everyone is equally dissatisfied with the result."
"I believe that the opposite is, in actual fact, true in this case, that is to say that most people are reasonably satisfied with the result."
"The proposal needs also to be strengthened in a number of ways."
"Each individual consumer must have the right to know whether there are any dangerous chemicals in the goods that he or she purchases."
"Therefore, our compromise also contains rules concerning the duty of care, which clearly lies with companies."
"The ALDE Group also proposes an addition clearly stating that the burden of proof should lie with companies."
"One important issue concerns authorisation, that is to say the actual decisions concerning chemicals."
"It is important to have a strong substitution principle for hazardous chemicals that can be replaced by less hazardous alternatives."
"Those chemicals that need to be authorised are not just any old ones. They are chemicals that can cause cancer, that damage people’s reproductive functions and that become concentrated in the human body – in other words, the worst of the worst offenders."
"Those companies lowest down in the chain, known as downstream users, need also to have access to better information, and consumers need to have the right to be informed."
"I am therefore pleased that the relevant provisions are included."
"REACH needs, moreover, to be made clearer."
"The mining industry is wrong to believe that it has to test every lorry-load of iron ore taken out of a mine."
"The proposal contains similar grey areas and odd features which all three of the major political groups have been very much in agreement about removing."
"I should like to thank Commissioners Verheugen and Dimas."
"For a moment, I was concerned when they came up with this ‘room paper’, but I am very pleased that the Commission has now decided to support the main policy represented by the big three groups in Parliament."
"I should also like to congratulate Great Britain on the sterling work it has done and continues to do and also to congratulate Luxembourg on the work it did earlier on when it held the Presidency."
"The decision I hope we shall vote through on Thursday here in the Chamber greatly resembles the proposal put forward by the Presidency."
"This means that we now have the opportunity both to stabilise the whole issue and to reach a decision considered by the ALDE Group to be incredibly important."
"We shall support the compromise proposals on the table."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Sacconi for his work on REACH and for the compromises that, with our help, he has brought about on the subjects of authorisation etc."
"The attacks on REACH by Mr Nassauer, Mr Schulz, Mr Poettering and Mrs Ek are, however, a policy of appeasement of the German chemicals industry, which destroys the environment and public health and makes things impossible for workers and all small enterprises that want actually to know about the effects of the chemicals they are buying and about their consequences for us."
"As long as four years ago, the European Parliament, through Mrs Schörling’s report, demanded that REACH be couched in stronger terms."
"For a year, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has worked in an efficient and balanced way with a view to protecting public interests, health and the environment."
"Now, the whole of Parliament appears to be hypnotised by the German chemical industry’s lobbying ploy, with Mr Nassauer as the first wielder of the magic wand."
"How can you in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats defend the Nassauer compromise’s attack on small enterprises whereby data is not fully shared with them and whereby they have an extra five years in which to pay for information available to the large companies?"
"How can you defend no longer having the registration fee dependent on volume and justify the lack of clarity there now is in connection with costs?"
"You should snap out of the spell you are under and vote in favour of the alternative compromise."
"How can you in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament defend the way in which the testing of low volume chemicals has been hugely undermined?"
"How can you defend woolly criteria according to which high volume chemicals too can be exempted from tests designed to detect cancer risks?"
"How are we to protect workers when we have no information and no clear requirements governing the working environment?"
"Stop being so bewitched and vote against Mr Nassauer and in favour of the alternative compromise."
"As for you Liberals, you should break the spell and stand up for a liberal policy."
"Allow consumers the opportunity and the knowledge to vote hazardous chemicals out of existence."
"Vote against the Nassauer compromise and the way it undermines consumer protection."
"It is in danger of making guinea pigs of us all by removing the explicit protection that exists against consumers being exposed to research chemicals."
"Moreover, the compromise bases consumer protection on risk assessment being required to be carried out using available data, but it was precisely this lack of data that REACH was supposed to remedy."
"That does not constitute your compromise."
"I would therefore ask you to break the spell of the German chemical industry’s misleading siren calls concerning growth."
"If REACH is undermined, all that will grow are cancerous tumours in our citizens."
"It would take me an hour to list all the organisations that want to see REACH couched in stronger terms."
"You should, emphatically, listen to them."
"You will only be given the opportunity to vote in favour of a stronger REACH if you vote against the Nassauer compromise and in favour of the alternative proposal."
"Before I continue, I would like to point out that Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure concerning personal statements enables Members whose names are mentioned in the speeches to request the floor, which would be granted to them at the end of the debate."
"If everyone mentions Mr Nassauer’s name, it is clear that at the end of the debate he could ask to make dozens of personal statements."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of the overwhelming majority in my political group."
"The Left in the EU want to see REACH couched in strong terms."
"We want to see a REACH whereby we are told about the effects of chemicals, including those manufactured in smaller volumes."
"We want to see a chemicals policy that makes it compulsory to phase out and ban the most hazardous chemicals of all."
"We want companies to have clear responsibility for their products."
"This is in the interests both of public health and of employees’ safety."
"Every serious analysis shows that the benefits of an efficient chemicals policy greatly exceed the often hugely exaggerated costs of chemicals policies in general."
"It should be self-evident that REACH is a good thing."
"Companies need to know what they are doing and to accept responsibility for what they do."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we arrived at what in the main was a constructive compromise."
"I deeply regret the fact that socialists and liberals have run away from that compromise and chosen instead to reach a settlement with the Right."
"The Nassauer/Sacconi compromise drastically weakens what we aspired to achieve in terms of an efficient REACH."
"It means that we shall not learn about the effects of chemicals."
"A full 90% of low volume chemicals may be exempted, and chemicals within the higher volume band are also exempt from proper tests."
"This means that we shall not be able to obtain the knowledge required for an efficient chemicals policy."
"We believe that this is wholly unacceptable."
"Our political group will never be able to agree to chemicals policy being weakened in such a way."
"We have therefore chosen to join with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in putting forward the alternative proposal."
"Many Members of this Parliament have in practice acted as mouthpieces for the chemical industry’s lobbyists."
"I think that this has sometimes been depressing to see."
"To Mrs Ek I should like to say the following: you talk about the environment but, at every possible opportunity, you have consistently made efforts to weaken and impair this draft legislation."
"This is the most important proposal on environmental issues that we have dealt with for many years in the EU system."
"What you are advocating is not an environmental policy."
"To the European Commission I should like to say the following. You have lost credibility on environmental issues."
"You are running away from your own proposal."
"You are not even standing up and defending what you yourselves proposed as recently as a few years ago."
"That is weakness, in my view."
"You no longer have any credibility on environmental policy."
"Finally, Sacconi’s apple."
"If you have been given this apple by Mr Nassauer, then I would look out."
"It is probably chock-full of dangerous chemicals and insecticides and presumably rotten inside."
". Mr President, rarely will a proposal be discussed here that is as complicated as this one."
"The Commission’s REACH proposal must be improved."
"We are all agreed on this, but, when it comes to how this improvement is to be carried out, opinion in this House is very much divided."
"On 4 October, we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety reached an acceptable compromise."
"Although aspects that are important to me, including risk and volume-based registration, have not made it to the finishing line, I still voted in favour at the final vote."
"I am now also endorsing in the plenary the compromise that was reached in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"In my view, the ‘Sacconi-Nassauer compromise’ is inadequate."
"With this approach, we lose the results achieved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to some extent."
"Nevertheless, I should like to express my appreciation to the rapporteur for his approach and good cooperation."
"Given the little support it received at the final vote, I can understand why he chose his approach after the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"I can endorse the thrust of the Rescue Reach Plan of the Group of the Greens, although I do not support the removal of use and exposure categories."
"I should like to draw you attention to a number of points again, because I consider them so important."
"An appropriate solution must be found to the problem of inorganic substances."
"Metals, ores and concentrates cannot be dealt with in the same manner as organic chemical substances."
"I expect the Council to address this problem and to have resolved it by second reading."
"The burden on small and medium-sized enterprises must be manageable."
"Following the vote, another cost and benefit analysis must be carried out in order to map out the effects of the vote on the burden on SMEs."
"The forming of consortia must be promoted, partly in order to keep the costs down."
"Volume and risk go hand in hand."
"It is precisely about the most dangerous substances that most information is required, and these need not involve large volumes."
"That remains a major problem."
"Finally, whilst animal tests must be avoided where possible, progress remains necessary."
"If this wish list is fulfilled, I think we will be well on our way of achieving our goal."
". Mr President, I am sure there is nobody in this House who disputes the need for REACH, whose primary concern is the health of the people of Europe, its future generations, its young people in particular, and the environment."
"Today there are more than 100 000 chemical products on the European market, a large majority of which have never been evaluated with regard to their long-term effects."
"More and more scientific research shows that modern-day illnesses such as asthma, allergies, certain types of cancer and work-related illnesses are often the result of chemical products in the environment."
"REACH will make it easier to develop and market new and safer substances and it will greatly reassure European consumers as manufacturers, producers and importers register chemicals and supply information about their properties."
"REACH will encourage the replacement of most hazardous substances."
"It will apply not only to products within all EU Member States, but will also apply to imported products."
"While there is unanimous approval for REACH’s aims, there is far less agreement over the means of achieving them, especially regarding the obligations it imposes on the chemical and pharmaceutical industries."
"In my own country, Ireland, pharmaceutical industries account for EUR 37.4 billion in exports and account for almost 40 000 jobs directly and indirectly."
"We must therefore avoid crippling small and medium-sized European industries with over-stringent obligations and regulations."
"In modern life, chemicals play an essential role in the economy."
"We all need chemicals as part of everyday life, but we also need to guarantee their safety."
"REACH can provide that guarantee and information, but we must be careful not to destroy these industries as well."
"The key to this debate is balance."
"I believe that, with the amount of effort that various members of committees have put in, particularly my own committee, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have achieved that balance and I believe that this proposal should be acceptable to the House."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pay tribute to the painstaking work undertaken by the rapporteur Mr Sacconi in preparing this report."
"As a doctor, I am aware of the considerable rise in the incidence of serious diseases recorded over the last decade, much of which is due to the hazardous use of chemicals."
"Often, however, problems arise from a failure on the part of manufacturers to provide information concerning the effects of chemicals."
"It is important to realise that the REACH directive is not only about the conflict between the chemical industry and the environment, but also about the competition between large corporations and small to medium-sized enterprises in the chemical sector."
"I welcome the fact that the REACH directive will ban some substances and have them replaced by less dangerous substitutes."
"However, most of the chemical substances mentioned in the report will not be eliminated from the environment."
"I hope that people will be directly informed, on the basis of tests, of the dangers they pose."
"Needless to say, I am also thankful for the fact that people will be more careful when handling such substances."
"I do, however, have one serious reservation regarding a kind of discrimination against the ten new Member States."
"These states have been party to the discussions on the REACH directive for only one year, as a result of which their level of readiness is lower than that of the EU-15, which have been discussing the issue for three years."
"The Slovak Republic supports and recommends the approval of the ‘one substance, one registration’ system because it contributes to reducing overall testing costs and eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy."
"Since the objective of REACH is to reduce the risks posed by chemical substances while avoiding price increases in final products brought about by high testing costs, I believe that it would be appropriate also to standardise testing charges, due account being taken of the weaker economies of the new Member States."
"Mr President, the Commission proposal is both too bureaucratic and too expensive; it harms small and medium-sized businesses and, unless substantially amended, is utterly indefensible."
"As it was not these two Commissioners, but rather their predecessors, who presented the proposal, the new change in attitude is to be welcomed."
"The second thing I want to say is that the additional proposals brought in by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety may well keep big businesses happy, but they will have no such effect on small ones."
"The line taken by the Greens and others, again and again, exemplifies their hostility to small businesses."
"There are a number of principles on which certain committees have agreed by large majorities."
"The first is that businesses bear responsibility, but must also take precautions."
"The second is that the minimum requirements and the available data are more readily accessible; it takes up to 18 months."
"Thirdly, assessments should be flexible and on the basis of risk; the exposure and use categories must be accessible right down to the end of the user chain."
"Fourthly, voluntary cooperation must be encouraged; there must be no mandatory consortia of the kind that the British Presidency keeps on proposing."
"Fifthly, repeated experiments on animals should be avoided."
"I shudder at the thought of all the thousands of animal experiments – all of them unnecessary – that would have to be carried out if the proposals from the Greens were to be adopted."
"Fair competition must be safeguarded, and one particular way in which this may be done is through the handling of imports, which is the subject of Article 6."
"There must be no time limit to authorisation, which must be capable of being reviewed under certain circumstances."
"Greater attention needs to be paid to the needs of small and medium-sized businesses."
"I would indeed argue that it is only these changes that will make the whole thing a defensible proposition, and I wish to express my gratitude to all those who, in various committees and in various capacities, have worked on it."
"It is only when we have a sensible compromise that enjoys general support that this House will be able to wield the clout to which it is entitled, for neither the Commission nor the Council have hitherto been in a position to do so."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in France, almost 10% of cancers developed by workers each year are related to their exposure to chemicals at their place of work."
"In the absence of useable data on these chemicals, however, only a tiny proportion of these cancers are recognised as occupational diseases and dealt with as such."
"More generally, we are seeing an exponential increase in the incidence of cancer affecting the whole of the population, particularly children, which has led many scientists to conclude that these cancers are directly related to chemical production."
"That demonstrates the importance attached to the entry into force of a system of assessment, authorisation and substitution of chemicals."
"All of us here are keen to guarantee the competitiveness of the European chemical industry and thus to protect jobs."
"For my part, I have always advocated the idea that the system adopted should be technically and economically sustainable for business and, to this end, promote consortiums."
"However, we do not want a REACH on the cheap."
"In order for REACH to make it truly possible to eliminate harmful substances from the European market, there are two conditions."
"First, the determination of the nature and the potential risks of substances is directly dependent on the quality of the information supplied during registration."
"No amendment must result in the registration aspect being rendered powerless and, in this regard, derogations from the obligation to provide data must be exceptional and strictly limited, including for substances produced in small quantities."
"The burden of proof must lie with the companies."
"Secondly, we must give all the citizens of Europe, and all workers, the assurance that harmful substances will be removed from circulation and replaced with safe products."
"The implementation of a substitution requirement, and not just a recommendation, is non-negotiable."
"Thus, a harmful substance must not be granted authorisation for placing on the market if an alternative product exists."
"In my view, it is in the light of these requirements that we must consider our vote at first reading."
"The socialists in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for whom I am the shadow rapporteur were satisfied with a compromise fairly similar to the one we have before us today."
"On the other hand, other members of our group, particularly the French socialists, would have liked a more ambitious compromise."
"To conclude, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, for the hard work he has put in."
"Mr President, there have been two early casualties of REACH, the first of which is truth."
"Too many in the chemicals industry, and particularly its German lobbying arm, seem to believe that if you are going to tell a lie, then lie big; the costs of REACH have been grossly exaggerated from beginning to end."
"The second casualty has been the Commission’s claim to be neutral in its support both for economic developments and for environmental protection at one and the same time."
"After Commissioner Verheugen’s quite disgraceful attempts even to undermine the position taken by the British Presidency, we are entitled to believe that the balance in the Commission is now firmly anti-environment."
"A word of praise from our political opponents for the British Presidency: it has done well to secure an agreement between the 25 Member States without sacrificing nearly as many of the original objectives as some of us feared."
"I hope it secures a common position before the end of December and I hope that this Parliament votes on Thursday in a way that will bring it close to the Presidency’s position."
"However, we cannot yet be certain."
"There are still Members here who reject the very idea that industry should bear the burden of proving that the chemicals it puts on the market are safe."
"There are still Members here who would strip away the testing requirements almost completely: ‘Trust us, they are chemical companies’ is their argument."
"There are Members here who still believe that chemicals of high concern should continue to be sold even when safer substitutes are readily available."
"Mr Sacconi and Mrs Ek have negotiated compromises that will meet the genuine concerns of industry while still setting high standards of environmental protection."
"However, we have yet to see if they command majority support."
"There is one matter that has hardly been considered: we are leaving a host of issues here to the new Chemicals Agency, but we have no idea what criteria it will adopt or whether it will be lax or rigorous in its interpretation."
"So, if you think the lobbying over the past year or more has been intense, wait until the industry starts trying to stuff the Agency with its own people."
"We will have to watch that process like hawks."
"Mr President, many in my group have highlighted the enormous weaknesses in the Sacconi-Nassauer compromise in terms of health and the environment and of course I agree with them."
"However, I want to focus on the additional weaknesses of that compromise from an animal welfare perspective."
"Concerning data sharing, for example, the compromise provides far too many loopholes."
"While groups of companies would be permitted to bring forward a single registration, separate registrations would still be allowed, making it much more likely that repeat animal tests will take place."
"The proposal would allow data over ten years old to be freely shared, reducing if not eliminating the possibility that repeat tests would take place."
"The compromise, by contrast, only allows data over 15 years old to be shared, again increasing the likelihood that repeat tests would be undertaken."
"This is completely unacceptable since, as well as being extremely cruel, animal testing is crude and inefficient."
"The problems of extrapolating test results from animals to people and from laboratory doses to real life are now well documented."
"Just last week an article in the scientific journal described regulatory animal testing as being ‘stuck in a timewarp, largely based on wasteful and poorly predictive animal experiments’."
"That is why I tabled amendments to Annexes V to VIII of REACH."
"Many of these were adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, a move that has already helped to increase the pressure on the Commission and industry to push for further work on non-animal tests."
"However, if we are to seek a better approach we must not let this opportunity to force greater scrutiny of animal tests to pass us by."
"We must challenge conventional assumptions about animal test methods and scrutinise test methods with as much rigour as we scrutinise other aspects of this proposed new chemicals policy, because exposing animal tests to scrutiny will prompt the kind of debate we cannot afford to ignore."
"If we ignore it, then REACH and all future chemicals regulation will be tied to test methods that deserve only to be consigned to history."
"Lord Bach said that the vote on REACH is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
"I agree and that is why it is so important we get it right."
"– Mr President, the history of REACH is a history of constant weakening of the Commission's initial proposal and every time the Commission comes along and celebrates a different proposal from the initial proposal it submitted."
"A month ago, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety voted by a very large majority for a strong REACH, worthy of its name."
"Today, under pressure from the chemical industry lobby – which no one here can pretend they know nothing about – and certain Member States, led by Germany, we have before us a poor compromise by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, a compromise which, with a gun to Mr Sacconi's head, weakens the proposal by the Committee on the Environment."
"With this negative agreement, not only is the protection of public health and the environment not being put first; on the contrary, it is being subjugated to the demands of a poor perception of competitiveness."
"We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left do not intend to vote for this poor agreement."
"Mr President, we believe that the House should reject this draft."
"Even the abbreviation by which it is known makes it sound as if it has come about purely for the benefit of the rich."
"After giving much thought to the matter, these latter have thought up a procedure that is authoritarian and centralist in its very concept."
"It goes without saying that they have packaged it as a noble attempt to protect health and the environment, yet it will mean bankruptcy for small and medium-sized enterprises, and cannot fail to deprive hundreds of thousands of people of their jobs."
"Few will benefit from the market being taken over by large chemical companies."
"Furthermore, any hypothetical health benefits from environmental improvements, which themselves are pure theory at present, would be vanishingly small compared to the health problems suffered by those who have been left unemployed."
"These people would be frustrated by the loss of their livelihood, their means of existence, their opportunities for development and their hope."
"More information and a supposed increase in consumer confidence in products are not worth having if the cost in economic and social terms is so large."
"Proof of this cunning scheme to ruin the weaker members of society can be seen in the fact that chemical companies have pre-empted the proposal for a directive by carrying out the recommended tests on toxic substances, without any consensus having been reached on whether their findings should be shared."
"Tests should be performed centrally on the most toxic substances in order to obtain reliable data, and these substances should be withdrawn from the market, in particular if they are carcinogenic or harmful to the reproductive system or other systems."
"We support the international campaign ‘Objection!’, which has been launched in protest at the costs that will be incurred for no good reason due to REACH."
"A proposal that is genuinely aimed at protecting human health and the environment should be drafted to replace the current proposal, which is primarily concerned with business-related factors."
"Another question I should like to ask is how anyone with a clear conscience can be in favour of a proposal for a directive to which only somewhat over 1 000 amendments have now been tabled, out of a former total of 2 000 or 3 000."
"On top of that, establishing which amendments have gained the approval of the House during the course of the debate is physically and mentally impossible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take my cue from Mr Sacconi’s reflections: he spent last Sunday thinking over this measure, which is certainly a compromise but which also entails considerable responsibility."
"In my view, however, Mr Sacconi has made some fundamental mistakes, especially in terms of relations with others."
"Thus to reach a compromise he should have shared his reflections with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety: otherwise his position is a purely personal one, not one shared by the committee."
"That is why, Mr Sacconi, I think you have taken the wrong route in deciding not to seek a solution of the most general application possible."
"In this connection I should like to make some observations concerning the OSOR (one substance, one registration) system."
"I think that we ought to try to find a solution that separates the OSOR system from the REACH package, because as things stand, as has been emphasised several times, small and medium-sized enterprises are not protected."
"It would furthermore be useful to speak about tonnage in cases where costs become too high."
"I nevertheless believe that in the case of hazardous products, the costs of tonnage should be duly taken into account without ever losing sight of the danger aspect."
"Moreover, I do not agree with the decision to split the list of products into two parts, since this would discriminate against some hazardous products and some firms."
"Mr President, once again we are faced with legislation designed for one purpose but dressed up as something else."
"Who could argue with the need for control of the use of chemicals and the protection of public safety?"
"Registration – maybe; evaluation by scientists – of course; but authorisation by officials in a chemicals agency? A nightmare!"
"REACH is not about the control of chemicals; it is about bureaucrats responding to the multinationals, both sides of an unspoken agreement happy to exploit the insatiable desire for yet more social engineering and centralised control."
"REACH has been sold to a naive public as a panacea for a better world, ‘switch selling’, I suggest, of the shoddiest kind."
"If REACH passes, even as it stands, with the compromise, any small enterprise with a new idea or a product that might really make this world a better place is likely to find the price of entry into the marketplace impossibly high."
"The law of unintended political consequences already says that the effect of REACH will be to export jobs."
"Enterprise in this sector will be stifled in the European Union and will emerge in other countries that are not hamstrung by crushing legislation."
"That will be the effect and it is the antithesis of what is needed."
"Mr President, the day after tomorrow the European Parliament will vote on the REACH Regulation, following two long years of legislative procedure."
"From the moment when we got to work until today, all the Members involved have spent vast numbers of hours in order to achieve a result that, with the greatest possible consensus within this House and with the other institutions, adequately protects consumer health and improves the quality of the environment, all without jeopardising the competitiveness of our industry."
"I must admit that, at the outset, such a result seemed very difficult to achieve, but I am pleased to note that, a few hours before the vote, the positions of the main political groups are relatively close."
"The compromise on registration, signed by the Socialist Group, by our group and by the Liberals, demonstrates that the European Parliament can be a match for the circumstances and take responsible decisions with regard to our citizens and our industry."
"Because, at the end of the day, that is what we are talking about: sending a message of confidence to the citizens, demonstrating that their welfare is a priority for the Union’s institutions."
"It is also our duty to legislate to promote the competitiveness of our industry, in accordance with the commitment we made in Lisbon and as we repeated a few months ago."
"Mr President, many Members here today, representing various political groups, have jointly presented amendments which we believe to be essential in order to ensure that REACH is an example of how European legislation can be coherent, take responsibility for the health of the citizens and promote innovation and competitiveness at the same time."
"I hope that the great majority of this House supports them."
"Mr President, I can certainly endorse what Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca has said."
"In the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we devoted ourselves to hammering out compromises, and it is evident to us from looking at the compromise package negotiated by Mr Sacconi and Mr Nassauer that they and we have in fact been thinking along similar lines. By that I mean that, on the one hand, we wanted to do everything possible to manage a proper energy policy, to develop it and to maintain competitiveness, while, on the other hand, not forgetting the second pillar, with its protection for health, the environment and people at work."
"The two are directly connected."
"I believe that these things are present in the compromise, but they are all becoming difficult, and we shall see how our negotiations proceed tomorrow, for we have another day to go before we vote."
"While we do, indeed, have a compromise package, it covers only registration, and we shall have to see what we can achieve in the other areas, with everything from authorisation to the issues about how to handle data protection and many other aspects."
"The Council Presidency has made suggestions."
"I would be happy if these negotiations could bring us, before the end of the year, to a proper compromise both here and in the Council, so that the topic does not end up being shelved."
"I would also advise all those Members who have made comments about Germany today to stop and consider for a moment the fact that there is a connection between the pursuit of a proper national energy policy in a particular Member State – which, I would add, applies in the case of the Nordic countries – and the sort of proper energy policy that we are constructing in Europe, and it can be summed up in the word ‘competitiveness’."
"Germany is the third-greatest chemicals producer in the world – behind the USA and Japan, but ahead of France, China and Italy; within the European Union, it accounts for over 25% of the turnover from chemical products and for one in every four jobs in the chemicals sector."
"These are figures of which you simply have to take note, for they are important, not only for Germany, but also for the European Union, when it comes to maintaining jobs."
"In 2004 alone, EUR 7.7 billion were invested in research."
"We are always talking expansively about how much we want research and how we want businesses to invest in it – so let us go ahead and support it!"
"Let me just give you one, final, figure, on the size of chemicals businesses in Europe: 92.5% of them are small or medium-sized."
"That is another statistic of which we should take note."
"– Mr President, when we come to vote on REACH, we do so at the end of a debate that has lasted almost two years and was, at its outset, conducted along strongly ideological lines."
"I say that with reference not only to the previous Environment Commissioner’s inglorious sensationalism, but also to some of the views emanating from the Greens today."
"They need to be told, gently, that there is more to politics than the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, that there is more to Parliament than the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and that there is more to the European Union than Scandinavia."
"I would like to say that I agree with Mrs Mann in so far as we, in this House, are working in Europe’s interest."
"I assume that that is what my fellow Members from other countries are doing and would claim that for myself."
"It has to be said, though, that ideology was initially introduced into the debate by the business world as much as by anyone else, for there were many in it who felt obliged to prophesy that REACH would be industry’s downfall, exaggerated though that certainly was."
"The debate has since become more rational, and it was indeed necessary that it should."
"In particular, I would like to thank Mr Nassauer and Mr Sacconi for having managed this difficult dossier really well."
"It must be abundantly clear to us that most small and medium-sized businesses, in particular those at the end of the production chain, will be significantly overstretched if the legal requirements are not simplified, if they get no outside support – which will be expensive, if the means of implementation are not practicable, and if the Commission draft remains in its original form."
"That is why we support ‘Objection!’, a European alliance of SMEs, which has taken an active part in the debate and demonstrated in practical terms what REACH will really mean at grass-roots level."
"Even now, the legislation we pump out of Brussels has become so complex that it is often beyond the capacity of SMEs to handle it."
"It follows, then, that if we do not succeed, in the course of implementing REACH, in making the information and assessment processes less complex, the existing transposition deficit will become all the greater, and that really is not in the interests of anyone in this House."
"In moving over to an approach to registration that focuses more on risk, the compromise proposal accomplishes a necessary paradigm shift, and rightly too, for that is where the crucial weakness is to be found in the Commission’s draft."
"The fact is that this would give cause to fear that requiring data without reference to risk would result in substances being lost to the market solely for reasons of cost."
"Were that to happen, REACH would not only have failed to achieve an essential objective, but would also have weakened European industry’s capacity for innovation."
"So let us get serious, let us have better regulation, let us be discerning in adopting REACH."
"I might add that I believe that we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, the draft REACH regulation would lose its bite if it were watered down in any way, shape or form."
"The misguided compromise hammered out between Mr Schulz and Mr Poettering is nothing less than a wish come true for the German chemical industry."
"Industry would win the day, while the environment and consumer protection would lose out."
"The compromise would be the final nail in the coffin for this reform of chemicals policy."
"We need a hard-hitting REACH and the equivalent of an MOT for chemicals, and we must not consent to companies being rewarded for their failure to provide information or for their lack of transparency."
"Surely it cannot be right that of the 30 000 substances that the regulation was originally intended to cover, only 12 000 are left."
"This would represent a complete abandonment of the fundamental principle underpinning REACH, namely that no substance may be marketed unless safety data is available."
"One of the mainstays of REACH is the reversal of the burden of proof, yet there are those in this House who even want to do away with this idea."
"I would call on Members to free themselves from the clutches of the German chemical industry, and to avoid setting yet another precedent that would mean that we would be treated in future as a carbon copy of the grand coalition in Berlin."
"Without a hard-hitting REACH, people will become guinea pigs for untested chemicals, and the principle of flying blind, guided only by ignorance, would be enshrined in law."
"Without REACH, the risk of cancer and the incidence of environmental illnesses will increase."
"I would therefore call on you to voice your support for a hard-hitting REACH."
"Industry must not be left to decide for itself what data it does and does not provide."
"It is a curious fact that all those Members of the House who have claimed to be acting out of concern for small and medium-sized enterprises have tabled amendments that would make matters worse for these latter."
"As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and in particular as a doctor, I should like to voice my support for a hard-hitting version of the new REACH regulation on chemical substances."
"During my time as a doctor, I have seen many cases of illness caused by chemical substances, and I am well aware of the fact that such substances have become so widespread that they are to be found in our children as well as in cleaning products."
"A great many of them also still need to be tested in order to ascertain the effect they may have in the future on humans or on the environment."
"In my opinion, the amendment seeking to ensure that industry would not have to provide information on small-volume substances undermines the very essence of REACH."
"As rapporteur on the Framework Directive on Health and Safety at Work (89/391/EEC), I believe we must adopt a hard-hitting version of REACH if we are to implement this Directive in practice."
"I am quite sure that we will not improve people’s health by means of a REACH that has lost its bite."
"Mr President, it is regrettable that powerful forces in this Parliament are working hard to ensure that chemicals legislation is as watered down as possible."
"REACH is a cross-border issue affecting both the environment and the internal market."
"EU measures are thus justified."
"I believe that the requirements to provide information about chemical substances in lower volumes must be strengthened."
"If that is not done, much of the point of REACH will be lost."
"I also support a strong substitution principle."
"Sweden has already introduced this, and to a large degree it is operating well."
"I believe that consumers should be entitled to information about the chemicals present in goods."
"That is a precondition of consumers being able to make active and informed choices."
"It is also important for us to make it clear that it is industry, and not the authorities, that must be responsible for evaluating the registered chemicals and assessing the risks they may present."
"There is no contradiction between a REACH couched in strong terms and an efficient market."
"Taking a lead on this issue will mean a competitive advantage in the long term."
"Hence, I shall vote against the compromise proposal devised by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"Mr President, it is unacceptable that, in our relatively enlightened times, we permit a huge number of chemical substances in our environment, without having registered them and without being aware of their harmful effects."
"It is unacceptable that we have no clear rules for replacing dangerous substances with less dangerous ones."
"We are in a situation in which this Parliament is divided, and the whole complicated proposal constituted by REACH could collapse into nothing."
"I belong to a party that would like to have seen action taken on the basis of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety’s position, as it stood before the compromises that have now been entered into."
"We must note with regret that there is no majority in favour of the original proposal by the Committee on the Environment."
"Negotiations regarding a compromise have, however, been conducted in a truly democratic way."
"I do not believe that REACH is the last piece of legislation we shall adopt in this area because we are always acquiring new knowledge about the need to protect our planet’s environment."
"The proposal now acceptable to Parliament’s large groups represents clear progress, however, and is far better than the present lack of clear legislation. I am therefore able to support the compromise proposal."
"Mr President, the debate that has been held so far on REACH, both within the House and outside it, has revealed that Europe is not yet ready to adopt this directive in its present hard-hitting form."
"We would all like to lead healthier and safer lives in greater harmony with nature, but financial realities and common sense should not be left out of the equation."
"At the same time, however, we do not want to turn down this opportunity to improve the situation for Europeans in legislative terms."
"Fortunately, the rapporteur has drafted a compromise proposal, which reconciles the interests of small, medium-sized and large enterprises, as well as those of consumers and workers who care about the environment."
"I will vote in favour of it for the sake of future generations, although it will mean financial losses for my country."
"Europe needs common regulations that are observed both by its Member States and by its foreign partners."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur."
"Sir Tom Blundell, Chairman of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, said that, given our understanding of the way chemicals interact with the environment, you could say we are running a gigantic experiment with humans and other living things as the subject."
"That was the reason for bringing forward this proposal."
"However, he said that if we followed the initial proposal, this huge backlog would take 50 years and see some 6 million animals destroyed."
"Therefore, the key is to get prioritisation, to make the system workable, to protect health, to reduce the number of animal tests and to achieve it all in ten years."
"We are embarking on this because most chemicals are safe and we depend on them, but some must be handled with care, some are so dangerous that we need to find safe alternatives."
"However, we do not know which is which."
"Since 1981 we have regulated new chemicals, but that covers only some 3 000 substances out of the 100 000 in existence and it has taken 40 different regulations and directives to do that."
"Hence we want to make it simpler: we want a single regulation, more understandable ways of establishing which substances are among the estimated 20% that will need proper assessment and authorisation."
"Industry needs certainty and clarity."
"So, with our compromises and our amendments, we go for prioritisation, pre-registration, ‘one substance, one registration’, data sharing, a balance between volume and risk, special account of the needs of small firms without sacrificing public safety, and mandatory data sharing to reduce and phase out animal testing."
"We also need to ensure that our European industries are not disadvantaged, so we must go as far as we can to ensure that substances in articles imported to Europe are covered by the same rules as those produced here, without infringing WTO rules."
"We must also take account of the very real worries among developing countries, especially on the issue of minerals and mining, and ensure that we do not damage their fragile economies."
"Mr President, very seldom in the history of this Parliament has there been such a high level of interest in our legislative work."
"Quite rightly so, because this legislation, along with the other points mentioned in this debate, provides us with a tremendous opportunity to lead the world in the regulation and authorisations of chemicals, and to influence what goes on not only within the European Union, but also beyond our borders with other chemical producers across the world."
"This is something that we need to take seriously because we really can have an impact."
"That is why it is so important to support the Sacconi-Nassauer compromise and ensure the passage of this legislation through Parliament, so that we can improve human health and the environment across the world, while at the same time maintaining our own industrial competitiveness."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when one is faced with a measure as wide-ranging as this one it is important to establish the right balance between on the one hand the overriding necessity to protect the health of citizens, workers and consumers and on the other hand the need to sustain the importance of the European chemicals industry in the economy and the labour market."
"This industry is represented not only by the large enterprises of some countries but also by the small, sometimes very small, and medium-sized enterprises of countries such as my own, Italy."
"That is why I believe that the work towards achieving convergence and narrowing the gap between positions that were originally far apart, work that has consisted of compromises, can be considered in a positive light since it takes on board all the many reasons and realities in question."
"In my view the important points are the need to protect people’s health; information for consumers; support for small and medium-sized enterprises while REACH is being put into effect, by means of support for research; the creation of a powerful agency with genuine powers; the streamlining of procedures for small and medium-sized enterprises; and, finally, the importance of the OSOR (one substance, one registration) programme. Not too many exceptions should be provided for, since I consider that data sharing and the apportioning of costs constitute important elements for our small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Finally, I believe that there should be specific and definite rules for imported products, since the rules for these products should be the same as those applied to European products."
"Mr President, we have made a great deal of progress since the launch of the REACH project."
"We have discovered that we were using more than 100 000 chemical compounds without knowing what effects they have."
"We have understood that our fellow citizens have been made ill by toxic substances that contribute to our jobs, our comfort and our happiness."
"About 20 years ago, when toxicological studies first showed that polar bears were contaminated with dioxins, we were shocked and indignant, but, of course, we were not going to stop progress just because of a few polar bears!"
"Today, the medical profession is certain: it is humans, all over the planet, who are intoxicated."
"Recent studies have shown that we women, as mothers, are passing a toxic heritage on to our children through the umbilical cord."
"It is the future of the human race that is in danger, whatever some of my fellow Members here today may say."
"This is a matter of urgency, if we do not want to be responsible for a health disaster attributable to chemicals."
"The initial REACH project allowed us to meet this challenge."
"Unfortunately, the blackmail of delocalisation and pressure from industry have poisoned our debates and misrepresented the ambitions of REACH."
"The rapporteurs’ compromise is an illusion, an imbalance between health and competition, because health is worth much more than high-pressure bargaining, and neither the Commission nor the Council has put a figure on the health costs of a weakened REACH."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forces opposing REACH demonstrate a sheer obstinacy that can be defined as anti-European."
"They are the forces of the uncontrolled market, of deregulation and of profits that speculate with public health and the environment."
"All these forces represent negative values that go against the underlying principles of a Europe harmonised in respect of social and environmental issues."
"Frankly, we do not have a high regard for Mr Barroso’s conduct."
"We think that a firm and decisive response to these forces is called for."
"For this reason we did not share, and we strongly criticise, the bad compromises that have been reached: they run the risk of gravely weakening REACH, without even resisting the forces that would like to kill it off."
"We are therefore – with the consent, in my view, of the vast majority who at this time are trying to ensure that this Parliament passes the best laws possible – retabling all the texts that are necessary for a strong REACH regulation, that is to say one that will be of genuine service to a modern Europe."
"Mr President, buried deep in the committee opinions attached to the Sacconi report we find a slim contribution from the Committee on Budgets showing funding forecasts for the proposed European Chemicals Agency."
"Those forecasts appear as an admirably clear table covering the years 2006 to 2016 and allowing for EUR 78 million of taxpayers’ money over this period to support the Agency."
"Curiously, this amount is spread very unevenly over the ten years in question with most of it, more than EUR 50 million, concentrated in 2014 and 2015."
"Even curiouser, no one on the Budgets Committee, including the chairman, seems to know anything about these figures, even though they appear in the Budgets Committee’s opinion."
"Why is this?"
"And why is the Agency expected to use two-thirds of its ten-year budget in only two years of the next decade?"
"Mr President, in view of the European Parliament’s first reading of the draft regulation concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals, and whilst we approve of the role to be played by the European Agency, we must take a cautious position, because this text, even with all the amendments made to it, is full of holes and is far from being a success."
"In addition, it does not seem to strike the desired balance between the three fundamental principles: protection of health and the environment, the competitiveness of business, innovation and substitution."
"This lack of precision results from the cost distortions that such a regulation would cause, which apparently range from EUR 3 to 180 billion, and from the benefits, which are estimated to amount to between EUR 5 and 230 billion."
"This disparity in the costs announced by the Commission, just like the costs put forward by the industry, is enormous."
"However, we must not forget that these costs will be borne solely by the industry, that this directive affects 5 million jobs and that it will have serious consequences."
"That is why we will not allow ourselves to be influenced by purely political statements and why we will assess the various amendments put forward on a case-by-case basis."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Sacconi, the coordinators and the rapporteurs for the immense efforts they have made, but also the whole of the technical team and the officials, all of whom have allowed us to reach an agreement on such a complex issue."
"This is a sign that politics works and that this Parliament works when it comes to a truly important task."
"We are dealing with a complex document, not just because it encompasses a huge number of policies, but because, furthermore — and this is what I am going to argue here — it is an open document."
"I believe that the issue is being dealt with as if the whole policy of chemical products ended with REACH; nevertheless, the policy on chemical products, if it is intended to promote the health and wellbeing of the citizens, must complement other Union policies and other policies of the countries and, therefore, we cannot take the view that everything begins and ends with REACH."
"And I believe that it will be the ideal instrument for producing consensus policies."
"What are the advantages of REACH?"
"I believe that it has created the basis for a common European policy in the chemical field and has been a victory for coordination and common policy in the field."
"Secondly, it has created an Agency which is being given authority, competences, responsibility and the capacity to coordinate, which I believe is an extraordinary victory for the citizens."
"Thirdly, REACH is entirely founded upon the recognition of science and the value of science and of studies, which guarantees objectivity for the future and also opens the doors to information for citizens and companies."
"I believe that that is the other important point we have to be pleased about."
"Furthermore — and I would like to end here — I believe that it is absurd to believe that the responsibility for the health policy must fall entirely to companies; companies are being blamed for everything that happens in the world of health and chemical products."
"I believe that, in this case, they are being given greater responsibility than before and they are being obliged to carry out studies, but the health policy with regard to new chemical products can only be implemented if we combine good research by the States and good health research and if the Agency emerges, with a group of experts, as a receptacle for the information which has to be communicated to the industries."
"Mr President, I see that we are all striving to create an effective, workable and successful system to improve the safety of chemical substances."
"To achieve this, it is crucial to ensure rapid implementation of pre-registration."
"This will enable the European Chemicals Agency to alert all manufacturers, importers and consumers at once if any new knowledge emerges regarding a substance."
"At the same time, however, we must not allow the draft REACH directive to engender discrimination between manufactured and naturally occurring substances, between particular geographical areas, or between Member States – here I am thinking of the new Member States, where industry is less capital-rich – or between large and small enterprises."
"REACH affects industry throughout the whole of Europe; in other words, we are talking about several million jobs."
"The statistical evidence confirms that one of the biggest dangers to human health and longevity is unemployment."
"The only kind of legislation that we can accept is one that creates at least as many new jobs as it might eliminate."
"Innovation, research and development are important for the discovery and economically efficient production of better quality substances."
"When tabling our proposed amendments, we in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy were guided by a concern for protecting the environment, protecting health and safeguarding jobs."
"I call upon you to support these amendments."
"Lastly, if you will permit, I would like to give Guido Sacconi a much nicer – and much healthier – apple from my own garden!"
"Mr President, like most of the speakers before me, I very much welcome REACH, which should guarantee that the substances we use in daily life do not present risks to human health and the environment."
"The authorisation of a harmful substance must, in my view, be an essential stage in the regulation."
"How is the product used?"
"How can it be identified?"
"How can we prevent its use by an unsuspecting public?"
"How, too, can we draw up a study plan with a view to the substitution of a dangerous substance?"
"REACH must also extend knowledge on chemicals by forming a European database and stimulate innovation by encouraging the substitution of substances of concern."
"REACH will be a good regulation if, based on the knowledge and expertise of the chemical industries, it gives rise to new technologies, new substances and new businesses."
"We will have succeeded if we adopt a proportionate, simple, effective system that is practicable for business."
"We will have succeeded if, on Thursday, we adopt a balanced text that enables businesses to retain their leading position at a global level and that protects the health of people and the environment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to extend my sincere thanks to Mr Sacconi for his excellent work, even if it may well be the case that our opinions on the issue did not always coincide."
"At the same time, I should also like to thank Mrs Ek and Mr Nassauer for having drafted key opinions on behalf of other committees consulted."
"If I may, I should like to comment briefly on the significance of REACH."
"I have had the pleasure of being a Member of this House for 17 years, and I believe that this is one of the largest and most significant reports that we have ever debated in this Chamber. This report will also have far-reaching implications for health – or at least we hope it will – and for industry."
"For once there is a point upon which Commissioner Verheugen and I do not see eye to eye, and I am glad that he is present in the Chamber again."
"The new Commission’s work on this dossier has been first-rate, but little information and few explanations were provided when this 1 200-page report was first put before the House. This meant that a very watered down and bleak version of the debate was presented over the following months by the other parties involved beyond the confines of this House."
"I am delighted that we are now well on the way to reconciling REACH’s two priorities, namely consumer protection and industrial policy, since this will ensure that the legislation is genuinely forward-looking and groundbreaking."
"It will be hard to ignore the implications of 1 200 pages."
"I am delighted that we have managed to incorporate the concept of exposure to chemicals into the report, at least up to a limit of 100 tonnes."
"This is exactly the approach I believe should be adopted to draw attention to an issue that lies close to my heart, namely the testing of chemicals in tobacco and cigarettes."
"The issue at stake here is neither tobacco nor a ban on smoking; instead, I am calling for nothing other than for tests to be carried out on the hand-mixed chemicals in cigarettes and cigarette papers."
"We fear that these substances could be mutagenic, carcinogenic and addictive."
"This issue is one of great concern to me, and I would urge the Members of the House to lend it their support."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur and draftsmen once again."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to thank Guido Sacconi for the work he has done on such a complicated subject."
"I believe that Parliament has done good work, because REACH is an important regulation."
"It should be noted that for many people it is bad that there is a chemical industry, but, if we think about it, in those countries in which there is no chemical industry, the average lifespan is approximately a half or a third that of the developed countries."
"I therefore believe that we should implement legislation which, on the one hand, guarantees quality of life and quality of products, but which, at the same time, makes it possible for this chemical industry from which we live and on which pharmaceutical progress depends to continue operating."
"I believe it is a question of balance and that Guido Sacconi and the rapporteurs of the different committees have examined the different elements and I believe that next Thursday we will be in a position, here in this Parliament, to vote on a text that has the full support of all sectors of Parliament."
"Mr President, in exactly two days’ time, Parliament will have a golden opportunity to reconcile Europeans with Europe by adopting this ambitious REACH directive, which really will protect our health and our environment."
"The choice is therefore simple: either we turn our backs on the concerns of the citizens by giving in to the wails of a certain industry or by voting in a traditional left-right split that is completely obsolete here, or the European Parliament transforms the draft produced by its Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety into a strong REACH project able to carry the hopes of the citizens and of the many innovators in the industry who have placed their bets on clean chemistry."
"We therefore need an ambitious REACH, which will make it possible to stem the increase in the incidence of cancer and other diseases, as two million doctors in Europe are demanding, and which will also protect the millions of workers exposed every day."
"With an extra-small registration system and an extra-large opt-out from the OSOR, in other words with the maximum opportunities to evade a system of ‘one substance – one registration’, how can you talk today, Mr Sacconi, Mr Verheugen, about an ambitious compromise?"
"Myself, I call that a defeat."
"I hope that, on Thursday, our Parliament will take the modern risk of combining health and sustainable employment instead of futilely continuing to set them up in opposition to each other."
"I will conclude, if I may, Mr President, with a brief, friendly response to Mr Goebbels: I, as a liberal, do not feel particularly ‘green’ for making this choice, which is neither left-wing nor right-wing, but is a bet on the future."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the science of chemistry and the chemical compounds produced by this science have helped man in his life to resolve problems; that is a fact, just as it is a fact that today we have thousands of compounds and products which circulate and many of these compounds are dangerous and may cause damage to the environment and to health."
"Consequently, the time has come for us to apply a policy in this sector and this policy is expressed in the REACH regulation."
"Similarly, this regulation gives us an opportunity to test in practice and to be tested on a series of questions of concern to the Union and its citizens."
"I refer to the questions of environmental protection and public health and to the need to adapt to the new circumstances being created with the introduction not only of quantitative but also of qualitative criteria, such as the dangers inherent in chemical compounds."
"This regulation must also regulate matters relating to environmental protection and public health while, at the same time, allowing the European chemical industry to adapt during the planned transitional stage."
"Basically, therefore, with this regulation we can have a tangible example of application in practice of the model of sustainable development, which supports and is supported by a harmonious combination of the three pillars which are, I would remind you, protection of the environment and public health, economic development, social cohesion and increased employment."
"I repeat, 'we can have a tangible example of application' mainly by expressing the expectation that the European chemical industry will respond in the way it knows best – in other words with innovation – so that not only will it adapt but also it will strengthen both its competitiveness and jobs."
"Innovation, by which I mean the composition of new compounds which are friendly to the environment and to health, is the key to achieving the harmonious updating of the three pillars of sustainable development."
"To close, I should emphasise that I have confidence in and I am relying on the codecision procedure in order to bring together all the aspects of this complex issue, so that we can achieve the best possible regulation."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to express my warm appreciation and thanks to Mr Sacconi who has, I think, done an excellent job."
"The REACH proposal means that 30 000 substances must be tested. As such, it is a source of innovation, but also of simplification."
"Since 40 directives will be withdrawn when REACH enters into effect, it will benefit both the environment and innovation."
"There are many fine amendments to make REACH more workable and less expensive, and to restrict the number of animal tests, but there are, unfortunately, still quite a few companies that are opposed to innovation and prefer to wallow in the unknown and do not feel like searching for safer and cleaner alternatives."
"Quite frankly, I think it is rather disappointing that they receive a good deal of political support."
"We all took up the challenge of Lisbon."
"Innovation is at the heart of European industry’s strong competitive position."
"Without continuing innovation to make products cleaner, safer and healthier, the European industry will end up losing out to China, India and the United States."
"The Dutch Social Democrats cannot back the compromise that is now before us."
"It represents a huge setback, if instead of 30 000 substances, only 8 000 are subjected to the full test regime of REACH, for then the uncertainty among consumers will remain, and the risk of allergies, cancer, and illnesses contracted at work will be perpetuated unnecessarily and potentially toxic substances will remain in the environment."
"Last but not least, with this, an incentive for continuing innovation in European industry is also being thrown overboard."
"Mr President, one of the key elements of this regulation is data requirements for registration. A very satisfactory compromise has been put before the House on this issue, and it has gained the support of the three main groups in Parliament."
"In this context, and addressing my comments in particular to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to reiterate the point that a compromise backed by such a large parliamentary majority is an entirely normal democratic procedure."
"Accusations that this House has been hypnotised by the chemical industry are insulting, and we should voice our protest at them."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has always championed a workable version of REACH."
"Our key demand is a system that cuts costs significantly for businesses, especially small businesses, and avoids unnecessary red tape, without sacrificing the goals of environmental and consumer protection."
"As recently as one year ago, our position was branded industry-oriented; it is now the consensus view. It involves the introduction of exposure categories, a significant relaxation of the rules for low-tonnage substances and the granting of derogations for research and OSOR."
"At the same time, however, the other key element of REACH, namely the authorisation of chemicals, must not fall prey to a political success story where registration is concerned."
"The point is that REACH does not only affect the chemical industry, and I say this particularly for Mr Nassauer’s benefit, since this is something he is wont to stress most emphatically. Instead, it affects all sectors that process chemical substances."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has retabled the proposal of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy concerning authorisation, since it is eminently sensible."
"Businesses need clear criteria in order to comply with legislation and plan ahead."
"Hazardous substances should only be replaced if scientific evidence indicates that safe alternatives exist."
"Furthermore, a flexible approach must be taken to the temporary authorisation of chemicals, with due consideration for sector-specific product cycles."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal that we are discussing today numbers the protection of human health and the environment among its main objectives."
"Nevertheless it has also set itself the objective of maintaining and reinforcing the competitiveness of the European Union’s chemicals industry and of increasing transparency in the interests of consumers."
"This being so, we must emphasis the impact that this new regulation will have on small and medium-sized enterprises in the Member States, which more than most other concerns will be overburdened with the new administrative and bureaucratic costs arising from it."
"What I have said should be linked to the economic role played by small and medium-sized enterprises in the chemicals industry."
"Ninety-six per cent of the 22 000 chemical firms in Europe are SMEs, which contribute 28% of total production."
"It is therefore necessary to reflect on the negative impact of production costs, which will turn out to be more onerous for SMEs. We should also reflect on the loss of competitiveness within and outside the common market owing to the greater cost of the finished products."
"In the light of what I have said, I attach great importance to the application of the principle of OSOR (one substance, one registration) and the possibility of forming consortia of enterprises to enable cost reduction and fewer superfluous experiments; but at the same time I am suspicious about the numerous opting-out possibilities foreseen in the compromise proposal on registration, which seem to me to negate the principle itself."
"Secondly, I consider it essential for the implementation of the priorities and objectives that REACH is aiming for that all imported products should be subjected to safety regulations that are equivalent to those in force for products manufactured in the European Union."
"In this instance I should have liked the European Union, which in environmental matters is often in the forefront of difficult battles – we need only think about climate change and the Kyoto Protocol – to stand up for these requirements and to negotiate with the World Trade Organisation for an extension of these regulations to all countries that produce chemical substances and articles, insisting on the need to apply the principle of traceability of substances."
"That is why I am against the exemption for products intended for third countries."
"Mr President, I should like to extend my warmest thanks to Mr Sacconi for his excellent work. Unfortunately, however, I have to say that I take a rather less optimistic view than him of the compromise on registration we have before us."
"I should also like to congratulate a large number of Members of this House on their clairvoyant powers, since they have voiced their wholehearted support for a priority list of chemical substances even though there is no way of knowing which chemical substances are hazardous and which are not."
"I also find it hard to believe those Members who claim that what matters is the survival of small and medium-sized enterprises. If that is the case, it is hard to understand why some of the amendments and wordings in the compromise work to the disadvantage of these small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In my opinion, this is a clear-cut case of Members protecting the interests of big business."
"I should like to conclude by drawing the House’s attention to a study carried out by the European Trade Union Confederation, which found that 50% of cases of occupational asthma and skin disorders would be prevented by a hard-hitting version of REACH."
"A Member pointed out earlier that millions of workers were employed in this sector."
"The same Members should be able to work out for themselves what savings would in that case be made by the state and by all of us."
"Mr President, just like other speakers, I welcome the fact that we are obtaining stricter legislation in this area."
"It is curious – to put it mildly – that this area has been so relatively free from rules for such a long period."
"We are aware of the risks presented by chemicals."
"Each time we have come up against a serious problem, for example PCBs, DDT or CFCs – we have been taken completely by surprise."
"A very great deal of harm has been caused."
"We must therefore have a significantly more cautious approach."
"Companies must obviously accept responsibility both for providing information and for replacing hazardous substances by less hazardous ones, when such exist."
"I wish to emphasise that the substitution principle has operated well in Sweden for almost 15 years."
"I believe that this principle needs to form part of the new legislation."
"I hope that as many colleagues as possible, including in my own group, agree with me on this point."
"The debate about REACH has been complicated."
"It is said that the devil is in the detailsIn few areas is that more apposite than in this particular one."
"There are masses of difficult details of which many Members do not have a good grasp, and this has made it that much more difficult to arrive at constructive solutions."
"The eleventh-hour compromise reached on the subject of registration is not perfect."
"It deviates in several respects from the line I myself would ideally have chosen."
"In the light of the requirements and of what the alternative might be – that is to say, a policy in which the main responsibility for gathering information were imposed on the chemicals authority, I must, in spite of everything, take a positive view of the compromise."
"I repeat that I am not satisfied, but the most important thing of all must, for all that, be for us to obtain a policy in this area that we can work with so that, step by step, we can put some order into the chemicals jungle."
"I want finally to congratulate Mr Sacconi, who I think has done some excellent work over a very long period under complex conditions."
"Mr President, tens of thousands of chemicals surround us in our everyday lives."
"They are everywhere."
"They are in our clothes."
"They are in our cars."
"They are in the ball-point pen I am holding."
"They are even in our children’s toys."
"Unfortunately, we do not know very much about the effects of these substances."
"We do not know what damaging effects they have on our environment."
"We do not know what damaging effects they have on our health."
"With REACH, this is something we now at last have an opportunity to set right."
"With REACH, we are being given the opportunity to obtain the basic data and to adopt a number of principles, which will be incredibly important."
"For me, the most important principle is that of the reverse burden of proof whereby, before industry is given permission to market a substance, we shall in future require it to prove that the substance is safe. It will thus no longer be up to the authorities – as it is today – to prove that a substance is dangerous with a view perhaps to withdrawing it from the market."
"The second and very important principle whose implementation we need to arrange for is the substitution principle."
"If there is a substance on the market that is dangerous and another that is not so and is thus a better alternative, it shall be compulsory to exchange the dangerous substance for the less dangerous one."
"Finally, I want to say that those who think there is a contradiction between competitiveness and sound, stringent chemicals legislation are mistaken."
"On the contrary, it is the chemical industry’s only hope for the future that REACH be worded with just such stringency and that it force the chemical industry to innovate, to invest in research and fully to commit itself to those parameters within which it will have to compete in the future."
"Mr President, we need a strong and effective REACH, a REACH that protects both people’s health and the environment, that reduces the number of experiments on animals, and at the same time safeguards the competitiveness of the chemical industry and increases transparency, strengthening the internal market while at the same time complying with WTO regulations."
"The question is whether or not there is a common denominator here."
"Can we achieve a radical improvement as regards our health without placing too heavy a burden on small and medium enterprises?"
"REACH will only be a success if our answer is yes."
"This is why we need to support the British-Hungarian proposal referred to as OSOR (one substance, one registration) and must not allow it to be diluted."
"Common sense and the interests of small and medium enterprises suggest that data-sharing should be mandatory, while of course respecting commercial confidentiality in the strict sense of the term."
"The ultimate goal of REACH is the substitution and withdrawal of substances that pose a danger to health and the environment."
"This is why we must move forward as boldly as possible with legislation in this area."
"As a chemist, I know that technological constraints impose limits on what we would like to achieve, but let us not shy away from being as rigorous as we possibly can within these limits."
"I also oppose the attempts that are being made to soften registration, and support the position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"I am convinced that this is the only way to ensure that our children and our environment are comprehensively protected."
"The key to an effective and viable REACH lies in the ability of those affected to implement it."
"This is why I also support the proposal to limit expenditures on REACH to 0.2 per cent of annual income in the case of small and medium enterprises, as this will guarantee that the legislation can be implemented."
"There is no sense in exiling the European chemicals industry to other regions of the world, because at the global level this will not solve our problems, indeed quite the contrary."
"For this reason, we must go to the very limits of what is possible, and we must not stop short of this."
"I did not bring an apple for Mr Sacconi, but I ask him to accept my congratulations."
"Mr President, the EU’s Chemicals Regulation (REACH) will ensure above everything else the protection of people’s health and standards of environmental protection that are as excellent as possible."
"Quite a big step backwards has been taken with regard to these principles since the Commission’s original proposal."
"This is mainly due to the fact that the political and ideological power relationships have clearly changed in all the institutions of the European Union since the last elections."
"Amid this difficult situation, Guido Sacconi, rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, has to my mind done an excellent job, and the result obtained in the Committee was an indication of how valuable his work has been."
"I would have hoped that there would no longer be any need to go back from this compromise."
"I wish to thank the country that holds the Presidency, particularly for promising to support tighter regulation than is contained in the Commission’s proposal for compensation for dangerous and harmful substances."
"This will help the chemicals industry and increase its capacity for innovation in Europe."
"Mr President, in response to criticism that the existing regime for regulating chemicals – a complicated maze of some 40 separate directives – was slow, overly rigorous and stifled innovation, you only have to witness the 14-year saga on zinc-risk analysis, yet to be concluded, the European Commission proposed a new chemicals regime in October 2003, following extensive stakeholder consultation."
"This REACH regulation aims to maintain a strong chemicals industry within the internal market, while providing a high level of protection for human health and the environment."
"It proposes to simplify the procedure for registering new and existing substances and it will increase our knowledge of their effects and ensure safe use at all stages in their lifecycle."
"Downstream users of chemicals, which include the vast majority of SMEs, will benefit significantly from this information."
"With only two minutes available to me, I have to be selective."
"I support the compromise on registration, together with the amendment to limit the cost for SMEs, and the minimisation of animal testing."
"I also feel that inorganic substances must be handled differently to organic chemicals."
"We need the highest possible level of confidentiality for business, while not compromising human health and the environment, by allowing registrants to use third-party representatives where possible and by protecting against the publication of sensitive business information on the Agency’s website."
"I would, however, like to focus on the proposal to include the chemicals used in tobacco products under REACH."
"It is very much in the interests of smokers to know exactly what chemicals are contained in tobacco products and for them to be able to exercise informed choice."
"Article 3 of the Tobacco Products Directive sets limit values for tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide only."
"It does not limit the use of the other 2 000 or so chemicals used in cigarettes."
"Article 6 of the same directive only requires cigarette manufacturers and importers to list the chemicals contained in cigarettes and to report on the toxicological data available to them to the Member States, who are then required to inform the Commission."
"This allows tobacco manufacturers to continue to plead ignorance of any detrimental effects on human health of these additives."
"I will conclude, Mr President: this is why it is essential that each and every one of the chemicals added to cigarettes goes through the centralised registration and authorisation procedure envisaged in REACH."
"I urge you to support my amendments."
"We in the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission cannot renege on our responsibility here."
"I thank Mr Sacconi and all involved in this very difficult piece of legislation: a work in progress."
"Mr President, the Commission’s proposal for a regulation contains a methodological flaw."
"Although the title refers to chemical compounds, Article 3 makes no mention of them, and instead gives a definition of a substance."
"This broadens the scope of the regulation substantially to include the kind of matter that, as we all know, is not energy."
"It also makes it less clear."
"The second point I should like to make is that no definition is given of the subject of the regulation, or in other words hazardous chemical compounds and their chemical activity in living organisms."
"Thirdly, the proposal fails to define hazard classes, for example on the basis of medical criteria."
"It would make sense to attempt to define hazard levels in terms of probability by assigning substances to different groups on the basis of tonnage if they all posed the same threat, yet this is by no means the case."
"My fourth point is that a number of traditional products should be excluded from the scope of the regulation, since their chemical activity is almost zero under normal conditions."
"There is an urgent need for the REACH regulation, but it should be limited to very narrow definitions of hazard classes for chemical compounds."
"It should also establish a European Chemicals Agency, which would draw up detailed specifications for chemicals and issue certificates and registrations in line with this interpretation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a regulation we are discussing here is not only complex and far-reaching, but also very ambitious."
"And that is how it should be, for it is, after all, about health and the environment."
"In order to achieve those goals, we must not only aim high, but the proposal must also be made simple to implement and given a practical dimension."
"Mr Sacconi was right to mention balance and responsibility as being the two key words in this area."
"The fact that we have an eye for the impact of competitiveness, for cost effectiveness, for the specific concerns of SMEs, for the innovativeness and competitiveness of our industry and for data protection with legal certainty is not going against REACH but forms an integral part of it."
"A plethora of amendments have been tabled – too many, in fact, for a plenary sitting – but we have to take decisions at some stage."
"Let us therefore press for sound consultations from now until Thursday, so that we can reach a voting result that is consistent at all levels and is widely supported, because a widely supported voting result will also culminate in a balanced legal document."
"In this area, we are deliberately – and rightly – opting for a common European approach."
"We should therefore capitalise on the European added value and give the Agency the necessary competences to reach a uniform approach without, however, overlooking the Member States’ know-how. Let us also ensure that when we come to enforce the regulation, the approach is sufficiently harmonised."
"If we do a good job this week, then our environment in 11 years’ time will be quite different from now and we will have caused nothing short of a revolution in the Union."
"We will have information on all chemicals and we will use them far more sensibly. We will have contributed to better public health and a healthier living environment."
"Let us accept our responsibility to achieve those goals in an ambitious and realistic manner."
"I would like to finish off by saying, as some fellow Members have already pointed out, that our political persuasion is really not relevant in this case."
"We should move away from that dimension and ensure that we vote wisely on Thursday."
"– Mr President, benefits for public health and the environment, the production of safer products more friendly to man, benefits from the development of new innovative products, protection for the European chemical industry against competitors from third countries, improved transparency, increased consumer confidence in industry, benefits for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the main users rather than producers of chemicals, protection for the health of workers in the chemical industry, fewer accidents, an anticipated regulatory system and reasonable implementation cost."
"This is REACH, this is Mr Sacconi's REACH of balance and sensitivity, this is the REACH of Parliament which we owe to European citizens."
"Citizens are entitled to REACH, which tomorrow we may need to redefine further to the left and make greener; but today we need REACH."
"I thank the Commissioners and the Greek Commissioner for their support on this major issue."
"Mr President, in most of what we use, there is a large number of chemicals, and we do not know how these substances affect us."
"We know, however, that cancer and allergies have become more common and that many industrial injuries are due to people having been exposed to chemicals in the workplace."
"On Thursday, we shall have the opportunity to change this by voting in favour of safe chemicals legislation enabling us genuinely to detect and phase out the dangerous chemicals."
"I hope that a majority of us will take the opportunity to fly the flag for European competitiveness but, above all, to put an end to the experiment with people’s health and the environment constituted, in actual fact, by current legislation."
"In common with the consumer, trade union and environmental movements, we Swedish Social Democrats shall not support the compromise on registration reached between the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"It exempts too many chemicals from testing, and such requirements for testing as are in fact laid down are not strict enough to enable hazardous chemicals to be detected and phased out."
"We cannot therefore support the compromise."
"Finally, I wish to say a big thank you to Mr Sacconi who has done some sterling work on this matter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make just three very quick points."
"First of all I should like to respond to the criticisms made by various fellow Members including Mrs Breyer and Mrs Foglietta, who allege that I have expressed my personal viewpoint and not that of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"It is possible that I have made a mistake and in that case I offer my sincere apologies."
"However, as the principal rapporteur of Parliament I feel that I have a responsibility to the House to work towards the broadest and most solid majority that can be achieved."
"It is above all for this reason that I considered the compromise that we have discussed at such length to be useful, feasible and necessary."
"To achieve REACH we have had to arrive at a compromise."
"Before assessing whether REACH is or is not a strong regulation – we shall have time after the vote to carry out a careful analysis – we urgently need to have a REACH regulation at our disposal; and we know how much deep-seated hostility it has attracted even in recent weeks."
"On the other hand it seems to me that the points of principle that I have publicly declared to be insuperable have not been resolved, given that the burden of proof for lower tonnage bands has been maintained: this means that 30% of those substances must be covered by complete documentation."
"I challenge anyone to contradict my assessment on this point."
"In this connection I should like to cite the example of the principle of ‘one substance, one registration’, which for the first time, thanks to the compromise, is largely supported in Parliament, whereas hitherto it had been adopted only by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"The criteria for opting out have certainly been retouched, but the final ruling on applications for authorisation not to participate in data sharing rests with the Chemicals Agency."
"Finally I should like to thank all Members, especially the rapporteurs, but above all the extremely important staff that we should perhaps value more highly: namely Parliament’s officials and Secretariat."
"If we have got this far the credit must also, and perhaps principally, go to so many officials who have carried out this exceptional work."
". Mr President, this has been an excellent debate, with honourable Members speaking with knowledge, experience and passion."
"Sixty-one separate Members of the European Parliament have spoken and I have listened with care on behalf of the Council to all of them."
"It is vitally important that the burdens which REACH imposes on industry are as low as possible."
"This is an industry that employs many hundreds of thousands of our European citizens, but it is important that the burdens are consistent with meeting our shared goals of protecting human health and the environment, and we believe that the emerging views of Parliament, the Council and Commission do this."
"A focus of many speakers has been the needs of small firms in the chemical and related industries."
"The Council shares that concern, and in its compromise the Presidency has attempted to put forward a range of measures to help them."
"These include ‘one substance, one registration’, the role of the agency in assisting small firms and a number of measures to help them capitalise on their innovation."
"Many Members have mentioned the word ‘balance’ this afternoon."
"REACH is in many ways a balancing act and we believe the emerging consensus between our three institutions represents the only achievable balance on this delicate, complex and very important dossier."
"I very much welcome and share the widespread support expressed here today for the need to avoid unnecessary animal testing."
"Clearly, for now, non-animal alternatives do not exist for all the tests we need, so the role of ‘one substance, one registration’ to avoid duplicate testing is key."
"We also want the scope to amend the list of test methods approved as rapidly as possible as non-animal alternatives come forward."
"In its amended form, REACH will target the most hazardous substances;"
"PBTs, VPs and VBs will be registered early."
"They, CMRs and other substances of very high concern, such as endocrine disrupters, will be subject to a rigorous authorisation process, including substitution."
"A key principle of the REACH approach is to lay the responsibility for demonstrating the safety of chemicals firmly upon the chemical industry."
"The reversal of the burden of proof will mark a positive and dramatic improvement on the current regime and is something that Member States and the Council have seen as vitally important."
"REACH is a significant improvement on the status quo."
"It will give us the information we need to address substances of concern."
"It will promote innovation in the industry itself through reducing the current existing burdens on companies wishing to introduce new and greener chemicals and through promoting substitution of older, more polluting substances."
"Europe has been debating REACH since 1998."
"We have come a long way in understanding both the substances and the concerns of all stakeholders."
"I argue that now is the time to seize this once-in-a-lifetime chance to agree on what is before us and overcome the problems of sound chemicals management."
"The current regime for chemicals is flawed, bureaucratic and slow and, in too many circumstances, it is frankly ineffective."
"More than 40 laws, over 100 000 substances and almost 40 years after the EU first started to address chemicals, we still have not got there."
"Chemicals pose a huge challenge and a huge opportunity to modern society and we need to take this on now."
"REACH, as it is emerging in Parliament, the Council and the Commission, is the best tool we have to do this, hence its importance to us all."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission too believes that this was an important and persuasive debate."
"At the risk of repeating myself, what mattered to us was to find a solution, or to help find a solution."
"It is impossible to make everyone happy in a case such as this one."
"There can be no such thing as a true compromise between those who are afraid of losing their jobs and of what the future brings, and those who are worried about the health of their children."
"A perfect compromise is an impossibility, and indeed compromise by its very nature means meeting one another halfway."
"This comment is directed at those on both sides who voiced controversial opinions during this debate."
"In my opinion, it would be wrong to want to lay down rules the like of which the world has never seen before with no thought for the competitiveness and future prospects of one of Europe’s most important industries."
"At the same time, however, it would also be wrong for us not to do everything in our power to achieve the best possible outcome for the health of our fellow citizens and for the environment in which they live."
"The Commission would like to reiterate its belief that the compromise on the table strikes a good balance, and I must once again protest most vigorously against accusations that this proposal waters down the objectives contained in the Commission’s original proposal."
"As I see it, it should be left up to the Commission to decide what it thinks of the amendments that have been made to its proposal."
"We are debating a Commission proposal, and the Commission does not believe that the amendments that have been tabled before the House weaken or water down its proposal. Instead, it believes that the proposal’s real objectives have in fact been strengthened."
"I would point out that requirements have even been made more stringent in the low-volume, 1-100 tonne category, which covers the most substances and is therefore the most crucial."
"At the same time, however, it is also true that practical tools have now been found that will make it easier for businesses, and especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, to contend with this extremely demanding body of legislation."
"Several of the speakers referred to the fact that the chemical industry in Europe is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This is a point I should like to make to those Members who have responded to proponents of other views by saying that the compromise before us, or the solution laid out therein, represents a setback for the interests of the large-scale chemical industry in Europe."
"This is nonsense, not least because the chemical industry in Europe is not controlled by large companies."
"You will no doubt be amazed to hear that the average chemical company in Europe employs only 74 people."
"What this means is that the structure of this industry is very much dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises, and we must think very carefully about the demands we should and should not place on businesses."
"No one anywhere has experience of implementing a body of legislation like this, and we should be aware from the outset that only practical experience will reveal whether our assumptions are right or wrong."
"We should remain open to improvements, not only during these debates, but also during the implementation phase that will follow them."
"On behalf of the Commission, I can assure you that we will not shirk our responsibility, in particular as far as the agency is concerned. The latter will in fact have to carry out the bulk of the work, and the Commission will take the necessary steps to ensure that it can get down to work as quickly and as effectively as possible."
"Mr President, I shall be very brief."
"First I should like to thank everyone who took part in this evening's debate, which was very important and very interesting and which will contribute towards the adoption of the proposal which we are debating for the benefit of the health of European citizens and the environment."
"I should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, and Mrs Ek and Mr Nassauer, for the truly huge effort which they made to bring us to this compromise, which relates to one of the most important aspects of REACH."
"The Commission fully supports this compromise and I am certain that equally extensive support will be expressed during the vote on Thursday."
"There are of course certain other issues, such as the issue of authorisation and substitution, which are the concern of the European Chemicals Agency, issues on which I am certain that Parliament will decide with the same transparency."
"The Commission welcomes the convergence being developed between Parliament and the Presidency and will work to facilitate the achievement of an agreement on REACH, so that REACH becomes law as quickly as possible."
"Similarly, the Commission supports the rapporteur's amendments on the time limit on authorisations, but with the precondition that the limit will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the European Chemicals Agency."
"As regards chemicals in products, the rapporteur is aiming for a more specific and operational solution which is similar to that sought by the UK Presidency and which the Commission will be able to accept."
"Thank you very much for your attention and for taking part in such an important debate."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the House for the serious debate that has taken place."
"I find it intolerable that an exhibition being held on Parliament’s premises should include an image of Mr Verheugen poisoning a child while Mr Barroso looks on, and I would call on the Conference of Presidents to remove this poster from Parliament without delay."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
", . Due to problems of internal democracy within the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I did not get the chance to speak during the joint debate on REACH."
"Of the total of 52 amendments I tabled, 30 have made it to the final vote, and these amendments have been welcomed by experts in the field."
"My goal was and is to strike a balance between the various approaches to the matter, and I am very much opposed to extremes of opinion."
"The end effect of the position advanced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety would be to prevent us achieving the Lisbon goals, and to weaken the position of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Pressure will grow on the new Member States, which have traditionally imported goods from the countries of the former Soviet Union, to replace these latter with imports from Western Europe, which would mean extra costs."
"Several studies carried out in the Czech Republic indicate that as many as one fifth of jobs could be lost, with profits also falling in related sectors, such as the automobile industry."
"I am glad that this initiative has emerged, but I believe that it must be implemented over an appropriate period of time."
"I would also call for the costs of testing to be met by public funding, as this is the only way to avoid negative repercussions, in particular on small manufacturing firms."
"I am in favour of the compromise that was reached within the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"REACH is not a confrontation between left and right; instead, it is a conflict of interests that raises the question of whether a balance can be struck between the economic, social and environmental aspects of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The Commission can accept in full all the amendments of the PPE-DE/PSE/ALDE compromise package on registration, including the amendment on OSOR; these are amendments 367 to 413 (inclusive)."
"The Commission can also accept in full the following amendments: 40, 73, 74, 79, 117, 119, 125, 128, 148, 158, 273, 276, 291, 292, 317 and 324."
"The Commission can partially accept amendments 10, 322, 327, 333, 335, 336, 340, 345 and 347."
"The Commission can accept in principle amendments 4, 8, 11, 14, 16, 18, 21, 26, 34, 36, 39, 50, 59, 60 61, 62, 63, 64, 67, 68, 72, 76, 78, 81, 83, 87, 97, 101, 102, 104, 105, 107, 108, 115, 116, 120, 121, 123, 124, 126, 139, 140, 145, 146, 147, 149, 159, 171, 172, 175, 176, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 190, 191, 193, 202, 203, 204, 205, 207, 208, 209, 211, 213, 215, 217, 220, 221, 235, 236, 248, 249, 259, 265, 270, 277, 278, 286, 293, 297, 299, 300, 301, 302, 306, 308, 310 and 323."
"The Commission can accept in principle and in part amendments No. 19, 20, 41, 53, 65, 88, 89, 103, 122, 130, 132, 141, 142, 144, 157, 158, 161, 163, 180, 181, 192, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 210, 285, 290 and 294."
"The Commission cannot accept amendments 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37, 38, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 66, 69, 70, 71, 75, 77, 80, 82, 84, 85, 86, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 98, 99, 100, 106, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 118, 129, 131, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 143, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 160, 162, 164, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 173, 174, 177, 178, 179, 182, 189, 206, 212, 214, 216, 218, 219, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 266, 267, 268, 269, 271, 272, 274, 275, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 287, 288, 289, 295, 296, 298, 303, 304, 305, 307, 309, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 318, 319, 320, 321, 325, 326, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 334, 337, 338, 339, 341, 342, 343, 344, 346, 348, 350 and 351."
"The Commission reserves its position on two linguistic amendments, namely amendments 127 and 165."
"The Commission also reserves its position on all those amendments tabled on 9 November with the exception of those of the PPE-DE/PSE/ALDE compromise package as mentioned before."
"These are amendments 352 to 366 (inclusive) and amendments 414 to 1038."
"The Commission position will be made available after the vote on all those amendments which are adopted."
"The Commission cannot accept any of the four amendments tabled to the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 67/548/EEC in order to adapt it to Regulation (EC) of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals."
"These are Amendments 1 to 4."
"The next item is the oral question to the Council (O-0093/2005 – B6-0337/2005) by Mr Leinen and Mr Lewandowski, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the draft interinstitutional agreement on the operating framework for the European regulatory agencies."
"– Mr President, within the European framework, there is a large number of decentralised or quasi-independent operational bodies which are identified under the title 'regulatory agencies'."
"This situation refers to a conception of multilevel intergovernmentalism."
"The conceptual approach and operational investigation of the regulatory authorities of the European Union is characterised by pluralism."
"Consequently, the challenge consists in establishing clarified and, where possible, uniform terms for the foundation, operation and supervision of this form of European intergovernmentalism, so that the regulatory agencies can become more transparent and cohesive than they are at present."
"The excessive increase in the number of regulatory agencies will result, without doubt, in an increase in European regulatory intervention, in the separation and lack of transparency of European policies and, by extension, in difficulties with operational coordination."
"The European Parliament considers that the provisions of the draft interinstitutional agreement submitted could constitute a minimum set of common principles and rules for the structure, operation and control of regulatory agencies, so that they can be harmoniously integrated into the framework of fundamental principles which derive from the Treaty system."
"It is therefore useful not only to adopt a framework for harmonising the operation of the European regulatory authorities, but also to harmonise their operation with democratic institutions."
"That is why we call on the Council to cooperate creatively in promoting the interinstitutional agreement."
". The question jointly submitted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Budgets involves an invitation to the Council to enter into serious negotiations on the operating framework for the agencies."
"I am sure that there is a well-recognised need here in the European Union to rationalise and standardise procedures for setting up and operating the regulatory agencies in the interest of transparency and in order to avoid the duplication of tasks and unnecessary expenditure."
"I am referring in particular to the agencies involved in executive functions, partly with respect to their functions disintegrating the operational responsibility of the European Commission."
"Setting up agencies is now a fashionable response to various challenges in the European Union."
"No wonder that there were five of them ten years ago and, by next year, there will be twenty-three."
"They are mushrooming and have ever greater budgetary implications because this is not only about operational expenditure; this is about expenditure of a more bureaucratic nature."
"Now we have a very good basis for discussion in the Commission communication, namely the draft interinstitutional agreement of February 2005."
"Following the White Paper on European Governance, the European Parliament adopted its position in the form of a resolution of January 2004."
"We, and in particular the Budgets Committee, understand the significance of applying the principle of budgetary rigour to the setting-up and operation of the agencies, and we fully support the proposal by the Temporary Committee to ring-fence expenditure on the agencies and to regulate both existing and new agencies."
"However, that is not in the Commission communication."
"Our oral question is in fact an expression of regret that the Council is not entering into these negotiations."
"The major question is whether the Council is ready and sees it as necessary and feasible to conclude the negotiations next year, that is, at the end of the current financial perspective."
". Mr President, in its conclusions of 28 June 2004 on the Commission communication on the operating framework for European regulatory agencies, the Council noted the existence of various decentralised Community bodies which fell within the broad heading of European agencies."
"It noted that, while these bodies had certain formal characteristics in common, they were in fact very diverse."
"The Council therefore called on the Commission to provide a clear definition of regulatory agencies according to their competences and tasks."
"It also considered that a future framework should identify which criteria should be applied when creating regulatory agencies."
"In particular, it was essential that any decision to create or maintain an agency be justified on the basis of real need and cost-benefit analysis, taking account of the availability of relevant expertise, and including impact assessment."
"In February 2005 the Commission presented a draft Interinstitutional Agreement, an IIA, on the operating framework for the European regulatory agencies."
"This contains rules concerning agencies’ tasks, executive responsibilities, legal base, objectives and mandate, seat, structure and operation, evaluation and control."
"The Commission proposal suggests that an IIA would be appropriate ‘to ensure that the three institutions are involved from the outset in establishing the basic conditions to be met when acts are subsequently adopted to set up sectoral agencies’ and that ‘this type of legal instrument ... does not rule out the possibility of more detailed arrangements subsequently being concluded as part of a framework regulation’."
"However, the draft IIA presented by the Commission goes beyond the establishment of arrangements for cooperation between the institutions as established in the Treaty, as it concerns the adoption of supra-legislative substantive legal rules which would have the effect of binding the legislature in the future by a procedure not laid down in the Treaty."
"The Council would like to refer the honourable Members to the declaration on interinstitutional agreements annexed to the Treaty of Nice, which states that interinstitutional agreements ‘may not amend or supplement the provisions of the Treaty’."
"In its conclusions of 28 June 2004, the Council acknowledged that ‘the evolving and varying nature of the responsibilities’ of regulatory agencies justified the examination of all questions related to their structure, including the composition of management boards and the respective functions of their bodies."
"It added that ‘this examination should take into account, inter alia, the competences exercised by, and the nature of the tasks allocated to, each agency’."
"Although an IIA may have certain binding legal effects in so far as its contents express the desire of the three institutions to enter into a binding commitment towards each other, this instrument cannot be used to adopt legislative or even supra-legislative rules."
"The proposals on this legal issue are therefore on the table for consideration by the Council."
"The Council is ready to examine a horizontal proposal for agencies which addresses the legal issues that I have raised in my reply."
". – In the White Paper on European governance, the Commission is proposing that the European regulatory agencies should have a legislative framework."
"The objective is now to reach a much-needed interinstitutional agreement."
"After all, if there is one example of a political decision-making system crying out for rationalised and coordinated organisation, it is unquestionably the European regulatory agencies."
"This is firstly due to the number and diversity of the vital spaces that it is intrinsically geared towards. It is also because the European institutional structure is fragmentary and in need of the integrating influence of a Constitution, which is why interim institutional agreements are required, along with a prudent and lasting organisational effort."
"Europe cannot turn a blind eye to the problem of governance arising from the enlargement and from its ambitions."
"Consequently, the regulatory agencies need Europe’s political institutions to take their share of responsibility."
"An interinstitutional agreement will enable these agencies to be successful."
"It will plug procedural gaps and in so doing rationalise and improve the effectiveness of European policy implementation."
"After all, we must all admit that the entire body of European discourse is built on rational foundations."
". Mr President, my group views with concern the proliferation of agencies in recent years."
"The number has grown enormously."
"They seem to be spread like confetti around the Member States, more to ensure that each Member State has an agency on its territory than with a view to the need and benefits of having a separate EU agency to deal with the matter in question."
"Our concerns therefore relate to a number of things: to the cost, of course; but more importantly, does not this proliferation of agencies undermine the executive role of the European Commission?"
"There are politicians in some of our Member States who would like to see the Commission broken up into a series of specialised agencies to undermine the supranational executive that we have."
"What of accountability?"
"The Commission is at least accountable to this Parliament."
"Commissioners and their civil servants can very easily be brought in to be questioned and cross-examined."
"We vote their budget."
"If necessary – heaven forbid that it should be necessary – we can vote them out of office."
"However, when a matter is delegated to an agency with its own structure – usually intergovernmental – and its own board, which is accountable in a totally different way, then the accountability is inevitably lessened."
"We therefore support the idea of an interinstitutional framework agreement to address some of these issues."
"It could at least correct some of the excesses."
"It could provide for proper accountability."
"It could have a standard structure."
"At the moment every single agency seems to have a different structure."
"Parliament could be involved in the appointment and scrutiny of the board."
"I hear the Council’s answer that it does not like the idea of an interinstitutional agreement but instead would be willing to look at a horizontal proposal."
"I would like the Council to enlighten us as to what kind of proposal that might be."
"Would it be a framework regulation or legislative decision of some kind?"
"We will not give up pursuing this matter."
"We liked the approach that the Commission put forward in its proposal and we will not let go in terms of ensuring that, if agencies are to exist, they must be properly accountable to the elected institutions of the European Union and not go off on a tangent by themselves."
"Mr President, the first European regulatory agencies were set up in the 1990s, in response to developments in EU policy, consecutive enlargements and the European Union’s resulting new technical and scientific needs."
"The White Paper on European Governance states that the European regulatory agencies help to implement and apply Community principles effectively, and that the role they play and the checks they carry out are of considerable significance in political and institutional terms."
"Nevertheless, there are currently 23 decentralised agencies, compared to 5 in 1995, and this steady rise in numbers is alarming in view of the fact that there is no common procedural framework."
"Citizens find the proliferation of agency names, remits, structures and control mechanisms hard to grasp, and the situation is not conducive to legal certainty."
"The 2004 annual report of the European Court of Auditors highlights the agencies’ shortcomings with regard to their adherence to budgetary principles, their recruitment of staff and their public procurement procedures."
"In view of the fact that these agencies place an ever greater burden on the EU budget, a thorough analysis of the financial impact of each new agency’s activities should be mandatory."
"In order to ensure that the EU of 25 Member States functions properly, more transparency and cohesion are needed in order to avoid the establishment of ever more diverse agencies, many of which would duplicate the responsibilities and activities of the relevant Commission services."
"In this context, the draft agreement between the Commission, Parliament and the Council, setting out common guidelines and a framework for the establishment of new regulatory agencies, deserves our full support."
"I find it impossible to understand why the Council has previously shown no sign of any political will to start negotiations on this agreement, although it is becoming apparent today that things may be changing."
". Mr President, I thank all those who have spoken in what has been an interesting and informative exchange of views."
"It must be said that some of the points made today have not yet been discussed by the Council, but I assure Parliament that they will be."
"Let me respond to as many of the points raised as I can."
"Of course the Council agrees that we need transparent and effective agencies."
"It is important to ensure coherence, good governance, credibility and cost efficiency."
"We can see the advantage in any framework of retaining flexibility and not putting in place excessively rigid guidelines."
"I can also assure Parliament – in case there is any doubt about it – that the Council will return to this issue when it has fully reflected on the positions of both Parliament and the Commission."
"The Council has noted the Commission’s proposal for a legally binding instrument for a horizontal framework for regulatory agencies."
"The Council believes that the current Commission proposal presents certain legal problems and is studying it carefully."
"What should such a framework cover?"
"The Council believes that any framework should address key issues in the creation, operation and supervision of regulatory agencies."
"In particular, it is important, as I have said, to ensure coherence, transparency, good governance, credibility and cost efficiency."
"How should decisions be taken to set up such an agency?"
"We believe agencies have a crucial role to play, but the Council agrees with Parliament that when a decision is taken to create an agency it has to be justified on the basis of an external, cost-benefit assessment, and we hope to work with Parliament in getting a satisfactory solution to this issue."
". Mr President, first of all I should like to say that the Commission shares the European Parliament’s sense of urgency and that we fully share the concerns expressed by the various speakers."
"The Commission feels that an interinstitutional agreement is indisputably the most appropriate form for the legislation."
"Indeed, only an interinstitutional agreement will make it possible to involve Parliament in defining a common framework on an equal footing with the Commission and the Council."
"The generally recognised need for legislation obviously means that we cannot let this draft, which the Commission proposed eight months ago, come to nothing."
"The Commission would now ask its institutional partners to get down to the task right now, so that the tripartite discussions can be started as soon as possible."
"The essential thing is to examine the content of a possible agreement between the three institutions."
"Once the content of the instrument has been defined, it will be easier to decide on its form."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0339/2005)."
"We shall take a number of questions to the Commission."
"Madam President, I am glad that Question Time is being extended to 8 p.m. because it is all too easy for the time allotted to it to be reduced, as has happened so often in the past."
"My point of order concerns my own question, No 69, which I tabled specifically because Mr Mandelson was scheduled to address the House and take questions this evening."
"It is about the WTO, yet inexplicably it seems to have been listed as a general question."
"Could you explain why?"
"The only explanation I can give to you is that it is customary in this House for the Commission to decide which Commissioner answers each question."
"That is why your question has been listed under Part3 of Question Time."
"I have a question for Mr Mandelson on the same issue, so perhaps he might oblige and answer the question privately?"
"That may well be one way of resolving the issue."
"Failing that, I can only give you the same answer I have already given to Mr Martin."
"Is the Commission considering ways of preventing national measures on the taxation of passenger air traffic, such as a tax on tickets or aviation fuel, becoming an obstacle to the internal market?"
". The issue of taxes on air traffic has been much debated lately, but it has been among the instruments considered in the search for new sources of funding for official aid to developing countries, in line with the UN Millennium Development Goals."
"The honourable Member is no doubt aware that the Council has been actively considering the issue and that the Commission has produced several staff working papers on the technical aspects at the request of the Council."
"Two types of tax instruments have been considered: the taxation of aviation fuel and a levy on airline tickets, also known as a departure tax."
"From the internal market point of view, the legal setting is not the same for those two types of taxes."
"Taxes on aviation fuel are covered by Community legislation in the form of the energy tax directive, 2003/96/EC."
"Although aviation fuel is, in principle, exempt from taxes, the Member States may choose to tax fuel for domestic flights."
"They may also tax fuel for flights between Member States, provided they agree bilaterally to do so."
"However, in practice there is no scope to tax fuel used by third-country carriers operating in the EC."
"As regards a levy on airline tickets, there are no specific Community provisions."
"Member States are therefore free to apply such levies on the obvious condition that they comply with their commitments under the EC Treaty."
"The honourable Member has asked whether the Commission is considering ways to prevent such taxes on air travel becoming obstacles to the internal market."
"I would first like to stress that the fact that a product or service is taxed does not mean that its free movement is obstructed."
"There is an obstacle to the internal market only if a tax is heavier on transactions between Member States than on similar transactions within a Member State."
"The Commission will make full use of its powers to enforce the Treaty against any discriminatory taxes on air travel, as it does for all other taxes."
"However, I understand that the discussions between Member States at this stage focus mainly on airline ticket levies."
"In this respect I must stress that, in the absence of Community rules, this is first and foremost a matter for the Member States themselves, acting within their fiscal sovereignty."
"Nevertheless, the Commission has argued in its staff working papers that there are good reasons to prefer a common approach to ticket levies."
"The Commission has also declared that it is willing to work on the technical aspects with the Member States that intend to pursue this option."
"That would help to ensure compatibility with Treaty obligations."
"I should like to point out that the Commission is continuously monitoring the functioning of the internal market."
"Taxes of the kind mentioned in the honourable Member’s question are still rare."
"Should the Commission identify a structural problem linked to the taxation of air travel, be it fuel taxes or ticket levies, it could ultimately make use of its right to propose appropriate legislation."
"Mr Mandelson, while you are here, and bearing in mind that you are responsible for the European Union’s external field, I would like to ask you whether you are aware that the countries that would be most harmed by a tax on air tickets, for the benefit of globalisation, would be the countries of the third world, who largely depend on tourism for their progress, tourism being moreover one of their few activities?"
"Secondly, a tax on air tickets and on aviation fuels would harm States of an island or peninsular nature."
"This tax has been thought up entirely from a continental point of view and would in fact genuinely restrict the traffic between the continental areas of the European Union and the regions and countries of an island nature, particularly outlying ones or those furthest from the centre of the European Union."
"I hope that you can communicate my concern to Commissioner Kovács."
". In response to your first question concerning tourism, increased taxation of air travel could in theory lead to a reduction in air travel demand."
"However, the increase in the price of the air ticket must be viewed in the context of the overall cost of a travel package – i.e. travel, accommodation and leisure spending – of which it is usually a minor part."
"The possible impact on tourism should also be set against the overall trend of a very strong growth in tourism demand."
"There are therefore good reasons for thinking that the overall impact on tourism will be moderate."
"In answer to your second question about remote and peripheral regions, the increased cost of air travel may have a greater impact on regions that are highly dependent on air transportation."
"However, as air ticket taxes are primarily a matter for Member States, those who choose to apply such taxes will have latitude to design their taxes so as to provide correctives to take into account the special circumstances of remote regions and the social needs of their inhabitants."
"The Commission has stated that it is prepared to work with Member States, as I have already said, on the technical aspects of airline tickets."
"This could include looking at various correctives for remote and peripheral regions within the framework of Community rules."
"Commissioner, I agree that the States should take measures to strengthen the development policy in those countries which, precisely because they do not offer their citizens opportunities, send us more and more immigrants, causing serious problems in the European Union."
"In this regard, I would like to ask whether the Commission has sufficiently analysed other alternatives to this same end, such as the proposal by the economist Mr Tobin of creating a tax on financial transactions, which would not affect tourism."
". The short answer to that question is that the Commission is not considering alternatives, for example the envisaged Tobin tax, which is a rather controversial proposal contested by many."
"The proposals that the Commission has examined are those that have emerged from discussions amongst our Member States."
"They are, as I say, subject to staff working papers."
"They are not currently subject to the initiation of the Commission itself."
"Obviously, should a so-called Tobin tax start to be canvassed or promoted by a large number of our Member States, that is no doubt something that the Commission could examine and bring forward views on."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we are all aware that developing countries are particularly worthy of our attention and concern."
"Yet the question that always occurs to me is why we are not prepared to impose a tax on aviation fuel in the same way that we do on other energy sources, in particular fossil fuels."
"Turning to the matter of environmental pollution, I should like to draw the House’s attention to the major problems that are sometimes experienced under airport flight paths."
". The honourable Member has made a perfectly valid observation."
"It should be pointed out that although a fuel tax would have an impact on prices, it may in fact contribute to putting air travel on an equal footing with alternative means of transportation, such as road travel, for which taxes are currently paid on fuel, and which are often the only option for the less well-off traveller."
"The point made by the honourable Member will no doubt be taken into consideration by those interested in pursuing this matter."
"In both the first and the second annual reports to the Council and the European Parliament (SEC(2004)0557 and SEC(2005)0839) on the activities of the Central Unit of Eurodac, the EU database on asylum-seekers, it was reported that this unit had registered a surprisingly high number of 'special searches'."
"This is a category intended for the implementation of Article 18(2) et seq. of the Eurodac Regulation, i.e for data-protection purposes in order to safeguard the right of the data subject to access his or her own data."
"However, these special searches have been made without the national supervisory authorities being able to confirm that these cases did indeed involve persons requesting access to their own data."
"What action has the Commission taken in order to find out the status of these special searches?"
"Has the Commission fulfilled its commitment to continue monitoring the application of the Eurodac Regulation in this respect? If so, what was the result?"
". The honourable Member Baroness Ludford asks for clarification regarding special searches in relation to Eurodac and action taken by the Commission."
"I am glad to respond to this question, which falls within the field of responsibility of Commission Vice-President Frattini."
"Firstly, a search is defined as special when it aims not to determine the Member State responsible for an asylum application, but to guarantee to each individual the exercise of his or her rights as provided for in the Data Protection Directive."
"Article 18 of the Eurodac Regulation sets out the procedures for the exercise of the right to information and to access to, correction or erasing of personal data processed by Eurodac."
"These rights are granted by EU data protection legislation and they aim to ensure the protection of the right to privacy of the individual."
"Indeed, in accordance with Article 18(2) and under the Eurodac Regulation, any person residing in a Member State has the right to obtain in any Member State data relating to her or him that is recorded in the central database and that the Member State transmitted to the Central Unit."
"She or he can subsequently ask that Member State to correct data that was factually inaccurate or to erase data that was unlawfully recorded."
"It is worth noting that only a few Member States sent such searches to the Central Unit."
"Under the system laid down by EU data protection legislation, the Member States’ data protection authorities and the European data protection supervisor are the competent authorities to monitor the lawfulness of personal data-processing activities by Eurodac."
"During a recent Eurodac users’ meeting, the Commission reminded Eurodac users of their legal obligations."
"At another meeting organised by the European Data Protection Supervisor, the Commission drew the attention of the EDPS and the national supervisory authorities to the high number of special searches noted in the Eurodac Central Unit."
"The Commission is following this issue closely since it is important to clarify whether activities carried out by national authorities within the framework of Eurodac comply with our established data protection rules."
"Thank you, Commissioner Rehn, up to a point."
"What you are saying is that the Commission knows no more than national data protection supervisory authorities why these special searches are being made."
"The reason that the topic is so important is that demand for access to EU databases is growing at a fast pace."
"In the case of Eurodac, how do we know that these special searches were not unauthorised access by national agencies masquerading as searches on behalf of individuals checking their own data?"
"If the Commission does not know the answer, what trust can we have in its watchdog function as data protection comes under increasing pressure?"
"I would remind you that the Commission is responsible for the enforcement of the rules of this regulation."
". First, I will pass on your concerns to Commissioner Frattini."
"Second, the Commission has asked for further clarification from one Member State where a particularly high number of searches were noticed in a very short period of time."
"You will understand that at this stage, without knowing the exact reasons for these numbers, I do not want to name and blame any particular Member States."
"I repeat that, even if we are surprised by these numbers, there is no evidence at this stage that the Eurodac Regulation has been incorrectly applied."
"Is the participation of the European Union in negotiations on the future of Kosovo secure? And has a list been drawn up of subjects and problems in respect of which the European Union, and in particular the Commission and European Parliament, could make a substantive contribution, especially since existing documents of EU institutions on Kosovo specifically mention the prospect of possible future membership?"
". Let me start by pointing out that the ultimate responsibility in decision-making to facilitate the political process to determine Kosovo’s future status is in the hands of the United Nations Secretary-General, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1244."
"The Commission is satisfied with the UN Secretary-General’s recent recommendation and its subsequent endorsement by the Security Council that says talks on Kosovo’s future status should go ahead."
"The Commission is also pleased with the appointment of President Martti Ahtisaari on 1 November this year as the UN Secretary General’s special representative or status envoy to lead the talks on the future of Kosovo."
"The Commission fully supports the efforts of the international community and of President Ahtisaari to prepare and work out a balanced and sustainable settlement in Kosovo and we shall obviously work closely with President Ahtisaari to achieve this objective."
"Concerning the EU’s participation and the Commission’s role, I would like to point out four things."
"First of all, we must ensure that the outcome is compatible with the European perspective for Kosovo and covers the whole western Balkans region."
"Secondly, we need to empower the local authorities, our future interlocutors and, at the same time, maintain a streamlined international presence as a security guarantee in Kosovo."
"Thirdly, and I am sure that the European Parliament agrees with me on this issue in particular, our common goal must be ‘status with standards’."
"It is of paramount importance that the rights of minorities and the protection of cultural and historical sites are ensured in order to achieve a sustainable settlement that facilitates stability and the European perspective for the whole region."
"And finally, economic development is crucial for the future of Kosovo."
"I shall soon present a joint paper on the EU’s overall policy on Kosovo with Javier Solana."
"In that document we will outline how we will facilitate the status process with appropriate financial resources, something on which the Commission would like to work closely with Parliament."
"I count on your support for this very important endeavour."
"– Madam President, I want to thank the Commissioner and his staff for their reply and cooperation and simply to reiterate two points."
"Firstly, it is very important to support the European prospects of Kosovo, as the UN ambassador, Mr Eide, says in several paragraphs of his report."
"Secondly, it is very important, given that a joint paper is to be drafted with Mr Solana, as the Commissioner said, for the European Union to have specific negotiating tactics on specific points, so that we can help to address the problems which arise and, at the same time, so that all this together can constitute its European prospects."
". I would like to thank Mr Dimitrakopoulos for his question and for the follow-up question."
"I can assure him that we have indeed a common objective in ensuring that the European perspective is the future of Kosovo."
"I agree that this was very much underlined in the report by Ambassador Eide on standards in Kosovo."
"In my view, the Eide Report is very professional, of very high quality, is very objective and realistic."
"It also underlines the need to ensure both standards and status as we make progress in this negotiation process."
"I can also ensure that, in the joint paper with Mr Solana, we outline our objective of a balanced and sustainable settlement."
"Madam President, I could not agree more with the Commissioner when he says that Kosovo must be offered a European perspective."
"Even the local authorities agree that a military presence will be needed as soon as it has gained independence."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner whether this means that, in the fullness of time, when this independent status has been attained, the KFOR troops will be pulled out and will be replaced by European troops?"
"If so, does he have any idea yet how much this is going to cost the European Union, and are the European Union and the Commission prepared to ensure that there are enough funds available?"
". President Ahtisaari has just started his work and is engaged in shuttle diplomacy in Belgrade, Pristina and with the international community."
"Therefore, I would not like to jump the gun and predict the proposal of the UN envoy President Ahtisaari."
"In my view it is better to let him work, let him consult with the different parties and then, when the time is right, try to achieve a solution with the necessary determination."
"Therefore I do not think it wise to take a stand at this point on whether and in which format K-For should continue in Kosovo."
"I want to say two things."
"First of all it is necessary for there to be an international presence in the future too, as a security guarantee."
"Second, we are starting our needs assessment work in regard to financing in Kosovo, so that we support the work of the international community and President Ahtisaari."
"The FLEGT action programme to combat illegal logging focuses mainly on the legal aspects of logging, while largely neglecting sustainable forest management."
"Yet legal logging in itself affords no guarantee whatsoever of sustainable development of the developing countries concerned, of any improvement in the social situation of local people or protection of biodiversity and the environment."
"Does the Commission consider that, during the negotiations concerning partnerships under FLEGT, binding conditions should be agreed concerning development aspects (both social and environmental) in order to improve the living conditions of the local population, and is legality a basic precondition for access to the European market rather than an aim of FLEGT in its own right?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU action plan known as FLEGT – Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade – focuses solely on questions of legality and does not address the broader and more complex issues of the sustainable development of forestry."
"There is a clear difference between the two: legal timber can be harvested in an unsustainable way, for example through authorised land clearance; and illegal timber can come from sustainable sources, as in the case of timber harvested under indigenous management systems which are sustainable but do not comply with formal legal requirements."
"In most countries, however, forest law is based on principles of sustainable development."
"Accordingly, improved governance and better implementation of the law will lead to more sustainable forest management."
"The partnership agreements to be concluded as part of the FLEGT action plan will also be a means of bringing together the parties concerned in order to address the broader aspects of governance in the forestry sector and, where applicable, to support the implementation of regulatory legislative reforms."
"The Commission hopes that these procedures will help to improve the quality and fairness of the law and governance in the partner States."
"In turn, I trust you will understand that, despite the importance attached to it, the issue of legality in the FLEGT action plan is not an end in itself but rather a means of working together with the partner States to improve governance in the forestry sector."
"That being said, the EU’s FLEGT action plan is an initiative aimed at bringing about change through the commitment of the parties."
"It is therefore not a good idea to impose strict social and environmental conditions on potential partners; conditions that are too strict would be detrimental to their commitment to the partnership agreements."
"It is also true that, even though the EU’s FLEGT action plan places the emphasis on governance and legality, the Union remains determined to encourage sustainable forest management in developing countries."
"In the past ten years, the EU has earmarked more than EUR 700 million for sustainable forest management in Asia, Central Africa and South America."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I thank you for your response and some of your observations."
"Obviously, cooperation with those partnership countries can be a good thing, but we all know that nothing will prevent possible partnership countries, including China, for example, from importing timber into Europe illegally via third countries anyway."
"Greenpeace reported very recently that it has discovered illegal networks extending from Congo-Brazzaville to Italy, from Papua New Guinea to China and then on to Great Britain."
"My question is therefore how the Commission, and the Commissioner in particular, intends to put a stop to practices of that kind?"
". The Commission naturally understands, for example, the desire – I have been questioned recently on this issue – to see the application of a unilateral ban on illegally sourced timber."
"However, we must accept that, in practice, this measure would not resolve the problem of the illegal exploitation of forests."
"Firstly, by implementing a unilateral ban on importing illegally sourced timber into the Union, we would not be providing the customs authorities with an instrument enabling them to establish whether or not the wood is legally sourced."
"In itself, this ban would not therefore be sufficient to prevent illegally sourced timber from entering the Union."
"In order to distinguish between legally and illegally sourced timber – and this is the enormous problem facing us – we clearly need the full cooperation of the exporting countries."
"Secondly, a ban at European level will not provide a means for dealing with the problem of governance in the producing countries."
"This is why the Commission has proposed taking an approach based on establishing partnerships with the wood-producing countries."
"This method will facilitate the required cooperation between the European Union and the producing countries with a view to tackling the problem of corruption and the deficiencies noted in the field of governance, which lead to the clandestine exploitation of forests."
"Without redoubling and combining efforts to eradicate corruption in the wood sectors of the producing countries, the measures intended to halt the trade in illegally sourced timber associated with the clandestine exploitation of forests will have no impact."
"Thirdly, the approach based on partnerships is targeted and proportional."
"It will allow us to focus attention and resources on the countries most affected by this problem without affecting trade with the countries in which the clandestine exploitation of forests does not pose serious problems."
"The majority of trade in wood-based products is not subject to presumptions of illegality."
"That being the case, we must agree on how to react, when exchanges with non-partner countries are subject to presumptions of illegality. This issue will be examined in more depth during a later evaluation exercise."
"I would like to emphasise that the measures examined in the case of this evaluation exercise are not intended to replace the recommended voluntary approach, laid out in the FLEGT action plan, but to complement it where necessary."
"I would also like to point out that we are talking about an evaluation exercise and that we have no intention of putting forward new legislative proposals at this point."
"The Commission is committed to reviewing and analysing the feasibility of supplementary legislation to support the FLEGT action plan, as has been requested of me here."
"As I promised, therefore, I have communicated the message to the Council."
"Unfortunately, this work has been slowed down by the delays linked to the confirmation of the active participation of the Member States and by the decision that we have taken to focus the meagre resources on the implementation of the voluntary approach laid out in the action plan."
"The assessment is under way and it is being carried out in close cooperation with the Member States, since many of the potential measures fall within national competence."
"The options studied include the policy in the field of public procurement, money laundering, stolen goods and anti-corruption legislation, as well as the feasibility of the practical aspects of the new legislation for controlling imports of illegally harvested wood."
"I would like to end by telling you that, during the short time I was Commissioner for Research, I had the opportunity to visit the Commission’s research centre near Milan, and I saw some extremely interesting work being done there."
"This included satellite surveillance which makes it possible to monitor very closely both deforestation and reforestation."
"I therefore believe that it would perhaps be useful also to assess whether this may be a tool that will enable us at least, in our political dialogue with the countries, to urge them to be rather more inclined to help us."
"It is a technological resource that would allow us to monitor how this situation develops much more closely."
"I do not know whether you have been able to go and visit that centre, to go and see what it can do, but I can assure you that I was extremely impressed."
"It is entirely possible to carry out relatively precise monitoring of the sometimes dramatic and sometimes rather more optimistic development of this situation."
"Commissioner, I am sure that Parliament wishes to strengthen your arm in terms of taking further action on the basis of the report which, under the Action Plan, was to be submitted by 2004."
"One way in which we can strengthen your arm is to press for action under the very welcome summit agreement signed with China in September."
"Can the Commissioner state how he thinks that will help stop the laundering of wood in China and that region?"
". Mr Bowis, unfortunately, all I can tell you is that I am taking a proactive approach and that this issue will be on the agenda when we hold talks with our partners."
"I can only offer you my good intentions."
"There are two things that I should like to see happen."
"I should firstly like the Member States, by which I mean the Council, to be a little more proactive on this issue."
"I feel that it would help us if, for example, the examination of the requests we put together were not blocked, because I am not opposed to stronger legislation – far from it."
"We shall have to go through this at some stage, in any event."
"I then mentioned an approach, which I would classify as technical, that would at least enable pressure to be brought to bear on the partner States and, naturally, on the Member States."
"What we actually need is a way – a scientific way, let us say – of identifying and classifying the origin of wood."
"This is something we managed to do on a technical level with diamonds, for example; there are now perfectly accurate ways of certifying the origin of a diamond."
"This is more or less the direction in which we should look to go."
"Madam President, Commissioner, family-run forestry operations in Europe represent a convincing example of sustainable forestry practices that benefit the economy as a whole."
"I would ask the Commissioner whether he thinks it would be possible to provide on-the-ground support to the countries we are debating in the form of technical advice, in order to avoid having to react after the event yet again."
"You mentioned research, and this leads me to an obvious point, namely that in the future wood will continue to be a raw material used in the manufacture of many other products."
"In all of our development programmes, it is clear that the action that you suggest in your question can fall under development projects. Furthermore it is perfectly eligible for similar projects, such as obtaining technical assistance, implants, and a number of other measures."
"Naturally, we are very attentive to this aspect of the issue."
"The question that you raise with regard to development projects is becoming an increasingly across-the-board one."
"Development projects affecting countries, regions or areas are perfectly eligible."
"Indeed, a number are already underway."
"There has been a call to increase donor countries' overseas development aid (ODA) to 0.7% of their respective GDP."
"This would make it possible to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the agreed deadline of 2015."
"For this to happen, national ODA needs to be increased in the following phases: a 'substantial increase' by 2006, 0.5% of GDP by 2009 and 0.7% of GDP by 2015."
"In many countries, however, this percentage is calculated taking debt relief into account, meaning that no additional funding is provided, even though this funding is crucial to the achievement of the MDGs."
"What other elements are included in the calculation of 0.7% and how can a standard calculation basis be established?"
"How can Member States be made legally accountable in this regard?"
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is perfectly clear that there must be a substantial increase in financial resources for development if the Millennium Goals are to be achieved by 2015."
"As you are aware, the EU takes a serious approach to the challenges related to mobilising the budgetary funds required to reduce poverty by half by 2015."
"The EU accordingly set itself a first interim objective in 2002 of increasing development assistance in 2006."
"The Union as a whole would like to achieve a level of aid corresponding to 0.39% of GNP for official development assistance."
"Last May, the Council adopted proposals to begin a new phase with the aim of jointly reaching a level of 0.56% by 2010, and subsequently 0.7% of GNP by 2015."
"I realise that these objectives are ambitious, but they are also realistic and have not been set by chance."
"I welcome the fact that four of our Member States have already achieved that level of aid, and that six others have indicated that they are seeking to achieve it by 2015."
"There is a more precise definition of the term ‘official development assistance’, established by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and recognised worldwide, according to which debt relief is deemed to be development assistance."
"This is justified by the fact that debt relief releases funds for the purpose of helping poor countries develop that had previously been channelled into servicing that debt."
"Since the Monterrey Conference on financing for development, there has been an increase in the flow of aid from the EU aimed at reaching the 2006 interim objective."
"A sizeable proportion of that increase is due to debt relief measures."
"According to the Monterrey Consensus, however, the debt relief initiative for highly indebted poor countries should, and I quote, ‘be fully financed through additional resources’."
"Accordingly, the Commission indicated in its 2005 annual follow-up report on the Union’s Monterrey undertakings that the impact of debt relief efforts on aid flows must be examined carefully."
"We shall of course be keeping a watchful eye on this matter in future annual follow-up reports."
"In this connection, I would point out that the EU is committed to mobilising around EUR 66 billion annually from 2010, which amounts to EUR 20 billion more than the figure set for 2006."
"In light of the amounts of assistance envisaged, the impact of debt relief on official development assistance will be limited in the short to medium term."
"Commissioner, I note that you take it as read that we will achieve the interim goal in 2006."
"I would therefore ask when you will be able to submit a report on this issue, and what the consequences will be for those countries that do not achieve this goal, since if we do not achieve the first goal we will make only slow progress in achieving the second."
"What additional projects, by which I mean EU cofinanced projects, do you intend to propose to help countries achieve these goals, and what will their main emphasis be?"
". Perhaps I did not make myself clear in my first speech."
"I wanted to say that what has been promised for 2006 will not only be achieved but in fact surpassed."
"We will be doing more in 2006 than we promised, or, to put it another way, we are slightly ahead of schedule."
"In order not to lose that momentum, which is relative, I have proposed a new objective for 2010."
"I think I made this clear – it is fairly realistic to think that the 2010 objective will be met."
"Unfortunately, I do not have any stick with which to force Member States that backslide to honour their obligations."
"That being said, I do feel that there is now an awareness of the fact that development policy is of central importance and that, whatever the circumstances, we no longer have any excuse not to honour our commitments."
"As regards the Millennium commitments, there are also no more excuses."
"If the will is there, the finances can be found, and I believe that the political will is indeed there."
"All that remains is to turn it into action."
"The next question – and this is the question you are asking – is how additional resources are to be found."
"You are aware that some countries have already decided to operate a levy or to impose a surcharge on air tickets."
"You are also aware that we have spoken, and continue to speak, about the Tobin tax on financial transactions, although no consensus has been reached to give the go-ahead."
"I should personally like to say that I am of course open to any new ideas on the subject."
"Some time ago I put forward the idea of a tax on the arms market."
"Yet there is a minor moral question that comes into play: the legal arms market accounts for USD 1 thousand billion per year, whereas the illegal market is put at more than USD 2 thousand billion."
"The problem is therefore whether to tax the legal arms trade while, unfortunately, the illegal market escapes?"
"As you know, in a few minutes Mr Rocard is set to ask a question on the creation of a worldwide lottery, an idea to which I am most open."
"You will also know that the proceeds from fines paid to the Commission for non-compliance with competition rules is under discussion."
"Why not set aside this money for development?"
"There is a whole range of options that we are currently assessing to see if they are technically feasible."
"I should like to inform you that I have other ideas, albeit subject to the Member States’ acceptance before they can be put in place."
"Most of these ideas will be neither useful nor genuinely effective if only three, four, five or six countries put them into practice."
"This has to be done on a far more widespread basis."
"In conclusion, I have the impression that we will be able to increase development assistance substantially in the years ahead."
"At a time when the holding of free elections still poses many problems in Africa, the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) should be closely monitored."
"Alarming news has been reaching us about the credibility of the future ballots, including the lack of transparency of the electoral body, mass fraud during registration on the electoral roll, intimidation aimed at deterring participation at election centres, predominantly in the east of the country, and the exclusion of large swathes of the population, including Congolese expatriates (including over 3 million in the European Union)."
"These irregularities will inevitably lead to democratic political forces refusing to take part in the ballot and one can expect the results to be disputed."
"The European Union has actively supported the holding of these elections and should keep a close eye on what is happening in the DRC."
"Therefore, what information does the Commission have on the organisation of the elections in the DRC?"
"How does it plan to support the smooth running of those elections?"
"What action would it take in the event of mass fraud?"
". Madam President, together with the whole of the international community, the Commission is monitoring the election process in the DRC and its organisation by the independent electoral commission very closely."
"I personally carried out a mission to monitor the registration of voters at the end of August of this year with a view to observing the conditions in which that registration was being carried out."
"Despite the poor state of the country’s infrastructure, the number of voters registered to date has exceeded 21 million."
"This figure is largely consistent with the demographic projections calculated on the basis of the last general population census, which is currently the most reliable statistical basis on which to work."
"Voter registration is governed by a specific law establishing the conditions for registration on a voluntary basis."
"Furthermore, the electoral commission had taken steps to guarantee that all registration centres were treated in the same way and that no region or zone suffered from the late opening of a centre."
"To give you a quick idea of the great technical difficulty faced, I must tell you that it has been necessary to distribute more than 10 000 registration kits throughout Congolese territory, despite the fact that, in certain areas, there are no more tracks, there are no more roads, and that helicopters have had to be used."
"You can perhaps imagine, therefore, what a huge job it is."
"Furthermore, in order to prevent any danger of double registration or mass fraud as far as possible – since the question mentions it – the electoral commission, with the endorsement of the international community, opted for voter registration on the basis of biometric data, the immediate issuing of the voter’s card, the daily posting of lists of registered voters in each registration office, the use of indelible ink and the cleaning up of voter lists on the basis of biometric data."
"The Commission is supporting the organisation of the electoral process by means of a substantial contribution of EUR 149 million via a trust fund managed by the United Nations development programme."
"In this regard, it is participating actively in the steering committee of the project supporting the electoral process, which monitors the activities managed by the electoral commission within the framework of the project."
"With a view to guaranteeing that the elections are carried out in accordance with international standards, the Commission has just decided to send a mission of electoral observers whose work will begin from the constitutional referendum of 18 December and will continue until the end of the electoral process."
"At this point, there is no reason to suspect that there is mass fraud in the organisation and conduct of the elections."
"Naturally, when I say ‘mass’, I would point out that this must be viewed within the context of 22 million registrations."
"This afternoon I have received figures that indicate that fraud has been noted, that some of it is deliberate, that in some cases it is not clear whether it is deliberate, and that mistakes have also been made."
"People who work on this type of registration are generally Congolese citizens who have been trained by the company that has provided the kits and, when millions of people are being registered, we must of course expect a percentage of purely technical errors and handling errors."
"When a mistake is made with a name, once the machine has registered it, it cannot be removed straight away."
"Nevertheless, work can be done at central level."
"It is there that any duplications among these 22 million or so people who are registered at the moment are going to be eliminated."
"We may therefore assume that, once these duplications have been dealt with, there will undoubtedly be around 21 to 22 million voters legally registered, with no duplications."
"In the event that irregularities that are sufficiently serious to jeopardise the transparency, credibility and representativeness of the process are noted by the mission of electoral observers, in accordance with the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement, the Commission is prepared to hold an enhanced political dialogue with a view to identifying corrective measures."
"That is not the case at the moment, we are far from that."
"I shall give you the figures."
"The results of the deduplication – to use that very inelegant term – for the operational area of Kinshasa have been presented today at the meeting of the technical committee on the electoral process."
"Of a total of 2 963 101 voters registered in Kinshasa, 150 000 cases of duplications have been identified."
"There are 18 587 cases of technical duplications – which is what I was just talking about, handling errors – 10 490 cases of fraud and 121 000 cases of potential fraud."
"The total number of duplications therefore represents around 5% of the total number of registered voters."
"With regard to the percentage of fraudulent duplications, it should be borne in mind that, once a duplication has been identified, each case does not involve one person, but at least two."
"That is why, even when we add up the cases of fraud and cases of potential fraud, there will be 2% of fraud at the most amongst the total number of cases registered."
"The figures relating to cases of potential fraud will be made known during next week, as well as the result of the deduplication for Lower Congo."
"So everything is going to be cleaned up at central level and there should therefore be an entirely correct general electoral list, with no fraud, so that it will be possible in any event to say that this election, if it takes place, will be conducted on an entirely correct basis in terms of registered voters."
"I have also been able to observe how it was working on the ground, and I must tell you that it was rather impressive."
"All of those people who were registering and who wanted to register, who were very happy to do so, effectively were being given the opportunity for the first time to enjoy a legal status in relation to their State."
"For the first time they received a voter’s card which, to a certain extent, also served as an identity card, which was something new for those people who had never had any real papers."
"All of this was very impressive to see and the fact that more than 22 million voters have been able to register under those conditions – it is not yet entirely complete, since there are a few days left – is a very great success, a success also for the international community and in particular for the European Union, which has worked very hard to support the process."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your encouraging and highly technical comments."
"You are aware that development aid cannot be truly effective unless there are minimum levels of democracy and rule of law."
"I would like to put a supplementary question about freedom of expression and freedom of the press."
"We are aware of a number of events that demonstrate that there are considerable difficulties in this field, which involve journalists and a number of members of the opposition attempting to express their views."
"Voter lists are one thing, but freedom of expression is quite another."
"Could you provide us with more information about what the Commission would do in the event that abuse is observed?"
". The level of political dialogue that we have achieved with the Congolese authorities would allow us, if necessary, to intervene and certainly convince them to change course."
"With regard to freedom of the press, Mrs Aubert, I do not know whether you have been following the Congolese press on the ground."
"If you like, I can supply you with a number of newspapers, including all the newspapers that appear on a daily basis in Kinshasa and other towns."
"I must tell you that, as a whole, the Congolese press is characterised by a degree of freedom of expression, a freedom to make accusations against anybody they like – which are sometimes at my expense, by the way – which is found in few democracies."
"So if there is one area in which truly substantial progress has been made, it is the freedom of the press, though there is plenty to say about other issues, in particular governance."
"For journalists in Kinshasa and elsewhere, there is complete freedom of expression."
"I must point out that their particular positions do not matter."
"The accusation is entirely unfounded and, therefore, while I am not saying that all of the press is like this, I can tell you that the press can criticise anybody, whether it be the President or anybody else."
"So, with regard to freedom of the press in Congo, I believe that it is not a problem."
"There are other problems, enormous problems, but, to be absolutely frank, I do not have the feeling that there are problems in relation to this particular issue."
"With regard to the opposition, I must tell you that, for my part, at the moment and for quite some time, I have not heard of any member of the opposition being prevented from taking part in the elections or, for example, from creating a political party, provided that they conform to the criteria, of course."
"I do not believe so."
"What I am saying does not mean that everything is perfect."
"We must simply bear in mind the progress made."
"I have been following the Congo problem for many years, particularly in my other capacity, and I must point out that, over recent years, we have never been so close to having the opportunity to lead that country towards free and democratic elections, and to provide it with a degree of stability."
"It is my fervent hope that the Constitution will be ratified at the end of December and that the election will take place from March or April, in accordance with the latest timescale set."
"I have not said that I am indulging in blind optimism."
"I am simply saying that we have never been so close to achieving the minimum conditions for restoring stability in Congo."
"It is true that I am extremely committed to this issue because I believe that stability in the DRC would undoubtedly be an extremely powerful factor in terms of stability throughout the region."
"It should be borne in mind that Central Africa practically represents a continent in itself."
"When we look at the number of deaths since 1994, when we look, I believe, at the progress made in Rwanda, the elections that have led to an unproblematic change of government in Burundi – which was rather unexpected – when I see, for example, the initial gestures and actions of President El Nkurunziza in Burundi for example, I hope that we can see the same kind of development in Congo in a few months time."
"Questions Nos 43 to 45 will be answered in writing(1)."
"Trade is a matter of exclusive EU competence. It is, therefore, essential that MEPs, as elected representatives, are able to give EU trade policy full democratic scrutiny."
"The use of an unelected secretive committee, such as the Article 133 Committee which reports to the Council of Ministers, to formulate trade policy erodes the legitimate authority of MEPs to act on behalf of their constituents."
"With suggestions that even the strongest supporters of the WTO's NAMA, like the UK Government, are having trouble in proving that ‘free’ trade will actually satisfy their rhetoric on both poverty and sustainability, and with criticism from the European Ombudsmen concerning the transparency of trade discussions and negotiations, what plans does the Commission have to improve public access to the WTO negotiations?"
"In particular, is the Commission going to conduct, and report on the findings of, full impact assessments in all areas of NAMA, including sensitive areas such as fisheries and forests?"
". The Commission is in favour of increasing the transparency and accountability of the WTO so as to reinforce the legitimacy of this institution."
"On the functioning of the WTO, the EU has put forward a number of proposals for improvements, notably relating to the preparation and management of ministerial conferences, with the aim of facilitating more efficient negotiations and decision-making amongst an ever-growing membership."
"For instance, it should be possible to agree in the short term to a better definition of the role of the host of ministerial conferences."
"Equally, there is a need to improve the ability of smaller and non-resident delegations to negotiate effectively both in the Geneva process and at ministerial meetings."
"Regarding parliamentary control, the Commission is in favour of granting the European Parliament more powers in terms of trade policy."
"It has therefore supported proposals putting the European Parliament on an equal footing with the Council in terms of trade policy-making in the Convention on the future of Europe."
"Meanwhile, we are keeping the European Parliament fully informed of the conduct and conclusion of international negotiations by regularly taking part in formal and informal meetings of Parliament and transmitting policy documents to Parliament on a par with the Council, as well as consulting Parliament on the main trade policy orientations."
"However, the Commission is bound to remain within the Treaty framework."
"The 133 Committee that is composed of representatives of the governments of the Member States is not a decision-making body, but a consultative body."
"Major policy decisions are taken by democratically elected ministers in the Council."
"As regards transparency vis-à-vis the public in general, the Commission pursues a proactive policy of communication, amongst other things by putting relevant information on its website, through its regular dialogue with civil society and in replying to citizens’ requests for access to documents."
"As far as sustainability impact assessments are concerned, they have already been conducted on the first batch of NAMA sectors in 2002/2003, i.e. textiles and clothing, pharmaceuticals and non-ferrous metals."
"The results have been available on the website of Manchester University since 2003, with suggestions for adjustment whenever imbalances have been revealed, both domestically or in third countries."
"A study on forests has also been carried out and the results published in June 2005."
"A second batch of studies is currently being launched on another set of NAMA sectors and will include fisheries."
"The results of this second batch are likely to be published in the first half of next year."
"I welcome what the Commissioner said about keeping Parliament informed."
"Will he specifically commit himself to keeping Parliament’s delegation to the negotiations in Hong Kong fully informed as the WTO talks develop, so that it can play an active part in those talks and serve as a conduit for relaying information to the public to ensure full transparency?"
". That is very important."
"Extensive arrangements have been put in place for the European Parliament’s delegation, not only to accompany us in Hong Kong, but to meet us every day, to be regularly informed."
"In fact, I have just written to the Chairman of the Committee on International Trade, informing him that there will be daily briefings every morning."
"It is very important to note that what we are doing in Hong Kong is not some obscure, abstract process."
"It is about the daily lives and employment opportunities of billions of people."
"Our job is to justify what we do so as to secure public understanding and support for what we are negotiating at that very important ministerial meeting."
"Commissioner, could I ask you to focus your attention for a moment on an aspect of substance in the WTO talks, namely the perception by many that agriculture is being made the whipping boy and the sacrifice in those talks."
"CAP reform was undoubtedly sold as a means to protect agricultural tariffs from future attack."
"We were then told agriculture would be safe in the WTO."
"Now we find that you have, maybe somewhat precipitately, made a unilateral offer to slice those tariffs by a further massive percentage."
"One really does wonder whether there is an appreciation of the dire jeopardy in which agriculture in many regions like mine, with which you are familiar, is now being placed if that is the process that is to be followed."
". It is all too tempting to say that if you were to persuade those with whom I am negotiating in the WTO that we are slashing our agricultural tariffs, then you will have done a better job of persuading them of the weight of our agricultural offer than I have."
"We have, of course, made a perfectly credible and serious offer concerning agricultural tariffs linked to proposals we have made in respect of domestic subsidies and the elimination of export subsidies."
"Those are proportionate, and are rooted very firmly within the envelope of the existing CAP reforms and do not go outside it."
"They are what we are required to do."
"We signed up to an original Doha mandate, and we then signed up to the framework agreement last summer which invites us to introduce measures that will bring about a substantial improvement in market access in agriculture."
"That is what I believe we are doing."
"However, we are not taking risks and we are not jeopardising or threatening the livelihoods of European farmers or farming communities."
"That is alarmist talk to which I do not subscribe."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if the negotiations to be held in Hong Kong in accordance with the multilateral system break down – which is a distinct possibility, even if it is the last thing we all want – do you believe that it would then be easier or more difficult to establish a free trade area between Europe and America?"
". I cannot think of anything more difficult or perhaps more painful than negotiating a free trade area between the European Union and the United States of America!"
"However, I strongly believe there is scope for attacking some of the non-tariff barriers that stand in the way of growing trade and investment across the Atlantic."
"As the honourable Member knows, this is something of great interest to me."
"I am particularly concerned about the regulatory differences, the lack of convergence and the obstacles that are thrown up because of the differences and frequent incompatibility between the different regulatory systems in Europe and the United States."
"However, both of those regulatory systems are rooted in tradition, past practice, and I suspect that we in Europe would have no greater luck in telling the Americans how to reform their regulatory systems than the Americans would have if they came over here and told us how to run our regulatory systems."
"Nevertheless, through patient dialogue and, I hope in due course, negotiation, we should be able to make some necessary and important improvements that will be of benefit to our respective business communities and, therefore, to jobs and livelihoods on both sides of the Atlantic."
"The Commission has reduced tariffs on Thai prawns from 12% to 4.2%."
"It was originally planned to introduce the reduced tariffs on 1 July 2005 but the date was brought forward to 1 April as a result of the devastating tsunami."
"The hope is that, by reducing tariffs, the EU will help Thailand towards economic recovery."
"The Council previously agreed that EU aid to countries hit by the tsunami should help to reduce their vulnerability to any future natural disasters."
"Critics claim that the reduced tariffs on Thai prawns are contrary to the Council's agreement."
"The reason for this assertion is that prawn farmers cut down coastal mangrove forest to create lagoons."
"Mangrove forest provides important protection against storms, floods and giant waves."
"The Swedish Society for Nature Conservation has emphasised that the tsunami would have had less of an impact if mangrove forest had not been razed to make way for prawn farms."
"Does the Commission consider that support for prawn farms, in the form of reduced tariffs, is consistent with the Council's abovementioned decision?"
"Has the Commission analysed the implications of prawn farming in Thailand with regard to the clearance of mangrove forest?"
". Under the current Generalised System of Preferences – GSP – the unilateral scheme of tariff concessions granted to 180 developing countries which still applies until 1 January 2006, imports of fishery products including shrimps and prawns into the EU from Thailand’s main competitors – Indonesia, Malaysia and Brazil – are benefiting from reduced duties: from 12% to 4.2%."
"Thailand has been excluded from GSP preferences for fishery products since 1 January 1999 on the basis of its high level of competitiveness in the EU market."
"The new GSP adopted by the Council on 27 June 2005 is based on different criteria and is also more generous to all GSP beneficiaries, including, it was decided, tsunami-affected countries like Thailand."
"Thus, from January 2006 onwards, Thailand will again benefit from reduced duties on its fishery products under the new GSP."
"This is consistent with the Commission and the Council’s overall aim to help tsunami-affected countries."
"The Commission is aware that concerns have been raised about the issue of prawn farming in south-east Asia and the effects of removing mangrove forests to create lagoons."
"The Commission therefore supports the sustainable development of coastal-zone management in Asia via the transfer of best practices and environmental solutions from Europe to Asia."
"The Commission’s EuropeAid Cooperation Office has so far committed funding for three projects dealing with rehabilitation of mangrove forests in tsunami-affected areas of Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand through the Asia Pro Eco post-tsunami programme."
"This, moreover, should help safeguard shrimp production – an eligible sector under that programme – which is to address the development of environmental management in coastal areas engaging in aquaculture."
"As is well known, the footwear industry is currently undergoing grave problems thanks to international trade liberalisation."
"This is primarily affecting those Member States with more fragile economies, including Portugal, some of whose northern areas are now running the risk of high unemployment and the blockage of their development, as the author of this question has recently witnessed."
"A particularly grave factor has been the removal of quotas on imports from China, one of whose most visible results has been a fall in average import prices of approximately 50%."
"Can the Commission state what action it is taking on the matter, especially with regard to the European Footwear Industry Confederation's request for an anti-dumping inquiry?"
". The Commission is aware of the recent development of imports into the Community of footwear originating in China and Vietnam."
"In that context, the Commission received earlier this year complaints submitted by the EU footwear industry containing convincing data indicating that the EU footwear industry is suffering from adverse effects caused by dumped prices of imports of footwear into the Community."
"The Commission has acted promptly by initiating two anti-dumping investigations."
"The first concerns imports of footwear with a protective toe-cap originating in China and India."
"The second concerns imports of footwear with leather uppers from China and Vietnam."
"The aim of those investigations is to establish whether the imports in question are dumped and have had a negative impact on the economic situation of the Community footwear industry."
"The investigations will also have to assess the impact and the possible adverse effect of any measures on the other economic operators in the Community."
"The investigation has made progress."
"The Commission is now analysing the question of market economy treatment of the exporters concerned, the definition of the different categories and models of the products involved, the question of whether there is dumping, the impact of these imports on the Community’s shoe-producing industry and the position of traders, retailers and consumers."
"All that is in progress."
"It is not a surprise that it is a highly complicated case."
"Given the enormous technical problems, with hundreds of economic operators and a product that consists of thousands of different models, it is too early to give any concrete indication about the possible outcome."
"– There are many small and medium-sized enterprises that are already closing down or on the brink of doing so."
"The effect of this is to exacerbate the unemployment problem in the areas in question – as in my country, for example, and in a number of other southern European countries – and seriously to hinder development in these areas."
"If the process does not move forward soon, it may be too late. I should therefore like to ask you how long the worst affected areas will have to wait before practical, effective measures, such as the safeguard clauses, will be put in place."
". The investigation will be completed within the prescribed time, though I am unable to say precisely when that will be."
"Provisional measures can be taken by the Commission between two and nine months after initiation of the investigation."
"I should stress that this really is a very complex matter indeed; much more so than was originally anticipated when we began the investigation."
"We have to be very careful that we assess precisely not only what the effect on the Community interest is, but what the impact would be if we were to take anti-dumping action on a variety of different producers and economic operators in this sector."
"Some Community producers are themselves partly producing outside the Community."
"Former fully-fledged Community producers have kept their research, design and development activities within the Community, but are getting supplies from a variety of sources, like China and Vietnam, but also Romania, Bulgaria and Brazil as well as Italy, Slovakia and other Member States."
"Those former producers also provide a considerable amount of jobs through these other economic activities."
"You can see from this – and I could also identify other issues complicating this matter – that we have to be very careful in our assessment."
"We do not have a single homogenous set of European producers with one set of clearly identifiable and quantifiable interests."
"There are a variety of different producer interests and we have to ensure, after our initial judgement on whether the alleged dumping practices have been substantiated, what the impact would be on a variety of different producer interests should any action follow."
"I am pleased and relieved to hear the Commissioner’s response because I have been lobbied by European retailers who have invested considerable money in Asia, have improved health and safety conditions and working conditions in Asian countries, and are bringing economic benefits both to Asian workers and to European retailers."
"Would the Commissioner agree that it would be quite wrong if those companies were caught up in any anti-dumping duties?"
". The honourable Member has identified one such type of European producer whose interests I have to take into account."
"It will clearly not be easy to find a balanced and equitable solution in this very complex situation and, frankly, the Commission will need a fair amount of ingenuity and flexibility in order to lead this case to a solution acceptable for the Member States and the economic operators."
"Having said that, Member States will soon receive a proposal from my services not to grant market economy treatment to the Vietnamese exporters, since state interference, subsidies and other competitive distortions are still widespread."
"The Commission has not yet assembled any results on China."
"Madam President, I also wish to thank Mr Mandelson for advocating free trade and speaking up for those industries that benefit from free trade."
"In specific connection with this matter, I should like to know why the anti-dumping investigation also extends to include sports shoes, which have been exempt from Regulation 467/98 and, overall, have been exempt from all import restrictions for many years."
"The kind of impression given is that the Commission has panicked at having been put under this pressure by forces in the EU that fear free competition."
"Can the Commissioner confirm that this is not the case?"
". The honourable Member has put the finger on an important issue."
"She should not assume that anti-dumping duties will be levied on such sportswear producers."
"I have yet to satisfy myself that there is a direct Community competitor producing such sportswear."
"Therefore it is not yet clear to me as to what Community interest in that segment of the sector is being harmed."
"However, the investigation continues."
"I suspect that shortly we will be able to reach a view about the particular sector to which she refers."
"Questions Nos 49 to 53 will be answered in writing(2)."
"Which means is the Commission using to forecast the restructuring of enterprises and future economic and labour developments in each sector of the market and in each type of job, particularly in island, agricultural and remote areas?"
"Do the EU's bilateral and international commitments affect these forecasts?"
"Which mechanisms is the Commission using to maintain the sustainable development of these regions and preserve their social fabric, in particular by helping workers adjust to the new employment situation and planning training arrangements for the younger generation?"
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s activities in the field of restructuring are carried out on a pan-European basis."
"It does not have special instruments at its disposal for forecasting the restructuring of enterprises and future economic and labour developments in each sector of the market and in each type of job in island, rural and outlying areas."
"Whereas each Member State has access to instruments for monitoring individual sectors and its own labour market, the Commission can only monitor specific sectors or regions on an individual basis."
"The Commission communication of 31 March 2005 on restructuring and employment provided the social partners with an opportunity to make their views on this matter known to the Commission."
"Furthermore, in its communication of 5 October on industrial policy, the Commission referred to certain industrial sectors in which structural changes may take place over the next few years."
"It follows that we must be able to anticipate these changes and to facilitate them at regional, national and European level."
"The tertiary sector may also be affected by restructuring, and detailed studies of this issue are needed."
"The Commission is working together with the Dublin-based European Monitoring Centre on Change and actively participating in its projects, which are targeted at various sectors and at the monitoring of restructuring."
"The commitments the European Union has entered into and the treaties it has concluded on a bilateral and international basis have an impact on certain key aspects of restructuring, such as the extent to which markets are opened up, access to markets, technological innovation and technology sharing, and the social clauses in this type of treaty."
"The Commission has certain instruments at its disposal to promote the sustainable development of the regions, including and in particular the European Employment Strategy, the European Social Fund in the case of investment in human capital and the European Regional Development Fund in the case of investment in infrastructure, productive investment and the development of endogenous potential."
"Assistance is available from the Structural Funds in the shape of medium-term strategy programmes aimed at forecasting and better managing industrial developments, and minimising their impact on workers."
"With this in mind, the Commission’s proposals for the 2007-2013 programming period prioritise the monitoring and management of change, under the goals of competitiveness and employment."
"The result of this will be a focus on three key issues; the major inequalities that exist in the field of employment, the continuing fast pace of economic and social restructuring, brought about by globalisation and the development of a knowledge-based economy, and demographic changes that will lead to an ageing of the workforce."
"Among other things, this regulation provides for a contingency reserve of 1% for convergence regions and 3% for other regions."
"This will enable Member States to make use of the Funds to better manage economic and social restructuring and to better deal with the consequences of global market opening."
"On top of this, the Commission recently proposed setting up a Globalisation Adjustment Fund, aimed at tackling any adverse effects of restructuring."
"If this Fund is set up, it will support workers hit by globalisation-related crises."
"As far as the education of future generations is concerned, the European education programmes Erasmus, Socrates and Leonardo enable thousands of young people to study abroad."
"In addition, the framework programmes for EU-funded research make it possible to fund key projects at EU level, particularly in the fields of employment, education, vocational training and innovation, and these projects will pave the way for further measures."
"– Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for his fairly elucidating reply."
"I specifically wished to ask if you have planned where the financing for this planned fund to strengthen restructurings is to come from and if provision has been made to publicise all these auxiliary measures in order to strengthen the confidence of Europeans in developments and prevent them from becoming discouraged in the face of the phenomenon of globalisation."
". It is of course the case that the funds currently at the Commission’s disposal mean that it can already respond to certain unexpected changes."
"To take one well-known example, 5 000 people were recently made redundant at Rover over a short period of time."
"The Commission made use of the Structural Funds to intervene, and this intervention has been widely acknowledged to have been a success."
"It goes without saying that this case was out of the ordinary, since it affected only one manufacturing plant in one country."
"The recent changes at Electrolux are an example of interrelated problems caused by major system restructuring, involving more than one country."
"At present we lack effective instruments to deal with cases of this kind, which is why the idea of a fund to tackle the effects of globalisation and restructuring has been mooted."
"Its aim would not be to protect non-competitive businesses, but to make it possible for people negatively affected by restructuring to find a new livelihood."
"To use a metaphor, if I may, our aim is not to save a sinking ship, but to rescue the crew and to get them to another ship or to dry land, so that they can carry on with their lives."
"The fund will promote investment in human capital and in life-long learning, as well as the conclusion of agreements on employment and partnerships for innovation at national, regional and local level."
"It will also support the development of systems and instruments that make it easier to forecast social and economic change, encourage greater flexibility of workers and businesses affected by restructuring, and boost the administrative capacities and productivity of all stakeholders, for example by training managers involved in change."
"It will be possible to use instruments that already exist at Member State level, such as those used for the European Social Fund, to implement this fund."
"At the end of September, the Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Vladimír Špidla, spoke on the subject of freedom of movement for workers at a meeting with social partners."
"Reports suggest that the Commission intends to lift the restriction on jobseekers from Eastern Europe as soon as possible."
"However, the extremely high pay gap in the regions bordering the new Member States means that a delay in allowing the free movement of workers and services is of the utmost importance."
"Does the Commission already have a firm plan to lift the restrictions for jobseekers from Eastern Europe?"
"If so, how and when will this take place?"
". Ladies and gentlemen, when the treaties of accession were concluded, it was agreed that the ‘2+3+2’ policy would be adopted for the transition periods."
"One way of looking at these multiple transition periods, or intervals at which checks can be carried out in order to decide whether there is any point in extending them, is to view them as motivated by a desire both to sign the treaties of accession and to put an end to the transition periods, since the latter would make it impossible to achieve full freedom of movement for workers within as short a period of time as possible."
"The Commission’s current obligation is to submit a report evaluating the impact of the transition periods in their first two years."
"Our aim is to draft a report which is credible and absolutely reliable in terms of methodology, and which takes all the surrounding circumstances into account, including the fact that some countries share borders with new Member States."
"I have to say that I attach a great deal of value to this report."
"As well as providing an authoritative basis for decision-making on such a sensitive issue, it must also serve as a platform for further work and evaluations in three years’ time."
"At this point decisions will again be taken in line with the treaty, since five years will have passed since the transitional period began, and there will be a great deal less room for manoeuvre then than after only two years."
"It is in our interest, not to say our supreme interest, to give due consideration to all the relevant circumstances surrounding this sensitive issue, including the geographical location of individual countries."
"Madam President, I should like to extend my sincere thanks to the Commissioner for his comments, and for his assurance that the report will be balanced."
"I should like to put the following supplementary question. Why is it that the public statements made by yourself and your officials have intimated that a decision has already been taken, and why is there such a rush to grant freedom of movement?"
"We all agree that freedom of movement is our goal, and we too uphold this fundamental principle of the European Union."
"The key issue, however, is ensuring that the concerns of all parties affected are taken seriously."
"To repeat my question, therefore, why have you already taken your decision on this matter?"
". In a sense I have already answered this question in my previous response, but I believe that it is of such significance that it merits a more detailed answer."
"The treaty of accession divided up the transition periods into certain stages, on the assumption that these would be subject to in-depth evaluations."
"The implicit goal of these interim stages is to put an end to the transitional periods, and the sooner this happens the better."
"It is my firm belief that the free movement of workers is one of the major driving forces behind the European Union’s economic growth, by which I also mean job creation."
"It follows that this is therefore a matter of public interest."
"Conversely, I am also very much aware that this is a highly sensitive issue."
"I would reiterate the point that our goal will be to submit a report that is regarded as authoritative, by which I mean that it will be above reproach methodologically speaking."
"Individual countries will naturally take their own decisions in line with the treaty, and they will be able to decide what is right for them on the basis of the facts."
"It is by no means the Commission’s intention to break up or bring about the destruction of the labour market in any country."
"The aim of the treaties of accession, however, is to create a common market and to achieve the free movement of workers within this common market, since this is one of the four key values which are upheld in the European Union and which underpin the concept of European integration."
"In view of this, I believe that we should act with due speed and with the necessary courage, after weighing up all the relevant information."
"It goes without saying that the responsibility for taking the decision lies with the governments."
"Commissioner, thank you for restating your commitment to the principle of the free movement of workers. I very much agree."
"However, I should like to ask you whether you plan to research or analyse, from the Commission point of view, the decision by the United Kingdom and other countries to open up their labour markets to free movement of labour immediately, as opposed to those countries which impose restrictions."
"Is this something that you plan to do and could you tell us if it is a feasible idea?"
". There can be no question that the experience gained by the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden is a valuable source of information when it comes to assessing the impact of any termination or non-enforcement of transition periods."
"Careful evaluation is needed of these experiences, and this may well involve using certain studies."
"As the time allotted to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 56 to 90 will be answered in writing(3)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in principle the Commission’s proposals are a welcome development, and its enlargement strategy for the Western Balkans is exactly right."
"The fact that the Commission has now formally confirmed that EU membership is a medium-term prospect for the Western Balkan states is also good news. This is enormously important for the future development of this region, since in the long term it is the only thing that will bring peace to this part of Europe, which has had such a difficult past."
"At the same time, however, the European People’s Party (European Democrats) would urge the Commission to assess the fitness of each candidate country in the Western Balkans to join the EU on an individual and point-by-point basis before binding dates are set for the opening of accession negotiations, and before timetables are drawn up for accession. The Commission must not make the same mistake with the countries known as the Western Balkan states that it did in the case of Romania and Bulgaria, and particularly in the case of Turkey, when it named a date prematurely, before the criteria had been met in full."
"The European public’s reaction to such a move would be even greater opposition to other countries joining the EU, while at the same time excessive demands would be made of the Balkan states in terms of their capacity for reform. This is the last thing we can afford in this highly unstable region, parts of which were ravaged by civil war until recently."
"As the Commissioner himself said, it is apparent that significant progress has been made with reforms."
"The Commission is right to maintain that Croatia and Macedonia have made the most progress, and have therefore already been recognised as candidate countries, or soon will be, as in the case of Macedonia. This should also act as an incentive for neighbouring countries that are lagging behind on the road towards EU membership for many different reasons."
"Each of these countries has its own lot with which it must contend. Albania must recover from the decades it spent under the communism of Enver Hoxha, when the country resembled a high-security prison."
"Bosnia and Herzegovina must come to terms with the nightmare years of displacement, murder and war, and shoulder the burden of the Dayton Agreement, which was a monstrosity that ended the war but failed to establish a platform for good governance and cooperation."
"Serbia took a long time to free itself of its dictator, and it is currently unclear how long its state union with Montenegro will last. Finally, the status of Kosovo must be determined without delay, by means of an agreement between Belgrade and Pristina mediated by the international community."
"I was pleased to hear the Commissioner say that the Commission would present an initiative and a strategy on this matter."
"The Western Balkans and our enlargement strategy for this region are a litmus test for our European policies."
"Mr President, I am pleased with the report by Mrs de Veyrac, which has the great merit of clearly proposing the principle of adopting a blacklist of unsafe, even dangerous, airlines."
"In view of recent repeated disasters resulting from the defectiveness of certain aircraft, it is essential that we act to identify them and ban them from flying."
"It is essential to the safety of all air passengers that they be aware of the identity of the airline carrying them and, furthermore, to know whether or not that airline is considered to be dangerous. This is an absolute right."
"This must be respected fully since it involves the lives of millions of people travelling across the world by air."
"I would like to express one reservation, however. What will be the scope of the Community list of these airlines not meeting European safety criteria?"
"For the time being, it appears that the Commission has not set any common criteria for the establishment of a Community list."
"Do you fear the diplomatic consequences in relation to certain sensitive countries?"
"Is there fear, for example, of the reaction of the Turkish authorities to the recent flight ban of Onur Air only by the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Switzerland?"
"Why are the other European countries not associated with this prohibition measure?"
"The text that has been presented to us proposes, amongst other things, increasing the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency. Why not, if the objective is the strengthening of common criteria for inspection, prohibition and restriction of flying rights?"
"Nevertheless, is there provision for measures to control this Agency and means for appealing against its decisions?"
"We must legislate, of course, and quickly, but we must take care not to remove any of the Member States’ room for manoeuvre in such a crucial area as the safety of their citizens."
". Mr President, on the particular issue of Units 1 and 2 of the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant, the rapporteurs in the Slovak Government have both come forward with an estimate of the total cost of decommissioning for the two units as likely to be EUR 750 million."
"Against this, the Commission’s proposal for an appropriation of EUR 237 million for the period 2007 to 2013 may seem modest, but there are two very strong arguments in favour of keeping to the Commission’s figure of EUR 237 million."
"Firstly, although Unit 1 is due to be shut down in 2006, major structural decommissioning will not begin until Unit 2 is shut down in 2008."
"EUR 237 million is a substantial sum of money for the first five years of a decommissioning period which is expected to last for 30 years."
"Secondly, to increase the amount is to make a mockery of the budget which Parliament has already voted."
"We know that politically we are entering into a very sensitive period on the financial perspectives and it does not help if Parliament votes one thing one minute and another thing the next. We have to respect the vote on the budget."
"Nor should we be trying to force anyone’s hand on the budget beyond 2013."
"The debate on any further money for Bohunice should take place in the context of the next round of budget discussions and in the light of whatever has happened on decommissioning up to that point."
"It is understandable, however, that the Slovak authorities want to know where they are with the funding over this 2006-2013 financial perspective, so the total sum of EUR 237 million needs to be fixed for that period without further review, although the yearly appropriation may vary."
"On the wider issue of decommissioning, the key challenge is to ensure that, on the one hand, enough money is available to decommission nuclear plants safely and, on the other hand, that the financing of decommissioning does not become state aid by the back door. Paragraph 5 of the report is important in this respect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for her very wide-ranging and in-depth analysis."
"We have always believed that nuclear power station security and safety is a European issue, and that such issues affect us all, because malfunctioning or other problems affect the public across Europe."
"Decommissioning and final storage are clearly issues for competition law."
"We must make sure that funds are allocated in line with EU competition law, and I also believe that there must be legal provisions to prevent distortions of competition, by which I mean not only distortion in competition between the Member States, but above all between producers, and not only as regards nuclear energy but for all energy sources."
"That is why we in the centre believe that peer review is necessary, that is to say mutual checks and transparent implementation, and that we need to pay particular attention to ensuring that in future funds for closure, final storage and consumer security are available for each energy source."
"The European Union, the Court of Auditors and the various other institutions must create a clear legal framework. It is a matter of presenting the situation as clearly as possible and of applying models that reduce costs to the consumer while at the same time optimising security, safety, final storage and decommissioning."
"Mr President, I would basically feel a lot happier in a Europe without nuclear power stations and free of the associated risks. However, because that is a decision made at national level, as the Commissioner quite rightly said, we need to pay particular attention to safety."
"The only thing is that, in this case, we are talking about a power station that was built before accession to the European Union, one of the consequences of which is that it must now be closed down. We are talking about a power station in a not very wealthy country, a country with economic problems."
"That is something that I believe we must take into account, and that is why the Austrian Members in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are seeking a higher contribution towards this power station’s closure costs."
"The PSE Group will therefore be voting for this higher contribution. I do not see any great contradiction with the financial perspective, because there is no problem about finding this funding in the long term."
"Let me once again appeal to the House to support Slovakia in this instance and give it a real helping hand, so that we can, in the interests of Europe’s safety, close this power station down as soon as possible."
"Mr President, allow me to return for a moment to a deplorable incident that took place yesterday regarding the anti-abortion exhibition organised by our Polish fellow Members from the Independence and Democracy Group."
"Mrs Gomes and myself were not only jostled, not only almost hit, but also called ‘fascists’ and ‘Nazis’ by this group."
"That is unacceptable."
"I was not planning to complain to the President, since the exhibition has been cancelled and the scandalous images associating abortion with the Holocaust – something that is really most absurd – have been withdrawn."
"However, since my fellow Member had the audacity to call us, in order to complain about having been called a ‘fascist’, I should like all the same to point out that we ourselves were called ‘Nazis’."
"In this Chamber, that is particularly shocking."
"Thank you for that information, Mrs De Keyser."
"As you were able to note, the exhibition has been withdrawn because the Rules of Procedure require that the debate take place here, in this Chamber, and not by means of an exhibition from outside."
"As regards the events that you have just reported, I suggest that you refer the matter to the Bureau to see how it might usefully be followed up."
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on Iraq after the referendum on the Constitution."
". Mr President, this debate comes at a critical stage in Iraq’s political transition."
"When this Parliament last discussed Iraq with the Commission and Council in July, Iraq’s political leaders were in the process of negotiating a new constitution."
"One month ago, Iraqis voted to approve that constitution which would, for the first time ever, provide them with guarantees on their freedom, security and human rights."
"The constitutional referendum marks a further step by the Iraqi people on the road to democracy, freedom and peace."
"In one month’s time they will vote again, this time to elect a new government that will need quickly to tackle important tasks such as planning and delivering much-needed services that will provide hope for a brighter and better future for millions of Iraqis."
"Last month’s referendum was remarkable in many ways."
"Along with January’s elections, it provided Iraqis with their first real taste of democracy."
"They participated, for the first time, in political decisions that will affect their own, and their country’s, future."
"It was humbling, particularly for those of us who come from countries which often take our freedoms and democracy for granted, to see the courage and determination of those who exercised their democratic rights and took part in the voting, braving difficult conditions and the threat of violence."
"European Union support for the constitutional referendum had a significant impact."
"The Commissioner will in a moment no doubt detail the valuable assistance which the Commission provided to the process in support of the Independent Electoral Commission for Iraq and of the UN."
"The United Nations has played, and continues to play, a key and outstanding supporting role in the constitutional review and election processes."
"The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq played a vital role in assisting the Iraqi Electoral Commission under the most difficult of circumstances."
"The decision to approve the Constitution paved the way for December’s general election."
"This should represent another major step in the political transition that will eventually lead to Iraq assuming its full role in the international community."
"Iraq is, of course, still some way from achieving that aspiration."
"Although a large majority of voters voted in favour of the constitution, the results of the referendum show there are still substantial divisions to be overcome between Iraq’s ethnic communities."
"A review of the constitution will take place early in the new government’s tenure."
"This offers an important opportunity for Iraqis to forge a broader consensus on the future of their country, and will assist the creation of an inclusive political system."
"Iraq’s political leaders will need to resolve key issues, including federalism, dealing with its political past, and the management of natural resources."
"Dissatisfaction also threatens the election process."
"It feeds the sense of frustration and disenfranchisement that some communities feel."
"It also breeds the sympathy which extremists and terrorists use to justify maintaining the cycle of violence and the insurgency."
"It is imperative, therefore, that Iraq’s political, ethnic and religious leaders do all they can to address these issues."
"We hope that the new parliament and government is as representative and as inclusive as possible."
"Turning now to international assistance to Iraq’s process of political transition, the EU and the wider international community have already provided significant and valuable support."
"I look forward to the Commissioner describing the Commission’s invaluable and ongoing assistance."
"I would like to mention an important step taken towards closer partnership between the EU and Iraq through the signature of the Joint EU-Iraq Political Declaration on 21 September."
"This paves the way for regular political dialogue with Iraq on issues of mutual interest, such as promotion of good governance, protection of human rights and conflict prevention and resolution."
"During that visit, the Iraqi Government stressed how much it values the EU’s assistance, particularly in supporting the constitutional and electoral processes and work to improve capacity in the rule of law sector, including through the EUJUST LEX mission."
"Many neighbouring countries and other regional players are making concerted efforts to engage constructively."
"In particular we welcome the Arab League’s suggestion to work with Iraq in holding a National Dialogue Conference early next year."
"A preparatory meeting is due to take place in Cairo in a few days’ time, on 19 November."
"This meeting has the potential to lay the foundations for post-election international engagement and support for the new government."
"The Council has strongly urged regional states, in particular Syria, to support the political process in Iraq."
"This includes cooperating with Iraq to prevent cross-border transit and support for terrorists and insurgents."
"As we approach this landmark election we should consider what implications the formation of a new and long-term Iraqi Government might hold for our engagement with Iraq."
"Our first objective must be to continue to provide support for the election process."
"The Iraq Government has specifically requested this."
"The EU will provide support to the election monitoring process, including through supporting the work of domestic election observers."
"I know that some of you were present in Iraq for the January elections."
"I hope that it will again be possible for Members of this Parliament to show their support for Iraq’s aspiring parliamentarians in December."
"I have already said that the review of the constitution during the early part of the new government’s tenure will be key."
"The EU stands ready to support actively these important efforts, and is well placed to provide expert advice and technical assistance."
"In the longer term, we also need to continue support for the vital rule of law sector and consider its enhancement."
"The EU is playing a leading role by becoming a supporting donor of the rule of law sector working group, which aims to coordinate donor and government activity in this sector."
"The EU’s rule of law mission for Iraq, EUJUST LEX, is due to reach the end of its mandate at the end of June 2006."
"The Iraqi Government has asked for the programme to be extended and expanded to include wider training of judicial, police and prison officers."
"The Council is considering how to respond."
"Strengthening respect for human rights is also key."
"Iraq has asked for help in developing its capacity to implement human rights principles and to accede to key human rights conventions."
"The European Union is uniquely placed to provide this support and advice, and the EU stands ready to offer further support in this area."
"Both the EU and Iraq hope to broaden and enhance their partnership further, as the political process goes forward, through the establishment of contractual political dialogue and other appropriate contractual relations."
"Let me say once again that as Iraq approaches this milestone in its political transition, now is the time for the international community to provide its full support to the Iraqi people."
"The European Union, along with others in the international community are, and should continue to be – as in so many other developing and recovering countries – at the forefront of reconstruction and development."
"I look forward to discussing this with Parliament and hearing honourable Members’ views."
". Mr President, it is almost exactly four months since we first discussed Iraq, as Lord Bach has said."
"I remember saying then that for the Iraqis the hard work was only beginning."
"I truly meant it."
"Today, the Iraqis have a constitution."
"They will soon elect a constitutional government."
"But today Iraqis are also aware of substantial divisions that still need to be overcome in the country."
"They are now facing two very critical challenges: on the one hand, ensuring inclusive electoral consultations in December and, on the other hand, after doing that, carrying out a comprehensive review of the constitution, which has to be more inclusive."
"We stood by the Iraqis during the constitutional process and will also do so during the preparation of the election process and the elections."
"By providing another EUR 20 million in support, the Commission was the sole supporter of the United Nations and the UN-led constitutional support project."
"We feel part of a process that allowed the Iraqis to have their say on the constitution by casting their ballots on the referendum day."
"With regard to the elections, you surely remember how hopeful I was in July that we could also dispatch an electoral observation mission."
"But today we must accept the evidence that the security conditions do not allow it."
"This does not, however, prevent us from assisting in other equally effective ways."
"We are providing EUR 30 million to the UN electoral support project."
"While I speak, several European electoral experts are working side-by-side with the Independent Electoral Commission for Iraq and with the UN to ensure proper preparation of the elections and also to set up a transparent domestic monitoring system."
"But the road leading to democracy and peace in Iraq does not end with elections."
"Inevitably, it crosses the path of regional cooperation."
"Iraq, its neighbours and the other states in the region are called upon to play a key role by strengthening good neighbourly relations and by cooperating to improve regional security."
"I am very happy to say that the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Mr Amre Moussa, has also gone there now and that there will be a conference next year, together with the Arabs, in order to enhance this relationship that has been hampered in the last few years."
"Iraq will be a federal Iraq."
"Functional central institutions will be set up to support the state structure that the Iraqis themselves have chosen."
"To that end, suitable legislative and institutional frameworks need to be established."
"Viable solutions will have to be identified rapidly to ensure continued progress towards stability and democracy."
"Inclusiveness is absolutely the only way forward. We shall also consider how best we, the European Union, can help the building-up of institutions that favour an inclusive approach."
"We shall also encourage the efforts of the Arab League and others in the region – such as Jordan, for instance – to promote inclusiveness and national reconciliation."
"I am convinced that the recent visit of Kofi Annan has had a positive effect in advancing that understanding among different parties."
"The political process and stability in Iraq is important for all of us and for its neighbours."
"The recent events in Jordan very clearly remind us of the importance of succeeding in this inclusive approach, which is crucial for the whole political stabilisation of the region."
"For the Iraqi citizens, it is very important that they really have the feeling of freedom and can exercise their freedom."
"In this regard, we shall not forget that most Iraqis are still struggling for their children to go to school, for their hospitals to be opened in order to fight the most ordinary diseases, for access to water, jobs – the basics – and for their livelihood."
"It is an unsustainable situation for any people in any country, and therefore also for the people of Iraq."
"Their needs will continue to be at the core of our assistance to Iraq in 2006."
"I should like to elaborate on what we have been doing."
"We have supported the political process."
"In addition, we, together with the United States, have co-hosted a very important conference – the Iraq International Conference – in Brussels on 22 June."
"That was instrumental in mobilising international support from over 80 countries and organisations for the Iraqi transitional government and for the institutions for the transitional period before the December elections."
"We have also always assisted in reconstruction: we delivered an assistance package of EUR 580 million through the International Reconstruction Fund for Iraq."
"We have always tried to work towards meeting the basic needs of the population such as water, sanitation, healthcare and job creation."
"We are also working together with two ministries – the energy and trade ministries – on institution-building."
"For the future, we want to support the political process for the election."
"We also want to set up joint working groups in areas of common interest such as trade and energy."
"We want to support the WTO accession request, initiate negotiations for an EU-Iraq agreement on trade and cooperation and progress on the opening of the Commission delegation in Baghdad in 2006."
"The Union has much to offer beyond supporting the reconstruction process."
"We want to be a meaningful partner for Iraq."
"The Iraqis are looking forward to that."
"We shall meet their expectations."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, following your very interesting statements, I should like to make the following comments:"
"The first comment concerns the Commissioner's last sentence."
"The European Union does indeed have much more to offer beyond reconstruction and our problem is how we can translate this very interesting idea into specific policy."
"The second comment concerns the vote on the constitution."
"I too agree that the vote for the constitution, despite the fact that an important group did not respond, is an important event."
"An important event which, however, still leaves certain very important problems outstanding, such as the issue and the role of religion, the federal model, the national identity and access to natural resources, especially oil."
"The third comment concerns the elections."
"The elections are indeed very, very important, especially as the new parliament will turn its attention – as the constitution says – not only to revising the constitution, but also to the manner in which certain of its provisions are applied."
"The fourth comment concerns a matter which, unfortunately, despite efforts, despite the democratisation process, is still outstanding."
"It is the matter of security."
"I do not wish to reopen a debate which has been held in Parliament, in the Council and in every Member State."
"However, I do wish to say this: there are a great many investigations, many of which have also been published, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in newspapers in your country, which raise the question of the continuing presence of foreign military forces in Iraq."
"I refer here, and this is my last point, to the proposal which we debated in the European Parliament: I think the time has come to replace the foreign military forces in Iraq with a UN peacekeeping force."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating you and giving you Parliament’s full support for the efforts you are making today so that the European Union carries some weight in the reconstruction of Iraq."
"Allow me, though, to return to an unsavoury point."
"A short time before the start of the war in Iraq, General Morillon put the European Parliament on its guard by saying: ‘there is no such thing as a clean war’."
"One might have hoped, though, that a war of independence might be less dirty than others."
"It is no such thing."
"After the terrible images of the invasion and the scandal of the Abu Ghraib prison, there is now the controversial issue of the white phosphorous bombs allegedly used in the siege of Falluja, a rebel town, but also a martyred town."
"Our history taught us that no kind of peace could be built in a country by hiding the atrocities committed there."
"It is here that an investigation and quest for the truth are required."
"The formal democracy seeking to establish itself in Iraq and the relations with this country we are seeking to reconstruct come up against the following obvious fact: ‘there can be no democracy without truth’."
"Saddam Hussein will be judged for the crimes he committed and, in all likelihood, for using chemical weapons against the Kurds in 1991."
"That is a simple matter of justice."
"The truth about the siege of Falluja, about its burned martyrs and about where the responsibility lies regarding the use of weapons banned by the 1980 Geneva Convention are also part of what we must contribute to the Iraqi people in addition to our material aid."
"We are going to help them to create their justice system: this is what is known as capacity building."
"Yet, can we really succeed in this undertaking if we do not also make them feel that justice, and especially international justice, exist?"
"I therefore call on you, Mr President, Commissioner, to demand of the coalition forces that a completely independent investigation be carried out and that justice be served."
"We have requested in due time that Saddam Hussein be tried by the International Criminal Court."
"The crime against humanity that the use of chemical weapons in Falluja would constitute, if proven, would fully warrant this move."
"Yet, if we, in this House, think that all of this is just a pipe dream, then what message of hope can we give today to the Iraqi people?"
". Mr President, when Saddam Hussein ran Iraq it was well described as a mass grave below ground and a torture chamber above."
"Yet after two years and eight months of war, the deaths of countless Iraqis and over 2 000 coalition troops, it is clear that life in Iraq is little better than before."
"Baghdad was statistically the world’s worst place to live even before the security situation deteriorated."
"How much worse now that civilian casualties run at more than 60 a day and insurgent attacks have almost trebled in 18 months."
"It is difficult to know whether the persistent presence of coalition troops under these conditions is a help or a hindrance in the restoration of normality."
"I fear I detect an air of complacency in the Council’s statement today and surprising optimism from the Commission."
"There have been notable successes on the road to democracy."
"Iraqis now have their own constitution; they have their own security forces, and in December they will have a democratically elected government."
"There are even signs that Sunni Arabs are moving into politics and preparing to contest the election, such as the formation last week of the National Public Democratic Movement in the province of Anbar."
"Nonetheless, Europeans have a number of serious concerns."
"There are signs of widening instability in the region."
"Evidence of gross human rights violations, including torture and the systematic use of arbitrary arrest, has badly damaged the coalition’s standing."
"That has helped recruit many to the insurgents’ cause."
"I have three specific concerns."
"First, the Pentagon’s acknowledgement a few hours ago that the US used phosphorous incendiary devices in Fallujah."
"The European Union must demand a UN inquiry into the use of these banned weapons."
"Second, yesterday’s revelation in sections of the media that of the more than 35 000 Iraqi civilians detained by the coalition, only 5% have ever been brought to trial and many have been denied legal counsel."
"What kind of example are we setting?"
"Third, the European Union Member States need a clear exit strategy."
"If we want to stop violent insurgents continuing to gain at the expense of moderate Iraqis, what is needed – and what the Blair-Bush alliance has always lacked – is a clear end-game."
"Europeans disagreed on the rationale for going into Iraq."
"We must not be divided on the conditions for leaving."
"We must talk to the Arab League, the Iraqi authorities and other Middle Eastern governments with a view to establishing the terms and timing of our departure that will leave Iraq a more stable and secure place."
"President Talabani has already made it clear that the Iraqi people are, and I quote, ‘looking forward to the day when we can say goodbye to the forces of the coalition’."
"Europe must work towards that goal."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group, too, will be supporting the measures proposed by the Council and the Commission as a means of giving the Iraqi people a chance of a peaceful and democratic future."
"I would, though, like to focus on something that Lord Bach said, to the effect that we Europeans want to take a leading role where democracy and human rights in Iraq are concerned."
"I have to tell Lord Bach that we must, in that case, have the courage and strength to tell our NATO partners that they must refrain from constantly breaching international law and to ensure that they do not, and we must give an assurance to this effect."
"What lessons can we learn from Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo?"
"To this day, the prisoners in Guantanamo have no rights and no legal protection."
"They are kept under appalling conditions."
"Can we, then, be all that horrified by the fact that those in positions of power in Iraq are also setting up prisons in secret?"
"In what sense are the international community and the EU setting a democratic example?"
"It is no more than cynical for Rumsfeld to enact new rules on torture stating that dogs may no longer, in future, be used in torture and interrogations, with not a word about compliance with the Geneva Convention."
"Those are the things about which I expect statements to be made."
"Do you know what white phosphorus is?"
"Do you know about the effects of white phosphorus, which the Americans now admit to having used in Fallujah?"
"It is a form of arson, with people as its victims, and there is no antidote, no means of putting the fire out – not even water can do it."
"It is a means of extermination that is contrary to international law, and it is means such as this that have been deployed."
"Lord Bach, you may have spent nine and a half minutes accentuating the positive, but you will carry no conviction unless and until you demand that the EU and the Council – particularly when it is being presided over by the British – commit themselves to getting the Americans to at last sign the international Convention, for unless we do that, we will not regain our international credibility and whatever instruments are applied, no matter with how much effort, will be ineffective."
"It is for that reason that I call upon you to ensure that there are not just investigations, but that the Americans also sign the international convention specifically outlawing the use of white phosphorus."
"Failing that, we will be unable to actively promote peace in Iraq."
". Mr President, for years, Europe and America turned a blind eye to the dreadful dictatorship in Iraq because Iraq supplied oil."
"Rather than provide support to Iraq’s opposition in good time, it was decided that there would be an intervention from outside on the basis of false arguments and without the UN’s approval."
"The way in which the superpower’s views and interests have been imposed, by force and unilaterally, has caused part of the Shiite majority to turn their backs on the Western occupiers and seek recourse to an Iran-style theocratic dictatorship."
"The good thing is that it has now proved possible to put an end to the situation in which the Kurdish north and the Shiite south were occupied lands oppressed by the central area surrounding Baghdad."
"The federalism inherent in the new constitution protects disadvantaged areas against oppression and exploitation, and so 80% of the population stand to benefit."
"A democracy in the new federal states can only succeed if the foreign military and the predominance of foreign companies withdraw from that country sooner rather than later."
"Staying on is a fresh provocation that continues to incite protests."
"When will the military presence of the EU Member States come to an end and in what ways is the EU helping Iraq to find its domestic solutions, thus ousting Halliburton, a failing American company that cannot repair the public utilities?"
". Mr President, this year, 2005, will go down in history as the year of the freest elections Iraq has ever known."
"Simply compare this three-day voting period with that country’s experience under the 35 years of the Ba'athist regime, with no elections whatsoever for the first 12 years and mock elections for the rest."
"What a contrast and what political progress!"
"We do not get to hear anything about this in this House."
"To be sure, Mesopotamia’s reconstruction continues to be threatened from within and without, as it was before."
"That is why the future of a federal Iraq looks very fragile."
"Earlier this week, a prominent Iraqi politician warned me that this affects Europe in equal measure."
"Indeed, if the destructive powers win, then our continent will also be in the firing line."
"I would ask the Council and Commission what the European Union could do for the Iraqi state and people in this precarious situation."
"Firstly, we must exert firm pressure on Baghdad’s neighbours so as not to fan the flames of terrorism across the border."
"Secondly, we must help lay the foundation of democratic rule of law along the banks of the Tigris."
"‘We must learn from the Europeans, and we do indeed want to’, said my Iraqi friend, full of optimism."
"The main thing is that we should not let them down in this aspiration."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"Iraq is painfully yet determinedly raising its head again after the bloody and in many ways insane dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and after the events of recent years, which have certainly paved the way for change but have also deeply scarred the Iraqi people."
"The next step, still under the aegis of the international community, should be for all the Arab states in the region to become increasingly involved in the whole process of democratisation and the fight against terrorism."
"The extraordinarily successful turnout in the recent elections was an historic event, but we have a clear duty to continue to stand by the Iraqi people and the freely elected authorities that are administering the country."
"We must provide practical help for all the young people who, with great courage and often at personal risk, want to fight to make Iraq a free, democratic and fair country at last."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the elections, the referendum and the new vote planned for 15 December show that, after years of bloody dictatorship, a true democracy is emerging in Iraq."
"It is a success story for the Iraqi people, who have shown through their turnout in the elections that they want to play an important part in establishing peace in the Middle East."
"At the cost of great sacrifices and hundreds of innocent victims, those who uphold democracy are winning the battle against the small minority who practise terrorism in the name of fundamentalism."
"The final goal has not yet been achieved, however, and much remains to be done to defeat Al Qaeda and its allies and to bring permanent stability to Iraq."
"Having survived a number of splits, the European Union has begun to make an important contribution, albeit belatedly."
"I agree with what the Council representative and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner have just said. Nevertheless, we have to do even more for the Iraqi people, in conjunction, of course, with the United Nations, which, through Resolution 1546, has enabled 35 countries to make a significant contribution to the birth of that new democracy."
"Their contribution is not only financial, as in the case of the democracy fund set up by the United Nations, but also political and military."
"Many Europeans are taking part in the peace mission, and we should be grateful to them for what they have done and are still doing – including risking their own lives – in order to make a fundamental contribution to the resurrection of Iraq."
"These people, soldiers and civilians alike, among whom are a great many Italians, have breathed life into thousands of projects to develop infrastructure in the fields of agriculture, transport, education and culture."
"This successful strategy is leading to cuts in the numbers of troops, who will be leaving Iraq under an agreement between them and the legitimate government in Baghdad."
"Many of those who criticised the peace mission are today having second thoughts and realising how important it has been."
"I shall finish, Mr President, by pointing out that it would be a mistake to think that resolving the Iraqi crisis will be enough to bring peace to the Middle East."
"We still have to solve the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, with the European Union playing an important role, by guaranteeing security for Israel and creating a Palestinian state."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, democracy is not a mere exercise in style, but requires roots that have not yet been put down in Iraq."
"Let us finally take a close look at the real situation."
"The Kurds turned out to vote because they glimpsed independence for their province on the horizon; the Shi’a did so to obey their religious leaders; and the few Sunni who voted did so to avoid being completely sidelined in the reorganisation of the country."
"The basic conditions needed to allow democracy to put down roots are economic security, a state apparatus that works and equality for all citizens under the law."
"The reality is that the project to export democracy on the wings of fighter-bombers has failed and the Western powers’ military occupation of the country now stands in the way of any solid, tangible progress."
"From another perspective, Iraq has become an exporting country, and not just of oil."
"The attacks in Jordan are proof: Iraq now exports its terrorism."
"The suicide bombers who blew themselves up were in fact Iraqis."
"A woman who was supposed to take part in the attacks but survived has explained that her family was decimated during the American offensives in the Sunni triangle."
"Therefore, I too strongly call for a UN investigation into the use of banned white phosphorus bombs by the American forces."
"Iraq is thus looking dangerously like another Afghanistan."
"President Bush wanted to fight the terrorists in Afghanistan so that he would not have to do so elsewhere, but today the terrorists already are elsewhere, and we wonder just how far they will go."
"Europe thus has to face two challenges, namely the obtuseness of those who still claim that the Iraqi campaign has been a success, and the murderous determination of those who demonstrate every day that it has been a tragic failure."
"To find a way out of this morass, we need neither propaganda nor comforting stories, but clear-headedness and brave statesmen who can acknowledge their mistakes and sketch out a new strategy, a strategy for peace."
"Mr President, sadly the anti-Americanism of some in Europe is so great that I sense that some even take a perverse satisfaction from the turmoil prevailing in Iraq."
"These same people, of course, are those who would have been quite content to allow Saddam’s tyranny to continue undisturbed."
"Of course it was wrong of Blair and Bush to rely on and peddle false information to justify the invasion of Iraq, but the removal of Saddam was right and necessary."
"The situation as it is must now be faced."
"The core issue is to ensure the triumph of order over terror so that democratic stability may indeed be established."
"A heavy price is being paid and I would wish to acknowledge the sacrifice of the American, British and other troops seeking to bring order to this strife-torn land."
"I regret that in their contributions neither the Council nor the Commission saw fit to make an acknowledgement of that sacrifice."
"It must be said that it is typical of its grandstanding that the EU now wants to pontificate on the future of Iraq."
"It has little that is credible to contribute, for, when it mattered, the EU as an organisation and most EU Member States left the heavy lifting to others."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Iraqi people’s adoption of an interim Constitution is, as far as we are concerned, a major step forward."
"The extensive participation of the people in the electoral process constitutes a reason for feeling optimistic about Iraq’s burgeoning democracy."
"The development of the country clearly opens the door to a future partnership between Iraq and the European Union, particularly in the context of the EU’s Neighbourhood Policy and of peace in the Mashreq region and, in this regard, I thank Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for the commitments made on behalf of the Commission."
"There are a great number of issues at stake for this partnership: the democratic stabilisation of the country; the creation of a real, and no longer formal, rule of law; respect for fundamental freedoms and minority rights, and yet also the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy and from a state-controlled to a market economy; the allocation of oil resources to diversification promoting agriculture, industry and services; and, finally, the reconstruction of the education and health care systems destroyed by so many years of authoritarian rule, embargoes and war."
"There are a number of prerequisites for this partnership, however."
"Iraq’s as yet uncertain development calls for us to exercise the utmost vigilance."
"We cannot just dismiss the use of white phosphorous bombs by the Americans in Falluja – if the information turns out to be true."
"An investigation must be carried out."
"Replacing the foreign forces with a peacekeeping presence under the aegis of the United Nations features among our objectives."
"The December elections must enable the Iraqi people to elect a government and a parliament that are representative of the human and political balances in the country."
"In this regard, the federal institutional framework seems particularly suitable."
"Curbing types of fundamentalism, combating the theory of the so-called clash of civilisations and building this entire Mashreq region upon the foundations of shared values are the goals that the European Union must be given."
"Mr President, over 2 000 American soldiers have died and 15 000 have been injured since military operations began against Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq."
"Iraq Body Count, a British research group, has estimated on the basis of news agency and newspaper reports that over 30 000 Iraqis have been killed, with other estimates placing the number of victims at 100 000."
"Constitutional ratification is a major step towards the reconstruction of Iraq."
"Two hundred and twenty-five political groups and coalitions have registered for the parliamentary elections due to be held on 15 December, and the parliament will elect a new government by 31 December of this year."
"This democratically elected parliament, which will include Sunni members, will be able to make amendments to the constitution over the next six months."
"The constitutional referendum held in Iraq gives us further reason to hope that Islam and the concept of liberal democracy can be reconciled in the Middle East and Central Asia in the shape of a so-called Muslim democracy."
"The period of rule of interim and transitional governments is coming to an end in the country, and a democratic political culture is emerging in its wake."
"At the same time, however, the situation continues to be characterised by incessant terrorist attacks and the constant possibility that civil war could break out."
"– Mr President, the international community welcomed the results of the referendum as an important stage in the course of the democratisation of Iraq."
"It is indeed, if you look no further than the degree of participation and the arithmetic aspects of the results."
"However, I fear that everyone is shaping their own fictitious reality for Iraq."
"However, we cannot ignore the actual reality in Iraq, because the serious security vacuum continues to exist."
"Instead of the centrifugal trends of the national and religious communities gradually weakening, they are strengthening and undermining the objective of the national unity, identity and sovereignty of Iraq."
"The majority of Sunnis are consciously outside political processes."
"The process of political reconstruction is leading to the creation of a loose state of at least three speeds."
"On the one hand, we welcome progress towards a democratic Iraq and, on the other hand, a theocratic Shiite regime is being established in the south and the quasi-independence of the Kurds is being established in the north."
"The consequences for peace and stability are obvious."
"Under these conditions elections are being planned to promote the new Iraqi parliament."
"However, I fear that the wishes and hopes being expressed here today do not correspond to the harsh reality of the military occupation and the serious strategic mistakes which the United States continues to make."
"There is an old saying in Arabic: 'Better a hundred years of tyranny than one year of chaos'."
"While the tyranny of the Hussein regime has been overturned, the conditions being created on a daily basis are pushing Iraq into long-term chaos."
". Mr President, I thank all those who have taken part in this debate."
"This is an issue that raises passions and strong views and we have heard them expressed around the Chamber this morning."
"However, I hope we can agree on two aspects at least."
"Firstly, on how excellent and what a good thing it is that Saddam Hussein is no longer in power in Iraq."
"Secondly, we can agree that any human rights abuses that have been shown to have been committed since he fell from power should be investigated and dealt with in a proper and sensible way."
"I am very grateful for what the Commissioner had to say and for the excellent work of the Commission."
"It is right to point out that the EU has contributed to the UN Office of Constitutional Support both financially and through the provision of experts."
"The Iraqi Government has requested that the EU provide election monitors and, whilst the full election observation mission would, as the Commissioner said, not be possible at the moment, the Council will look closely at what we can do to monitor and support the elections."
"As far as human rights are concerned, the Council’s conclusions following the external relations meeting on 7 November emphasised the importance of full respect for human rights in Iraq."
"The Council underlined the EU’s strong opposition to the use of the death penalty."
"It noted with concern recent reports – including by the United Nations – of human rights violations by the Iraqi security forces and urged the Iraqi Government to address these allegations."
"The EU stands ready to offer further support."
"At the same time, the Council welcomed the improvement in the human rights situation since the fall of Saddam Hussein and condemned, as we all should, the atrocities of terrorists since then."
"The issue of coalition troops has been raised during the debate and it is certainly an important issue."
"However, honourable Members will forgive me if I mention what President Talabani, the Kurdish leader whose people suffered so appallingly under Saddam Hussein, said only last weekend: ‘Immediate withdrawal would be a catastrophe and lead to a kind of civil war."
"We will lose what we have done for liberating Iraq from the worst kind of dictatorship ..."
"Instead of having a democratic, stable Iraq, we will have a civil war in Iraq, we will have troubles in Iraq and they will affect all the Middle East’."
"That seems to me an important statement by the President of Iraq at the present time."
"The people of Iraq have demonstrated great commitment to democracy."
"They turned out in their millions and in the most difficult of circumstances to approve a new Constitution that will guide their country and protect their rights."
"If this momentum can be carried through to the December elections, then I believe Iraq could be on the verge of a major turning point and, with the election of a new government, Iraq enters a new phase."
"The leaders of Iraq’s first constitutionally elected government will owe a huge debt of responsibility to its people."
"They will place their trust and their future in the hands of those leaders and those leaders must respect that trust."
"That means putting the nation’s interests above political and personal ambition or ethnic or religious interests."
"The new government has to be truly representative if it is to survive."
"It also must waste no time in getting down to business."
"That means ensuring security, health, education, employment and, of course, human rights."
"Terrorism and insecurity remain the biggest obstacles to political progress and reconstruction."
"We should not underestimate the challenges that lie ahead, and I do not think this Parliament does."
"There is still a lot to be done and huge dangers that we all know about still threaten these processes."
"This fledgling democracy will require support for some time to come."
"The international community has done a lot already and the EU has a proud record: it has joined with the UN and others in committing significant resources to supporting the political transition and reconstruction."
"We all have valuable expertise and experience of democracy-building to share."
"The Iraqi Government has expressed its appreciation for the significant contribution of the EU and it has asked for more."
"We should not let Iraq down."
". Mr President, it is true that the European Union has been divided over Iraq in the past, but it is also true that we are now united in building a new Iraq, and that is the most important thing now."
"We cannot continue looking backwards."
"We have to build a stable Iraq now and, although Mr Watson is correct in saying I emphasised the positive things we have been doing, it is also absolutely clear that the underlying situation is very difficult."
"That is why I said we cannot send to Iraq an election observation mission which otherwise I would have provided."
"It is too dangerous for our people and they would not be able to do their job properly."
"What would the alternative be?"
"In fact we have no alternative other than to try to work together."
"Of course, the challenge is absolutely enormous, and I consider that the Iraqi Government and its people have shown great courage in this."
"What my colleague has just said is true."
"The outcome of the election was quite encouraging and really astonishing under these difficult circumstances."
"This shows that the average Iraqi wants stability and peace, but there is also a minority, a very strong minority, which is of course extremist and radical, that is trying to undermine all the efforts made by the international community and the Iraqi Government."
"I did not mean to be one-sided and perhaps I could have made myself clearer."
"On the question of torture and recent events, we will have to see whether all the allegations are true."
"If they are, we must make it clear that human rights, just as Lord Bach has already said, are part of our very strong values and the ones we want to export to Iraq and to be taken into consideration there."
"I learned today that the Prime Minister of Iraq has already said he would himself set up a committee to investigate all instances of torture perpetrated by Iraqis themselves."
"We can contribute to that through EUJUST LEX and by building up a police corps that does not torture, but which knows what the limits are and tries to help restore order."
"We are therefore in this for the long run and will have to remain in Iraq for a long time in order to restore stability to that country."
"This is something that is also very important for the region as a whole."
"Indeed, I am working with regard to the whole region as part of the broader Middle East initiative, and we will cooperate with the Americans on this issue too."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the joint debate on the statements by the Council and the Commission on climate change, and the report (A6-0312/2005) by Mr Wijkman on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on Winning the Battle Against Global Climate Change (2005/2049(INI))."
". Mrs President, there is now almost universal acceptance that climate change is a serious and an urgent problem."
"The IPCC predicts that global temperatures may rise by as much as 5.8°C by the year 2100."
"According to one insurance company, the estimated economic costs of global warming could double to USD 150 billion each year in the next 10 years, hitting insurers with USD 30-40 billion worth of claims."
"There is good evidence that the 2003 European heatwave was influenced by global warming and that, as Members will recall, resulted in 26 000 premature deaths, as well as costing USD 13.5 billion."
"Those events and their associated price tags bring very close to home the reality of what unchecked climate change would mean for us."
"It is clear that the scale of a climate change problem is enormous and that it is pressing, and that is why the UK decided to make climate change a priority for our presidencies of both the G8 and the EU."
"2005 has been a critical year for international climate change policy."
"The Kyoto Protocol has entered into force."
"The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is up and running and we are due, at the end of the year, to begin discussions on further action beyond 2012, something to which I will return."
"The G8 represents only a small – albeit key – group of countries, but the progress we have made there will, I hope, have a major impact."
"The G8 summit discussions in July concluded with an ambitious communiqué."
"It included agreement from all members, including the United States, on the role of human activity in global warming and on the need for urgent action."
"There was also consensus on a package of actions to combat climate change through a diverse range of avenues: energy efficiency, cleaner power generation, research and development, financing of cleaner energy, managing the impacts of climate change, as well as combating illegal logging."
"The G8 countries have engaged with the World Bank and other development banks to improve the harnessing of funding for clean technology and, crucially, they also agreed to begin a new dialogue between the G8 and other countries with significant energy needs on climate change, clean energy and sustainable development."
"The first meeting of that dialogue took place in London on 1 November."
"Mexico has offered to host a second meeting next year."
"The Member States of the European Union were some of the first in the 1990s to recognise the dangers of global warming, the link to human activity and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"As long ago as 1991 the Commission issued the first Community strategy aimed at limiting CO2 emissions and improving energy efficiency."
"In the light of the EU’s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, it soon became clear that more needed to be done."
"So, in 2000 came the launch of the European climate change programme."
"Today the EU is taking the lead, for example in focusing on emissions from aviation, and we warmly welcome the Commission’s recent communication on reducing the climate change impacts of aviation."
"Its announcement of support for the inclusion of aviation emissions in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is highly encouraging and we look forward to fostering progress in that area as a priority for our Presidency of the European Union."
"Within Europe there is a clear recognition of the importance of energy efficiency in meeting the challenge posed by climate change and work is already under way to deliver energy efficiency savings throughout the Community."
"The energy services directive which we hope to agree by the end of the year is expected to provide a challenging first step, while the Commission’s Green Paper on energy efficiency published at the end of June should set the future blueprint for Europe’s energy efficiency strategy to 2020."
"But despite all this work and effort, it is clear that emissions in the EU are not being reduced as quickly as we want and that urgent action is needed in all sectors, at both national and EU level."
"So I applaud the Commission’s decision to launch a new phase of the European climate change programme to look at what more can be done."
"Alongside this, the Commission and Council are developing an EU medium- and long-term strategy for tackling climate change and will report on progress so far to the December European Council."
"Parliament’s input in this will be crucial, so the resolution that you have recently produced is an extremely valuable contribution to this process."
"The UK Presidency has set out to create a fresh momentum in the wider international process in which the EU plays such a crucial role."
"That is why we put climate change on the agenda of our EU summits with China and India."
"These two countries are particularly important partners for the EU in tackling climate change."
"Both summits included useful bilateral discussions on energy security and efficiency."
"A key element of the partnership with China is a new initiative on near-zero emissions for coal, with carbon capture and storage, to address the vital challenge of tackling the increasing greenhouse gas emissions from coal."
"We also agreed a new partnership with India."
"The EU-Russia summit too was an excellent chance to consider what experiences we can share with regard to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, to ensure its mechanisms are up and running as soon as possible."
"In September, for the first time, Ministers from the Agriculture Council met Environment Ministers to discuss the impacts of climate change on agriculture in the EU."
"We also put climate change on the agenda of the Energy, Transport and Competitiveness Councils."
"All this activity is leading to the first meeting in December of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol in Montreal, where, under the Protocol, parties will begin discussions on the next period after 2012."
"Let me make it quite clear that the EU and the UK remain absolutely committed both to the Kyoto Protocol itself and to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change."
"As our Prime Minister Tony Blair said this week at the Lord Mayor’s banquet in London, the world needs a framework with the necessary targets, sensitively and intelligently applied over the right timeframe, that takes us beyond 2012."
"Perhaps I could ask colleagues to take particular note of the use of the word ‘targets’, because the UK has repeatedly stated that formal agreements with targets are absolutely essential in any international climate change regime, not least because they give incentive and certainty to the business community."
"The informal G8 process is also hugely important, but it is complementary."
"It is not, and was never intended to be, a substitute for the Kyoto Protocol or for the United Nations Convention."
"I hope the work we have done this year through both presidencies will in fact be built on at Montreal."
"Montreal will primarily be the celebration of a massive achievement: the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol."
"There were times when it looked as though that might never happen, but the EU continued doggedly to work for such an outcome, and now here we are, with the world’s only credible, binding international agreement on controlling greenhouse gas emissions."
"The EU set out our negotiating position for Montreal at the October Environment Council."
"First, we want to agree the Marrakesh Accords – the decisions that will form the rulebook of the Protocol."
"Secondly, we want to agree a compliance mechanism to ensure that parties to the Protocol keep to its rules."
"Thirdly, we want to seek to improve the way the Kyoto mechanisms – and here I am talking mainly about the clean development mechanism – work."
"Emissions trading, the CDM and joint implementation are all crucial elements to the Protocol and will remain essential in the years to come."
"Finally, the Montreal Conference will look to the future and begin to discuss what happens when the first Kyoto commitment period ends in 2012."
"This last issue is likely to be by far the most delicate, as well as the most important, element."
"There is no question but that we want to build on the Kyoto Protocol post-2012 and that we have to launch a discussion under Article 3(9) of that Protocol to consider future commitments of the EU along with other Kyoto parties."
"However, it is also quite clear that for a global climate change regime to be truly effective, we need broader participation than the Protocol currently offers."
"At Montreal we will be looking for pathways towards a framework post-2012 which builds on and learns from the Kyoto Protocol as it stands and can include as many countries as possible."
"The EU will clearly have to back our political ambition for the Montreal Conference of the Parties with real evidence that we are taking a lead in tackling climate change."
"The Kyoto Protocol also stipulates that, by the end of 2005, parties must demonstrate their progress in meeting their Kyoto commitments."
"This will be the ideal time for the EU to reaffirm our commitment to Kyoto, to meeting our emission reduction targets and to our obligations to assist developing countries."
"In preparing for the conference, we are assembling data, facts and figures to show the practical application of our political commitment."
"We know that we need to do more and we all stand ready to do more."
"Today’s debate here in Strasbourg will allow us to take stock of the current situation and offer us a further opportunity to demonstrate to the rest of the world that the EU takes this problem very seriously and is committed to delivering results."
"Together we have already achieved a great deal; we have shown leadership and made a real difference."
"We need to continue to do that and not falter as the environmental stakes get higher."
"We will not see a resolution to the problem at Montreal, nor under the current UK Presidency of the EU."
"We need future presidencies – both of the EU and of the G8 – to carry on this work, keeping climate change high on their agendas and tackling the major threats it poses to our economies, our society and our environment."
"There are encouraging signs that the next G8 presidencies – Russia and Japan – fully intend to do so and I have every confidence in the EU’s continued determination to tackle this vital issue."
". Madam President, I am particularly pleased to be given the opportunity to debate with you the recent developments surrounding climate change and the way in which the relevant policy of the European Union will be strengthened and the active involvement of all partners in productive international cooperation in this field will be achieved."
"Today's debate is particularly important in the run-up to the forthcoming meeting of the parties in Montreal, which will be marked by the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol and discussions about the system to combat climate change after 2012."
"We have all been worried by the recent succession of disasters."
"We had a serious drought on the Iberian Peninsular this summer, we had floods during the summer in central Europe, we had a series of hurricanes – Katrina, Rita, Wilma – and other smaller-scale disasters."
"2005 has already achieved an unprecedented record, in that 2005 was the year with the highest number of named tropical cyclones since records began."
"Although specific weather phenomena cannot be connected directly to climate change, the increase in the phenomena of droughts and floods and the more serious and more frequent hurricanes or tropical storms nonetheless confirm scientific warnings about climate change."
"The earth has probably never in its history heated up as quickly as it has over the last 30 years."
"The 1990s were the hottest decade and nine of the ten hottest years in history fell between 1995 and 2004, with the hottest in 1998."
"Scientists are expressing fears that 2005 may ultimately be the hottest year in history."
"As we all know, when the planet heats up, the sea also heats up and when the temperature of the sea exceeds 26°C, then a tropical cyclone is likely to develop."
"The temperature at the surface of the sea has increased at global level over the last 100 years to 0.6%, which means that we shall probably have much more frequent and stronger cyclones in future."
"Nonetheless, rather than determining the extent to which hurricane Katrina or other weather phenomena were caused by human activity, it is more important that we draw lessons from these weather phenomena, so that we can win the battle against climate change."
"I should like to refer in particular to Parliament's motion for a resolution on the communication entitled 'Winning the battle against global climate change' and I should like to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman, and the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Development and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their valuable and specific proposals."
"The motion for a resolution emphasises that the Community strategy for restricting climate change must be based on an approach which includes the following: building on key elements of the Kyoto Protocol, strong reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in the European Union, the participation of all the main countries, such as the United States, the development of a strategic partnership with developing countries of crucial importance, vigorously promoting research and innovation and improving energy efficiency in the European Union."
"I agree with and support this approach; the initiatives taken by the Commission this year in the field of climate change mostly go hand in hand with Parliament's proposal."
"Allow me to make a brief general remark: in October, the Commission marked the beginning of a new era in the European programme on climate change at a major conference in Brussels which was attended by the main actors in the sector."
"The new European programme on climate change will be a new framework for the policy which we exercise on climate change beyond 2012."
"We address a series of new issues, such as aviation, and we also turn our attention to new technologies, such as carbon capture, which offer opportunities for taking financially efficient measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases."
"As a first step, the Commission is setting up certain working parties."
"They include the working party which will review the progress made to date in implementing policies on climate change, the working party which will investigate carbon capture and storage in geological formations as a means of moderating climate change, the working party which will evaluate the integration of aviation into the Community greenhouse gas trading scheme, the working party which will prepare the review of the Community strategy on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from light commercial vehicles and the working party which will determine the necessary political adjustments which the European Union needs to follow."
"Each of these working parties will determine specific new fields in which the European Union can step up its action to combat climate change."
"The first of these working parties is expected to start submitting its final reports during the first half of next year."
"As Mrs Beckett said, the Commission has also adopted a Green Paper on energy efficiency."
"Similarly, I should like to refer to the Commission communication entitled 'Reducing the climate change impact of aviation'."
"Aviation is making an increased contribution to emissions of greenhouse gases."
"The Communication arrives at the conclusion that, in order to reduce these emissions, the best way is to integrate the aviation sector into the Community emissions trading scheme."
"Following consultations with the interested parties, the Commission intends to submit the relevant legislative proposal by the end of 2006."
"Of course, the Commission's initiatives are not confined solely to developing action within the European Union."
"We take an active part in discussions with third countries and seek their opinion on the next steps which need to be taken during future negotiations on climate and on the creation of new structures to strengthen our political dialogue and technological cooperation."
"Climate change and, in particular, its connections with energy and the secure supply of energy, are included in the priorities of our bilateral and multilateral contacts."
"In this sector, we are cooperating closely with the British Presidency which, as Mrs Beckett said earlier, has placed climate change very high on the agenda for the G8 summit in Gleneagles and has constantly placed the issue of climate change on its list of priorities."
"The results are encouraging."
"The agreement on the partnership between the European Union and China on climate change and energy provides the political framework for closer cooperation and dialogue on these issues."
"The main objective of the EU-China partnership is to develop advanced, almost zero-emission, carbon technology based on carbon capture and storage in biological formations."
"Its other objectives are to promote other clean energy sources and energy efficiency, energy savings and renewable sources of energy."
"The EU-India initiative on clean development and climate change makes provision for various initiatives in order to develop dialogue."
"It emphasises cooperation on the development and evaluation of clean technologies, on the necessary adjustments to the heating of the planet and on the clean development mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol."
"The UN Climate Change Conference will start in Montreal in Canada at the end of the month and will last two weeks."
"The Commission has participated actively in a series of unofficial meetings to prepare for the Montreal conference."
"Our activities, both in the European Union and on the international stage, have played a serious role in shaping the conditions for the success of this conference."
"What are our objectives in Montreal?"
"Firstly, the conference will mark the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, with the adoption of the rules and procedures required for its application."
"Within this framework, it is important for us to demonstrate that the European Union is responding to its commitments."
"Secondly, the intensive dialogue held over recent months has created important momentum, so that at the Montreal conference the debate will start at international level on the shape of the future international climate change strategy."
"However, the achievement of the above objectives is not a foregone conclusion."
"A small number of countries, headed by the United States, continue to be unwilling to participate in the dialogue on the future global strategy relating to climate change."
"We shall need to step up our efforts over coming weeks, so that these countries also cooperate in starting the dialogue."
"It is also important for us to realise that the Montreal conference will not be the end of the procedure; it will mark the beginning of the dialogue but it will not provide the solution."
"The solution will only be found through an intensive international debate over coming years."
"Through this dialogue, we need to find the solutions that will respond to the basic elements of the future climate strategy, as determined in the Commission's communication earlier this year."
"These elements are reflected in Parliament's motion for a resolution: broader participation, coverage of all sectors and all gases, strengthening the development and use of new technologies, using means based on market mechanisms and finally, policies to adjust to the consequences of the increase in the heating of the planet."
"To close, if there is to be a positive outcome from the dialogue, there must continue to be active political interest in the issue of climate change and the leading role of the European Union must be strengthened."
"We need to demonstrate that we can reduce our emissions and that this contributes towards our economic development."
"The motion for a resolution sends out a clear message that, in meeting this challenge, the Commission can always count on the support of the European Parliament."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to convey my special thanks to Mrs Beckett, who was present in this Chamber today."
"Climate change is one of the most serious threats we face."
"I wish to emphasise that it can no longer be seen as an environmental problem."
"A warmer climate is a less stable climate, entailing a threat to just about every sector of our society, a threat that must be designated as one of our security problems."
"It is a security threat not only to the EU and its Member States but also, of course, to many poor countries in the tropics."
"At the same time as saying that, I wish to emphasise that it is important not to see the climate issue merely as a problem and a burden."
"If we do the right things, we can reduce the risks for society in the future."
"If we do the right things, we can also open up opportunities for companies and technology in a range of areas."
"The world boasts an association known as the Climate Group. This includes a number of large companies, which show that it is possible both to reduce emissions and to earn a lot of money in a relatively short period."
"I believe that the necessary transformation of energy and transport systems in our part of the world should become an important lever in the Lisbon Process and should be able to create some impetus for creating new jobs and export opportunities."
"Parliament’s report offers a list of proposed measures for the strategy after 2012."
"We think that the EU should continue to play a leading role in climate change work at an international level."
"Mrs Beckett has just confirmed in her speech that this is a view shared within the Council."
"We must do more in the short term so that we really do comply with the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol."
"We are, however, at present responsible only for a portion of emissions, amounting to approximately 14%."
"We must, then, involve other actors."
"It is a matter of great urgency that, in the long run, we involve the United States in constructive cooperation."
"We must establish long-term goals."
"What we demand, and want to see, are reductions of 30% by 2020 and of 60% to 80% by 2050."
"This is also a demand constantly heard from the business world, which says that it needs long-term ground rules."
"The situation of the developing countries is, of course, incredibly important."
"For them, energy is first and foremost a question of growth and development, but they need not repeat our mistakes."
"We require strategic partnerships, especially with the large developing countries, in order to provide a stimulus for technological leaps forward and for investment in the best possible technology."
"What has been introduced in this area through the Commission’s agreement with China is, of course, extremely constructive, but it must take place on a larger scale and become very much more significant."
"It should be borne in mind that, every month, China puts two new coal-fired power stations into operation."
"We must invest more in research and development."
"It is now a fact that governments throughout the world invest less in energy research as a proportion of GDP than they did 30 years ago."
"That is quite incomprehensible to me."
"I often compare this state of affairs with that which applied in relation to the Apollo project."
"If the Americans were able to put a human being on the moon within ten years, we should, by means of huge efforts in the fields of research and development, be able to do something similar in terms of a breakthrough in new technologies."
"In order to become politically credible, we must take vigorous measures at home."
"We must give impetus to energy saving, something that has already been emphasised on several occasions."
"This means that, for example, the Buildings Directive should be extended and made more ambitious."
"The transport area is a very critical one."
"We welcome the fact that shipping and aviation are to be included in climate policy."
"We recommend rapid measures designed to make railway transport more efficient."
"We think that we must draw the right conclusions from the difficulties in reducing road traffic emissions."
"We need, and therefore propose, ambitious and binding rules governing carbon dioxide emissions from new vehicles."
"We need to help put new technologies – which do exist – on the market."
"There are, however, a great many obstacles."
"One of these is, of course, the fact that we continue to subsidise conventional technology, that is to say technology powered by fossil fuels."
"We need to develop emissions trading, but we must of course ensure that the allowance is not as ambitious as it was last year."
"Instead, we must lower the ceiling step by step."
"We must invite other actors to participate in this process so that we in Europe do not become the only market."
"The majority of the measures proposed in the report are aimed at companies and manufacturers."
"We also think there needs to be more active involvement on the part of our citizens."
"The life-styles of all of us affect developments."
"We have an idea about, in the long run, considering some form of emissions trading at the level of the individual."
"Perhaps that is impossible to implement in practice, but a first step should be to increase knowledge both of the carbon content of everything we buy and of the carbon emitted by our forms of transport."
"We in Parliament and in the European institutions should naturally practise what we preach."
"We should ensure that, for example, our buildings and forms of transport go as easy on carbon as possible."
"There is a lot to do in this area."
"In conclusion, I want to wish both the Commission and the Council good luck in Montreal."
"You must ensure that the EU can continue to play a leading role and you must propel international work on climate change in the direction of achieving positive results."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Development, I should like to begin by congratulating our fellow Member, Mr Wijkman, on his excellent report on climate change."
"As draftsman of this committee, I should like to make a few brief remarks of a general nature."
"Our fellow Member is right to emphasise that, although global warming represents an environmental challenge, it is above all a challenge for development."
"In actual fact, climate change is, in our opinion, a real concern for civilisation."
"That is why our committee was keen to highlight that the combined effects of climate change, of worldwide demographic changes and of economic globalisation open the doors to an unprecedented period of instability in the history of humankind."
"There are indeed grounds for fearing that, in this context, global warming will increase the divide between the developed world and countries whose development is lagging behind."
"There is, unfortunately, no doubt that these countries will be affected most by the impacts of climate change."
"This is particularly the case as regards the small island states, which are vulnerable in more ways than one, above all in the face of hurricanes and of rising sea levels."
"That is why we believe that providing aid to enable these countries to adapt in the face of the impacts of climate change must be one of the priorities of the European Union’s development aid policy."
"We recommend that the European Union develop a specific cooperation policy for developing countries."
"You will have realised that, as far as the Committee on Development is concerned, the fight against climate change is therefore irrevocably tied to the fight against poverty and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"The report is also right to emphasise the mitigation efforts that still need to be made in order to achieve the Kyoto Protocol’s objectives."
"Just one question to conclude, Madam President: while, today, 20% of the planet’s population consumes 80% of the world’s energy, how polluted will the atmosphere be in around 2050 at a time when the energy requirements of between nine and ten billion people will have to be met?"
". Madam President, it is clear that climate change is so intense and so close to us that it is no longer an intellectual problem or a problem affecting certain more sensitive groups which had raised the issue."
"This is an opportunity to change our habits and customs, it is an opportunity to reduce emissions and to create cleaner air, it is an opportunity to develop renewable and alternative energy sources and it is also an opportunity for Europe to look at its dependence on fossil fuels, often in areas with great political instability and subject to dramatic price fluctuations."
"I therefore believe that it also opens up the opportunity to look again at nuclear energy as one of the many solutions, in addition to other alternatives."
"We must still greatly improve research into and knowledge of the causes of climate change."
"For example, very little research has been done on the relationship between agriculture and climate change."
"Recent research has raised an alarm and opened up another direction; we are only blaming industry for the problem."
"I believe that we should create an intelligent form of agriculture which is geared towards those strategies; that would be much safer from a scientific point of view."
"Furthermore, I believe that we must also make improvements in relation to quotas, the mathematical models for setting quotas; there are still many countries that are not doing so correctly, while others have found good solutions, such as the British."
"I also believe that we must seek strategies for compensating for climate change and determining the extent to which it can be alleviated."
"I believe that we must review our policy on drought and desertification in the Mediterranean and deal with the suffering and deterioration of the eco-system and of our animal resources and fauna."
". Madam President, we have seen the faces of the victims of the New Orleans hurricane and flood."
"Global warming does not mean actual warming in every single part of the world."
"It means a growing number of disasters, for instance weather irregularities, huge losses of lives and valuables."
"We simply use too much fossil energy."
"If the developing nations, including almost three billion people in China and India, follow the American way of consumption then we will burn up our planet."
"That is why on behalf of the Socialist Group I welcome Mr Wijkman’s brave report."
"Nice words are not enough, however."
"We have to urge our partners to ratify the Kyoto Protocol."
"We have to find allies for this goal among broadminded politicians and citizens in the US who understand the importance of sustainable development."
"In order to reduce emissions we need a strong shift to public transport."
"Rail is five times more efficient than road transport."
"Furthermore, it is environmentally friendly."
"But the European Union still lacks the proper tools to encourage it."
"The EU does not have any projects to improve urban public transport, and the growing number of cars in our cities means that urban life is becoming more and more chaotic and unhealthy."
"Our urban population deserves more care from us as politicians as regards clean air and good public transport."
"Renewable energies are developing in some countries, but in other Member States only a few steps have been taken."
"We need binding targets if not for 2010 then at least for 2020."
"There is one point on which I would contradict Mrs Beckett."
"I think that semi-solutions such as carbon storage cannot be a solution for the future."
"Instead of hiding our growing emissions temporarily, we have to reduce them."
"If a nuclear power station is to be closed down for any reason it should be replaced only by renewable energies."
"Closing nuclear power stations and using more fossil energy would be a kind of collective suicide."
". Madam President, I should like to thank the Commission and Council for their statements."
"I have to say though that I do not share Mrs Beckett’s upbeat assessment of how the European Union is doing, despite the British Government’s pledge to make climate change a priority for its Presidency."
"Progress on the ground has been very disappointing."
"Hearing the G8 communiqué on climate change being called ambitious stretches the English language almost to breaking point."
"If the British Presidency is genuinely going to show international leadership on this subject, then it has to get its own house in order first."
"Earlier this year, we commissioned a report from the Association for the Conservation of Energy to assess how well this government has been implementing existing European laws on reducing fossil-fuel use."
"Their findings made clear that this is a government which has delayed implementation of the directive on the energy performance of buildings, demanded an increase in the UK’s level of CO2 emissions permitted under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, failed to set binding targets for energy-demand reduction under the energy services directive, and failed to promote small-scale combined heat and power plants in line with the cogeneration directive."
"This is why the Council should take particular notice of the European Parliament’s report on climate change, which has been expertly drafted by Anders Wijkman."
"There they will find a genuinely bold and ambitious call to action."
"In particular, the report demands strong emission reductions at home, starting with 20% to 30% domestic reductions in the EU by 2020, increasing to between 60% and 80% by 2050."
"It calls for the goal to make Europe the most energy-efficient economy in the world by setting targets for annual reduction in energy of the order of 2.5% to 3% and for a robust strategy for Montreal."
"And, in our amendment, the Greens are calling on the EU to ensure a formal mandate and timetable for negotiating future climate commitments with a time limit for achieving agreement at the end of 2008."
"I want to end with two quick questions for the Council."
"First, what is its view on contraction and convergence as a framework for future action?"
"Second, alongside the inclusion of aviation in the emissions trading scheme, will the Council propose instruments in parallel to tackle the full climate impact of aviation since, as we know, the Emissions Trading Scheme will not cover emissions that are not CO2 related?"
"."
"Madam President, to cut straight to the point, a free market system is not the best solution to the problem of climate change."
"An unbridled free-market economy without any restrictions to excess consumption and products leads to the increasing emission of greenhouse gases and thus exacerbates the problem."
"Economic growth is like a sacred cow: it is sacrosanct, with each and every consumer product required to be available on the market across the world at the same time."
"We have to remember, though, that sacred cows can also spread harmful gases, and that is not just metaphorically the case, but also literally true, if one considers the proportion of intensive cattle farming in the level of CO2 emissions."
"The nuclear energy lobby has seized the issue of climate change to put itself back on the map."
"Strangely, they do not breathe a word about the enormous waste mountains they create for us and which will present us with major problems for the next ten thousand years."
"We should not attempt to solve one environmental crisis by creating another."
"The billions that are still being pumped into the development and promotion of nuclear energy could be spent more wisely on wind, solar and hydraulic energy."
"Emission levels in the transport sector will, in 2030, still be 28% above the 1990 level."
"Its symbolic value for an international free market economy makes it a difficult sector in which to take measures, and so I would call for taxes on air and maritime transport."
"In contrast to the trade in emission rights, we cannot, by means of taxation, pass the problem to developing countries."
". Madam President, I am impressed with the work schedule presented in this House yesterday by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso."
"It contains many valid points with regard to beating climate change too."
"For example, I warmly support the inclusion of air traffic within the scope of the emission trade system, as well as the revision of the Directive on national emission ceilings, which dates back to 2001."
"Even so, the Commission has not, to my mind, been very ambitious in this respect."
"For years, we have been discussing drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, but emission levels are still increasing year after year, not only worldwide, but also within the various Member States."
"If we want to be taken seriously in Montreal, we should not only dare mention reductions, but also commit to really taking measures this time. If necessary, we should involve a smaller number of countries."
"I urge Commissioner Dimas to present a strategy that contains measures which can help us achieve our long-term goal, for despite the positive effect the proposals that have been presented here this week have had, it is only short-term vision that inspires them."
". Madam President, a decade ago there was much speculation about climate change, but today it is very much a reality as we see the future unfolding before our eyes."
"The Arctic people see it in disappearing Arctic ice; the shantytown dwellers of Latin America and southern Asia see it in lethal storms and floods; Europeans see it in disappearing glaciers, forest fires and fatal heatwaves."
"In Brazil this year, for example, while hurricanes thousands of miles away battered the United States and the Caribbean with water and wind, residents of a small fishing town deep in the Amazon region watched the lake on which they depend for food and transportation shrivel away in a year which saw the region’s worst drought in four decades: the result of warmer ocean water, which has also been blamed for one of the most violent hurricane seasons on record in the Gulf of Mexico."
"The signing of the ratification protocol for Kyoto by some of the major players has been a much-welcomed event."
"The Kyoto Protocol is off life support because the Russian Federation ratified it."
"However, major players now need to be more proactive in convincing countries with the highest levels of pollution: the United States and developing countries."
"I remain deeply concerned that the United States continues to choose to tackle the climate change issue through unilateral activities."
"Climate change needs to be dealt with as a global problem."
"If carbon dioxide is not reduced, the Arctic ice cover will disappear."
"That will affect the quality of life in particular of those living in coastal regions and island communities."
"That is a scientific fact, not a passionate policy comment on my part."
"Ireland is much more energy efficient than it was a decade ago."
"I encourage other Member States to follow suit."
"Tackling climate change was never labelled as being easy, but complacency in dealing with it is far worse."
"What is a fact, and what surprises many people, is that because of the level of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere, we are already committed to a significant amount of global warming and rising sea levels."
"If we became a perfect pupil now in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, we would still suffer from past pollution, but the longer we wait to tackle greenhouse gas emissions in a serious manner, the more entrenched the commitment is."
"Temperature rises have already been noted."
"The half-a-degree temperature rise is similar to that observed at the end to the twentieth century."
"However, what is more alarming is the projected sea-level rise, which is more than twice the three-inch rise that occurred during the latter part of the previous century."
"Those numbers do not take into account the fresh water from melting ice sheets and glaciers, which could at least double the sea-level rise caused by thermal expansion alone."
"Scientists have claimed that water temperatures in the North Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico have been as much as 3.6 degrees higher than normal this year."
"That has helped to feed the hurricanes that have devastated the US Gulf coast and the Caribbean."
"It has also helped to generate the warmer-than-normal air currents that have poured into the Amazon basin and prevented rain clouds from forming."
"Greenpeace has warned that this year’s experience could be a sign of things to come if practices such as deforestation and emissions of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere do not stop."
"By tackling climate change in a serious manner, we not only help to preserve our planet for our grandchildren and future generations, but we would also save them and ourselves monetary cost, given that the climate change costs incurred as we aim to protect disappearing species and habitats are very high."
"Evolving players such as South Asia, Latin America and Africa require emission reduction policies that will not harm their economic development."
"Climate change policies thus need to be designed to contribute to economic growth in the developing countries."
"As I travel to Montreal next month as part of the European delegation, I look forward to seeing the global players face the reality of this year and work together as partners in tackling this extremely important global problem."
"Europe was among the first regions in the world to record the climatic changes that are the consequence of dangerous global climatic shifts."
"Summers have become warmer, winters have become rainy, river flows have dwindled, soil humidity has diminished and we have recorded more floods, as well as extreme droughts and hurricanes."
"There is no doubt that these changes spring directly from human activity, mainly in the developed countries that are mostly responsible for high emissions of greenhouse gases."
"The largest polluters include the European Union."
"Each year, disasters cause significant economic loss, loss of life and an increased incidence of the many diseases linked to environmental pollution."
"Joint action by the biggest polluters – China, the United States, the European Union and India – in the fight against climatic changes is essential."
"It is unrealistic to expect that mankind will give up the conveniences of modern life such as automobiles and other means of transport, in favour of bicycles."
"What we need is therefore innovation in respect of existing technologies and the development of more environmentally friendly sources of power."
"It is necessary to use more solar, water and wind power, and to boost research into these new forms of energy."
"In Europe, we are witnessing the exodus of our young scientists to the United States, because Europe does not offer them adequate resources for carrying out effective research to a high standard in this area."
"In addition, there are some fields of research that are not even covered in Europe."
"Climatic change will have an impact on the health of Europeans."
"As a result of climatic changes, Europe will be exposed to diseases that are not indigenous to this continent, being more typical of geographical zones lying further to the south."
"Global warming may increase the incidence of infectious diseases transmitted by arthropods, such as mosquitoes spreading malaria or certain viral inflammations of the brain."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by making the observation that the Council Presidency left us waiting some 10 to 15 minutes for the beginning of this debate."
"I would welcome at least an explanation and an apology; perhaps we will get one."
"I wish to express my gratitude to Mr Wijkman for his dedication and hard work."
"His was no easy task, and it is surely no secret that there have been debates within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, although we have been able to satisfactorily resolve these issues."
"The report we have in front of us is a good one, and there is one particular aspect of it that I would like to highlight."
"In Germany, there has been since Monday an agreement on a new Great Coalition, aspects of which agreement have come in for justified criticism: there are some compromises that not everyone can go along with."
"The chapters on the environment, energy and climate change are, however, perfectly respectable, and I believe that they will enable Europe, too, to make progress."
"Much in the coalition agreement is identical with what the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has proposed in the Wijkman report, and that is an encouragement to the Commission to redouble its commitment to pursuing its objectives in such areas as air travel."
"Where renewable energies are concerned, we – not only in the German Great Coalition but also in the amendments we have tabled to the Wijkman report – want a new priority to be given to heating, an area in which, for little expense, we can save a great deal of CO2, and it is for that reason that the Commission wanted to table a proposal for a directive on the subject."
"There is, I think, one issue that neither the Great Coalition in Germany nor the Environment Committee have satisfactorily resolved, and that is nuclear energy."
"I agree with Mrs Gutiérrez that nuclear energy is indispensable if we are to solve the climate problem."
"I would, nevertheless, like to see the report gain a large and convincing majority, and let me conclude by emphasising what Mr Wijkman said about there being a security problem as well."
"According to one study by the Pentagon, climate change will, in the long term, represent a greater danger to the human race than international terrorism. That should make it clear to one and all, that now is the time for action."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to thank Mr Wijkman for his excellent and hard-hitting report."
"I would also like to congratulate Mrs Beckett on her commitment to climate policy."
"Today, this House is once again calling for an ambitious climate policy and Commissioner Dimas has explained why it has every reason to do so."
"In Montreal, we have to lay the foundations for a new climate policy."
"We are faced with the enormous challenge of providing clean energy and cleaner transport, whilst at the same time reducing energy consumption."
"So far, Europe has played a leading role, which has really paid off."
"We certainly have something to celebrate in Montreal."
"Europe’s key task is now to ensure that the largest CO2 emitter, the United States, will also accept obligations and that the involvement of such countries as China and India in the entire process will be honest."
"That can only be done if the EU addresses the problems itself and demonstrates that the European economy will, in fact, be given an enormous shot in the arm by innovation, by being more energy efficient, by more efficient production and by bringing sustainable products onto the market."
"Unfortunately, though, except for Great Britain, most countries do not meet the obligations themselves and sadly, the cleanest and most economical cars do not originate in Europe but in Japan."
"We need to do better and do more!"
"That is only possible if we involve the public in climate policy."
"Mr President, I heartily endorse the comments of my group colleague, Dr Lucas, on the UK Government’s fairly patchy record on seriously tackling climate change."
"However, if the Council is looking for some ambition, then it could do worse than to carefully examine and adopt Mr Wijkman’s report."
"The fact is that we need a step change in the way we debate climate change, particularly among the public."
"We must start with our own actions, because those are the actions we can control best."
"We need to realise that if we embrace the challenge, we can profit by our own example."
"Renewable energy is the key plank of the solution."
"My own country, Scotland, could lead the world in clean, green renewable energy."
"We have waves, a long coastline, windswept hills, biomass and geothermal power, and the raw material for hydroelectric power falls from the sky on a regular basis, and yet we are not nearly investing sufficiently in renewable technologies in Scotland or in Europe."
"In the case of Scotland, this is because the United Kingdom controls energy policy and remains wedded to a nuclear agenda, which I believe offers no long-term solution."
"We in this House can play our part in this step change on renewable energy and the debate on climate change, and we must unite around Mr Wijkman’s report."
"The Commission can play its part by prioritising renewable energy in the FP7 Programmes."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the greenhouse effect is the greatest problem that we have to face, because it involves a structural change in the conditions needed for life."
"Our ability to address this problem has to be an essential element in what we do."
"To that end, we must accept the Kyoto strategy and its implementation as overriding factors in all our decisions, as a legal basis and a basis for planning, and as a key factor in Europe’s internal and international policies from Montreal onwards."
"The main thrusts of the Kyoto Protocol, namely convergence and contraction, show that our development and economic models need to change radically and to be geared towards a fairer, more rational way of managing resources."
"I think we can achieve a figure of one tonne-of-oil equivalent per person."
"Such a commitment should encourage us to save energy and to use alternative, renewable, democratically managed sources."
"Any idea of resorting to nuclear energy – which is a finite and extremely hazardous source that entails unsolvable problems such as nuclear waste, and is not democratic – to meet this target and this need would be utterly unacceptable."
"Mr President, I find it hard to lend my approval to a report which contains so few constructive suggestions regarding practical steps that can be taken to prevent climate change, and which also includes no financial analysis."
"In addition, the Millennium Development Goals and compliance with the recommendations contained in the Kyoto Protocol are insufficient on their own."
"The latter commits individual governments and companies to a policy of implementing programmes aimed at reducing greenhouse gases and at putting in place emissions trading systems and energy saving regulations."
"The main responsibility for environmental destruction lies with the industrialised countries."
"The liberal lifestyles they enjoy and the consumer behaviour they promote lie at the root of this disaster, which has unimaginable consequences for health and for the future of the earth in general."
"Above and beyond the measures to which previous speakers have already referred, equal importance should therefore be attached to changing people’s mindsets and to ensuring that they develop as individuals."
"This has rightly been described as the move towards a culture of satisfaction, and it reverses the trend towards possession at any price and the unchecked accumulation of goods."
"Mr President, although global warming today appears to be an obvious fact, it is still a good idea to verify the analyses that attribute it almost exclusively to greenhouse gases, something that certain scientists dispute on the grounds that there might be other causes."
"That being said, if it is proven that greenhouse gases are almost exclusively the cause, environmentalists should ask themselves whether they might not have gone too far in their relentless fight against any form of nuclear power, which undoubtedly presents risks, but which does not emit any greenhouse gases."
"As the Wijkman report proposes, alternative energy sources must be encouraged, particularly solar and geothermal energy."
"Such heavy restrictions cannot, however, be imposed on European countries alone, when China, the United States and a good many other countries are hugely increasing their CO2 emissions."
"As for the storage of carbon dioxide, allow me to recommend a natural, efficient and beneficial method, namely reforestation, all the more so because systematic reforestation could be the subject of a wide-ranging international cooperation programme."
"Mr President, the debate is just about over and the scientific jury is largely agreed on the impact of greenhouse gases on our climate."
"Economic losses due to weather-related natural catastrophes have increased six-fold since the 1960s."
"The earth’s temperature is rising at an alarming rate."
"The EU 15 will not meet their current Kyoto targets on CO2 emissions reduction and nothing will be done about that."
"At the COP 11/MOP 1 meeting in Montreal next month, the focus will be on post-Kyoto and on what happens beyond 2012."
"Without genuine global cooperation, particularly from the world’s largest producer of greenhouse gases, the US, any agreement will be meaningless."
"It is a huge challenge."
"We await the Commission’s review of the operation of the emissions trading regime next June to keep the cynics and the ‘I told you so’s’ at bay and to maintain the credibility of the emissions trading scheme."
"It is essential that we broaden its scope and set horizontal sectoral targets."
"Too many sectors are excluded, which creates gaps and inefficiencies in the market, which risk pushing up the cost of doing business."
"We are still only paying lip service to the whole area of energy efficiency, which has an enormous contribution to make."
"We also need to focus on the development of substitute fuels and alternative technologies."
"Public transport vehicles and captive fleets should use clean and alternative fuels to provide a stimulus for the market, for the private sector, and to kick start the process of installing a network of forecourt outlets."
"We need excise regimes that favour bio-fuels and bio-flexi-fuels."
"Why not legislate for all motor fuels to include a blend of fuel from renewable sources, for example 5% bio-ethanol mix in petrol, 2% bio-diesel mix in diesel vehicles, without any alteration necessary to the vehicles?"
"We need some radical thinking and radical action."
"If we are convinced that CO2 emissions need to be reduced dramatically, then we have to stop tinkering at the margins of renewable energy and to achieve genuine liberalisation for electricity markets."
"Let us put our money where our mouth is, look at FP7 and invest in this area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Wijkman’s report deserves our full attention."
"This text must be considered as our road map to enable us to fight more effectively against climate change in the years to come."
"The paths laid out are realistic, so it is up to us to adhere to them as rigorously as possible by relying on all the partners involved in implementing the report, from the Member States to the people, and by changing our production and consumption methods."
"If there is, however, one crucial area in which we must have a far greater involvement by providing ourselves with financial resources equal to what is at stake, it is that of research policy, for there can be no new technologies or innovations without research."
"Our researchers’ grey matter constitutes a resource for the European Union that we must optimise in order to rise to the challenge of sustainable development and climate change, without overlooking, of course, our responsibility towards the poorest countries."
"Thus, in the future, we will need to have a research budget that is equal to our ambitions."
"Mr President, it was gratifying to hear Commissioner Dimas express his support at the Beijing International Energy Conference the other day for Parliament’s ambition of having 25% renewable energy by 2020, just as it was also gratifying to hear the Commissioner say that renewable energy is crucial to overcoming problems such as climate change and poverty and promoting general economic development."
"If we are to create a market for renewable energy, the costs of today’s unsustainable dependence on fossil-based energy sources must, however, be clearly shown."
"It is not just a question of showing the effects on the environment and public health of sky-high emission levels. Rather, the effects must also be expressed in terms of euros and cents."
"Europe has already introduced a market-governed system of emissions trading."
"Certainly, the part played by aviation in the system is the subject of discussion, but I also want to see marine transport and, above all, land-based traffic included."
"It will only be once we clearly see the costs entailed in carbon dioxide emissions from this sector that we shall seriously boost the demand for, and the supply of, renewable energy sources."
"My first question, then, is about whether – and, if so, when – the Commission intends to include the transport sector in European emission rights trading."
"My second question is about the proportion of renewable energy sources."
"We wish to increase these, but they do, of course, need also to be used."
"When does the Commission intend proposing that the Auto Oil Directive, as it is called, be replaced by a minimum 10% admixture of ethanol in vehicle fuel?"
"Mr Wijkman’s report makes it clear that living up to the Kyoto requirements is the first priority of the EU."
"Whilst Kyoto is only a small step in the fight against climate change, we must throw our support behind it and urge those who have not signed up to do so immediately."
"This morning I was glad to hear the Commission and the Council stress the importance of the next phase, because the real challenge is to set ambitious targets for the post-2012 period and to get all the major world actors involved."
"I also want to support the amendments made by my colleagues in the GUE/NGL Group, particularly the assertion that the promotion of an unbridled free market has led to excess consumption, which in turn leads to increased emissions of greenhouse gases."
"– Mr President, I wanted us to talk about a very serious issue."
"I wonder how many women this morning did not spray lacquer on their hair and which of us did not use an underarm spray."
"In this way, we are helping to create the greenhouse effect."
"They are simple things which even we overlook."
"You are labouring in vain in your efforts, Mr Dimas, if you do not bring the Americans into the rules."
"Let me quote you two statistics: the United States emits more pollutants than three-quarters of the members of the UN and the state of New York emits the same pollutants as the whole of Africa."
"Consequently, whatever we do in Europe, unless we persuade the usual wayward party, by which I mean the United States, to take its responsibility, we shall fail."
"This is a tragic truth."
"We also need to see what is going to be done by China, as the most highly populated country in the world which alone has one quarter of the world's population."
"Whatever we do in Europe, we will not achieve results."
"We have the huge problem of the climate, which knows no borders."
"We cannot put up barbed wire fences."
"So we need to convince the Americans if we want to avoid disastrous results."
"The course which is being traced with mathematical precision is that we shall suffer the same fate as the dinosaurs."
"We all need to understand that the threat from Bin Laden and terrorism is much smaller than the environmental threat hanging over the Americans."
"Consequently, if we want to achieve results, we need to bring the Americans into the rules."
"Mr President, Mr Dimas, Mrs Beckett, only a few years ago, when climate change was being discussed, some people would smile dubiously."
"Today, no one questions the obvious fact that these changes are taking place."
"There is even a sense of urgency."
"We must act immediately in order to respond to this threat, which is undoubtedly one of the most serious in the history of humankind, with a growing number of floods, droughts and hurricanes, a melting ice cap, our melting glaciers and perhaps, one day, the development of certain diseases."
"In the face of this threat, therefore, we have an unprecedented opportunity to launch a real technological programme, enabling us to foster the innovation that we desperately require in order to create new jobs in Europe."
"Europe and the world have held a great many debates, but acts are not enough."
"The time has therefore come to have the political courage to give new impetus to the Kyoto Protocol."
"Biofuels, solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric energy, hydrogen, energy efficiency efforts: these technologies exist."
"It is up to us to speed up their use in our urban planning policies and our construction methods."
"We need to make use of all the possibilities offered to us."
"There is no one ideal solution."
"Rather, we must combine the use of these different sources."
"There are still too many restrictions on the implementation and marketing of technological innovations such as hybrid and electric vehicles."
"Our fellow citizens are ready to assume their share of responsibility for this kind of energy control."
"The United States, India and China are already taking initiatives, particularly in the field of nuclear energy."
"It will be impossible for us to overlook nuclear energy, which does not emit any greenhouse gases."
"What is Europe waiting for, moreover, to really open the debate - a serious debate, devoid of passion - on nuclear energy?"
"I call on you not to hold it up."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to be credible in the eyes of Europeans, the European Union has to leave its good intentions to one side and act practically by providing itself with ambitions linked to investments."
"How much money will be allocated to road-rail transport?"
"When will we have trans-European networks, which we are still waiting for?"
"When will we have CAP appropriations for biofuels?"
"When will we see an increase in the research budgets designed to meet the great energy challenges, such as those relating to the hydrogen sector?"
"When will we see the Structural Funds and grants adjusted with a view to energy efficiency and energy saving?"
"I am thinking of the urban environment, housing and social housing."
"When will we see ecotaxes levied on the carriage of goods, particularly in relation to sea transport?"
"When will we see a regulation of trade from the perspective of the fight against the greenhouse effect?"
"We are waiting for practical and operational responses, laying the ground for immediate action."
"The European Union must act here and now in order to convince people, in order to serve as an example and in order to form new partnerships with the countries of the South."
"We are still only at the stage of intentions."
"Let us move on to actions."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Wijkman for a balanced report on an important issue."
"I should like to emphasise that it is at present difficult to see Europe achieving the Kyoto objectives, for they are very demanding and the policy now being conducted does not look as if it will lead to our being able to fulfil these objectives at the first stage."
"One reason for this is that the demands made by a modern environmental policy on energy policy are largely ignored."
"If we consider the conditions as they stand, we shall not be able to fulfil the Kyoto objectives in terms of expectations concerning renewable fuels."
"Such fuels will be developed and will play a larger role, but they will not solve the problems."
"We cannot achieve the Kyoto objectives by regulating the economy or making savings, because such measures would interfere with the aim of creating basic conditions for a better economy that does more to meet environmental requirements. We cannot solve the problems by causing the economy to grow more slowly."
"Instead, we must conduct an environmental policy compatible with a consistent and credible energy policy, in which case we must also look at the basis of our energy supply."
"Oil and gas are not the way of the future, yet we see how it is, above all, the use of oil and gas that increases when nuclear power is phased out, the consequence being growing carbon dioxide emissions."
"With the present energy mix, nuclear power production in Europe accounts for 50% of carbon dioxide emissions and leads to reduced carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to those from private cars."
"This shows the kind of figures we are talking about."
"That being the case, nuclear power cannot be dismissed."
"Nuclear power will not solve our environmental problems, but those problems cannot be solved and the Kyoto objectives achieved by ignoring nuclear power."
"It is therefore an important task for this Parliament and also for the Member States to conduct a credible energy policy not aimed at phasing out nuclear power and replacing it by oil and gas. Instead, we should ensure that nuclear power can play a significant role in the balanced energy policy that is needed."
"I would like to welcome Mr Anders Wijkman and others who share the belief that saving the planet is our own concern, not somebody else’s."
"The European Union must exercise all the influence it can to urge countries that still have not joined the Kyoto Protocol, even the most powerful ones, to do so."
"It would be naïve to claim that had the USA fulfilled the Kyoto Protocol requirements it would not have been devastated by the Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma."
"But Nature did strike back at precisely the state that harms it most."
"Unless the international community takes urgent and drastic measures to stop the further spread of global warming, our planet will turn into a hurricane bearing, fire and water- spitting monster."
"The present report rightly offers to make the EU an even more prominent leader in terms of the use of renewable energy sources."
"I also express my full support of the proposal with respect to increasing the awareness of EU citizens and involving them in environmental preservation."
"We need to devote further energy to the development of a tax, sanctioning and promotion system that would encourage companies to operate in an efficient and environmentally friendly way."
"Even more important is the lifestyle."
"Each citizen of the EU should realise that living with the least possible pollution and tampering with the climate of the planet is not only noble and beautiful, but also a worthwhile undertaking."
"Mr President, at the end of this month and the beginning of the next, the European Parliament will once again present its position on climate change at a UN conference."
"Before this position is submitted to the international community for debate, it is crucial to ensure that it reflects the best interests of all EU Member States."
"As Mrs Grossetête and Mr Hökmark rightly noted, the role of nuclear energy should also be given due consideration."
"Greenhouse gas emissions are still on the increase in many Member States."
"Individual citizens will therefore have to play a greater part in joint efforts to limit emissions and to find a more sustainable lifestyle if the UN Convention and the Kyoto Protocol are to be fully implemented."
"In this connection, an important aspect of the fight to reduce CO2 emissions is the integrated approach, which involves politicians, industry and society."
"Adopting this integrated approach would be a more effective and less expensive way of reducing CO2 emissions."
"It is based on the assumption that the responsibility for reducing emissions lies not only with car manufacturers and fuel suppliers, but also with vehicle users."
"Other factors that warrant our attention include road infrastructure conditions and road traffic management systems, as indicated in the European Climate Change Programme II launched in October 2005."
"Although the shift from a fossil fuel-based economy presents us with an historic business opportunity, it should not be forgotten that many countries with abundant renewable energy resources do not currently have the technologies needed to harness these latter."
"This is particularly true in the case of developing countries."
"The issue of energy subsidies is therefore very relevant to negotiations on reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
"Many methods have already been found to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"Energy-saving and low-emission technologies are an effective tool in the fight against environmental pollution, but they should not be combined with the reduction in fossil fuel subsidies proposed by the rapporteur as a for the use of modern environmental protection solutions."
"– Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, as a great Indian leader once said, the earth does not belong to us, we borrowed it from our children."
"If we lose the battle against climate change, what kind of earth are we going to leave our children?"
"The diagnosis has been made."
"All that is missing is the courage to put into practice more ambitious and effective policies."
"Mr Wijkman’s report is a step in the right direction."
"Actions speak louder than words and, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy, new technology must be adopted, and the international community must strive to honour the obligations of the Kyoto Convention."
"The United States must assume its responsibilities."
"I welcome EU dialogue with China and India, but it is also necessary to involve countries such as Brazil, South Africa, Russia, Japan and Indonesia and to remove contradictions such as fossil fuel subsidies."
"Mr Dimas said that the Montreal Conference will not produce all of the solutions we are looking for."
"Some solutions, however, are expected to come out of it."
"Our children and future generations expect nothing less."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Beckett, I am glad that the Council Presidency is following our debate, and, before I say anything else, I would like to thank my good friend Mr Wijkman for the very ambitious report that he has put together on this subject."
"The need for action is simply illustrated by the natural phenomena going on all around us, be it the fires raging through Southern Europe, the hurricanes in America or, indeed, the floods in the Austrian Tyrol, from which I come."
"There is one mistake, though, that we cannot allow ourselves: we must be careful not to attribute everything to worldwide climate change or to say that such change is caused only by man-made CO2 emissions and is in some sense our own fault."
"It is an unfortunate fact that effects occurring in nature are overlapping with those attributable to human agency; greater efforts must be made to research this area if it is to be possible in future to deliver reliable prognoses of climate development and, above all, to assess the effect of human activity."
"It is also important, though, that long-term strategies should be in place to enable us to respond, and in order to give us the security to plan ahead."
"It quite simply has to be brought home to business and industry where this road leads and what options will be available to them in the future. That is of immense importance for Europe as a business location."
"Let us also bear in mind the fact that the Community is currently responsible for only 14% of CO2 emissions, and so it is vitally important that not only the developing countries, but also, of course the USA – which is the principal source of emissions – should be brought on board."
"The point in the report that needs to be underlined several times over is the one that says: ‘we need a global strategy’."
"I have to say that I am not in agreement with my colleagues as regards nuclear energy, which I do not regard as an alternative to those technologies that produce CO2, since its long-term effects are too negative."
"Most of all, we must not offer it to the developing countries as an alternative, quite simply because it cannot be safely used in them."
"It is also important that we give more attention to transport and attempt in that area simply to make full use of the potential for CO2 reduction."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall use this opportunity to carry on where the previous speaker left off."
"I have to say, following my visit to the United Kingdom last week, that I find it very irritating that Tony Blair and others are steering the climate change debate towards the idea that climate protection targets might be achieved by the greater use of nuclear power, which would produce energy that is alleged to be cleaner."
"I would like to take this opportunity to disabuse you of a misconception, and to ask what you, in England, currently mean when you talk about cleaner nuclear energy."
"Are you talking about the extraction of uranium, which is a peculiarly filthy business?"
"Are you talking about fuel enrichment, which is particularly dirty?"
"Are you talking about the conversion of uranium hexafluoride, which is a very difficult process involving high levels of environmental pollution?"
"When you talk about clean atomic energy, do you mean the manufacture of fuel rods in Russia?"
"Have you, in England, ever discussed how much waste you will have to dispose of, and when and at what cost you will do that?"
"How do you assess the dangers and risks involved in reprocessing?"
"Windscale is an example of the great experience you have had with the real damage reprocessing does to the environment and to people."
"I am quite astonished that it is the British of all people, who in fact abandoned nuclear energy on economic grounds, who are pushing forward this crazy debate on ‘climate protection through increased use of nuclear energy’."
"Let us just consider the global picture: if we want to be really efficient in making a contribution through nuclear energy to protecting the climate, we will have to build hundreds, thousands more nuclear reactors."
"That would, in fact, involve the massive expansion of a new generation of fast breeders, which have already proved such a devastating failure in Europe."
"It would involve the operation of reprocessing facilities throughout the world, because the stocks of uranium available would be nowhere near sufficient for such an expansion of nuclear energy."
"To engage in such expansion at a time when we are debating terrorism and the risks of proliferation is irresponsible."
"Even though it is far more difficult to address the problems of energy by means of maximising energy efficiency, cutting back our use of it, or some other approach, let us now, at last, start doing so and keep on doing so, rather than returning to the use of a technology that is actually already consigned to the past century and the pollution and waste from which we have not yet even begun to get to grips with."
". Mr President, this has been an interesting and stimulating debate, marked by almost total welcome – quite correctly – for Mr Wijkman’s report and for its contents, and by very real agreement on the nature and scale of the challenge."
"It has also been marked by a strong emphasis from many speakers on renewable resources, with various examples of this being cited, and also by strong differences of opinion over nuclear power."
"I would say to the last speaker, Mrs Harms, that if the only aspect of the climate change debate she heard in the UK was that of nuclear power, then she must have moved in very restricted circles, because there is a great deal being discussed in the UK, which has not actually made a fresh commitment to nuclear power, despite a commitment to discussing it."
"In fact, energy efficiency is top of the UK’s list of policies for tackling climate change, just as she would wish."
"There has been much emphasis on what are usually known in the jargon as ‘co-benefits’."
"Some speakers emphasised the damage caused by air pollution by the same gases that are contributing to climate change, while others emphasised that, as we tackle climate change, we will derive other potential health benefits from the reduction in the use of those gases."
"Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines asked about the role of agriculture."
"As she may know, in countries such as New Zealand, livestock are the source of almost all greenhouse gas emissions, making this a particularly difficult problem to solve."
"There is therefore no doubt that agriculture can, in certain circumstances, be part of the problem."
"However, as a number of speakers mentioned with regard to biomass and biofuels, it also could also be part of the solution."
"That is an issue that will come under increasing scrutiny."
"I am sorry Mr Hegyi is opposed to carbon capture and storage."
"The sad and blunt fact is that countries like India and China, which need to grow and develop in order to tackle poverty – and this was another issue referred to, again quite correctly, in the debate – have huge coal reserves and will use them, because they feel they have no choice."
"It is surely better for us to try to find ways of helping them to do that sustainably, through technologies like carbon capture and storage, rather than simply telling them not to use those power sources, which I fear would be fruitless."
"All the references made to the most vulnerable states and to the most vulnerable within other countries heighten the need for the actions the EU must take on adaptation, and support for adaptation, to impacts that we cannot avoid."
"Strong emphasis has been placed on the role of the many other countries involved and on the need for a global dialogue – with which the Council wholeheartedly agrees – and there is clear agreement both that the EU should continue to take the lead internationally and that we should continue to place strong emphasis on delivering on our own programmes."
"Mrs Doyle and Mr Hökmark both suggested that the EU is unlikely to meet its Kyoto targets."
"That is not my understanding of the latest position as assessed by the Commission."
"However, that is a report that we will be publishing as we approach Montreal, and it certainly remains the case that we must continue to maintain and indeed step up our own activity."
"That brings me to the comments by both Mrs Lucas and Mr Smith, who quite rightly praised the ambition of the Wijkman report in setting a target of a 60% reduction in emissions by 2050, without apparently being aware that this is the target the UK Government set in its own Energy White Paper in 2003."
"Perhaps, though, this should come as no a surprise, since Mrs Lucas had nothing good to say about the UK’s approach."
"However, I must put it firmly on the record for her and on behalf of this Council that it is a waste of everybody’s time to demand that the EU deliver a formal mandate and a formal timetable in Montreal."
"This body above all should recognise that the world of imperialism is at an end."
"We cannot just march into Montreal and dictate to the rest of the world how they should conduct themselves and go about their business, not least when we are talking to some of the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the world whose priority, quite rightly, is development and feeding their populations."
"We will not act in this manner."
"If we are able to kindle a dialogue and spark a process in Montreal, it will be a real and substantial achievement, just as it was a real and substantial achievement to elicit the language and secure the programme of action agreed at Gleneagles."
"We all agree that we ought to be moving faster, but let us at least recognise the fact that we are making some progress."
". I should like to thank everyone who has participated in this rich and important debate."
"The need to act urgently to tackle climate change was underlined by Mr Wijkman and others."
"I believe that the action taken and the series of new initiatives put forward by the Commission since the adoption of its communication in February clearly demonstrate its determination to act in this area."
"The European Union's first priority in Montreal is to build broad international support for further action and obtain agreement on starting a formal process to discuss the shape of a future multilateral climate change regime."
"Once the discussions get going, the European Union will need to consider the right moment for putting forward its views on targets under such a future regime."
"Targets have proven to be a very useful tool in environmental policy making."
"They provide our guidance to decision-makers in society."
"They are particularly useful for industry and the private sector when they have to take long-term investment decisions."
"Targets will therefore remain a core element of any future climate change architecture."
"We need targets."
"As you will be aware, the European Council of last March set down a pathway target of 15% to 30% of emissions reductions by 2020."
"However, the Commission believes that the time has not yet come to set concrete targets for developed countries in Montreal in December."
"That would only be done when we have more clarity on the progress of the negotiations on the post-2012 period."
"Mr Seeber has underlined that any future climate change regime will have to build on broad participation on all major emitters and that is of key importance if our cooperation is to be truly efficient."
"The Commission and Member States are working hard to promote deeper dialogue with the United States and developing countries."
"We have engaged in policy dialogue with the United States administration within the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change and within other fora and meetings, such as the Joint Climate Change Science and Technology Workshop."
"That covers concrete topics such as renewable energy, energy efficiency and carbon sequestration."
"The United States claims that is has a different approach to fighting climate change, based mainly on the research and development of new technologies."
"The difference between their approach and our approach is that they have seen an approximate 15% increase in carbon dioxide emissions while the European Union of 25 has seen a considerable reduction compared with 1990 levels, and the 15 member countries under the Kyoto regime obligations are 1.7% under the 1990 level."
"That is not enough, but we are sure that, by the end of our commitment period, we will be in compliance with our Kyoto target."
"This is the difference between the two approaches."
"As regards developing countries, the European Union has an open mind on how they should participate in future multilateral climate cooperation."
"It is clear that we cannot expect the same mandatory requirements as we do from developed countries."
"Any commitment they take on will be based on the principle of common, but differentiated, responsibilities."
"China and other developing countries have contributed to the formation of the greenhouse phenomenon by a much smaller percentage than the developed countries, and per capita emissions in China are currently less than one tenth of the levels in the developed world, so we should follow that example."
"Where capita income is much lower and development needs greater we have to follow what the United Nations Convention wisely prescribes as a common but differentiated policy."
"Mr Verges mentioned that we should take particular care of developing countries and their increasing needs arising from global warming."
"We really should prepare for that impact."
"The Commission is already providing funding and welcomes Canada's intention to prepare a five-year work programme on adaptation at the Conference in Montreal."
"In addition, the European Union is the major contributor to the 2001 Bonn Political Declaration which pledges USD 410 million per year in climate change funding for developing countries, starting this year."
"At the October Environment Council, Ministers committed themselves to communicating at Montreal the progress being made towards delivery on this target."
"Also, to support developing countries, we have to make sure that the clean development mechanisms actually work."
"The key issue is the efficiency of the executive board in Bonn, and the European Union is already providing funding, but more support is clearly necessary."
"The European Union is still the main contributor of funds to the executive board."
"There have been certain concerns about bilateral cooperation outside the United Nations context, and especially in the Asia-Pacific Partnership."
"Let me stress that this can in no way be viewed as an alternative to the United Nations process."
"However, this Partnership can support our efforts under the Climate Change Convention and the Kyoto Protocol through closer bilateral cooperation that includes both a stronger political dialogue and a focus on technology."
"This is also how one should see the European Union-China and European Union-India partnerships."
"This translates into very concrete actions: we have recently held two workshops in India and China on the Clean Development Mechanism and market-based mechanisms."
"In relation to China, we also see an important focus on the development and demonstration of near-zero emissions power generation, and I agree with Mrs Beckett that carbon capture and storage is one of the means of tackling the problem of climate change."
"It is not a cure-all, but it is one of the many means that we can use."
"These partnerships will have the positive and immediate effect of supporting the discussions on a multilateral climate change regime post-2012."
"Mr Blokland asked about the efficiency of the European Union's current measures."
"If we implement all the measures in full, this will lead to a 4% reduction compared with 1990, which obviously is not sufficient to meet the target of -8% that we have set for ourselves."
"That is why we included additional measures in the climate change programme that we launched a month ago."
"This implies that we should make greater emission cuts, allowing us to reach the Kyoto target and make further progress for the period after 2012."
"It is important to know that, for the European Union of 25, the result with the existing measures will be -7%."
"Mrs Doyle, Mrs Grossetête and others asked about emissions from cars."
"I fully agree that this is a vital issue and that is why, in 2006, the Commission will review the agreement with the car industry in order to assess the possibility of reaching the Community objective of 120 g/km by a certain point, having made sure, of course, that we reach the target, voluntarily agreed with the car industry in Europe, Japan and Korea, of 140 mg."
"Mrs Ek referred to the inclusion of transport in European Union emissions trading."
"The Commission has already made a proposal with regard to aviation, as you know."
"The Commission will assess this for the other transport sectors as part of the 2006 review."
"On renewable energy, the Commission will put forward, in the weeks to come, a new report assessing a target for renewable energy by 2020."
"Regarding nuclear energy and the remarks made by Mr Hökmark, some Member States expect nuclear energy to be a part of their future energy."
"However, we have to ensure that we have a broad range of energy sources that are low in carbon."
"Nuclear power will not be able to meet the increased energy demands and we should also be aware that nuclear power faces problems concerning nuclear waste and public opinion."
"With regard to what Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines said about agriculture, the Commission agrees that synergies can be found between climate change and agriculture."
"We had an extremely interesting meeting in London, organised by Mrs Beckett and the UK Presidency, on climate change and agriculture and very important conclusions were reached there."
"The Commission will be putting forward a plan in support of biofuels."
"Finally, winning the battle against climate change requires determined action, starting now."
"It requires action, as Mr Smith said, from all actors and sectors of society."
"We should not underestimate the size of the challenge."
"Winning the battle against climate change will take time, of which we have precious little, and efforts that some will argue we cannot afford."
"With your continued support, we are determined to reassert the European Union's leadership in this key challenge for mankind."
"Thank you very much."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"– The next item is voting time."
"Mr President, the report on Iraq, on which we are currently engaged in voting, is perhaps one that would otherwise appear among the also-rans, but it is important in that in it, Parliament, the Council and the Commission together are demonstrating that the European institutions are capable of responding quickly and in the public interest."
"It was late last night – just before midnight – that this report was debated."
"While every moment in this House is an important one, I do believe that we – that is, the services and we Members – should all ensure that such important legislative reports, the adoption of which is in the public interest, are debated at better hours of the day, so as to send a clear message to the outside world."
"Mr President, I rise on a point of order under Rule 132 about Commission Question Time last night."
"Last night we had 90 minutes of questions but only 11 questions were answered, mainly because all the Commissioners gave long, rambling replies."
"That was started by Commissioner Mandelson, who then overran, so that in the end there was only the opportunity for Commissioner Špidla to answer two questions."
"When I raised this before, President Borrell wrote a letter to the Commission asking Commissioners to be crisper in their answers."
"Nothing so far has happened."
"I should like to ask you to send a further letter, with much more ferocity, saying that what we look for as Members are short answers, not long rambling speeches."
"Mr President, I want to raise the fact that this House is set to debate the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis only next month."
"It is a UN summit on the freedom of information."
"The delegations attending that summit have had their internet access and e-mail filtered in their hotels."
"They see demonstrators being arrested and journalists being harassed and beaten."
"Tapes on human rights infringements have been confiscated by the Tunisian police."
"There is no freedom of information in Tunisia."
"European Union delegations are in Tunis right now."
"I do not think we can wait another month to condemn these events."
"Mr President, although it is now a bit late, I did indicate earlier."
"It appears that the previous adoption of Amendment 5 makes this amendment superfluous."
"Although I would very much like to know what the rapporteur thinks about this, I am assuming that this vote was unnecessary."
". Mr President, I would like to make a statement on this vote."
"Now that this House has voted by a large majority to make out, without any money behind it, a cheque for EUR 400 million, which may well, without reliable calculations, find its way into the coffers of the Italian energy conglomerates, I now urge you to vote against my report."
"I regard that decision that this House has taken today as utterly irresponsible."
"In the belief it would be more right to follow the Commission’s line, I ask you to vote against my own report, from which I will, in any event, be withdrawing my signature, believing as I do that cheques with nothing to back them up are of no use in gaining acceptance for European policy or in buying safety for atomic energy."
"I am sorry to have to say this, but I do believe that the House is extremely ill-advised if a majority in it can vote to accept these false promises."
"Mr President, I should like to add ‘eutrophication’ – probably the most serious ecological problem in the Baltic Sea – to the text distributed to you."
"The text should be amended to read: ‘Stressing the further need to enhance cooperation between EU Member States and in particular to reduce eutrophication’."
". Mr President, I wish to add the following text to the end of paragraph 24 after the words ‘blending ratios’: ‘examining the environmental effectiveness of requiring 10% biofuel blends in transport fuels’."
"Mr President, I find there are problems with the versions in different languages."
"In the German version, there is reference to ‘’ – two seats or bases, but that is nonsense, as, according to the Treaty, Parliament is based only in Strasbourg."
"That was decided long ago."
"The English version makes reference to ‘double location’, with Brussels as the second ‘location’; it is one we can happily do away with, but then the translation has to be right."
"I therefore ask you to compare the two language versions with one another."
"– That concludes voting time."
"We have voted against the report as a whole because we believe that the Commission’s proposal is better."
"It is only fair that airline passengers be informed as to which carrier is operating a particular flight so that they are able to take carefully considered decisions from, for example, a safety perspective."
"We support the Commission’s proposal that the Member States gather security information with a view to passing it on to the Commission and other Member States, but we object to Parliament’s proposal to introduce instead a Community list and, in that way, centralise the administration of the data."
". I wish to congratulate Mrs De Veyrac on her important and timely report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the information of air transport passengers on the identity of the operating carrier and on communication of safety information by Member States."
"I support the report, and wish to highlight the proposal to broaden the competence of the European Aviation Safety Agency and to give it a central role in publishing safety measures relating to aircraft of third-country carriers."
"The blacklist should be published not only by the Commission but also by each Member State, ticket sellers, national civil aviation authorities and airports in Member States, in order to ensure that passengers are kept properly informed and that the objectives of this proposal are properly met."
". This is a very timely proposal initially in reaction to concerns raised after the Sharm-el-Sheikh air accident (which killed 148 people) and after the spate of air disasters in August this year."
"Many of the passengers who died at Sharm-el-Sheikh did not know they were going to be flying an Egyptian airline called Flash Air nor that this carrier had temporarily, in 2002, been subject to restrictions by Switzerland because of safety concerns."
"Passengers have a right to be informed of the airline operating their flight regardless of where in the Community the service starts."
"Air travellers should be well informed prior to travel about their prospective flight, particularly if the actual carrier is not the one originally indicated at the time of reservation."
"This proposal takes us in that direction."
". I fully support the De Veyrac report calling for an EU-wide blacklist of air carriers which do not meet international aircraft safety standards."
"These carriers should be named and shamed under the principal of zero tolerance throughout the Community. At the end of the day all EU citizens want safe flights when travelling inside and outside the Community and we cannot compromise on this objective."
"I also firmly believe that the information contained on the blacklist needs to be easily accessible and widely available to all stakeholders (national civil aviation authorities, all EU airports and of course passengers)."
"As a member of the transport committee I believe it is the role of the European Parliament, as co-legislator, to do everything possible to have such a list quickly established."
"I believe it is equally vital that the blacklist should also cover aircraft chartered from companies in non-EU countries and Member States should provide the European Commission with a list of carriers banned from their airspace."
"Co-operation and co-ordination is the key."
"In this respect the role of the European Safety Agency needs to be increased in checking international standards and issuing certificates of approval."
"I reiterate the point that we cannot compromise in any respect the safety of our EU citizens."
".I voted, of course, in favour of this proposal for legislation aimed at implementing a blacklist of unsafe airlines."
"What is the spirit of this proposal?"
"To enable passengers to choose their carrier with full knowledge as regards the safety conditions, and to be informed in the event of a last-minute change of carrier."
"This task forms part of a broader strategy aimed at enhancing the safety of the booming air transport sector."
"In 2003, there were 1.7 billion air passengers worldwide, and it is predicted that there will be 2.5 billion in 2015."
"In Europe alone, the number of air passengers increased by an average 5.5% per year between 1990 and 2003."
"This work must be done at European level, in collaboration with the Member States, in order to lay down common inspection criteria."
"There are still too many disparities, particularly in relation to the controls."
"Without taking the place of sky marshals, the Commission must demonstrate ambition, draw attention to the worst performers, unearth any weaknesses and harmonise European legislation regarding air safety."
"This is a prerequisite in order for air transport to remain what it is: the safest mode of transport."
"As a Slovak MEP and member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I naturally voted in favour of the proposal to increase support for decommissioning the two reactors at the Jaslovské Bohunice nuclear power plant."
"The Slovak Government, whose representatives made the difficult decision on decommissioning in the accession negotiations, would have had some tough explaining to do if the vote in the European Parliament had turned out differently."
"Left to its own devices, Slovakia would not be able to cope with a 19% drop in power generation, coupled with the high direct and indirect costs resulting from output reduction at the Bohunice plant."
"I would therefore like to thank all of my colleagues in the European Parliament, who saw that the Slovak problem was a European problem, and who voted to provide financial assistance for the decommissioning of the Bohunice installation."
"I am pleased with the result of the vote on financial support for the decommissioning of the Bohunice V1 plant."
"The reason for this is as follows: In the 1990s, the Bohunice V1 installation underwent full-scale reconstruction under the watchful eye of an international agency, at a cost of nearly EUR 300 million."
"The plant is therefore clearly being decommissioned before time, as it is now capable of safely producing electricity at least until 2015."
"The 1999 decision was political, dictated not by good sense but by biased reasoning."
"The direct costs will amount to more than EUR 1.3 billion."
"Fortunately, the plenary session at least agreed on a contribution of 400 million, but this represents only one-third of the amount needed."
"Overall costs will be as high as EUR 5 billion, including critical elements such as the safe storage of radioactive waste, substantial losses in electricity generation, and so on."
"Nuclear power plants produce around 57% of the electricity in Slovakia."
"The decommissioning of the V1 plant will result in a shortfall of about seven terawatt-hours of electricity per year."
"This is the equivalent of unscrewing every second light bulb in the country."
"I thank everybody for their support."
"Mr President, record oil and petrol prices are now making us aware, in a very uncomfortable way, of the likelihood of a new energy crisis."
"Worldwide energy consumption has virtually trebled since 1960, and, while the USA leads the field in this respect with its consumption of a quarter of the world’s energy, the real cause is the ongoing modernisation of former developing countries and newly industrialising economies."
"It is still the case that 80% of the world’s energy output is derived from fossil sources such as oil, gas and coal, the extraction of which is becoming more and more laborious and hence more and more expensive, and the use of which is detrimental to our environment."
"When we are as far off track as we are, the renewed demand for nuclear power amounts to choosing plague rather than cholera."
"Nuclear fission does, admittedly, have the advantage of not discharging carbon dioxide, and of not, therefore, contributing to global warming, but, until such time as the besetting problems of reactor security and the final storage of nuclear waste are resolved, new nuclear power stations should not be built, nor should the life of existing ones be extended."
"If we are to cope with demand and further improve the efficiency with which we use energy and existing technologies, our only option is to further develop the renewable energy sector, which offers the only plausible long-term alternative."
"We chose to vote against Amendments 5 and 12 concerning an increase in the amount allocated for decommissioning the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant, since we believe that the budgetary framework for 2007 to 2013 should not be exceeded."
"Naturally, nuclear power plants must be decommissioned in the light of environmental and security considerations."
". The purpose of the proposed regulation is to provide finances for the decommissioning of the Bohunice VI nuclear power plant in Slovakia."
"Slovakia has committed to the closure of Units 1 and 2 of the plant by 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2008 respectively."
"The decommissioning process of the plant is an expensive one as it will last beyond 2006 and after the next financial perspective 2007-2013."
"In light of this, the EU has agreed to extend pre-accession aid by providing financial support for decommissioning up until 2006."
"Subsequently, an amendment was adopted to raise the budget from EURO 237 million to EURO 400 million."
"Despite being largely in favour of raising the budget, I believe the new amount of EUR 400 million proposed by the amendment to be excessive and I welcome the alternative of seeking non-EU funding in order to raise the amount of money necessary for decommissioning to take place."
". The nuclear option, which I feel is justified in certain circumstances, is only workable if accompanied by a stringent safety policy governing its use."
"When safety becomes an issue, these plants must be closed down and decommissioned."
"In this particular situation, however, I do not believe that the case has been made for releasing far greater financial resources than those proposed by the rapporteur."
"I therefore opted to abstain from the vote on the proposal before us."
"We support the EU’s Nordic cooperation, known as the Northern Dimension, but believe that the cooperation should be basically intergovernmental, strictly limited and focused on practical results."
"Among the issues to which priority should be given are the environment, safety where nuclear power is concerned and the fight against international crime."
"We support the proposal according to which the EU should develop its cooperation with regional organisations, including the Nordic Council."
"Nordic cooperation can operate as a model for the EU, because it shows how freedom of movement can be promoted and encouraged without a comprehensive supranational bureaucracy."
"In the light of the above, we choose to vote in favour of the report."
". The geography of ‘our Europe’ – the European Community – changed dramatically in May of last year."
"These changes are widely acknowledged to have been a great success, but, having changed its neighbours from one day to the next, with all that that entails for a number of policy areas, the EU faces fresh challenges."
"The EU already has extensive experience of regional policies adapted to specific geographical characteristics, albeit not always with the desired success."
"I welcome the guidelines put forward in this resolution, as they represent a positive step towards effective political action of this nature."
"To my mind, policy should not simply be applied with a broad brush, but should be adapted to different situations and specific characteristics."
". I was pleased that this joint motion for resolution gained a sufficiently broad support across the Chamber as this is a particularly important policy area."
"My own country, Scotland, as a Northern European country should be playing a more active role in this policy, though sadly even with our own Scottish Parliament we have yet to make our voice heard in this topic, so far."
". Ladies and gentlemen, on 1 May 2004 the European Union’s border moved eastward and northward."
"This has entailed a great many new challenges, which is why actions and projects like the Northern Dimension of the European Union are crucial in this context."
"The aim of multilateral regional cooperation between the EU Member States in the Baltic region is to create conditions that are conducive to social and economic development and to political stability in this region."
"The European Union now has an internal sea for the first time in its history."
"I should like to take this opportunity to draw the House’s attention to the particular political significance of this initiative."
"After all, the Northern Dimension countries are located at the point where the European Union meets the East, by which I mean that they share borders with such key partners as Russia and Belarus."
"The region could therefore play a crucial role in implementing a project of special value, namely close and multifaceted cooperation between the EU and Russia."
"The Northern Dimension will have a favourable impact on economic cooperation and infrastructure building, and the stepping up of cooperation in the field of home affairs and justice is likely to increase security where cross-border issues are concerned."
"Attention should also be paid to the environmental benefits to be gained from the Northern Dimension, which covers a valuable and sensitive ecosystem."
"In view of this fact, cooperation should therefore be promoted in the spheres of environmental protection and sustainable development."
"The Baltic or North European gas pipeline project has been the source of much controversy, and it remains a key issue to be resolved."
"None of the governments of the Baltic Sea countries were consulted in any way on the decision to construct this pipeline, and this decision poses a major threat to the energy security of many countries."
"We must not allow weaker countries to be discriminated against, and we must not allow actions to be taken that damage their interests."
"If we fail to do so, the Northern Dimension will remain pure theory and bear no relation to reality."
"The Baltic gas pipeline project also represents a huge threat to the environment in the Baltic Sea region."
". The benefits of the EU are sometimes at the root of its troubles."
"This is certainly true of technological challenges, regarding which the sheer size of a Union of 25 Member States naturally makes it difficult to reach agreement."
"When it comes to technological development and to adopting new technologies, it is crucial that we think quickly and take action decisively."
"These considerations come into play as regards the significant technological change that the switchover to digital represents."
"I welcome the guidelines contained in the Common Resolution, although I feel priority should be given to ensuring that the market in this field can function freely."
"Supporting technological development must not mean jeopardising the natural freedom required by markets in general, and by this market in particular."
". Although I support this report, there needs to be parity when such a switchover takes place."
"Citizens need to be informed and prepared."
". The way we voted on this report took account of the Czech perspective on these proposals, in light of the pressure that they were under to decommission the nuclear power plants."
"Adequate financial resources have therefore been made available to cover all of the costs of decommissioning and the final processing and storage of the radioactive waste."
"There are currently 14 Member States with nuclear plants, which corresponds to 149 reactors, and the working reactors are on average more than 20 years old."
"In the new accession countries faced with these decommissioning requirements, as in the case before us, we feel it is right that they should receive the support they need to carry this out in the proper manner, from the point of view of human and environmental safety."
". This report is a step in the right direction towards improving financial and technical aspects of decommissioning nuclear power plants."
"As we know from experience at Dounreay in Scotland, there is considerable improvement required in the handling of this dangerous, but necessary, process."
"Safety must be the number one priority, and the unsatisfactory state of preparations for decommissioning in most EU member states justifies the view that no new nuclear power plans should be built."
". I voted for this report."
"Decommissioning is an important issues as there are some 50-60 nuclear power plants in the EU that will be decommissioned by 2025."
"It goes without saying that nuclear power plants need to be shut down safely to protect people and the environment."
"A lack of finance for this process could cause delay and potential safety risks."
"All nuclear undertakings should have sufficient funds for decommissioning."
"The Commission is anxious to come up with a common framework, and in the longer term, to harmonise the methods by which decommissioning is financed in the EU."
"This report makes a contribution to that goal."
". No more must the EU promote nuclear power, as the Euratom Treaty specifies that it must."
"When the EU, exceptionally, calls for the decommissioning of nuclear power station in order to protect human life and the environment, as it did in the case of the Slovak Bohunice V1 reactor, such demands are deserving of support, even if the distinction drawn by the Commission between the ‘good’ reactors in the West and the ‘dangerous’ ones in Eastern Europe is an untenable one."
"The initially high level of support is appropriate to a purposeful start to the decommissioning process, as the Slovak Republic has accumulated funds amounting to only EUR 320 million."
"The support is in line with undertakings given at the time of Slovakia’s accession to the EU."
"Were it not for support from the EU, there would be cause for concern that the reactors at Bohunice V1 would continue in operation, which would entail serious security risks."
"Without EU funding, it might well also not be possible to ensure that decommissioning measures would be taken promptly in order to protect human life and the environment."
"The use of EU funds should, however, be limited to the decommissioning of the Bohunice V1 reactors and to the measures accompanying it."
"An addition should be made to this effect to Article 2 of the Commission proposal, which should also specify the EU’s priorities for the use of such funds, including, , the maintenance of safety standards in the course of decommissioning and the achievement of the climate change goals through the promotion of renewable energies."
". I voted in favour of the report on the use of financial resources earmarked for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants."
"I welcome the principles put forward in the report, not only because I feel that all possible safety measures should be taken when it comes to nuclear power, but also because, to my mind, adequate financial resources must be made available to cover such measures during the useful lifetime of these plants."
"I believe that the conditions for using the financial resources for decommissioning set out in this report are both responsible and effective, among which I wish to highlight the setting up of a decommissioning fund that will take account of the management of funds generated by energy production."
"I would note that it is crucial, whenever we talk about nuclear matters, to provide for the necessary environmental safety and protection measures throughout the useful lifetime of a nuclear power plant. In this context, the proposed measures aimed at the safe, effective and environmentally-friendly decommissioning of such plants should be included."
". I was pleased to back my group colleagues in supporting this important report as it underlines concerns about the long term viability of the nuclear industry when it comes to decommissioning."
"With so many alternative technologies available, I believe that we must invest in renewables, which will leave no ecological legacy."
"Mr President, I would like to make a statement of vote in respect of the Wijkman report, which, in essence, I very much welcome."
"It is unfortunate that the adoption of Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca’s amendment means that the derogation for nuclear energy is now deleted."
"That I regard as false, since I do not regard nuclear energy as a realistic alternative for the future and believe that the risks associated with it are not yet manageable."
"It is for that reason that I, along with my colleagues as a whole, have voted against the report."
"We have nothing against it as such, but it could have been more clear in coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is no alternative."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid that Mr Wijkman’s report – and I hope he will not hold this against me – is wrong, starting with its very title."
"Human beings have never won the battle against climate change and never will, because their influence on it is limited and not yet scientifically demonstrated."
"In my view, the most that can be endorsed are the hopes for a cut in harmful and potentially climate-altering emissions, but there is a great difference between that and approving a document of doubtful scientific value, which is even presumptuous in its aims."
"One need only look at items 2 and 3 after recital M, which propose limiting the average temperature increase of the planet to two degrees above pre-industrial levels, even though there are no reliable records or data for that time."
"Furthermore, I do not agree with the statements that the European Union should commit itself to giving financial aid to China, India, Brazil and South Africa so that these countries can develop sustainable energy strategies."
"It would be better, instead, to impose sanctions and trade restrictions on industrialised countries, including the United States, and the developing countries I have just mentioned if their industries continued to harm the environment or, more generally, if they showed very little social consideration."
"Therefore, in view of everything I have just said, I voted against the report."
". Ahead of the forthcoming Conference of Parties in Montreal between 28 November and 9 December, Parliament is emphasising the need to give the highest priority to talks on emission reduction commitments for the period after 2012 arising from the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which entered into force on 16 February 2005, having been ratified by 152 countries and regional organisations."
"It would appear that the targets that have been set are rather too ambitious, given that little is known regarding the actual consequences of human interference in climate change, which is even more problematic while the USA remains outside the Kyoto Protocol."
"We do welcome all of the measures intended to reduce the amount of energy consumption and waste, to achieve greater energy efficiency, to develop a new, more environmentally-friendly transport policy, and to promote rail transport, along with public transport as a whole."
"On the other hand, we take a diametrically opposed view on the issue of emissions trading, given that, by all accounts, it solves nothing and only serves to exacerbate environmental inequalities and imbalances."
"The wealthiest countries will be able to go on polluting by buying emissions rights from others, and that is unacceptable."
"Hence our abstention."
"Global climate change constitutes a significant problem, which we believe there are good reasons for dealing with at an international level."
"The Wijkman report has a lot going for it."
"However, the June List restates its position that the European Parliament should not take over the Member States’ foreign policies by calling on third countries that have not yet ratified the Kyoto Protocol to do so."
"It is also regrettable that the report calls on the Member States to deal with a number of matters that should be handled at national level."
"For example, it includes proposals for EU-wide speed limits, traffic charges and tax incentives and for the development of rail transport and public transport in general."
"We are also critical of EU initiatives to make people aware of the ways in which unrestrained consumption and production affect the climate."
"This is a dimension that can, of course, be dealt with at national level."
"We have chosen to vote against the report as a whole, but have supported individual amendments in order, in our view, to improve the report."
".I abstained from voting on this text."
"As I made clear in my speech in today’s plenary session, this is a matter of urgency."
"We must act immediately in order to respond to this threat of climate change, which is undoubtedly one of the most serious threats in the history of humankind."
"I support the actions recommended in this report – while rejecting the idea of ecotaxes – and the political resoluteness displayed."
"I abstained to show my strong dissatisfaction regarding an amendment that challenges the existence of the Strasbourg Parliament."
"It is unacceptable to use such an important text to include issues in it that bear no relation to the subject dealt with."
"We are in favour of a minimum level of carbon dioxide tax within the EU."
"We believe, however, that any decision to levy such a tax must have the Council’s unanimous backing and not just that of a majority."
"In the future too, taxes must be deducted on a national basis and not by the EU."
". Mr Wijkman’s excellent report puts forward a number of measures to help solve the problem of climate change around the world."
"The Conference of Parties is due to take place in Montreal, where it is hoped that European leaders will submit proposals for future arrangements on climate change. These arrangements must be based on shared, but different responsibilities aimed at the continued reduction of emissions and the participation of more countries in these efforts."
"More ambitious targets also need to be set."
"The March 2005 European Council stressed the need for developed countries to reduce emissions by 15 to 30% by 2020."
"The rapporteur is proposing that longer-term targets be set to reduce emissions by 60 to 80% by 2050."
"Lastly, a strategy must be developed to turn Europe into the most energy-efficient economy in the world."
"Incentives must be introduced for increased use of ‘clean’ technologies, and research and innovation to support sustainable energy and the sustainable management of soil use should be promoted at European level."
". I welcomed the report outlining the need to fight the climate change battle."
"Once a certain level of Green-house gas concentration has passed in the atmosphere, the whole system will undergo drastic changes."
"Disasters such as annual material damages due to extreme weather conditions resulting in millions of people left homeless will occur."
"Developing countries are likely to be the ones who suffer the most."
"The EU has reduced its emissions by 3% below the 1990 level but more has to be done to reach the 8% target agreed in the Kyoto Protocol."
"Although I agree that the EU needs to reduce its emissions to reach the target agreed in the Kyoto agreement, I find the report to be extremely optimistic considering the inclusion of more policy areas and the time limit and would like to see a greater sense of urgency."
".The climate is changing."
"Rock paintings illustrate mammals in the Sahara and ibex at Lascaux."
"Well, as these animals have disappeared from these regions, this is indeed proof that the climate has changed."
"What is more, if this change is taking place, it is undoubtedly because of human beings."
"The fact that the earth’s axis is tilting relative to the ecliptic plane, which changes over a period of 10 000 years for example, and that, as Milankovitch demonstrated, this has an influence on the climate, matters little."
"The fact that the great phenomenon of oceanic respiration, with vast rivers plunging in the North Atlantic only to resurface in the Pacific, has an influence on the climate, matters even less here."
"Fear requires explanations, great and reassuring mythologies, cosmogonies, Good and Evil, and punishments."
"We are therefore punished for our ingenuity, punished for our progress and punished for our inventions and our creations."
"Man as Prometheus, who stole fire, must today receive his punishment in the shape of melting ice fields, rising sea levels, heatwaves and a lack of oxygen."
"Just as, in the past, there were the plagues of Egypt."
"All of that would be fine if this post-Medieval confusion were to lead to a change in the economic and social climate that causes the – very real – decline from which we suffer."
". It is only natural that environmental issues, and climate change in particular, should be uppermost among our concerns."
"I support many of the guidelines on environmental policy that Europe has been pursuing, reflected in both the report and the Commission communication."
"I believe, however, that there are two points that we must bear in mind."
"Firstly, environmental issues are obviously not at the forefront of the concerns of developing countries, and indeed they are not alone in that respect."
"Secondly, developed societies are not prepared to accept a lower standard of living, and nor should this be our policy or our blueprint."
"This is precisely why research and development needs to be our major priority, given that the aim should be to manage resources, thereby ensuring a better and more sustainable quality of life."
"Mr President, the minutes record a dispute between Mrs Gröner and myself about Mr Giertych’s anti-abortion exhibition."
"The acting President stated that there would be no censorship."
"Since then, though, the exhibition has been removed, and so there has been."
"I would like to point out that there is also, in the building, an anti-REACH exhibition, in which the President of the Commission is depicted poisoning a child."
"I regard that as controversial in a way in which Mr Giertych’s exhibition is not."
"If you are going to use ‘controversial’ as a justification for removing displays, then both of them ought to go."
"I do believe, though, that nothing should be taken down, and that discussion, rather than censorship, should be the order of the day."
"Mr Posselt, the Quaestors are aware of what has happened and will provide the President with a report on it. We will take the appropriate decisions on that basis."
"The next item is the debate on the Report of the European Council and the Commission Statement on the informal European Council at Hampton Court, to which Parliament was invited, as you know, represented by its President."
"I would like to thank the British Presidency for the respect it showed the European Parliament."
"."
"Mr President, it is a very great honour to address this Parliament again – a very high-quality group of parliamentarians are here I know."
"In all parliaments sometimes you speak to a very large number and sometimes you do not."
"I take this as full support for all the policies which have been followed both by the UK Presidency and by the United Kingdom on aspects like the budget, which I shall come to in a moment."
"This is the 48th time that a British Government minister has appeared before Parliament since the beginning of the UK’s Presidency of the European Union and, with six weeks to go, I am happy to tell you there are still many more ministers on the way."
"That is an indication of the seriousness with which we take Parliament."
"Today, I want to report back on the informal summit at Hampton Court."
"Much of this is now familiar to you, but what was achieved three weeks ago was important."
"At the beginning of the summer, the people of Europe gave a clear signal that they were unhappy with the way in which Europe was heading."
"They felt detached from European politics and politicians."
"At Hampton Court, Europe’s leaders took a significant step towards providing a response to that concern by reaching broad agreement on a direction for Europe’s economic and social policy."
"Much of the leg-work had, of course, already been done by the European Commission and published in its excellent paper ‘European values in the globalised world’."
"If I may say to President Barroso, I thought that paper was one of the best and most insightful papers that I have read on the future of Europe and its nations in the last three years."
"With 20 million people unemployed across Europe and youth employment running at 18%, the main task for all of us who believe in the social model for Europe is to get Europe back to work and to give our citizens the tools to compete in the global market."
"The Hampton Court summit identified six key areas, backed up by a range of specific policies, in which the joint efforts of Member States and of the Commission can bolster Europe’s economic prosperity and collective security."
"First, there is research and development."
"We need a strong technological foundation if European companies are to stay ahead of the competition, particularly that posed by the Asian economies."
"Second, there is investment in our universities."
"We are lagging behind the United States and, in some key respects, China and India as well."
"The third is facing up to demographic change within the European Union."
"The EU currently has four people of working age for every elderly citizen, but over the coming decades this will fall from a ratio of four to one to just two to one."
"At the informal summit EU leaders therefore agreed that we had to examine in much more detail the relationship between legal migration and the EU’s future economic needs."
"The fourth concern was energy."
"How do we handle soaring global energy demand while supply remains tight?"
"The summit recognised that the solution requires action on a number of tracks."
"We have to diversify our sources of energy and approach our current major energy suppliers in a more coherent manner."
"We have to use our market capacity and power as users with those who are the suppliers."
"We also have to pursue energy efficiency and clean technologies and develop within Europe a much more genuinely open energy market."
"It is open in some countries, but not in all countries."
"I do not call that an open market."
"Fifth is the European Union’s work on global security."
"On data retention this Parliament has an opportunity to join in the EU’s collective responsibility to shape legislation that will increase the security of our citizens and bring criminals to justice."
"There is a counter-terrorism strategy that will indicate how we deal with radicalisation, how we protect our infrastructure and how we ensure better exchange of information."
"We also have to combat illegal immigration and strengthen our borders, whilst ensuring that we harness the benefits of legal migration for the EU and for developing countries."
"Finally, the summit agreed that Javier Solana, working with the Presidency, should take forward work on common foreign and security policy aspects of defence and security."
"There are specific proposals for research and training in this area to fill gaps in our capability."
"We also have to improve crisis management structures to respond to disasters and look to increase funding for CFSP."
"In December, by the way, we will be publishing a comprehensive strategy for Africa."
"In all areas there will be interim reports to the December European Council and final reports during the Austrian Presidency in the first half of next year."
"I am confident that in drawing up these reports the Commission will give full consideration to the views of the relevant Parliamentary committees."
"This, in some detail, is what was discussed at Hampton Court."
"However, now that we have broad agreement on the direction of a modern Europe, we have to get the right budget deal to deliver these economic and social priorities."
"The Presidency is committed to working for a budget deal in December."
"But we all know that it is going to be extremely difficult to reach one."
"In June, five Member States rejected the proposed budget; next month we will need all 25 to agree."
"So we have some hard negotiating ahead of us."
"With that in mind, we aim to table comprehensive proposals in early December for discussion at a conclave of foreign ministers."
"Changes will be needed in three main areas."
"First, we have to chart a new direction for the European Union budget to ensure that it can respond to the challenges of the 21st century."
"That requires establishing a clear timetable for a review covering all aspects of revenue and expenditure, a hard look at where the money comes from, how it is used and how we account for it."
"Failure to sign off the European Union’s accounts for the eleventh successive year – which is very poor – affects the climate of debate and of opinion about the whole of the European Union in every single Member State."
"So this new direction requires the laying-down of clear objectives for future Union spending, for the accounting for that spending, without which there will not be taxpayer confidence in what this Union is doing, and setting clear pathways for the future reform of the Union’s policies."
"Second, we have to amend the structure of spending from 1 January 2007 from that which was proposed in the last negotiating box in June, notably to take account of recent discussions by Member States of the proposals by Commission President Barroso, which he made on 20 October."
"Third, the consequences of any proposed changes to the own-resources decision – in other words to the amount which is paid by Member States to the EU’s budget – must be seen to be fair and balanced in all Member States."
"For that to happen, significant changes will be needed to the arrangements affecting the United Kingdom – amongst other Member States – from those that were proposed in June."
"I do not want anybody to be taken by surprise: when I talk about significant changes, I mean significant changes."
"Without significant changes, I see little prospect of a deal."
"However, with them, I believe that we can take negotiations forward and we are committed, as the Presidency, to trying to do a deal and we will make every effort to get there."
"So far, I have talked about Europe’s response to the challenges of globalisation mainly in terms of what we will do – what policies we adopt and what budget we should agree."
"However, globalisation also poses a challenge to Europe in terms not just of what we do but how we do things."
"As I have indicated, there is a growing gap between the politics of Europe and the people of Europe."
"It is exactly this question that will be the focus of a conference tomorrow in The Hague, jointly hosted by the Dutch and the British Governments."
"The ‘Sharing Power in Europe’ conference will look at how regional and national parliaments can work more effectively with European institutions, including the European Parliament, and how we can get the right balance between action at the regional, national and European levels to deliver the best results for our citizens."
"I should like here to express great appreciation to Jan Peter Balkenende, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, for first proposing that such a conference be held – he did so at the June European Council – and to our colleague, Bernard Bot, the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, who has helped the British Presidency to take this idea forward and to host the conference tomorrow."
"A part of all this effort has to be to bring Europe closer to its citizens and to make European Union legislation lighter and more relevant."
"As globalisation has made it more difficult for the people of Europe to relate to its institutions, so too have those people, our citizens, become more critical about the nature of European Union legislation."
"They are much more impatient of a regime and more strident in their belief that methods of regulation cannot, and should not, be a proxy for outcome."
"Too often – it is true of all parliaments and unions but it is particularly true of the European Union – the method has been seen as the same as the outcome."
"This is not the case."
"Businesses, non-governmental organisations and Member States want new European rules, for example, to fight unfair competition, to protect the environment or to improve our legal systems."
"However, they want action that makes our lives better, not more complicated."
"Standardisation and harmonisation do not add value by themselves."
"Thanks to the efforts of the Commission under President Barroso, there are many positive signs now."
"For example, the Commission has listened to what businesses and people want and has proposed a lighter regulatory touch in financial services."
"This will help promote a globally competitive European financial sector."
"The Commission’s three-year action programme for simplifying the is another very welcome step, as is the recognition that the European Union does not always need to get involved in those areas where it used to get involved."
"Hence the decision to get rid of a 1968 directive which regulated the number and the size of knots in wood."
"There may have been a reason 37 years ago for the European Union to regulate the number and size of knots in wood."
"However, today we ought to leave that maybe to Member States or just to the judgement of those people who buy wood from a timber dealer."
"Why not?"
"The proposal to see whether we can simplify the way in which employers have to give compliance reports on 20 separate directives on health and safety at work should lessen the burden on employers, giving them more time to focus on workers’ needs – maybe on creating jobs – than on paperwork."
"As a co-legislator, the European Parliament has a critical role to play in all this."
"Let us take REACH – which was the subject of a little excitement outside as I came in and, I have heard, a little excitement in here."
"It is controversial how far you regulate the European chemical industry to protect the consumer."
"None of us wants to be poisoned by chemicals."
"Nonetheless I believe that Europe’s record on this is exemplary and second to none in the whole of the universe."
"Equally, none of us want to see, in a globalised world in which barriers have come down, Europe’s chemical industry brought to its knees so that the regulation, which is a very fine one, ends up regulating an industry that has disappeared, to be replaced by industries across the world in China, India and elsewhere, where the regulation is far less good than it is today."
"That is the dilemma facing Parliament, as it faces all our peoples."
"We have to recognise the difficult cases."
"The proposed changes to the Working Time Directive are a good example of well-meaning legislation that will not achieve what those changes are set out to do, and where method and outcome have become grievously confused."
"We are all agreed that European labour markets must embrace decent standards of protection for our workers."
"Europeans must have rights at work, but they must also have jobs in which they can exercise those rights at work."
"My Prime Minister said recently that we hoped to resolve the outstanding issues on this directive during our Presidency, and that remains our goal."
"Let us be clear about the nature of the challenges we have to address."
"The Working Time Directive is justified as being about health and safety, and in part, it is."
"But rigid limits on total hours worked are not the answer."
"The United Kingdom has one of the best health and safety records in the whole of the European Union."
"Since you ask, we are second best in terms of days lost through injury and, I believe, third best in terms of deaths at work."
"We have shown by our record that a strong health and safety record judged by outcomes is entirely compatible with flexible labour markets and flexible working hours."
"Rigid pan-European limits on working hours will not deliver health and safety for our workforce, particularly where the rules are unevenly applied."
"Some European partners have rightly, I believe, expressed great concern that there are other Member States in which working time limits are being applied per contract and not per worker."
"Some of those countries are the same ones that say there have to be rigid limits; but when it comes to enforcement within their own countries, there is a dodge taking place and in the place of enforcement per worker – which has to be the basis for health and safety – it is per contract."
"Therefore, if people have two contracts – two jobs, one person – then they can evade the limit, entirely unregulated and unprotected."
"It does not make sense from a health and safety point of view."
"It does not make sense from an employment practice perspective."
"It does not make sense in terms of the reputation of the European Union of applying fair and sensible regulations across Europe."
"We have to find ways to implement and enforce the directive which match the needs of all labour markets."
"We must ensure that all workers enjoy proper employment rights and that none are forced by the rigidities of this directive into a grey economy, for that is what is happening."
"The blunt truth about the directive is that in seeking to reset European limits and standards, we risk infringing individual workers’ freedom to work the hours they choose."
"We will undeniably restrict employers’ flexibility to adapt to changing businesses and seasonal demands and, in doing so, will threaten the very jobs on which workers’ livelihoods depend."
"That cannot be right."
"It is vital that workers feel safe and appropriately protected in the workplace."
"It is good business as much as it is good politics."
"We need to judge how much of this should be fixed at European level and how much we should trust national governments, employers and trade unions to agree on an approach that reflects labour traditions and good practice within individual Member States and across Europe."
"After all, the minimum wage, another aspect of labour regulation in which I happen to believe passionately, has always been left to Member States."
"I believe that is quite right."
"Now is the time to leave far more issues concerning working hours to Member States as well."
"That seems to me to be an excellent example of an area where Europe, in addressing the challenges of seeking to engage more closely with our citizens, must go forward with a lighter touch."
"When the United Kingdom took over the Presidency of the European Union we also inherited the need to conduct a wide debate on the future of Europe."
"The Hampton Court summit was a vital element of that debate."
"But the debate is far from finished."
"The process of constructing a modern, confident Europe will be an even longer one."
"This is a journey which governments, politicians and parliaments, including this one, cannot take alone."
"We have to bring the benefits of Europe to the people of Europe and take the people with us."
". Mr President, Mr Straw, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Straw pointed out, we can be satisfied with the results of this Informal Summit."
"I am keen to share with you my delight that it was possible for the voice of the European Parliament to make itself heard at the Summit, thanks to Mr Borell’s participation in all of the discussions."
"I can only congratulate Mr Blair on the way in which he contributed to creating a positive atmosphere and a climate of confidence."
"I am particularly proud of the role played by the Commission in the success of this Summit."
"Our debates at Hampton Court resulted in a consensus based on a fundamental idea and on five key areas."
"The fundamental idea is as follows: in order to preserve our values, we have to modernise our policies."
"There are no contradictions between a project of economic reform to modernise Europe and the commitment to a political Europe and a social Europe."
"The five key areas are, briefly: first, a consensus on the analysis and the nature of the challenges confronting us, which follows on from the contribution made by the Commission – and, while we are on this subject, Mr Straw, I thank you for what you said about the quality of our document."
"Secondly, the importance of practically implementing ambitious reforms that foster growth and employment."
"All the Member States have applied themselves to this task, and the Commission will draft a report on the national programmes developed in order to implement the Lisbon conclusions at the very beginning of next year."
"Thirdly, the development of the practical work done on the political responses to be provided in relation to globalisation and our ageing populations, focusing on specific areas such as research and development, universities, energy and demographics, including the issue of immigration."
"Fourthly – and this specifically relates back to my last point - a new priority for immigration policy, simultaneously covering legal immigration, which undoubtedly meets the needs of our economy, the securing of our borders, which our people are waiting for, and effective integration policies, which are crucial in our multicultural societies."
"Fifthly, new initiatives with a view to examining how our external action can be enhanced, so that we can respond more effectively to globalisation and to the new security threats that do not stop at national borders."
"We must now move on with our work."
"I hope that we will be able to do so in close cooperation with Parliament and with the current and forthcoming Presidencies of the Council."
"In order to sustain the momentum for promoting long-term growth and employment, the Commission proposes to give new impetus to research and development and to present ways of reorganising the education systems in Europe and universities."
"We will report back to the Council and to the European Parliament on these matters before the spring European Council."
"Searching for the resources to better tackle the demographic challenge: as from the beginning of next year, we will present the results of the consultation launched at the beginning of the year by issuing a Green Paper on demographics."
"Establishing a coherent energy policy: next year we will present a strategy for Europe."
"All the options must remain open."
"This fresh recognition of the fact that we must work together in an area which, until very recently, was considered as an area reserved for the Member States, is very important."
"As regards migration, work is already under way."
"Several proposals have already been submitted to Parliament and, before the end of the year, a document should enable us to enhance our thoughts and actions concerning legal and illegal immigration."
"Finally, security confronts us with a two-fold challenge."
"We have not only to work together more effectively in tackling the cross-border crime that we encounter in Europe, but also to make our commitment to combat international terrorism more resolute."
"On that point too, important proposals by the Commission are on the table, and a strategy for combating terrorism is in the process of being completed."
"Yet, we also need to make greater efforts to ensure that the European Union fully takes its place in the debate on the responses to be provided in relation to globalisation."
"That is why the Commission will present a concept paper, examining the way in which we, the European Commission, together with the Council and Parliament, can contribute to strengthening the external coherence of the Union."
"It is clear that we can do more to promote the coherence of our external action, not only in relation to foreign policy and common defence, but also in relation to the various internal policy instruments with an external dimension, as well as in areas in which the Commission has a special role to play, such as development aid, international trade and the neighbourhood policy, for instance."
"Hampton Court showed once again why the European Union matters in a globalised world."
"Never before has European integration been so much in question, but never before has it been so necessary."
"Europe has the scale and the range of policies to maximise the benefits of globalisation for its citizens and to minimise the threats."
"It is European legislation which enables a terrorist suspect to be transferred from Italy to London within 50 days."
"A process that once took years now takes weeks because we have an instrument at European level and because we have European legislation that enables us to do that."
"It is Europe that can provide answers to the challenges of more expensive and scarcer energy."
"It is also Europe which will help manage the border crossing in Gaza, a very important recent development."
"It is Europe which is leading the world in aid for Africa."
"So there is a need for this European dimension."
"We agree – and we have done a great deal to achieve this with better regulation – on the need for sensible legislation to avoid bureaucratic measures."
"However, that does not mean a minimalist Europe – and I want to be totally clear about that."
"Not at all."
"It means that Europe should do less in some areas and should make the lives of our citizens and businesses easier."
"Nevertheless, at the same time, there are areas where we have to do more, not less."
"It is a very important to avoid the idea of a minimalist Europe."
"It is the responsibility of all of us European leaders – at Council level, Parliament level and Commission level – to explain this and to avoid the demagoguery and populism that is sometimes levelled against Europe."
"Because, in this globalised world, we need a strong Europe more than ever."
"But all these policies – from external relations, to security, to migration, to energy, to research, to universities – need money; they cost money."
"When I was a child my mother told me never to speak about money because it is impolite."
"But now I have to speak about money."
"Because without money, we cannot deliver on those policies, we need the resources to go ahead with our policies."
"Distinguished members of the Council, you cannot ask the Commission and the other European institutions to deliver and not give them the means to deliver on those policies."
"The positive atmosphere, the signs of a stronger European political will that we saw at Hampton Court, must now be turned into action, turned into an agreement on the financial perspective next month."
"This is the defining issue of the British Presidency; it is the test of whether Europe is on the move, and we need Europe on the move."
"In respect of prosperity, solidarity and security, all we can do is give our citizens the means to achieve them."
"I know the British Presidency is working hard for a deal; the cost of failure would be high."
"It is hard to see how our positions will converge within a few months."
"So there is a real risk of no agreement next month, leading to delays in money coming on-stream for the new Member States, a risk that the Community will not be able to deliver on crucial international commitments, including commitments for the poorest."
"Without the financial perspective, how can the European Union make medium-term commitments to global funds for HIV/AIDS?"
"How can we respect the commitments we made at the United Nations for the Millennium Development Goals?"
"How can we support the Caribbean countries in adjusting to the changes in the European Community banana regimes, for instance?"
"How can we keep our commitments to African peacekeeping?"
"How can we go ahead with the so-called new policies, the policies for the future?"
"Indeed, if there is no agreement we will keep the policies of the past; we will not have the means for the policies for the future."
"I also think we all agree that an enlarged, more diverse European Union needs more investment."
"I do not say ‘the costs of enlargement’ because I do not like the word ‘costs’ when we speak about enlargement."
"But now that we are a much bigger Europe and we are a much more diverse Europe we need more investment for those new Members."
"We have to share the burden of this investment."
"We have a duty of solidarity to the new Member States who look to the European Union for support in their rapid and remarkable progress in modernisation and reform."
"This is a win-win situation for all Member States."
"This is not a zero-sum game and it is precisely because we have to bridge this gap that I came up with some proposals, including a proposal now being taken into consideration by the British Presidency – I thank the British Presidency for that – linking cohesion and competitiveness."
"In our thinking there is no contradiction between cohesion on one side and competitiveness on the other, on the contrary."
"The cohesion and support for the new Member States is also a way for them to improve their competitiveness and for Europe as a whole to be more competitive."
"So I hope that those proposals will be taken into account in the final agreement so in the end it will also be clear that what we are proposing is not money for an old concept of Europe, it is money for a more competitive and more modern Europe, but a Europe that at the same time keeps its strong values in terms of cohesion."
"We need a fair sharing of this burden."
"No Member State can do enlargement on the cheap."
"I trust in the common sense of the British Presidency to deliver a fair and balanced agreement next month."
"I hope that we will achieve this by strengthening, and not reducing, the Commission and Parliament’s ambition for an enlarged Europe."
"Because we have to say very frankly that the financial perspectives represent an agreement between the Council, Commission and the Parliament, and the position of Parliament and the Commission should be taken into consideration in the final agreement."
"Hampton Court was indeed a success."
"Hampton Court was the first very important step in a new consensus for a dynamic, modern Europe."
"I hope that the positive spirit of dynamism and openness which everyone showed there can be turned into agreement on the budget now."
"I give my full support to the Presidency in its efforts to achieve that and I wish the Presidency and all the Member States the very best."
"Thank you, Mr Barroso, the Presidency wishes to point out that the debate was on the European Council at Hampton Court and it is turning into a preliminary debate on the financial perspective."
"But the Presidency is not going to tell the participants in the debate what they must discuss."
"They may insist on the issue of the financial perspective if they wish, although it does not specifically appear on the agenda."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of Hampton Court, the President of the European Council was present in this House, not the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom."
"He is, it is true to say, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom too, but it is in that capacity that he is President of the European Council."
"Tony Blair being here the day before Hampton Court sent the right message."
"In that, I think he got the order right: Parliament first, and then the Heads of State or Government."
"I am also very glad that the President of this House was at Hampton Court for the duration."
"I recommend to you, Mr President-in-Office, that you invite the President of Parliament to Brussels for the whole of the summit."
"That could then be the beginning of good practice for the future, and the United Kingdom would always be remembered for having fully involved the President of the European Parliament in the European summits."
"Your reference to the quality of the Members present today was a masterpiece of British understatement."
"I think it is marvellous that you use that to express indirect but justified criticism of the fact that there could be more of us here, but it was our quality that you chose to highlight, and that shows what mastery of parliamentary skills is to be found in the UK."
"It is at this point that I feel the need to sound a cautionary note."
"You mentioned the visits by ministers and said that a minister had been to the European institutions on 48 occasions."
"Tremendous though I think that is, and certain though I am that the number will rise to 60, because we still have six weeks left, it has to be said that, at the end of the day, what is crucial is that the quantity of ministers from the British Presidency should be matched by their quality, and we still harbour the hope that it will be by the end of December this year."
"You said that Europe is very distant from its citizens; that is indeed the case, and we will have to give some thought to how we can, together, improve that, but the same can be said of politics at the national level too."
"It follows that we have to make the same effort at national and at European level if people are to have confidence in the policy-making process."
"When considered from an outsider’s point of view – and I am sure this was one of the things Hampton Court achieved – I do think that there is new trust between the parties involved."
"As Chairman of a Group with MEPs from all 25 Member States and from 45 national parties, I know from experience that, where there is such a problematic interplay of interests – such as is also to be found in the other political groups, in this Parliament as a whole, and in the national governments – problems can be resolved only if there is trust."
"Where trust is absent, there are no political solutions either."
"What we expect of the Heads of State or Government is that each and every one of them should play his part in fostering trust in the other members of the European Council."
"I have no desire to repeat right now all the things that have been said about the future of Europe, about the Commission’s paper, and about globalisation, but what is crucial is that we should accept what is at the heart of globalisation – the fact that we are one world and becoming more and more so; on the other hand, though, globalisation is not just something for us to endure, but rather something that we can shape, and by that I mean that we can, through political action, keep globalisation’s excesses, and its negative manifestations, under our control."
"That is what I regard as being our task."
"I would now like to say something about the most important decision that has to be taken, about which you have already had a debate, albeit in the margins."
"I refer, as did the President of this House earlier on, to the Financial Perspective."
"I hope you will not mind if I advise you – and even if you do, I will advise you anyway – that you should find a solution to the Financial Perspective, for the UK was always in favour of enlargement, thanks to which there are Members from the countries that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 in this House today, even if it has not always gone down the same road with us where institutional issues are concerned."
"If you cannot get the Financial Perspective right, that will be disappointment for the formerly Communist countries in particular, who joined us on 1 May 2004."
"I therefore urge you to do everything possible to get a result."
"It has to be said, though, that if you and the President of the European Council are to do that, you will need to have the courage to draw a clear line under the issue of the British rebate."
"You spoke of fundamental change, and you probably had agricultural policy in mind when you did so, but we also need fundamental change in the contributions made by the individual Member States, and that is where the United Kingdom, during your presidency, can have a major part to play."
"The agricultural policy has been laid down for the period ending in 2013, but, if a solution is found to the issue of the British rebate, and if we want to have a Financial Perspective, it must be ensured that we can, at some point, give serious thought to the further reform of agricultural policy, with the intention of producing at least a binding declaration of intent."
"When you discuss the Financial Perspective and, I hope, come to some decisions on it, Mr President-in-Office – and I am also saying this to the Commission – I urge you to remember that you, in the Council, are not taking decisions on your own; the European Parliament is part of the budgetary authority, and it possesses equal rights of codecision, so you need to guarantee that it is fully involved."
"Just as you do, of course, we represent the citizens of Europe, and if we, together, show goodwill, if we have trust in one another, our problems will not be insoluble."
". Mr President, Hampton Court was a Summit lacking any formal conclusions."
"The promises made at the Summit are in danger of being just as short-lived as the marital commitments contracted by King Henry VIII in the very same palace."
"The UK Presidency is right to call on the 25 to carry out reforms, to invest more in the technologies of the future and to create the conditions for increased employment."
"Reforms are still needed but, for many Europeans, the word ‘reform’ has a negative connotation and is synonymous with job losses and the scaling down of society."
"Mr Straw has just criticised Parliament’s position with regard to the Working Time Directive."
"I advise the minister to re-read the very first convention adopted by the International Labour Organisation at the time of the League of Nations, a convention that aimed at a 48-hour week without opt-out."
"The reforms will be accepted if they allow general welfare to be improved."
"In order to make this happen, Europe must change its overly pessimistic and despondent position."
"Viewed from the outside, the Union serves as an example."
"The President of Chile said so here last month."
"To read the Commission’s communications, though, Europe will to all intents and purposes have become a hospice by the year 2050."
"Who among us will be able to check whether these alarmist forecasts have proved accurate in 2050?"
"Yes, Europe will be faced with an ageing population."
"Yet, Japan and Russia will experience a declining population."
"What can be said, furthermore, about China, with its one-child policy?"
"What can be said about India and the other countries that are unable to curb the spiralling growth of their populations?"
"Which country will experience the greatest demographic problems by the year 2020, without even daring to talk about 2050?"
"If there is one area in which Europe could imitate the United States, it is that of immigration policy, which could be more generous."
"A large part of the United States’ surplus growth in the last decade comes from the contribution of the ten million Latin Americans and the hundreds of thousands of European and Asian scientists."
"Two weeks ago, the US Senate decided to award 330 000 additional Green Cards each year to highly qualified immigrants."
"Europe’s competitiveness is a constant concern."
"Comparing Europe with others in terms of its hourly competitiveness and particularly its industrial competitiveness, it is clear that we are easily beating the United States in the majority of economic sectors."
"The Commission’s communication on industrial policy recognises this."
"The European Union is still the first destination and the first source for international investments."
"In 2003, the investments of the 15 were four times higher in the ten new countries than in China, which received only 3.8% of European investment."
"Let us therefore stop being afraid of China."
"It is only natural that a country with 1.3 billion people should take a greater share in international trade but, in absolute figures, Europe’s share in international trade is increasing, even though some sectors are experiencing difficulties."
"However, nine tenths of our trade is not done with low-salary countries but with developed countries."
"Globalisation provides a great opportunity for reducing poverty in the world."
"For 50 years, growth in international trade has been faster than growth in gross world product."
"This demonstrates that foreign trade is not a no-stakes game, but has enabled millions of people to escape poverty while at the same time benefiting consumers in wealthy countries."
"It is in fact our consumers who, by buying the cheapest products, force our manufacturers to become more competitive."
"The Union remains the leading export power in the world, led by Germany, France and Italy."
"These three countries are nevertheless at a standstill in terms of internal growth."
"Their citizens are saving record amounts."
"For their part, the Americans and the British are consuming and getting into dangerous amounts of debt."
"In order to restart growth, we have to restore confidence among Europeans."
"There is no alternative to the market, but the market is unable to create the solidarity that is the distinctive sign of the European model."
"Political will is required in order to create more solidarity among our countries and within our countries."
"Policy always boils down to a question of resources and, on this point, I agree with Mr Barroso."
"It is budgetary resources that Europe sorely lacks."
"Mr Blair is right to encourage us to invest more in research and universities."
"This means that the Union’s budget should receive more in the way of resources than the paltry 1% of GDP that a few important countries, beginning with Great Britain, wish to grant."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will judge the Presidency on its ability to release a realistic, but more generous, financial perspective."
"The December Summit must be the Summit of renewed solidarity."
"A strong commitment from the 25 towards a coordinated reflationary policy, as well as greater national and trans-European infrastructure investment, will enable Europe to restart growth, which is a prerequisite for gaining acceptance of difficult structural reforms."
"It is growth that will create stability, and not the other way round."
"Thank you very much, Mr Goebbels."
"The debate is heating up, and this is positive in terms of ensuring that more Members become involved in it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can understand how the high-level relationship therapy at Hampton Court apparently proceeded as it should."
"It took place, however, in duly romantic and exclusive surroundings, so the odds were all on your side."
"Now that all the government leaders are home again after their therapy, we shall see for definite whether Tony Blair’s therapeutic efforts have borne fruit, for we all of course know that, when marriages begin to fall apart, couples often relapse into familiar bad habits."
"I therefore have a practical request to make to the Presidency and the Commission."
"In practice, there is really very little that the EU countries can do jointly to set in motion the necessary and desired process of reform aimed at modernising the European labour market so that it suits today’s society."
"We all know of course that this necessary work needs to be carried out by the individual Member States."
"Efforts at reform are an exclusively national matter."
"The EU can and must, however, complete the work on creating a fully-fledged internal market for capital and services."
"While the effects of the relationship therapy can still be felt, I would therefore call on the Presidency and the Commission to work towards ensuring that the European services and capital markets are fully liberalised."
"I am convinced that, if this process is a success, it will yield genuine labour market reforms on the basis of the motto, ‘There is no alternative’."
"The benefits to the people of such a reform would be huge, and that is of course what EU cooperation is all about: providing our fellow citizens with additional benefits."
"I should also like to put a clear question to you, Mr Straw."
"You mention the Court of Auditors’ annual report."
"Are you prepared to set a good example and ensure that you and the United Kingdom assume responsibility for administering an EU subsidy in your country, something that, unfortunately, your Chancellor last week refused to do?"
"I seek a clear answer from you."
"Thank you for your attention."
". Mr Straw, Mr Barroso, I have three remarks to make in response to your speech, Mr Straw."
"As regards the Hague Conference, which you mentioned, I will take the liberty of suggesting very modestly to you that you re-read the draft Constitution you signed which, in my opinion, includes solutions in relation both to the division of powers and to the role of national parliaments."
"Why abandon this draft?"
"With regard to social policy and the Working Time Directive, I agree with you: we must be in favour of national diversity but, if we must draw inspiration from one model, I should very much like to draw my inspiration from the Scandinavian model."
"On the subject of the single market, now: I hope that you will agree with me that competition also needs to be fair and balanced."
"In other words, the single market is also built on common social standards, and thus forms part of the very spirit of the Treaties."
"As regards the budget, lastly, I believe that we are encountering a real credibility problem in terms both of revenue and of spending – Mr Barroso and the European Parliament have sufficiently alluded to this."
"For the European Union of 25 to succeed and for us to express our ongoing solidarity towards the new Member States and to carry out an external policy with sufficient resources – possibly more than 5% of the budget - presupposes an increase in the Community budget."
"Above all – and this will be my final point – we must leave to one side a budgetary debate characterised by an increase in national self-interest."
"In the mid-term review requested by the Commission and Parliament, the Presidency and the entire European Council must make the political commitment to propose a European mechanism providing the European Union with real independent resources for the future of the Union’s policies."
"Armed with such a commitment, it will perhaps be possible for us to convince our citizens of the usefulness of European policy."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that we have the opportunity today, in the presence of the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission, to make an appraisal of the informal European Council held at the end of last month."
"Unfortunately, while the idea of convening the Council was not a bad idea, it suffered most in the execution."
"Indeed, at a time when the European Union is on its last legs, given that we have twenty million unemployed, where we do not know how to address social problems, especially those which broke out recently in France, and where the citizens' confidence in governments is falling by geometrical progression, the idea of the leaders of the European Union meeting in London in order to discuss the European social model and the resistance to globalisation was, on the face of it, a very good one."
"Unfortunately, instead of agreement prevailing, we again witnessed the customary quarrels break out about as important an issue to the future of Europe as the financial perspectives."
"I would remind the House that Mr Blair, during his speech from this same tribune in the European Parliament on 23 June, stated that he had always been an enthusiastic champion of Europe."
"I wonder, four and a half months later, how Mr Blair is translating these words into practice."
"What is the appraisal of his country's Presidency so far, given that one month before it ends we have not reached agreement on the financial perspectives."
"The social model has not progressed even one inch and the Council's response to globalisation is the creation of an ambiguous adjustment fund."
"I truly wonder, Mr President of the Commission, if you have seriously thought about the reaction of the workers made redundant when you tell them that there is the panacea of the fund for all the ills of globalisation."
"The British Presidency had the opportunity to write history at Hampton Court."
"Instead, it demonstrated once again that this is a union of interests which wastes time and public money on talks of no substance and whose mistakes, unfortunately, have to be paid for by the citizens of Europe."
". Mr President, the Hampton Court meeting was to be the ‘social model’ summit."
"Then Mr Blair socialised – the same Mr Blair who strode into Brussels in July promising root and branch reform, but then pruned it down to the most invisible square root of a branch of any EU Presidency in memory."
"The comments after Hampton Court were from those amazed that nothing happened."
"In fact it should be labelled the Hampton Court ‘aMaze’."
"The ARD TV station in Germany said that, after four months, nothing happened – absolutely nothing."
"The Polish media called it one of the most bizarre EU summits."
"In Italy, just called it ‘embarrassed’ and ‘embarrassing’."
"Mr Blair claimed it debated the things the public wanted it to debate, but the public does not want European policies for universities when the EU has no competence in education."
"Nor does it want things like nine separate missions around the world as part of an EU defence policy."
"If Hampton Court proved anything, it was that vacuums are dangerous when filled with hot air from politicians."
"I propose that a blue metal plaque be placed on the wall at Hampton Court saying: ‘On this spot on 27 October 2005 nothing happened’ or, as they say in Yorkshire: ‘Eee, you must be jokin’’."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to paraphrase your introductory words, Mr Straw, I am here and I beg to differ."
"Joking aside, despite Mr Blair’s and Mr Barroso’s welcome good intentions, the practical outcome of the Hampton Court Summit was highly unsatisfactory."
"First of all, the long-awaited platform on the Commission’s European social model seemed rather disappointing."
"No real strategy and no targets for a genuine revival of Europe’s economy were proposed; instead there was just a policy of damage limitation."
"So far there has been nothing concrete behind high-sounding claims such as the ‘Lisbonisation’ of resources and the globalisation fund."
"As for Mr Blair, the balance of his political account is certainly not in the black."
"Despite continual outward reassurances, there is in fact no agreement on the financial perspective, which is clearly the crux of the problem."
"Finally, there is no real intention above all to renew the debate on the United Kingdom’s unfair rebate."
"It is a privilege that has been paid for mainly by Italy and France, siphoning off precious resources from our two countries."
"Mr President, from the spin of today one would think that much had been achieved at Hampton Court, but as we have already heard, the verdict of the informed EU press was almost universally negative."
"One press agency reported that many papers could not recall a more useless and shallow example of posturing with no outcome."
"One paper talked of a bizarre show of relaxed leaders who dodged the most crucial issues facing Europe."
"Another called it a summit of impasse with a facade of forced smiles."
"The said in an article that the leaders attempted to answer the question of what impact globalisation would have on the European economy and concluded that we needed more research and development and, of course, more money. In other words, they failed to answer the question."
"The EU, the said, is the wrong institutional platform from which to deal with globalisation."
"It has become too large and divided. The appropriate political levels are national governments and the eurozone."
"I suggest that the article in the comes close to the truth."
"If individual Member States were to expend the same effort and energy addressing the issue of how, as nations, to compete in a global market as they did in preparing showcase summits, then I suspect we might all see much more product."
"My biggest fear arising from the failure of the Hampton Court summit and a lacklustre British Presidency is that it will make my government over-eager to secure a face-saving deal on the budget in December and that, as a result, Mr Blair will concede far too much on the British rebate, just so it can be said that something was achieved by the British Presidency – that is to say something other than ensuring EU bankruptcy by opening the door to Turkish accession."
"Mr President, I am very sorry but I am afraid I have to be a little bit churlish as well."
"The summit at Hampton Court was what I warned it would be: something of a talking shop – or even a talking palace."
"And I think that Mr Straw’s speech was as Churchill once said ‘a pudding without a theme’."
"First the Prime Minister downgraded the Hampton Court meeting to one day."
"He then constructed an agenda that was thin on specifics and avoided all the major and pressing issues facing the EU and finally, amazingly, he decided there would be no communiqué at the end."
"These are hardly the hallmarks of a Presidency and Prime Minister leading the agenda and shaping our future."
"I am frankly surprised the Presidency has anything at all to report to us from the summit."
"At least, however, this Parliament is receiving a report, something which the Prime Minister failed to give the British House of Commons in the aftermath of the event."
"The Informal Council was a wasted opportunity."
"Europe needs direction on economic reform."
"Instead, the Presidency produced a couple of discussion papers written by academics and even these were not discussed."
"Europe needs direction on reforming the so-called social model."
"Again all we had were a few worthy but irrelevant discussion papers."
"Europe needs direction on being more flexible and responsive."
"However, the fundamental issue of what to do following the rejection of the Constitution was not even on the table for discussion."
"Europe also needs direction on its future financing."
"There are serious issues here, not least the question of the rebate."
"But the Presidency continues to avoid the matter and the drift continues."
"I agree with Mr Barroso that the Presidency must make efforts to reach an outcome at the December Council."
"We will be looking carefully to see precisely what is contained there and whether Mr Blair ditches his previous commitments in protecting the British rebate."
"Transparency and openness is another issue for the Presidency."
"Recently I called for meetings of the Council to be held in public when it is operating in a legislative capacity."
"Mr Blair says he wants progress on this."
"I challenge the Presidency to implement such a procedure before its term of office ends and I look forward to the Council’s answer in this matter at Question Time following this debate."
"What about the Court of Auditors’ report on the EU accounts?"
"For the eleventh year in succession, the Court has been unable to give a statement of assurance on the accounts."
"This really must be sorted out by the Presidency."
"Drift and indecision have been a fundamental characteristic of the British Presidency."
"Indeed, the Prime Minister of Slovakia speaking on it said ‘silence reigns, we do not have information’."
"I must agree with that analysis and, whilst enjoying Mr Straw’s speech today, I cannot see that it takes us anywhere useful at all."
"Hampton Court provided no evidence that the Presidency and particularly that the Prime Minister had any strategy."
"He gave every appearance of drifting from summit to summit unable or unwilling to provide the kind of leadership we British Conservatives called for in June."
"Let us hope that the last chance saloon at the forthcoming Brussels Summit will demonstrate that my disappointment with the British Presidency is actually misplaced."
"Mr President, recently a terrorist suspect wanted by the British Government was arrested and extradited from Rome in a matter of weeks."
"This was a direct result of the European arrest warrant; previously it could have taken years."
"This is just one example of the positive benefits the European Union brings to its citizens."
"Each citizen has benefited from the single market by some EUR 6 000 a head in increased output."
"It is possible, if you wish, to swim in the sea off Blackpool in my region because of European Union laws that have improved the environment."
"Those are positive benefits for our citizens."
"We need to do more to shout those positive benefits."
"I welcome the papers that were presented at Hampton Court, because they deal with how the European Union can bring added value to our citizens, particularly in the area of the energy markets where we have a crisis waiting to happen."
"However, we have to ensure that there is follow-up on these matters."
"One of the difficulties with the Lisbon Agenda in particular is that Member States themselves promise to deliver but do not."
"I would hope that out of the Hampton Court discussions came a clarification of the role of Member States and the important role of the European Commission in ensuring that Member States carry out that which they have already agreed."
"If that were to happen, the European Union could move much further forward without necessarily having any of the grand plans that some people have outlined in this debate."
"Let us stick to delivering what we agreed to deliver."
"That will be the key success of the European Union."
"I congratulate the President-in-Office for the commitment made by this Presidency to Parliament."
"We are delighted at the extent to which ministers have engaged Parliament and particularly the extent to which the British Home Secretary has ensured that Parliament is involved in taking forward that security agenda."
"That is one of the most important dimensions of where the European Union is going in future to protect the interests of its citizens."
"Mr President, a meeting with little or no purpose, held in pleasant surroundings, under a warm autumn sun: that is what the Informal Summit at Hampton Court was."
"No practical outcome, no progress, no perspective."
"In short, the Heads of State or Government did not even attempt to outline the beginnings of a response to Europe’s deep crisis, just as though finally they were more than happy to put up with this crisis."
"Instead of formulating a response, they did what they usually do and trotted out the catalogue of proposals that have been repeated a thousand times over."
"Yes, the European effort in relation to research and development obviously needs to increase."
"Yes, centres of excellence at university level are obviously needed."
"Yes, a common energy policy is obviously needed."
"Yes, a real immigration policy is obviously needed too."
"Finally, yes, Europe obviously needs a security policy."
"We always come back to the same old problems, though."
"If we want to do things together, we need political will, we need effective and democratic institutions and we need a common budget."
"Well, it is clear that, in relation to these three points, nothing has been undertaken, or even attempted, by the UK Presidency."
"The UK Presidency has not only failed to get the Union working again, but has also contributed to its decline."
"From now on, the UK Presidency has clear responsibilities."
"Mr Straw, the December Summit will be the last chance to provide Europe with a substantial budget and to thus give hope back to all those who believe in Europe’s future."
"Yet, this will also be the last useful moment for the British Prime Minister if he is not to go down in history as the man who contributed to the failure of Europe and if he is not to go down in history as the one who deliberately turned the page on Europe’s political union."
"Mr President, if I may say so, Mr President-in-Office, the Hampton Court Summit was the biggest embarrassment that any Presidency has ever come up with."
"Far from making progress with the pressing problems of the Financial Perspective and the debate on the Constitution, these items were removed from the agenda."
"Even its chosen theme of ‘Social Europe’ was one to which the Summit found itself unable to do justice."
"There was no discussion of any of the policy instruments for a social Europe, whether minimum standards, labour legislation or the means whereby unemployment and social exclusion may be done away with."
"What you have proposed, Mr Straw, is particularism, and does nothing to advance the cause of social Europe."
"Instead of action, you offer only ideas; instead of pro-active measures to address globalisation, you have come up with knee-jerk responses like this idea for an anti-shock fund."
"Our aim, though, must not be the creation of a backward-looking Europe, but rather of a Europe that can face the future with confidence."
"– It is not enough simply to note that there are social problems in the EU and around the world."
"As my group said at the informal meeting held at the end of October, it is crucial that we analyse these problems and change the policies that are at the root of this problem."
"The truth of the matter is that what we have heard here offers no assurances that policies will be changed, even though it is widely acknowledged that there is growing discontent among the citizens and that there are serious social tensions in a number of countries, right here in the EU."
"Rather than much-needed proposals to provide an adequate response to these serious social problems, the Council puts the accent on the all too familiar neoliberal blueprint, namely the Lisbon Strategy, with its liberalisations and privatisations of public services, along with even more precarious working conditions."
"The infamous proposal for a directive creating an internal market for services is one such example, as, in some cases, is the Stability and Growth Pact, hammering a further nail in the coffin of the workers and the small and medium-sized enterprises."
"As competition is seen as the be-all-and-end-all, precedence is always given to measures aimed at creating competition between workers in order to try to drive salaries and other social benefits further and further down."
"Hence the emphasis on greater labour flexibility, mobility and support for relocations, which shed jobs and lead to greater unemployment and a more precarious labour market."
"As demonstrated by the huge growth in the profit margins of the major economic and financial groups in the EU, current policies are essentially geared towards pandering to the wishes of the Union of Industrial and Employers Confederations of Europe (UNICE)."
"What we have heard today follows the same script."
"Even when people talk of creating a favourable environment for companies, we all know that the companies in question are only the large ones."
"Mr Mandelson made this perfectly clear here yesterday in the answers he gave regarding concerns about the consequences of the liberalisation of international trade in industrial sectors that are vitally important to the countries of Southern Europe, such as textiles, clothing and footwear, which are being used as a bargaining chip in World Trade Organisation negotiations to obtain benefits for high-tech sectors and services."
"This is a trend that must be reversed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that the Heads of State or Government meeting at Hampton Court were debating in a vacuum."
"On the great social, economic and political issues, which have been mentioned in many of the previous speeches, the results achieved were decidedly sparse."
"While cities are burning across half of Europe, I feel it is terrible that they should talk in such general and imprecise terms about immigration and about the social and economic crisis, which are in fact the cause of what is happening in Paris, Strasbourg and Brussels."
"The challenge that the young rioters have set us is, instead, a very serious threat, and one that we should consider carefully when we talk about immigration."
"I certainly do not mean to put the blame on those young people, but rather on those who drew up these mistaken policies, those who still talk about immigration in such bureaucratic, general and superficial terms."
"We have fallen short in the immigration challenge."
"Our immigration policies have been a failure for Europe, and I consider it our duty to acknowledge the fact and to debate it."
"I believe this summit should have set an example in this respect, and the solution proposed by the Commission – allocating a fistful of cash to the Paris – is not, in my view, an adequate answer."
"Instead we need to address the causes, change our policy and stop making insane decisions, such as making it easy for people to bring in their families or even easier to take up nationality."
"In essence, what we need is a sensible immigration policy."
"Mr President, Minister, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the talks held by the Heads of State or Government at Hampton Court represent a significant acknowledgment of the difficulties that the European Union is currently undergoing."
"The fact that the 25 have recovered their composure after the tensions of recent months and that they are willing to bring the negotiations on the financial perspective to a close by December should be seen in a positive light."
"I should like, however, to draw the Council’s attention to the fact that agreement must not be reached by taking the lowest common denominator and, above all, that Parliament’s position must not be ignored."
"The priorities identified by Tony Blair for revitalising Europe – research, innovation and life-long learning – are proposals worth endorsing and are in fact contained in our report on the financial perspective."
"In addition, the need for a European energy policy, the increase in Community aid for immigration transit countries and the globalisation compensation fund are priority aims for Europe, though they require adequate funding."
"The citizens of the Union are aware that no government on its own can provide answers to the most serious of today’s problems, such as unemployment, the lack of job stability, the loss of competitiveness, international terrorism and illegal immigration."
"Only Europe can respond effectively and guarantee well-being and security for our countries."
"A meagre budget will not allow us to address these challenges, but the October European Council was an encouraging start."
"That is why we are looking to the December summit with moderate optimism."
"Mr President, I have looked up the word ‘informal’ in my French dictionary."
"Informal, in French, means badly formed and inelegant."
"This adjective was used by Montaigne in 1580 to describe something that was difficult to define."
"I will let you be the judges of the Hampton Court summit and the ghost of Catherine Howard."
"You have not had much luck in the UK Presidency."
"France has said no and the United Kingdom is being asked to relaunch Europe."
"I think that is asking a lot."
"Having said that, over a number of years, a number of landscapes have opened up to our citizens, with which they have been living and have had to live, namely the reunification of Europe, the Constitution, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the single market and the single currency."
"When I think of our fellow citizens, I have the feeling that Lisbon is not fulfilling this role."
"Today, there is a vacuum."
"When it comes down to it, I do not dispute the priorities of the summit: that is not the problem."
"The real problem is the connection with the citizens: it is as if there used to be something we shared that has now disappeared."
"I think that the next summit or the ones after that should enable us to rediscover a landscape that we can share with our citizens."
"Of course, this brings to mind the cohesion of the 25 Member States, which is sometimes called the Marshall Plan for those who are joining us, because endless enlargement and greed for funding do not escape the notice of the citizens."
"That is no good at all."
"In my opinion, it would be worthwhile, in spite of everything, to restore the word ‘harmonisation’ to the European vocabulary, given that it is, so to speak, an endangered species; this is also unfortunate, all the more so as there are still areas that need to be harmonised."
"We are not going to harmonise everything, but it is still possible to make progress in certain areas."
"And if we forget to do this, if we neglect this word and this value, the citizens will distance themselves from us."
"Finally, another topic is close to my heart, that of exchanges between young people."
"I have looked at the statistics."
"In 2005-2006, Europe is funding 280 000 young people as part of three programmes: Comenius, Erasmus and Leonardo."
"However, there are 58 million of them."
"Multiplying the corresponding budget by 10 would not cost us too much, particularly given that it is on these young people that we must stake European awareness."
". Mr President, I would like to deal with two specific points and then comment more widely on the debate."
"Mrs Riis-Jørgensen asked me about the Court of Auditors and she asked for a yes or no answer."
"My apologies, but I have to give a yes and a no because this matter is in the hands of finance ministers, and you know what they are like!"
"The answer is that the Ecofin Council on 8 November adopted conclusions listing a range of actions for both the Commission and Member States."
"They talked about a roadmap which they said was vital, not least because it focuses greater attention on Member States’ responsibility to improve their systems of auditing and to take responsibility for the money spent in their countries."
"My judgement is that where Member States have control of the money, they ought properly to account for it as well."
"If they do not have control of it then the European Union will have to account for it, but I am with you on encouraging our finance ministers to get a grip on this."
"Nevertheless, this is the responsibility of the Commission and of this Parliament together."
"We all have responsibility for this."
"On the issue of transparency, which Mr Kirkhope raised with me, we will shortly be circulating an options paper with ideas for improving transparency, and essentially will be putting two options before the Council."
"It will be up to the Council to take a decision on the basis of a simple majority, as with all procedural issues, so I am glad to be able to satisfy you in this respect, Mr Kirkhope, if not in any others."
"Colleagues here have been very frank, so I will be frank in return."
"My problem with what a number of colleagues have said is that people refer to the need for change and then say that the future for the European Union nevertheless lies in the past."
"All I can say to colleagues here is that globalisation is a fact of life."
"The French, my comrade friend, may not like it, but we either have to deal with it or it will engulf all of us."
"I did not invent it, President Barroso did not invent it and nor indeed did President Chirac, but it is a fact of life."
"It has come about as a result of other policies that we have pursued over many years, namely to build up the World Trade Organization, to encourage free trade and to lift countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America out of poverty, meaning that they now want to share in trade and they want to work to their competitive advantage, just as we have done in the past."
"That means that the old European economic and social model will not work to deliver prosperity, social justice and jobs in the way it used to."
"This is a big challenge, especially, if I may say so, for the country you represent, and for a number of others on the continent."
"However, I simply do not understand why you continue to clutch at old methods, such as inflexible methods of labour regulation, including the Working Time Directive, which may have worked in the past but which cannot work for the future."
"France is a country which knows that, and it is for that reason there is a higher level of evasion in France than in other countries."
"France is one of those countries which goes in for saying, as we understand it, that people can be assessed on whether they work 48 hours a contract rather than 48 hours an employer."
"We do not want to be lectured about our employment practices when we enforce the law, even if it is inconvenient, by countries which bang the drum for enforcement and then go through the back door to ensure that the law is not enforced."
"This is a fact, and this Parliament undermines confidence in its own measures if it turns a blind eye to what is going on when everyone knows that this has happened."
"Moreover, it is better to be flexible."
"There is no European-wide requirement to set a minimum wage, which in my view is a fundamental human right."
"There is no requirement on it, however, and it is left to national governments."
"Some countries have a minimum wage and some do not, so why should there be a requirement across Europe regardless of national circumstances and the nature of employment contracts, to set limits on working hours when the test for that ought to be health and safety?"
"The countries that apparently have slightly longer hours actually have a better health and safety record than some other countries, including, my friend, your own."
"Turning to the important issue of the budget, I listened very carefully to President Barroso’s speech."
"He said that the defining issue of the British Presidency will be the financial perspective, which is a test of whether Europe is on the move."
"It certainly is a test of whether Europe is on the move, but we do not regard it as the defining issue."
"If you asked me to bet on what historians will judge to be the defining issue of this Presidency in ten or twenty years’ time, I would not bet on it being whether or not we reached agreement on the financial perspective in December, although I hope we do."
"I think it will be judged on the fact that on 3 October we agreed to start negotiations with Croatia and Turkey."
"That is what will help to shape Europe for the future."
"I would remind colleagues that the last financial perspective was not agreed until the equivalent of the March Council 2006, rather than the December Council 2005."
"We very much hope that we can reach agreement, but it is going to be difficult."
"Why?"
"Well, Mr Jonckheer spoke of not allowing this issue to be dominated by national egos."
"I agree with that but would say to colleagues – and they know this to be true – that this debate is bound to be dominated by the different national perspectives and by whether a country has traditionally been a high contributor or a net recipient of funds from the European Union."
"That is a fact."
"If one ignores that or abuses those of us – including Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and a number of other Member States whose citizens have real concerns about the amount they have paid in the past and the amount they will pay in the future – by saying that this is all about national egotism, we will not get anywhere."
"I would remind those colleagues from Belgium that their country has been a net recipient, despite the fact that it is a wealthy country, and will continue to be so under any of the exemplifications of the budget between 2006, 2007 and 2013."
"Luxembourg – a country that I like very much – is the richest country in Europe but will continue to be a net beneficiary."
"If we were in that happy position we would be saying to the Presidency: ‘Come on, do a deal’."
"If the only issue was whether we ended up with EUR 3 billion or EUR 6 billion in our pockets, that would be easy."
"The problem, however, for a number of Member States – and not just the United Kingdom – is that we have historically been very high contributors."
"I am just saying this so that colleagues can understand the problem we have within the United Kingdom."
"We might as well lay our cards on the table and be frank."
"The problem is that over the latest financial perspective the UK has paid EUR 39 billion, France has paid EUR 28 billion, Italy has paid EUR 24 billion and Germany has paid EUR 77 billion, which is another extreme."
"However, the UK has still paid EUR 39 billion, which in population terms is much more than those other two countries."
"Spain has benefited by EUR 48 billion and Portugal by EUR 14 billion, so that puts a different perspective on things."
"I agree that we have all got to pay our way for enlargement."
"With any, even the most minimal, change to the financial perspective, or no change at all, the United Kingdom would be paying another EUR 11 billion – getting on for another third more – towards the next financial perspective to pay for enlargement."
"The issue is not whether the United Kingdom or the better off countries pay a bit more for enlargement – though some better off countries would not pay anything extra – but of how much more one pays in a context in which the United Kingdom has, over the last 20 years, paid 2.5 times the equivalent of say France or Italy, notwithstanding the fact that our GNIs have been equivalent over that period."
"That is the problem."
"We are working through it."
"We see our responsibility as being to the Union as well as to our publics."
"No one can accuse my Prime Minister of not being courageous or of not being very committed to this Union, as we have done a great deal."
"I just wanted to make that clear so that everyone understands the difficulties we all face."
"The last thing point I wish to make, on a more hopeful tack, is that President Barroso spoke very eloquently about the fact that the European Union has to do less in some areas and more in others, and I think that is exactly the right way of looking at things."
"This is not about a minimalist Europe, because Europe’s achievements have been astonishing over the last 60 years when one recalls the condition of conflict which had characterised Europe for three centuries prior to that."
"When I look around other areas of conflict today, particularly the Middle East, with horror, it reminds me of the Britain that I grew up in as a young child just after the war and of the even worse conditions that existed on the Continent."
"That is the European Union’s achievement."
"What we have to do for the future, however, is to build on that achievement and recognise that the challenges are a little different."
"One of the areas in which we can do the greatest good, and are doing so with the great leadership of Javier Solana and the Commission, is in the field of foreign, defence and security policy."
"Take what was agreed yesterday by Condoleezza Rice and Javier Solana."
"Take the fact that the European Union is now the third party in that agreement to allow Palestinians to travel in and out of Gaza and the West Bank."
"We were not always regarded by the government of Israel as the third party in such matters."
"Take what we are doing together with respect to Iran, take the joint declaration we have just agreed with Afghanistan and take the tangible increase in aid of Africa."
"It is here that we can see real progress being made by Europe collectively."
"It is in this area, as well as in many others, that we need to do more, and at the same time rebalance what the Union does compared to what national, regional and local government does in respect of domestic policy."
"This Presidency has been a great privilege for us, Mr President."
"I have certainly enjoyed it, and I look forward to another six weeks of interesting times here in Strasbourg, Brussels and in other cities."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, the UK Presidency and Tony Blair are actually victims of the great expectations that the UK Prime Minister raised in his speech to this Parliament on 2 July."
"Obviously, the greater the expectations, the greater the subsequent disappointment."
"Time is running out, results are thin on the ground, and I do not think the UK Presidency should be surprised at the criticism that Parliament is levelling at it in this debate."
"In fact, rather than an informal Council, this was an insubstantial Council: instead of debating the European social model last month, as it should have done, it found itself holding a discussion about the four corners of the world, without coming to any decision."
"I am not going to set fire to myself in public for the Constitution, but I think that the limitation of having six-month presidencies is emerging very clearly."
"Every presidency in fact inherits the previous presidency’s agenda and adds a new layer of commitments, thus increasing the list of decisions to be made and reducing the chapter of decisions adopted."
"We continue to add ingredients to the cake, but the cake never leaves the oven."
"I should like to mention an example that I put to President Barroso yesterday evening."
"It is true that Europe has been through other severe crises in the past."
"I am not nostalgic for the Europe of six, nor do I believe there is a golden age to long for."
"However, when your girlfriend leaves you when you are 18, life seems very harsh but you know that things will carry on anyway, whereas when a marriage fails at the age of 45, with five children and a mortgage to pay, everything is more complicated."
"It seems to me that Europe’s situation at this point in time, post-enlargement and pre-Constitution, resembles the second case much more than the first."
"I am not frightened of the institutional crisis, the financial perspective or the Lisbon Strategy in themselves, but I am afraid that all these elements together may be extremely damaging to the European Union."
"The UK Presidency still has six weeks to bring its work to a close, and I hope it will be able to leave a positive message for tomorrow’s Europe."
"Mr President, normally I would complain that one minute is not enough to sum up a presidency in its latter stages, but not in this instance."
"UK Presidency: no progress."
"It is interesting that Mr Straw commented on the sparse attendance here and made an extremely limp attempt to be humorous about it."
"The fact is that most of my colleagues had better things to do than to listen to him give the same speech today that Tony Blair gave at the start of the Presidency and then repeated with minor variations just a couple of weeks ago."
"I had hoped, had Mr Straw still been here, to ask him the same question that Mr Alexander failed to answer when I put it to him directly a couple of weeks ago, but I will ask it again."
"Will the UK Presidency give an assurance that the interests of Scotland’s fishing communities will not be traded away in the interests of something more important to Whitehall in the mess of horse-trading it has stored up for itself for the December Council, and for the subsequent Fisheries Council, which will be almost the last act of the Presidency?"
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I object in principle to the setting up of the so-called globalisation fund as a response to the challenges of globalisation."
"This is simply sweeping the problem under the carpet, and indicative of the populism of politicians who are afraid to tell the citizens the truth that globalisation is, was and will be here to stay, and that while it may lead to some job losses it will also, and in particular, lead to fresh job opportunities being created."
"There is much to be gained from globalisation, but only in a flexible free market environment in which working is worthwhile."
"European policy is often at variance with this idea, inviting citizens to be passive and sometimes even rewarding laziness."
"The EU’s share of world trade has dwindled over the past 10 years, while that of the United States, and in particular China and India, has skyrocketed."
"This is how the free market rates the EU’s policies, and yet the leaders of the 25 once again react with redistribution policies, which might act as a sticking plaster for the present, but under no circumstances are they a long-term remedy for the future."
"I am convinced that instead of wrangling over the protectionist globalisation fund, the EU Member States should as a matter of urgency reform their labour markets."
"Putting off such reforms undermines public support for free market policies and creates a breeding ground for nationalism, xenophobia and racism."
"Mr President, Mr Alexander, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is facing an identity crisis, a loss of its values and general disillusionment."
"For the first time in a long while, Europeans are afraid that their children’s standard of living is going to be lower than theirs."
"How can we react and provide a response to these major worries?"
"The Hampton Court summit claimed to be a stage in these considerations."
"I am afraid that it produced very little in the way of concrete results since, even if the questions raised were justified, specifically ‘do one or more European models exist in a globalised world?’, the response given to this question lacks clarity, to say the least."
"Europe has been plunged into this crisis because it does not know what it wants."
"It is divided: for some, the sole aim is to turn it into a commercial area without customs barriers, in short a Europe running behind the train of globalisation with an endlessly expanding Union."
"Others have a different vision, a political ambition for Europe to be defined by its borders and by its projects, in order to assert itself and to share its humanist values in an unstable world."
"French MEPs belonging to the (UMP), like the vast majority of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, have made a clear choice to fight for the latter vision to prevail, aware of the challenge to which we must rise."
"France’s proposals, broadcast throughout the EU by President Chirac on the eve of the summit, have the merit of placing the emphasis on the need both to complete the single market, to promote solidarity between the Member States and to guarantee the emergence of a Europe of grand designs."
"In order to contemplate a relaunch of Europe, however, the European Council must first remove a basic obstacle, because, given that almost all of the Member States have reached a common opinion on the financial perspective 2007–2013, on the basis of the negotiations undertaken by the Luxembourg Presidency, they absolutely must reach an agreement by the end of the year."
"Any other debate would be nothing but guesswork."
"Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order, in accordance with Rule 65(c), if I remember correctly."
"We have just been listening to the British Foreign Minister."
"I would like, via your Presidency, to ask the Conference of Presidents the following question."
"My colleague has just spoken for one minute."
"Her Britannic Majesty’s Minister with responsibility for European affairs is with us."
"How can the European Parliament allow itself to be limited to just one minute’s speaking time to respond to him?"
"Could you perhaps speak to your colleagues in the Conference of Presidents, to decide what approach should be taken in future?"
"Thank you Mr Beazley, I think we have understood your argument."
"It is the political groups that divide up the speaking time."
"If they want to give their main speakers 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour, they have the right to do so, and the opposite is also true."
"The time taken by the Commission and the Council is not counted, but both of them, I have observed, are careful not to abuse this."
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those who have appreciated and still appreciate the efforts made by this Presidency to try to revitalise Europe, with its hopes and its challenges, at this difficult time."
"It has done so through actions and commitments, including practical ones."
"I refer to the positive outcome of the Turkish question, which would not have been possible without a strong commitment from the UK Presidency, and to its ability to give direction, vision and some clear objectives that were subsequently put into practice, at least potentially, at Hampton Court, namely universities, energy, security and defence policy."
"Precisely from looking at those great ambitions and the few concrete results achieved, however, I must say that I am increasingly convinced – and I invite you all to reflect on this as well – that there is an enormous contradiction between the potential of that Europe and the illusion that such results can be achieved by a Europe that has less money than it needs and, above all, is unwilling to change its rules."
"What I mean is that, even if we only want to achieve half of those objectives and we want to treat each other fairly, we have to deal thoroughly with the core issues of the crisis."
"Addressing those issues implies having more resources, which will have to be used better; it also implies having less intergovernmental Europe and more integrated Europe, more political Europe, meaning new rules for the Commission, precisely so that we can achieve the objectives that we have already set ourselves."
"The only possible way forward now is to design a new institutional architecture and to share policies to an ever greater extent."
"Maintaining the , which is perhaps the UK Presidency’s greatest achievement, will inevitably lead to a renationalisation of policies, aggravating the crisis, increasing governments’ powers of veto and diminishing the ability of summits to reach decisions."
"I hope, therefore, that these six months will succeed in convincing even the most sceptical that it is not enough to have good ideas and to show willingness: we must also realise that either we have the courage to change by taking a leap forwards along the road to integration, or we die."
"Mr President, I would be fascinated to know at what stage the British Presidency realised that to have adopted as its logo a flight of birds heading towards Europe was a mistake!"
"If the British Presidency does not secure a deal on the future budget perspectives, it will not be regarded as a success."
"I agree that movement has to be made on the issue of agriculture."
"While the British Presidency has to recognise that, at some point, it is going to have to compromise, it is also important for other Member States to realise that they must give too."
"At some point the French – above all, it seems – must give something to enable those seeking a deal to be able to point to future changes and reviews of the agricultural policy, not just to help the UK out of a difficult situation but to help the world secure an agreement on the Doha Development Round."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you are aware of the increasing impatience with your presidency and of the growing sense of disappointment."
"Your period in office may well not yet be at an end, but most of it is already over."
"It is not only Tony Blair whose absence we regret, but I do wonder whether he had perhaps recognised at last that there is more to a successful presidency of the Council than two good speeches."
"Above all, though, we regret the lack of concrete results, constructive proposals, and serious negotiations with this House in order to resolve problems and hammer out answers to people’s questions."
"The only way we will create trust is with a new togetherness and sustainable solutions."
"It may be that your Foreign Secretary let something slip when, instead of looking forward, he said, ‘The important thing about this Presidency – Croatia and Turkey – is already behind us.’"
"Let me ask you this: are those really the things that the people of Europe see as priorities?"
"Are those really the issues for the people who have no work, or for the Europe that must be made more competitive?"
"No, I say, they are not."
"Perhaps they have their priorities wrong."
"Declarations of intent alone do not make for a successful Presidency."
"All six of the points that emerged from Hampton Court may well be right, but most of them are not things that the European Union has the powers to deal with."
"If you want us to achieve the things that you yourself postulate, then give us the powers, give us the money, and do not stand in Europe’s way as it moves towards political union, or in the way of the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"Let me turn to the Financial Perspective."
"Between your proposal and our own there is a difference of EUR 70 billion."
"Between your proposal and the Treaty, there is a difference of EUR 2 billion. Between your proposal and the Commission’s, there is a difference of over EUR 100 billion."
"Tell the people what it is that you intend taking away from them before you start pretending to be on their side ..."
"Mr President, the Hampton Court summit showed that the European Union needs fundamental reform."
"The European Union needs to harmonise research and development, to significantly increase expenditures on education, to liberalise services and put in place a common European energy policy, and it needs all of these at the same time."
"We have the diagnosis, but European leaders have so far failed to provide the answers."
"We know what we should do, but not how these aims can be achieved."
"We do not have the resources to do it either."
"We cannot have more Europe with less money."
"Agreement has still not been reached on the Financial Perspective 2007–2013, which could be a disaster for us, the new Member States, as we stand to lose two-thirds of our possible financial support."
"This is why the financial directive is so important for us."
"I also think it is important, since Mr Tony Blair has attacked the common agricultural policy, that the way forward for us is not to demolish existing Community policy, as cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy are major achievements of the European Union."
"Rather than demolishing these, more Community policy should be implemented in other areas."
"The big question is how to do all this."
"Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány proposed that, alongside Community policies, we should establish coordinated cooperation, which would mean harmonising national policy in the different areas."
"This would not mean new Community policies, but would help to improve cooperation, be it on energy, be it on research and development."
"I call upon Mr Barroso and the Commission: let us help Europe heal its current crisis and let us move forward in the area of coordinated cooperation."
"Mr President, the British are famous for their nerves of steel, their reserve, their calmness, their peculiar sense of humour and also for their emotional self-restraint."
"I was therefore very surprised to hear Lord Bach say yesterday that if a compromise on the REACH regulation is not adopted before the year is out, he will consider it both a personal failure and a failure on the part of the British Presidency."
"I should like to take this opportunity today to ask Mr Alexander whether we will hear that he shares these sentiments."
"If the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective is not adopted before the year is out, will you too consider this to be a personal failure, on your part and on the part of Prime Minister Blair?"
"Tony Blair gave a fine speech to the House in Brussels in June, and his analysis of the crisis in which Europe finds itself was worthy of publication."
"Unfortunately, during the following months and subsequent ministerial speeches we have heard nothing but increasingly pale repetitions of the Prime Minister’s proposals."
"My impression is that the British have lost the will to fight for the realisation of their vision of the European Union."
"Instead, they have decided to muddle through this six-month Presidency as best they can."
"Unfortunately, they too have been infected with the European disease of impotence and paralysis."
"At the same time, however, I have to admit that after the questions and speeches of Members of this House had left him with no other option, Mr Straw finally started to talk about business like a normal human being, which is how a politician should talk."
"Europe can only be built by means of effective action and decisions that will be forever writ large in the history of our continent."
"The way in which the Presidency is putting off the debate on the Financial Perspective until the last minute, as well as preparing the budget proposals behind closed doors and talking in Orwellian newspeak about the problems of civilisation faced by the world instead of holding a hard-hitting debate on the business at hand, amounts either to time-wasting or to a deliberate attempt to pass the hot potato of the budget on to Vienna in December."
"The most important task we face today is the Financial Perspective."
"Estimates suggest that if this Perspective is not adopted, the new Member States will receive EUR 10 billion for development in 2007."
"If it is adopted, however, this figure will rise to around EUR 22 billion, with an additional EUR 3.5 billion for Romania and Bulgaria."
"These countries would therefore lose out on around 60% of the money they could potentially receive."
"I would ask you to take this Financial Perspective seriously, and to embark on effective measures to ensure that it is adopted in December."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, we are today discussing the outcome of the informal meeting of the European Council at Hampton Court, and not the performance of the six-month British Presidency."
"I am content with the outcome of Hampton Court."
"The meeting clearly identified six areas that are crucial to Europe’s survival and success in the globalised world, which included science and research, investment in our universities, energy policy, global security and the common foreign and security policy."
"Let us take a look at the energy situation, for example."
"Europe is increasingly dependent, already to the tune of 65%, on one source and that source is in very unstable regions, either former Soviet territories or the Middle East."
"We therefore need a common energy policy, and a common foreign and security policy, although first and foremost we need money to finance these common policies."
"At this point, I should like to call on the British Presidency to channel all its efforts into achieving a fair and well-balanced deal at the December summit, not only for the new Member States but also for the old ones."
"That would be the biggest achievement of the British Presidency, which will be under discussion on 20 December."
"I believe that the outcome will be a positive one."
"Mr President, Mr Straw proudly told us that we have had 48 ministerial speeches during the British Presidency but I have to say that we have very little to show for any of them."
"I am amazed that with just a month to go before it comes to an end, the UK Presidency is still talking about agendas, strategies and timetables."
"I speak for those many people of East Anglia who want to see action, security, prosperity and a real change of direction in the EU, rather than empty promises."
"Citizens of many countries have woken up to what has been happening in their name."
"They seriously question the nature and direction of the EU project."
"People want more local control over their own lives, but our governments continue to cede powers to regions and to Brussels."
"I ask you: what sort of relationship with what sort of Europe is right for our people and our nations in this first half of the 21st century?"
"That vital question is never asked by our government or by the EU institutions."
"It should perhaps have been the central question at Hampton Court."
"The fact is that at Hampton Court there was no fundamental reappraisal of the European Union."
"It just carries on regardless."
"There is no end to unhelpful legislation."
"Mr Straw mentioned the working time directive and the temporary workers directive."
"There are dozens more such irrelevant and interfering items of EU legislation on the stocks."
"What is being done about all this?"
"The budget was mentioned."
"Pretty fundamental, but still unresolved."
"In comparison with a similar sized economy such as France, the United Kingdom already contributes disproportionately to the EU budget and that is after Margaret Thatcher’s rebate."
"Apparently you want us to pay more. Meanwhile our nations and societies are being dangerously fractured as a consequence of catastrophic asylum and immigration policies."
"Instead of creating and sustaining world class centres of academic excellence, we are destroying them through lack of funding and misconceived class-driven doctrines."
"Our armed forces are desperately over-stretched and lack key items of equipment. At the same time gallant officers and soldiers are hung out to dry by a government-inspired system that cares little for their wellbeing but everything for its own political agenda…"
"Mr President, the Hampton Court Summit was to discuss how Europe could do better in the world."
"People in Ethiopia voted in their masses in May under EU eyes, but the first results did not please the ruling party."
"Suddenly, the observers were obstructed, media openness was suppressed and demonstrations were banned."
"People were brutally repressed in June: over 40 were killed and 5 000 arrested."
"Despite that, a few weeks later, Prime Minister Meles attended the Gleneagles Summit hosted by the British Presidency."
"In September, several governments and the President of the Commission sent him messages of congratulation."
"On 1 November, another bloodbath took place: 58 elected leaders, journalists and NGO members are in jail and, according to the Prime Minister, face the death penalty; dozens more were killed, hundreds wounded and thousands were arrested."
"Yet, a few days later Mr Meles was officially wined and dined in Germany."
"President-in-Office, why does the Council send contradictory signals instilling a sense of impunity in rulers who violate human rights and democratic principles, rulers who may then choose to go to war with neighbours to divert attention?"
"Did you consider this at Hampton Court?"
"Can the President-in-Office say that Europe is doing enough and doing its best for human rights, democracy and development in Ethiopia, the second most populous country in Africa?"
". Mr President, it is an honour to conclude this debate today on the discussions that took place at Hampton Court."
"It is a particular pleasure for me to be speaking alongside President Barroso."
"The debate following the departure of Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was taken forward by Mr Pistelli, who spoke of the European Union being like a family."
"Clearly, on the basis of our brief discussion this afternoon, it is a family within which, like any other family, there can be disagreements from time to time."
"But I certainly concur with his view that there are challenges that we face in the weeks ahead."
"A rather less lofty point was then made by Mr Hudghton."
"As a fellow Scottish representative, a Member of Parliament representing a Scottish seat, I would happily spend all day debating with him why backward-looking nineteenth century nationalism offers no future to any part of Scotland, nor to any group within Scotland."
"But I, unlike him, am aware that I speak today for the Presidency of the European Union rather than simply rehearsing domestic political disputes between our parties."
"Mrs Bobošíková spoke of the opportunities provided by globalisation."
"With that I certainly concur; that was a central focus of much of the constructive and useful discussion that took place at Hampton Court."
"Mrs Sudre emphasised the need for agreement on future financing by the end of December."
"As the Foreign Secretary made clear, we are working towards that aim."
"Indeed, a number of other speakers addressed this continuing issue of the importance of reaching agreement."
"I will say a word about that in a moment."
"Mr Zingaretti generously acknowledged the importance of Turkish accession."
"For that I am grateful."
"It reflects the distinctive approach taken by Jack Straw as the Foreign Secretary, whereby – somewhat similar to future financing – questions were raised as to the strategy the Presidency was adopting."
"I am glad to say that on the occasion of 3 October we secured the outcome for which so many of us had worked for so long: seeing the accession talks beginning both with Turkey and Croatia."
"I hope that we achieve a similar outcome in relation to future financing."
"Mr Davies, who has now left the Chamber, again emphasised the importance of future financing."
"On the basis of the British motivation and indeed the British capacity to deliver the deal, what matters is not the will of one country – of the Presidency – but the willingness of all Member States to work together to find a consensus."
"If what mattered was simply the motivation of the Presidency, we would have seen agreement reached in June rather a situation in which five Member States were unable to accept the Luxembourg proposals."
"Mr Karas questioned the importance of enlargement in the face of enduring significant competitive challenges that we face, such as unemployment."
"Surely the very point that he makes about enduring unemployment and the need for us to address those challenges, makes the case for Hampton Court."
"It is necessary for Europe to have a clearer sense as to its future direction before we would be able to try and secure the consensus we want on the basis of the financing of the European Union."
"Mr Tabajdi offered a qualified welcome to particular aspects of the work programme that was agreed at Hampton Court and Mr Sonik quoted to me the earlier remarks of my ministerial colleague, Lord Bach."
"I am sorry to disappoint him: as regards future financing, there can be no guarantees that agreement can be reached."
"What I can guarantee is that the British Presidency is earnest in our endeavours to try and reach that agreement, but critical days and critical discussions lie ahead."
"It is important for all the relevant parties to recognise how significant the progress reached since June – where disunity rather than unity was the hallmark of the conclusion of the discussions – will need to be."
"Mr Rouček said that he was content with the outcome of Hampton Court and argued for an honest, fair and well-balanced deal on future financing."
"With that I would have no disagreement."
"I disagree with many of the points that were raised by Mr Van Orden, who has now left the Chamber."
"He ranged very widely indeed while claiming to speak for the people of East Anglia, before having his microphone switched off."
"Suffice it to say that he did not have the chance during his speech to acknowledge the invaluable work that had been undertaken by the Commission in the course of the British Presidency on exactly that issue of better regulation."
"Today I pay tribute to the personal commitment of President Barroso and indeed to Commissioner Verheugen in driving forward this agenda during the British Presidency."
"Mrs Gomes raised important challenging points in relation to human rights, democracy and development within Africa."
"Again, I would simply return to the progress that was made by European Union development ministers back in June, when we effectively agreed to double the level of overseas direct assistance provided by Member States from approximately USD 40 billion to USD 80 billion."
"I would re-emphasise the commitment reached at Gleneagles between 6 and 8 July effectively to double the aid being provided to Africa."
"I would reflect again on the very constructive and unified approach taken by European Union Member States at the Millennium Review Summit which took place in September of this year."
"I should like to echo a point made earlier by Mr Davies, that those of us who are sincere and genuine in our commitment to help the developing world recognise that there is a continuing challenge that lies ahead of us in the remaining weeks of the British Presidency, which is to try and have an ambitious and balanced outcome to the Hong Kong ministerial meeting that will take place in December."
"I can assure Members that this remains a continuing priority of the British Presidency."
". Mr President, to sum up, there will be a defining issue for the British Presidency: to get an agreement on the financial perspectives."
"I think that message was very clearly transmitted to the British Presidency today."
"I understand what the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said before he left about other issues that were very important and that will have strategic consequences."
"Precisely because of that, it is important to get an agreement on the financial perspectives, because this will be the first test for the enlarged Europe."
"Let us be frank."
"There are some people who believe that with 25 Member States we cannot work and we cannot deliver."
"There are some people who believe that a greater Europe will be a weaker Europe."
"I know that is not the idea of the British Presidency, I know that is not the idea of the Commission."
"We believe in this greater Europe we are now building."
"We believe it is a great achievement that we now have 25 free, democratic Member States – as we have."
"However, we cannot do enlargement on the cheap."
"We need resources for this new Europe that we are helping to consolidate."
"That is why it is crucially important to have an agreement on the financial perspectives, because if not, if we do not have that instrument for what people are asking of the European institutions, there will be, and I really believe this, a crisis of confidence that will be reinforced in Europe."
"And this not only applies to the current situation in Europe, but also to the future of Europe, future accessions to Europe, to our capability to build a Europe."
"However, for a greater Europe we need greater politics."
"And that is the point."
"Are we ready?"
"Are we able to do it?"
"Can we deliver?"
"That is why I urge the British Presidency to do everything in its power – and I well know the energy and commitment of your Prime Minister and indeed of all your officials – to get an agreement."
"Of course everyone has to move: it is not only the responsibility of the British Presidency."
"Of course it is not."
"But I really believe the key to the problem, or it would be better to say the key to the solution, is in your hands."
"You can achieve that agreement, at least among Member States."
"We came very close in the last formal European Council: we can do it."
"It is crucially important and it is my duty and my responsibility, as President of the European Commission – which has to represent the general European interest – to call on the responsibility of all leaders in Europe to make the best efforts to achieve that compromise."
"Let me tell you very frankly, President-in-Office, from my contacts with all the Member States – which, because of my responsibility, I have to keep on a daily basis, especially with the new Member States – I know they look to you and to the role of your Presidency with this expectation."
"In fact, everything that we have done so far has been, from my point of view, a great contribution for Europe."
"As I said in my previous statement, I think that the Hampton Court Summit was a good summit, it made a good contribution to that new, emerging consensus about a stronger, more modern Europe."
"However, the test in the minds of the new Member States, the test for a major proportion of the European public centres around whether we can really show that we are on the move on those concrete questions."
"That is the great challenge."
"So let us do our best, let us ask all the Heads of State and Government to be ready to compromise; let us ask the British Presidency to do its very best."
"I believe it is possible."
"It is difficult but it is possible, and the real test for our leadership is to make possible that which is necessary and I believe we can do it."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the recent statements of the President of Iran, Mr Mahmoud Ahmadinejad."
"."
"Mr President, I am delighted to be able to address the Parliament in this important and timely debate on Iran and I am delighted to be speaking alongside my good friend Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner in this important discussion."
"During the last debate on this subject in this House on 12 October I used those same words in indicating that discussion on Iran was timely."
"I now feel that this debate is perhaps even more timely than the debate on 12 October because international concern about Iran’s policies remains high and I believe that Iran is facing crucial choices about its future."
"It is right, therefore, that the European Union should be active in shaping that debate."
"Iran’s decisions about its relations with neighbouring countries can affect the security and prosperity of peoples well beyond the region of the Middle East."
"It is important for the security of the region and beyond that Iran now makes wise choices."
"As all Members of this House will know, Iran elected a new President in June of this year."
"I believe that the international community, and particularly the European Union, must maintain its dialogue with Iran’s new government."
"We have a responsibility to encourage those who now hold power to make choices that are in the best interests of that country and the region as a whole."
"As I said the last time I had the privilege of addressing this Parliament, Iran is a land of genuinely vast potential."
"It has a young, educated and entrepreneurial population."
"It has immense natural resources, in particular oil and minerals."
"I suggested that the combination of these factors should make for a vibrant economy and society in any country if its government can create a culture of opportunity based on the rule of law."
"Today, more than ever, there is a real need to encourage the growth of such a culture within Iran."
"I know that many honourable Members of this House were, as I was, outraged by the recent remarks made by the President of Iran about Israel."
"These are deeply troubling statements."
"Moreover, they have been made against the background of mounting concerns about Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, its human rights record and its commitment to countering terrorism."
"Let me turn first to those specific comments."
"As you know, on 26 October, President Ahmadinejad addressed a conference in Tehran on the subject of a world without Zionism."
"In his speech he is reported to have called for Israel to be wiped from the map and said ‘the Islamic world will not let its historic enemy live within its heartland’."
"The European Union led the international response which was swift and, I am glad to say, unequivocal."
"The Presidency statement issued on behalf of the European Union Heads of Government meeting at Hampton Court on 27 October strongly condemned President Ahmadinejad’s remarks."
"Josep Borrell said on behalf of this esteemed body that you were ‘deeply shocked, sickened and revolted by this statement’."
"He spoke of total condemnation by the leaders of your political groups."
"I know that Hans-Gert Poettering, who will be speaking in a moment, also expressed his concern at these comments at that time."
"Today in this debate we are being called upon to discuss these remarks and their implications."
"Calls for violence and the destruction of any state are manifestly inconsistent with any claim to be a mature and responsible member of the international community."
"The Presidency summoned Iran’s chargé d’affaires in London to protest at these remarks, and many governments across our Union of 25 nations did likewise in their national capacity."
"I welcome the swift response from the wider international community, including from governments within the Middle East region itself."
"Saeb Erekat put it eloquently on behalf of the Palestinian authority when he said he hoped President Ahmadinejad will focus on adding Palestine to the map rather than calling for Israel to be wiped from the map."
"Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General, spoke for the world when he stated that Israel is a long-standing member of the United Nations, with the same rights and obligations as any other."
"Under the United Nations Charter, Iran, like other members of the organisation, has undertaken to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state."
"I hope that President Ahmadinejad will recognise the damage that these remarks have caused to its standing in the international community and withdraw them unconditionally."
"His remarks are a further reminder of the imperative for Iran to take steps to address international concerns about its intentions in relation to the nuclear programme."
"Iran’s nuclear ambitions were discussed by European Union foreign ministers when we met in Brussels on 7 November."
"At that meeting the Council reiterated its grave concern at Iran’s resumption of activities at the uranium conversion facility at Isfahan and urged Iran to implement all the measures requested by the International Atomic Energy Agency Board. These include a reinstatement of the full suspension of all fuel cycle activities."
"The European Union’s preferred approach remains the resumption of negotiations within the framework agreed in Paris last November."
"The European Union has urged Iran to take the steps necessary to make this possible."
"A satisfactory resolution of the issue of Iran’s nuclear ambitions is of fundamental importance to the international community."
"A nuclear-armed Iran would add greatly to instability in the region and it could do irreparable damage to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the rest of the international non-proliferation system."
"Turning to the field of human rights, we continue to be deeply concerned by the serious and continuing violations by Iran."
"We continue to hear reports of juvenile offenders being sentenced to death."
"Iran continues to restrict freedom of expression and to imprison political prisoners, such as the investigative journalist, Akbar Ganji."
"Iran continues to persecute religious minorities, including the Baha’i Community."
"I know from our last debate on this issue that this is a matter of ongoing and profound concern to many Members of this Parliament."
"We therefore urge Iran to strengthen respect for human rights and the rule of law."
"It is disappointing that the EU-Iran human rights dialogue has not been held since June 2004, despite repeated attempts – I can assure you – on the European Union’s part to agree dates for the next round."
"It is important that Iran take steps to resume substantive discussions under the dialogue."
"I welcome the resolution on human rights that Canada tabled last week at the United Nations General Assembly."
"European Union Member States have agreed to co-sponsor it."
"Iran must demonstrate by its actions that it is willing to improve respect for human rights."
"Iran can begin to do this by fulfilling its obligations and earlier commitments in relation to juvenile executions and by permanently releasing prisoners of conscience."
"I hope that Iran’s government does this without delay."
"Turning now to terrorism, the Council remains concerned by Iran’s approach to terrorism."
"The fact that President Ahmadinejad’s comments were made on the same day as the horrific attack at Hadera in Israel, for which Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility, should reinforce for us all the lesson that incitement to violence and the terrorism that it breeds are despicable and unacceptable acts."
"The European Union has encouraged Iran to join, without reservation, the international consensus on the necessary existence of two states – Palestine and Israel – living peacefully side by side within recognised borders."
"The European Union stresses that support for Palestinian terrorist groups is unacceptable."
"All states have a responsibility to work together to combat the threat of international terrorism."
"I believe that this is genuinely a crucial time for Iran and for its government."
"The recent remarks by President Ahmadinejad have focused attention upon Iran and its position in the world."
"It is imperative that this attention be channelled constructively into effective influence on Iran to address its policies on the nuclear issue, terrorism, human rights and regional and other questions, including the Middle East peace process."
"The international community can have most influence when it is united."
"I believe our united response to President Ahmadinejad’s remarks about Israel has been successful in putting Iranian policy on this issue directly under the spotlight."
"As foreign ministers of the European Union said on 7 November, the evolution of the long-term relationship between Iran and Europe must depend on action by Iran to address effectively all the European Union’s areas of concern."
"It is up to Iran to determine through its actions whether its long-term relationship with the European Union will improve or deteriorate."
". Mr President, even though I am repeating something that has already been said, I would like to do so because I think the matter is so serious that it is necessary to do so."
"There was indeed a very broad and very speedy reaction from all the different European institutions."
"President Barroso reacted immediately on behalf of the European Commission by issuing a very firm condemnation in the clearest possible terms."
"We know that the President of the European Parliament has also condemned this statement very forcefully and, as Mr Alexander has already said, the European Council also issued a very strong declaration from Hampton Court."
"I also reiterated in public that Mr Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s statement on Israel was shocking and completely unacceptable."
"It has also rightly been condemned in the strongest terms across the international community."
"I would also like to thank the Presidency for having associated our heads of delegations in statements made by the Presidency, together with the Commission, especially in the Arab countries."
"The Foreign Ministers further reiterated this collective condemnation of calls for violence and for the destruction of any state."
"They also concurred in the fact that ‘such comments cause concern about Iran’s role in the region and its future intentions’."
"There is a long, very ugly string of precedents at political rallies, military parades and other events, going all the way back to the early years of the revolution."
"But when they are made in the current delicate climate, and especially by the Head of State himself in connection with a conference entitled ‘The World without Zionism’, I think it really is time to draw a red line and to remind the Iranian President of the responsibilities that come with being a member of the family of nations."
"On the most burning issue, the nuclear track, we still believe that engagement is far preferable to brinkmanship, confrontation and isolation."
"We therefore support the efforts by the British Presidency, France, Germany, Mr Javier Solana and like-minded partners to bring Iran to a fuller cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and Dr El Baradei"
"In this regard the next meeting of the board of the IAEA will be crucial."
"Clearly we all want to avoid Iran becoming a nuclear weapons state."
"But this is not the only area where we would expect the Iranian Government to deliver."
"Iran’s attitude towards the Middle East peace process in particular is very important."
"Since the launch of our EU-Iran comprehensive dialogue, the successor of the critical dialogue, that has been identified as one of the major issues of concern, along with weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and human rights."
"During Mr Khatami’s presidency, we used this channel of engagement to good effect."
"Even though Iran did not officially acknowledge the existence of Israel, we registered some positive signs and a better appreciation of the whole Middle East equation."
"In particular, it was stated that Iran would not obstruct the peace process and would not pretend to be ‘more Palestinian than the Palestinians’."
"But the intemperate remarks by President Ahmadinejad came as a setback."
"Among the many condemnations it triggered, I was particularly pleased to note also that the Palestinian Authority representative, the chief Palestinian negotiator, Mr Saeb Erekat, displayed real statesmanship by recalling that the PLO and the Palestinian Authority had recognised the State of Israel, with which they pursued a peace process."
"Thunderous neo-revolutionary warnings by the Iranian leadership to other Muslim countries not to recognise Israel seem curiously out of step with the modern world and may very well backfire."
"Over the past months, the EU has invited Iran to reactivate our tracks of dialogue, by holding sessions of both the comprehensive dialogue and the human rights dialogue."
"I strongly hope that Iran will recommit itself to these processes and seize the opportunity to clarify its position, dispel misunderstandings and start restoring an overall confidence that has been badly damaged by recent remarks."
"Although today is not the occasion, one could speak at length about human rights and the positive expectations that were initially created during the first years of Mr Khatami’s presidency, and then about the subsequent negative trend that has regrettably cemented itself."
"Improvements are indeed badly needed and the European Union obviously cannot remain silent on the matter."
"I believe that we should try to build bridges with the Iranian people and I prefer to think that not all Iranians identify with the remarks and the line taken by their leaders."
"Freedom of expression and association in Iran are eroding."
"We should continue to monitor closely, for instance, the treatment of individual cases, such as that of Mr Akbar Ganji."
"But as the Council clearly stated last week, ‘the evolution of the long-term relationship, avoiding a deterioration between Iran and Europe, will depend on action by Iran to address effectively all of the EU’s areas of concern’. That includes Iran’s attitude towards the Middle East peace process."
"The ball is now in the Iranian Government’s court."
"As a basic prerequisite we expect the Iranian Government to exercise responsible leadership, both domestically and internationally."
"Iran has remarkable historical, cultural and geo-political assets, as well as immense natural and human resources."
"This entails special responsibilities in order to foster peace and stability within a particularly volatile neighbourhood."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, our group has asked for this debate, and I would like to express my warm thanks to the other groups for having agreed to it without further ado."
"What President Ahmadinejad of Iran said on 26 October about wiping Israel off the map is so monstrous that it must be condemned in the strongest terms."
"We know that the Ayatollah Khomeini, who led the Iranian revolution, took a similar line, but we are now all the more grateful to the former President Khatami for distancing himself from it."
"To Israel – of which I have been critical on several occasions in this House – we say that, when something touches, as this does, in such a way on the security, stability, and integrity of Israel, then Israel enjoys our unconditional support, and that any and every attack upon Israel or attempt at destabilising it amounts to an attempt at jeopardising Western civilisation and constitutes a declaration of war upon Europe and the world at large."
"Of that, the Iranian Government must be made aware."
"I find this development in Iran so very disappointing precisely because I was spending a whole week in Iran at the time that Ahmadinejad took office, and I was still under the illusion that not everything would turn out to be quite so bad as it looked."
"It is, however, precisely because things have turned out so badly that those who, with a great deal of goodwill, wanted to give the new government a chance must, today, say loud and clear: ‘nip this in the bud!’ – and that is the position we must adopt."
"The tragic thing is that this behaviour on the part of what one must call the new Iranian regime does nothing to help those whom it is intended to help, namely the Palestinians."
"It is not only the Israelis who have a right to live within secure borders; we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have always acknowledged the right of the Palestinians to do so as well."
"What the President of Iran is doing puts the Middle East peace process as a whole at risk, and that is bad news not only for Israel, but also for the dignity of the Palestinian people."
"Following our criticisms of Ahmadinejad, I saw on German television demonstrations in Teheran, with men wearing suicide belts, something that in itself constitutes an incitement to terrorism."
"While in Iran, I saw a magazine in which young people were called on to sign up as suicide bombers or freedom fighters – you can call them what you like, but that is still an incitement to terrorism."
"I was told yesterday that Iranian children’s television programmes were showing Palestinian children wearing these suicide belts, so to speak, setting Iranian children an example and encouraging them to volunteer for these sorts of suicide missions."
"Yesterday, too, a British colleague told me that two people had been hanged in Iran as a punishment for homosexual relations."
"All this shows that what we are dealing with here is a reversion to the worst of the Middle Ages, and we must get the Iranian leadership to see the error of their ways."
"Both the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner mentioned the civil nuclear programme."
"That is something to which Iran is, of course, entitled, but it does not enjoy our trust, and we can be virtually certain that the development of civil nuclear power will one day lead to its being used for nuclear weapons, which we, as a European and global civilisation, cannot allow to be placed in the hands of people whose outlook can be regarded as medieval."
"This morning, I urged the Russian Government, through one of its representatives, to do everything in its power – for it enjoys a degree of influence on Iran – to bring about, at last, transparency in all these questions touching on nuclear energy; the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council have made similar demands."
"We must be very vigilant where Iran is concerned."
"Iran must itself be aware that it is throwing away its chance of playing a major geographical and strategic role."
"Iran has a major role to play in the peace process in Afghanistan, the peace process in Iraq, in relations with Syria, Israel, Lebanon, and Palestine."
"The Iranians are a great people, many of whom took no part in the election because they feared the worst and could not prevent it."
"There are people of good will in Iran, and we should not forget them."
"Iran needs a good future, and it is to be hoped that its President will come to realise that he needs to adopt a civilised approach in his dealings with both people and states around the world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we too endorsed the need to hold this debate, because we want the serious remarks made by the Iranian President, Mr Ahmadinejad, regarding the existence of the State of Israel to be met with a firm, unanimous response from the European Parliament."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament believes that the seriousness of what has happened should not be underestimated, since those words were uttered at an extremely sensitive moment in the Middle East situation."
"The truth is that fortunately, within days, we heard the statements by the former leader Mr Khatami, which ran in a completely different direction."
"In fact, he came out against any kind of crusade, war or violence, declaring them immoral."
"Returning to the Middle East, on the one hand hopes have been raised again for a peace process that will lead to the emergence of the Palestinian State alongside the State of Israel, a solution that for us has never been and will never be an issue. On the other hand, however, we realise that this process has many enemies and that terrorism is in fact backing those who do not want a solution to this tragic situation."
"Peace, democracy, freedom and social justice are the values that we want to prevail in the Middle East, and we want Europe to play an ever greater role in making that happen."
"We therefore welcome the fact that the European Union has accepted responsibility for controlling the border at Rafah, which we hope may soon become one of the borders of the Palestinian State."
"Iran is a great country and we do not want it to isolate itself from the international community."
"Quite the opposite: we believe that the decisions it makes, starting with a clear and incontrovertible rejection of nuclear weapons, can help bring about peaceful stability throughout the region."
"Israel and Palestine are linked by a single destiny and wiping out Israel would mean wiping out Palestine."
"I say that because it is time to unmask those who help to maintain the Palestinians’ tragic situation by pretending to uphold their rights."
"Unlike President Ahmadinejad, we shall strive to add a new state to the map of the Middle East."
"Lastly, let us assure Israel that Europe cannot forget the Holocaust, because that would mean denying the very reasons for its existence as a political project."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will echo some of what my fellow Members have been saying before me, but I think it is important to show that all groups in this House are unanimous in their condemnation of recent events in Iran."
"Iran is a cradle of civilisation and has made an invaluable contribution to mankind’s cultural, artistic, religious, intellectual and scientific heritage."
"When Iran became an Islamic republic, it was isolated for decades."
"The European Union has taken the lead in bringing this isolation to an end, and a comprehensive debate has been set in motion about such things as economic relations, international cooperation and human rights."
"Since President Ahmadinejad took up office, however, there has been a clear and perceptible setback in the shape of the sentencing of juveniles to death, renewed persecutions of journalists and human rights activists and the recall of 40 ambassadors."
"Recent statements by the President – who has congratulated suicide terrorists and said that Israel must be wiped off the map – are completely at odds with the Charter of the United Nations, are deserving of condemnation and are wholly unacceptable not only politically and in terms of international law, but also, and above all, from a humanitarian and moral point of view."
"Israel’s right of existence within internationally recognised borders and in safety alongside a viable Palestinian state is not a matter of dispute."
"Iran would do well to contribute to a solution in the Middle East and to stop supporting international terrorism."
"The latest statements by its President threaten to plunge Iran, which is indeed a big country, back into isolation and, in any case, prevent it from playing a leading role in its region."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group, that of the Greens, is also glad that we will be adopting a unanimous resolution whereby the European Parliament will make clear that anyone – whether an organisation or a state is immaterial – who questions the right of Israel to exist or preaches hatred of it will find no acceptance in this House, and that such attitudes are firmly rejected."
"The Commission and the Council, too, have spelled out the serious problems that we face."
"President Ahmadinejad’s speeches make it clear that we Europeans can do nothing to stop a hatemonger mobilising thousands of people the length and breadth of his country; that is not our task, neither is it our field of activity, but I do nonetheless appeal to those in power in Iran to consider whether they might play a positive role in the international community by giving their backing to the right of both Palestine and Israel to exist, rather than allowing their President to make their rich country an international pariah."
"Hence my appeal to the people of Europe and to this House: we must draw distinctions."
"Iran is a fascinating country with a young and well-educated society."
"There are also, in Iranian society, active women’s organisations that fight for women’s rights."
"Iran is also represented by such a man as Akbar Gandji, whose life is at risk because he refuses to submit to censorship."
"Iran is also a society full of webloggers and journalists attempting to remain in contact with us and to reveal the truth about their country’s regime."
"Iran is also the Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi, who has addressed this House."
"Iran is also the lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani, whom we once invited to this House and who is now in jail."
"It is to this other Iran, then, that we should try to stretch out a hand."
"We should not make the mistake of breaking off contacts with its civil society now, of shutting the door on it."
"That is precisely what people like President Ahmadinejad want us to do, and that is why we must not do it."
"We have committed ourselves to human rights, to peace and to the peaceful resolution of conflicts."
"That is our way."
"That is only the dialogue ..."
"Mr President, the Iranian regime prevents any opposition within the country."
"It violates human rights and barbarically sentences people to death by hanging etc. A long list of the regime’s crimes can be drawn up, but such crimes are clearly not enough for this regime."
"Now, the Iranian President has made terrible statements about another state."
"He has talked about annihilating the State of Israel."
"His doing so is, of course, completely unacceptable and must be condemned by everyone."
"I assume that we are a unified Parliament that supports the condemnations both of this statement and of the Iranian regime’s human rights violations."
"There is a danger that the President’s statement will make the work to bring about peace in the Middle East that much more difficult."
"At the same time, we must also demand that the State of Israel comply with the UN Security Council’s resolutions, that Israel immediately withdraw from the occupied territories and that Israel assume its share of responsibility for a two-state solution and thus finally accept an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. In this context, we must also criticise the State of Israel’s construction of a wall in the Palestinian territories."
"This is a wall that, among other things, separates farmers from their land and pupils from their schools and that prevents people who are ill from getting to hospitals. This wall must also be taken down."
". Mr President, Iran is developing a nuclear programme that it does not need since it is sitting on a sea of oil."
"It is clearly intended to provide the country with nuclear weapons."
"The President of Iran thinks that Israel should be wiped off the map."
"The ability of the West to deal with the threat posed by Iran has been severely restricted by the war in Iraq, a war Britain entered into because of the lies and deceit of our Prime Minister, Mr Blair."
"We all hope that the situation in Iran can be resolved peacefully, and this is certainly one of those cases where the West needs both to speak softly and to carry a big stick."
"Unfortunately Britain’s big stick – its armed forces – is being merged into the euphemistically named European Defence Identity, i.e. a European army."
"If accomplished, this will prevent Britain from being able to embark on any independent military actions in the future."
"But once again, the EU assumes the attributes of a political state in order to address this problem and its pretensions are fully supported by a minister of Her Majesty’s Government."
"Meanwhile, this Parliament continually calls on both France and Britain to decommission their independent nuclear deterrents."
"If they did so there would not be the big stick that might ultimately be needed in any negotiations with Iran."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the expressions of hatred and violence uttered by the Iranian President, aiming at wiping the State of Israel off the map, are a threat to the whole civilised world."
"Iran is a country of 68 million inhabitants, has an area of 1.7 million square kilometres and is a major oil producer. Its current president is trying to turn it into a state that represents the most extreme form of Islamic fundamentalism, that supports or does not condemn terrorist acts, and that is preparing to produce nuclear energy without the backing of the international community."
"If the Iranian President does not clearly change his stance, he will be a threat not only to Israel and the region, but also to all of us, to peace and to democracy."
"Such a threat demands the strongest possible response."
"The unilateral nuclear rearming of Iran must be stopped in line with our resolution of 13 October 2005 and the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 7 November."
"We must also seek a diplomatic solution to dispel the legitimate concerns about Iran’s nuclear programme."
"If this threatening trend in Iran’s policy does not stop, we shall have to speak firmly of diplomatic and economic consequences, because these statements inciting violence against a democratic sovereign state are a danger to the democratic community as a whole."
"As institutions, however, we should continue to foster relations with the people."
"We express our greatest solidarity with the State of Israel, which has also received statements of support from that part of the Islamic world that rejects terrorism, as well as the spontaneous support of the citizens of many of our countries."
"The pursuit of a lasting peace means that we must resoundingly condemn and take the necessary action against all those who instigate hatred and violence."
"We call on our institutions to pay even greater attention to the opposition movements in Iran, which are denouncing the methods that this violent, repressive regime uses even against its own people."
". Mr President, it has once again been a high-quality debate on an important subject, similar to the last time we had an opportunity to debate these issues in this Chamber."
"A number of speakers including the Commissioner and Mr Poettering have underlined the significance of the Iranian President’s statement for the wider Middle East peace process, and with that I would concur."
"President Ahmadinejad’s comments caused concern about Iran’s role more widely within the region and indeed about its future intentions."
"The fact that these comments were made on the same day as a horrific attack on Israeli citizens should reinforce for all of us the lesson that incitement to violence and to the terrorism that it breeds are despicable and unacceptable."
"Frankly it is clear what Iran must do."
"It must renounce groups using terror and violence, including the kind of sickening propaganda that was referred to by Mr Poettering, and support a solution to the Palestinian question based on the principle of two states living side by side in peace and in security."
"There is no reason why an Islamic political system such as Iran’s should deny fundamental democratic rights such as freedom of choice and freedom of expression and there can be no excuse for any system abusing human rights, as a number of speakers have made clear in the course of their contributions to this debate."
"On the wider nuclear issue, Iran must provide objective guarantees that its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes."
"The governments of the European Union are now in close consultation with each other and key partners such as the United States, Russia, China, India and South Africa about the next steps."
"We all look to Iran to reinstate the suspension of uranium conversion activity which it agreed to last year and which the IAEA board itself has said is essential for confidence to be rebuilt and we urge Iran to come back to talks on long-term arrangements on the basis of the Paris agreement."
"On 7 November, as speakers have mentioned, European Union Foreign Ministers reaffirmed the Union’s support for a diplomatic solution to international concerns over Iran’s nuclear programme which should include an agreement on long-term arrangements."
"Such a solution would help create the climate we believe to be necessary for a better relationship with Europe generally and the international community as a whole."
"Working and engaging with Iran is of course a challenge, but we must do our best to meet that challenge in the important weeks and months ahead."
"Our preference remains to aim for a mutually beneficial relationship based on cooperation and our shared interests, in that Europe wants to see Iran realise its potential and to grow and prosper."
"That is certainly what its young population deserves and that is, as Ms Beer said, why it is important to keep open the links so that the other Iran, as it was described – the more open Iranian society to which speakers have addressed themselves today – can welcome the efforts which are being made to maintain that dialogue, certainly by the Commission and by others."
"But a relationship of this sort will also need to address the European Union’s main concerns, including, of course, nuclear proliferation and human rights."
"In conclusion, on behalf of the Presidency, let me say simply this: Iran stands at a critical juncture."
"The world is watching to see how its new government faces up to the very important choices that it has to make in the weeks, months and years ahead."
"We from a European Union point of view will continue to encourage Iran to address international concerns about its policies and about its statements."
"I hope that Iran does this and that its relations with the wider world and the European Union in particular are therefore able to evolve in the direction in which I believe this House wants them to develop."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"The next item is questions to the Council (B6-0339/2005)."
"How does the Council view the impact of the EU’s bilateral and international agreements and commitments on developments in the European market as regards the relocation and restructuring of enterprises, especially in island, agricultural and remote areas of the EU?"
"Do any forecasts exist regarding the restructuring of enterprises and future economic and labour developments in each sector of the market and in each type of job in these regions?"
"Which mechanisms is it employing to ensure the sustainable development of these regions and the preservation of their social fabric, in particular by helping workers adjust to the new employment situation and planning training arrangements for the younger generation?"
". Mr President, I am conscious that your direction to honourable Members also, no doubt, includes the Presidency, so I shall endeavour to keep my answers as brief as is appropriate, given the range of questions that we have been asked."
"In response to Question 1, the assessment of the impact of international agreements in terms of companies relocating and restructuring is not within the Council’s competence."
"The Council does not have any forecasts for the restructuring of companies."
"The European Social Fund is the main financial tool through which the European Union supports Member States’ employment policies within the framework of the European employment strategy."
"Set up by the Treaty of Rome, it is the longest established Structural Fund."
"The Structural Fund supports measures to improve employment opportunities and to develop human resources and integration into the labour market in order to promote a high level of employment, equality between men and women, sustainable development and economic and social cohesion."
"Furthermore, the Council will be taking forward discussion of the Commission’s proposals for a globalisation adjustment fund, which could provide assistance for those affected by economic restructuring."
"Rural development also makes European Union funding available in parallel with national funding for developing rural areas."
"In 2007 to 2013, this money will focus on increasing the competitiveness of European agriculture, food and forestry, land management and the environment, and quality of life and diversification in rural areas."
"Thus the European Structural Fund and rural development funding provides the tools to help workers adjust to the situations referred to by the honourable Member."
"– Mr President, I should like to ask the Council representative if the restructuring fund will have specific funds and if the British Presidency has already used the open method of coordination in order to make new proposals for the management of restructurings."
". I would start with the basic point, which is that, clearly, the level of funding is contingent upon the wider conversation about the future financing of the European Union."
"We have had a long and useful debate in the course of the afternoon which, while apparently directed towards the Hampton Court informal Heads of Government meeting, in reality strayed into the issue of future financing."
"I would simply reiterate the points made by the Foreign Secretary when he was speaking here earlier this afternoon in saying that we are sincere in our endeavours in reaching a conclusion to those discussions on future financing in the course of the British Presidency."
"However, the specific details of specific programmes are obviously contingent on the resolution of that matter."
"What effect might the adoption of conflicting national measures on the taxation of passenger air traffic have on the internal market, and what steps can be taken to harmonise those measures?"
". Data concerning the effect on the international market of national measures to tax passenger air traffic are limited."
"Were Member States to adopt national measures for the taxation of passenger air traffic that were not compatible with the internal market, measures could be proposed by the Commission and adopted by the Council after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee under Article 93 of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"However, it remains the right of Member States to set tax rates according to their own national circumstances."
"Thank you for your reply, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"Nevertheless, the question concerns the effect that the introduction of any kind of tax on air passenger transport will have within the internal market."
"You are from an island, as I am; this measure, although it would not affect countries which only have a continental structure, would have a very negative impact on the island regions and, above all, on those which are a very long way from the central nucleus of the European Union."
"This is therefore an issue that probably warrants consideration by the Council, in agreement with the Commission."
". I would certainly not want the impression to be left in this Chamber that somehow by dint of geography Britain is isolated from the mainstream of the European Union."
"Indeed I hope many of our efforts in the course of the Presidency have challenged that impression."
"As I suggested in my initial answer, there is provision within the Treaties for action to be taken when necessary by the Commission."
"Nonetheless it remains a matter for individual Member States to make decisions in relation to taxation, as I sought to declare."
"If the honourable Member is suggesting that further action needs to be taken either at Member State level or at European level, I am not convinced that would necessarily relate to issues of taxation as distinct from potential other public policy remedies for the problems that he claims to have identified."
"– Thank you Mr President."
"I think it would be wrong if we keep on looking at this question strictly from the point of view of taxation, we must also look at it from the perspective of the free movement of persons and services, two of the essential freedoms of the European Union."
"Let me give you as an example my own country – Malta."
"To buy a ticket from Malta to Brussels it costs around 104 Euros if you get a good price, taxes and surcharges on it amount to 126 Euros, that means 121% of the price; between Malta and London 200% of the price, are taxes and other ‘charges’."
"We must look at this seriously, it is not possible that travelling, especially from remote and isolated places, be considered in any way as a form of luxury."
"We cannot go to ‘mainland Europe’ by car, what can we do then, swim?!"
"That means that we have to look at it from the perspective of freedom of movement."
". I would simply reiterate the caution that I emphasised earlier as to the legitimate remit of the Council in these matters."
"There is, as I said, provision for the Commission to take action in particular circumstances, and Mr Muscat is right to recognise that free movement of services is one element of the original Treaty of Rome."
"However, to counterbalance the rather negative construction that he has placed on the present position in relation to air fares in one particular Member State, it is important to recognise that some of the measures taken at European Union level in recent years have resulted in very dramatic drops in the price of tickets that are being charged to European Union citizens to travel elsewhere within the European Union."
"Only this morning I had the opportunity to travel to Budapest where I was hearing directly about the seventeen daily flights now available between a number of regional airports in the United Kingdom and Hungary."
"That would have been inconceivable only a matter of years ago, and the European Union deserves credit in recognising the extent to which it has contributed towards the new opportunities that are afforded to many citizens to travel, which have now been enjoyed by many citizens in recent months and years."
"Last month I tabled a question for this session of Question Time to the Council on a related subject, that of EU kerosene tax."
"In response to the question as to what the Council’s position on EU kerosene tax was, I was told that because it had not received a proposal from the Commission, the Council could not take position."
"I have here documentary evidence that the Commission has made proposals to the Council."
"The issue was last discussed in the Council by the Luxembourg Presidency, prior to the British Presidency, which British ministers would presumably have attended."
"Can the Council Presidency please tell me whether this is a case of incompetence, or is there a secret agenda to introduce a kerosene tax?"
". I can assure the honourable Member there is no secret agenda as far as I am concerned."
"On the other hand, if he would like to share with me the information he has waved before this House today I shall certainly look into the matter that he has addressed and I will make sure that a reply is forthcoming to him."
"Why have not all the EU Member States signed up to the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings which encourages the treatment of trafficked persons principally as victims rather than illegal immigrants?"
"Is the UK, as the country holding the Presidency, setting a good example?"
". The Council is not in a position to give information on the state of individual Member States’ decision-making concerning the signature of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings."
"The convention has to date been signed by five Member States of the European Union: Austria, Cyprus, Poland, Portugal and Sweden."
"No Member States have ratified the convention."
"It is noted that part of the convention is under EC competence and will therefore need to be signed and ratified by the EC."
"The Council is currently considering an action plan on trafficking in human beings to develop a comprehensive and strategic European Union approach on this issue."
"The action plan will build on the conference held on 19 and 20 October, ‘Tackling human trafficking: Policy and best practice in Europe’, organised by the United Kingdom Presidency, the Commission and Sweden."
"That is rather inadequate."
"The Commission’s recent communication said that victim protection is the top priority, but Member States tend to lump trafficking together with illegal immigration and prefer to make victim protection conditional on being a witness."
"That is why they dislike the convention."
"The advice that I and colleagues received from the police is that victims will cooperate with police voluntarily once they and their families are safe."
"Police are dismayed that the chances of a successful prosecution of traffickers are being undermined by a policy of deporting victims as illegal immigrants or making assistance conditional."
"Mr Blair said recently that you need powerful reasons to turn round and say ‘no’ to the police."
"Why are 17 EU Prime Ministers – and you are now telling me it is actually 20 Prime Ministers, including Tony Blair – saying ‘no’ to the police by refusing to sign up to this convention?"
". I would first like to repeat to the honourable Member the point that I made at the beginning that it is not for me, representing the Presidency in the course of today and in the course of this debate, to speak in terms of the decision-making of those 20 Prime Ministers that she identifies."
"I would however say that it rather ill befits her to suggest that there is a conflation between illegal immigration and human trafficking when the conference that I described on this important issue of human trafficking was entitled ‘Tackling human trafficking: policy and best practice in Europe’."
"This was a matter which, as I said, was taken forward by the British Presidency and therefore the allegation that she seems to be levelling that there is somehow a profound and perpetual confusion between illegal immigration and human trafficking seems, not least on the basis of the title of the conference, to be refuted by the evidence."
"Following on from that, I think the reason my colleague said what she did was because the UK Presidency seems to view this as a security and stability issue rather than a human rights issue."
"Further to what the President-in-Office has said, could he try to make sure that the Council discussions on the EU action plan on trafficking is in the public domain, because we do not have any information about it at present."
"Could he also give reassurances that at least the minimum standards that are written into the EU Convention against trafficking are put into that EU action plan?"
". Let me assure the honourable lady that there is widespread support for the aims of the Convention on Action against Human Trafficking and that European Union Member States want to see concerted action to tackle at source what is undoubtedly an abhorrent trade, in order to protect and support the victims of which she has spoken and bring those responsible to justice."
"I can assure the honourable lady that the United Kingdom, as Presidency of the European Union, has prioritised work on combating human trafficking, and the EU Action Plan for best practices, standards and procedures for combating and preventing trafficking in human beings has been the focus of our efforts."
"We have held not one but two conferences on the subject."
"That action plan will, I can assure her, address the whole cycle of human trafficking and specifically recognises the importance of a human rights and a victim-centred approach."
"So, I hope that, on the basis of the answer that I have been able to offer, some of her concerns over the approach that the British Presidency has taken on this important issue transpire to be misplaced."
"The European Commission and the European Parliament are in favour of abolishing guidelines on the amounts of tobacco and alcohol that consumers may bring into their own country for their personal use from another Member State."
"What efforts has the Presidency made to convince the Council to agree to the abolition of these guidelines and thus allow shoppers to exercise their full single market rights?"
". The proposed deletion of the indicative amounts for tobacco products and alcohol constitutes only one of the elements of the relevant Commission proposal amending the arrangements for products subject to excise duty."
"Indicative amounts are used as an important indicator of whether the quantity of excise goods carried across borders is for commercial reasons or for private consumption by non-taxable persons."
"They are not in themselves an obstacle to the rights of cross-border shoppers."
"The Commission proposal has been discussed on several occasions in the relevant bodies since it was transmitted to the Council, with no indication that Member States would agree to abolish the minimum indicative levels."
"The Presidency therefore does not believe that further discussion of this issue would be productive."
"Would the President-in-Office not agree with me that a single market in the European Union, in which goods, people, services and capital can move as freely across European borders as they do within Member States, is a vital policy objective?"
"Would he agree with me that we should prefer tax competition between Member States to harmonisation of tax rates across the EU?"
"If he so agrees, can he see any justification for any limits or guidelines as to how much in the way of excisable products our citizens can take with them across our borders?"
". It is refreshing to hear a point of view being put forward in this Chamber that differs so much from some of the allegations normally levelled against the British and the British Presidency."
"The free movement of goods and services is, of course, reflected in the original treaties of the European Union, and one of the focuses of our work in the course of our Presidency has been the completion of the single market."
"We have sought to take forward, and continue to seek to take forward, work in relation to services."
"Indeed, countries who at times in the past have questioned our pro-European credentials have been some of those most critical of our efforts to continue to advance discussions in relation to the issue of services."
"On the specific issue that the speaker raised in relation to cross-border shopping, let me simply say that the Presidency fully supports the rights of cross-border shoppers."
"At the same time, though, we are committed to tackling those who abuse freedoms that would otherwise be enjoyed by citizens right across the European Union."
"We are determined to tackle abuses of the freedoms within the single market by those who engage in illegal activities such as smuggling."
"Guide levels are therefore essential to assist customs authorities to distinguish between genuine cross-border shoppers and smugglers."
"On the more general point with which he concluded his remarks, I think the rather robust case which was put by our Foreign Secretary in terms of the limits of harmonisation within the European Union earlier this afternoon is an eloquent testimony as to the British Government’s view on the appropriate balance between harmonisation and competition within the European Union."
"Would the President-in-Office agree that guidelines are precisely that – guidelines – and that if individuals can prove that what they are importing is for their own use then, even if they exceed the guidelines, they would not be outwith the law?"
"Also, would he agree that the guidelines exist to ensure that the single market functions in this area and that, if we did not have the guidelines, the very objective that Mr Purvis wants might be undermined, because the guidelines are there to stop the abuses that the President-in-Office referred to?"
". I can assure the honourable Member that we take seriously the kind of abuse of which he speaks so eloquently."
"Speaking for a moment from the United Kingdom point of view rather than the Presidency point of view, it is the case that in the United Kingdom we have the highest guide levels of all the Member States of the European Union."
"We, like every Member State, apply sanctions to those who bring in excise goods that are not for their own personal use with the intention – exactly the intention to which the honourable Member refers – of evading the duty that would otherwise be due."
"These sanctions, I believe, are proportionate to the nature of the offence."
"Therefore he is right in recognising that guidelines are exactly that."
"The UK Government is seeking to oblige many British women to leave the UK so that they join husbands refused residence rights."
"They are told that it is safe to settle in countries such as Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Congo and Burundi, although such countries are deemed by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office or US State Department as being dangerous for Western visitors and/or in breach of fundamental rights."
"How is this practice compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, especially the right to a family life, the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights and Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union?"
". The Council has never debated this question and it is not within the sphere of its competence."
"I must say that I find the lack of any legal justification in terms of European Community law and the European Convention on Human Rights somewhat distressing."
"There is little to reassure me about the welfare of my constituents."
"The President-in-Office will be aware that, since February 2005, non-EU/EEA nationals have to obtain Home Office permission to get married in the United Kingdom."
"Its effect is that we are talking about a limited number of couples."
"Would the President-in-Office be prepared at least to convey to his Home Office colleagues my request that an amnesty be granted to such couples, at least where it is recognised that there is a genuine and subsisting relationship, and that the requirement to travel to the country of origin in order to apply for spousal residence be waived?"
". I can assure the honourable Member that I have concerns for the welfare and interests of her constituents, not least because we share constituents, representing as I do the constituents of Paisley and Renfrewshire South in Scotland."
"I am respectful of her experience, not least in the field of constitutional law, but I would simply state what seems to me an obvious point, i.e. that my responsibilities today are not to explain or to articulate the position of the British Government in relation to this particular policy issue, but instead to outline the position of the European Union Presidency of which Britain holds the chair at the moment."
"I would therefore be perfectly content if the honourable Member would wish to write to me on a bilateral basis on the specific points that she has raised in order that we could ensure that a reply be directed towards the Home Office in the United Kingdom."
"But I would hesitate to go further than that, given that it is not really the appropriate focus for our discussions in this Chamber this afternoon."
"I note that in relation to the question on alcohol guidelines the Minister commented on UK practice, so I am sure he is prepared to do so on this subject: does this practice in the UK not jar with EU free movement rules in the developing concept of European citizenship?"
"If one of my constituents who has been caught by the new rule and whose marriage is accepted by the government moves to France, she would have the right to have her husband with her."
"So, the bizarre effect is that couples get greater protection of their right to family life in an EU country other than their own."
"There is a strong European dimension to this, so I believe it is apt to ask the UK Minister to answer as Presidency."
". Well, Mr President, it was a valiant attempt in the supplementary to try and draw us into a discussion of Britain’s domestic policy, but I think the appropriate response, and one which is genuinely respectful to this Chamber, is to address ourselves to the points that have been raised in responding as the Presidency."
"I have already made an offer to one of the Member’s parliamentary colleagues that if she wishes to write directly to me, I will facilitate the correspondence being passed on to the Home Office in the United Kingdom, but I think, not least given the constraints of time always upon us during Question Time, it is important that we focus on questions to the Council at this stage, rather than to continue what is an appropriate discussion within respective Member States."
"On 25 September 2005 rules were issued by the Chinese Ministry of Information regarding the dissemination of information via the Internet."
"Information supplied via the Internet must not incite illegal assembly, membership of illegal associations or participation in illegal demonstrations that disturb social order."
"The new rules are targeted both at websites and email."
"They seek to prevent any information (news, commentary) that has not first been examined and filtered by the regime from being distributed."
"Internet portals have an obligation to take all of their news and commentary direct from official news sources."
"As for email, all private groups or individuals must first register as a 'news organisation'."
"Only then may they distribute news or news analysis."
"Even before the new rules were issued, Zheng Yichun was sentenced on 22 September 2005 to seven years' imprisonment for calling, via the Internet, for political reform."
"How does the Council intend to raise the matter of this new fundamental breach by the Chinese Government of the right to freedom of expression?"
"Will the Council be raising, in this connection, the case of Zheng Yichun and insisting that he is released?"
". In reply to Question 6, the Council shares the concerns of the honourable Member regarding restrictions on freedom of expression, including on the internet in China."
"The European Union has most recently expressed these concerns in the context of the EU-China human rights dialogue, which took place on 24 and 25 October 2005 in Beijing."
"The European Union has also repeatedly raised this issue in other bilateral meetings, including at the highest level."
"With a view to China’s signature and the process of ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it is of particular importance that freedom of expression be guaranteed in line with international standards."
"Article 19 of the ICCPR was therefore the subject of a recent legal seminar of European Union and Chinese academics and practitioners that took place in Beijing in June 2005 in the context of this dialogue."
"The joint recommendations that resulted from that seminar were handed over to the Chinese side during that last dialogue."
"As part of the dialogue and in the context of the European Union guidelines on human rights defenders, the European Union has raised with the Chinese authorities a number of cases of individuals detained for peacefully expressing their opinions, asking for more details on their fate and pressing for their release."
"Mr President, grateful though I obviously am to the Council for this response, I cannot shake off the impression that the Chinese Government, barring a few benevolent statements, is doing very little in specific terms."
"I have the impression that the Council and the European Union are, to some extent, applying double standards and that China is being generously humoured on account of its numerical strength and our clearly enormous economic interest in it."
"I personally think that the Council should adopt a tougher, more principled and more courageous policy where very basic human rights and the fundamental free expression of opinion are concerned, and would ask it, if possible, to revisit the specific case I have mentioned and perhaps, in this specific case, to contact the Chinese authorities."
". The supplementary question ranges more widely than simply the specific case and the concerns regarding censorship of the internet and questions as to whether there is an effective response to the European Union’s pleas and discussions with China in relation to human rights."
"There is a fundamental choice to be made as to whether isolating any one country with which we have disagreements on standards of human rights is the right way forward."
"The European Union has taken a view historically that to have a structured dialogue and to have engagement is the best means of effecting the kind of change I am sure all Members of this Parliament would wish to see."
"The dialogue has, for example, encouraged China to become more involved in international human rights mechanisms, including the ratification in March 2001 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights."
"China received the European Union’s Special Representative on Education in 2003, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in 2004 and we very much hope that China will receive the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture this year."
"I can assure the honourable Member that the dialogue is both very open and very frank and, as I sought to reflect in my initial answer to his question, this is a dialogue that takes place not simply at official level but at the very highest levels of the contact that exists between the European Union and China."
"Later this week, the European Court of Auditors is due to produce its Annual Report on the EU accounts."
"For the past ten years, it has been unable to give a satisfactory statement of assurance."
"This is unacceptable."
"What steps have been taken by the UK Presidency to rectify this unsatisfactory state of affairs, and will the Council now give me an assurance that, next year, we may expect a positive statement of assurance on the EU's accounts?"
". The Council shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Member regarding the fact that for the past 11 years the European Court of Auditors has been unable to give, in its annual reports, a statement indicating that there was a reasonable assurance as to the legality and regularity of most of the underlying transactions."
"However, for the 2004 accounts the Court was able to give assurance on the legality and regularity of underlying transactions for pre-accession assistance as well as on own-resources and administration."
"For the first time, the Court has been able to conclude that the Integrated Administration and Control System – IACS – has reduced the risk of error for most agricultural expenditure to an acceptable level."
"I can assure the House that the Council has consistently attached great importance to this issue and has regularly expressed its concern about the level of errors in transactions underlying payments and weaknesses in the control system."
"As Members of the House will know, the Council has examined the recent Commission communication on a roadmap to an integrated internal control framework, which is part of the process towards a positive statement of assurance."
"The UK Presidency and the Commission established a panel of experts which helped prepare a draft Council conclusion on this issue."
"The Council adopted conclusions on 8 November 2005, confirming that achieving a positive statement of assurance is the European Union’s objective and listing a series of recommendations for action by the Commission and by Member States."
"The Council considers those conclusions to be an important step towards a positive statement of assurance and will continue to support the Commission’s efforts to contribute actively to improving the financial management of the European Union at all levels, but the decision lies ultimately in the hands of the Court of Auditors."
". I accept that in your reply you acknowledge that there have been some improvements, but I hope that the Presidency will also accept that we have had lots of recommendations for action before but been a little bit short on action."
"Very briefly, the information note from the European Court of Auditors says on page 7 that the adaptations and validations necessary to ensure the full implementation of the new accounting framework have been delayed."
"Why, and for how long?"
"On page 8 it concludes that CAP expenditure was still materially affected by errors."
"Why?"
"It adds that on internal policies the risk of errors will persist unless the legal framework is changed."
"Will it be changed and when?"
"We should all accept that these problems are not the fault of the Presidency."
"But will the Presidency accept that it has a responsibility to press for actions on these recommendations and could it perhaps write to me on the specific points that I have just raised?"
". I can assure the honourable Member that these are matters that we take extremely seriously."
"Indeed in the remarks that were made by my ministerial colleague the Foreign Secretary in this House this afternoon, he made clear that ‘failure to sign off accounts for the eleventh successive year, which is very poor, affects the climate of debate in all our countries’."
"So at every level of the British Government and in the course of our Presidency, we have recognised the need to take forward work on this issue."
"That is why we have been working with the Commission to improve financial management and control of the budget."
"In January 2005, the Commission introduced a new accounting system, which should offer the Court of Auditors better information as the basis for giving a positive opinion on the presentation of accounts."
"The new system, I understand, will be used to produce the accounts for 2005."
"The Presidency also secured Member States’ agreement at the 8 November ECOFIN Council on a package of further proposals for improvements in financial management and control, known as I described in my earlier answer as the roadmap, which the Commission has put forward."
"So I can assure the honourable Member that this is not simply a matter of concern to the British Presidency, but one which, in the course of that ECOFIN meeting and in support of the renewed efforts of the Commission, we have been determined to take forward."
"He is generous in acknowledging the fact that this problem, because it is a real problem for the European Union, long predates the British Presidency."
"I hope that in the course of the six months of the British Presidency, we will have been able to play our part in resolving what has been a long-standing issue, which has brought no credit to the European Union and on which I hope a way forward can be found in the months and years to come."
"Would the President-in-Office accept that there are few, if any, individuals in Brussels stuffing their pockets with money?"
"Would he also accept that most of the complaints that the Court of Auditors brings forward concern systems and procedures, and not fraud in its narrow sense, and that if fraud does occur it is generally in donor countries or, indeed, sometimes in the Member States of the European Union?"
". The honourable Member is of course right to acknowledge that although the European Court of Auditors’ report concerns the European Union accounts, 80% of the spending under that is in fact implemented by Member States through agriculture and structural funds."
"However, we must be take care not to simply deploy that argument in case we are perceived to be complacent in the face of the challenge we face."
"I would simply reiterate the point the Foreign Secretary made earlier, which is that, in the hands of those who are hostile towards the very idea of the European Union, the failure to sign off the accounts for the eleventh year is ammunition which we should certainly endeavour not to provide in the years ahead."
"It is certainly true that action needs to be taken at Member State level rather than simply at the bureaucratic level within Brussels, but that should not in any way provide an excuse for the action that other Members have called for not being taken both in Brussels and at Member State level."
"All of us with an interest in building and sustaining support for the European Union and its efforts amongst European citizens have a strong vested interest in seeing this long-standing problem being resolved."
"That will involve action at the Member State level, but it will also involve the kind of important work that we took forward at Ecofin and which, I am glad to say, has the support of the European Commission."
"I wish to follow Mr Martin’s observation to the Presidency-in-Office, because the President-in-Office used the expression ‘has brought no credit to the European Union’, as if somehow the European Union is a different institution from our national institutions. I simply should like to emphasise the fact that the reason the Court of Auditors has found it difficult to sign off the accounts is not because of corruption in the European Union – as distinct from the Member States – but because the Member States do not assist the European Union to give the sort of valid accountancy that the Court of Auditors and EU institutions require."
"I wish to ask the President-in-Office to give the public confidence that, of course, we must be scrupulous; but it is not somebody else’s fault: it is our Member States’ fault."
". With the greatest respect to the honourable Member, I disagree that the best way to tackle this problem that has existed for 11 years is somehow to get into an apportionment of responsibility which suggests that one is better than the other, or vice versa."
"The challenge, surely, is to recognise that there is a shared problem."
"It would simply be disingenuous if I were to suggest that this does not present a very considerable reputational risk to the European Union, not least in the way that this failure to secure a statement of assurance for the eleventh year running has been presented in newspapers in a number of countries across the European Union, rather than get into a ‘who is right, who is wrong’ argument."
"The challenge is to find solutions that reflect the respective responsibilities of the Commission, the bureaucracy in Brussels and the Member States, but it is not an adequate response to the fact that, for 11 years, a statement of assurance has not been forthcoming simply to say that this is a matter for Member States and therefore there is no shared responsibility to find a way forward."
"There is a shared responsibility on all of us who wish to see statements of assurance being forthcoming in the future to take the very kind of practical steps that the Commission’s proposals represented and that, I am glad to say, we advanced during the British Presidency at the recent Ecofin meeting."
"Can the Council indicate how it is proceeding with its resumed consideration of the proposal to revise the 1999 comitology decision?"
"Would it agree that the 2004 revised Commission proposal would, with just a few changes, be an acceptable basis for a lasting solution to the controversy over comitology?"
"Would the Council consider amending this proposal so as to exclude the possibility that the Commission may maintain without amendment an implementing measure that has been rejected by Council or Parliament?"
". I welcome the question from the honourable Member who I know has a long-running interest in the issue of comitology."
"He will know that discussions of the Commission’s amended proposals resumed once more only in September so I hope that he will understand that it is too early at this stage for me to give a definitive answer to his question on behalf of the Council."
"The working group considering the Commission’s revised comitology proposal has met three times so far and will meet twice more under the British Presidency."
"I understand, however, that discussions are going well."
"May I just thank the Presidency for its answer and urge it to persevere."
"If we manage to find a solution to this issue which has beleaguered the Union for many years, we will be making a notable contribution to our endeavours to regulate better."
"So much now comes to three readings each in Parliament and Council that really ought to be delegated to the executive."
"But we will not delegate unless we have the guarantee that we can, if necessary, call things back, in the same way that the Council can."
"Equality between Parliament and Council is the key to this."
"If there is better opportunity for scrutiny, we will in turn be willing to delegate much more readily."
". I pay due tribute to both the experience and expertise of the honourable Member on this matter."
"I find myself in concurrence with his view, both as to the importance of this issue and to the fact that we need to persevere."
"I can assure him that, from a Presidency point of view, we are persevering on this important point and will continue to do so."
"Finally, I just wish to reiterate that, notwithstanding the fact that these discussions only resumed in September, I am glad to say that real progress has been made in the discussions that have already taken place."
"I am optimistic that further substantial progress can be made in the two remaining meetings during the British Presidency."
"In a period of merely two weeks, we have received inconsistent messages from two Ministers in the UK Government, the country currently holding the Presidency of the Council."
"In his preface to the EU Annual Report on Human Rights 2005, published on 3 October, Jack Straw, Foreign Secretary of the UK, quoted Kofi Annan: 'we will not enjoy development without security, we will not enjoy security without development, and we will not enjoy either without respect for human rights.'"
"Mr Straw also said: 'it is essential that we continue not just to reaffirm these values, but to insist on their validity.'"
"However, on 26 September, the UK Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, was quoted in the New Statesman as believing that 'given a straight choice between security and the human rights convention ... [his] first responsibility is national security.'"
"Can the Council reconcile these seemingly contradictory statements?"
"If not, which of them most closely represents the view of the Council: given a straight choice between security and human rights, which would be its priority?"
". All governments face the challenge of dealing with the current unprecedented threat of global terrorism."
"However, there is no choice to be made between security and human rights."
"Without security there are no human rights, and without human rights there is no security."
"Following the attacks in London on 7 July this year, the Council held an extraordinary meeting on 13 July."
"At this meeting the Council adopted a declaration on the European Union response to those terrible bombings."
"In the declaration the Council made it clear that, and I quote directly: ‘the attacks are an affront to universal values on which the European Union is based."
"Central to those values is a commitment to democratic and open institutions and societies governed by the rule of law within which people of all faiths and backgrounds can live, work and prosper together."
"The terrorists who reject that commitment and seek to use violence to impose their ideas will be defeated’."
"They added thereafter that the European Union was strengthening, and again I quote directly: ‘its commitment to combating terrorism and upholding the fundamental principles of freedom, security and justice’."
"Thank you for your response."
"I accept that this is a matter in which there ought to be more choice and it is an issue of striking the right balance."
"What I would like to know is: in what way does the detention of persons without charge, the refusal to provide meaningful information for the reasons for detention and the removal of a lawyer’s right to take meaningful instructions in such matters either reaffirm these values or assert their validity?"
". I would suggest respectfully that the honourable Member is trying to tempt me into discussions as to the approaches or suggested approaches of one Member State or another, when my responsibility today is to speak on behalf of the Council."
"I can assure him that from a Presidency point of view the statement that I shared with Parliament and which was agreed by Council Members on 13 July is a strong basis on which, as a united front, we can confront the threat of international terrorism."
"Let us be very clear: the terrorists want to deny us not just life, through their vicious and unprecedented attacks on us, but also our way of life."
"That is why I think the statement made by the Council on 13 July is such a strong reflection of pan-European sentiments as to how we should deal with these challenges."
"The Swedish media reported on 14 October 2005 that the UK Defence Minister, John Reid, had publicly stated that the Member States should increase their respective funding for defence."
"According to the same media, the Defence Minister asserted that a reasonable allocation for Member States' defence budgets is approximately 2.5% of GDP, which corresponds to the UK's defence budget."
"Last year, Sweden's defence spending amounted to 1.7% of its GDP."
"Is it the Presidency's collective view that Member States should endeavour to bring their defence spending into line with the UK's?"
"Does the Presidency consider that Member States such as Sweden, which spends less than 2% of its GDP on defence, should increase their defence budgets?"
"Does the Presidency consider that this question should primarily be a common EU concern or that it should be entirely up to the Member States to judge what level of GDP it is appropriate to allocate to defence?"
". The Council has not discussed the level of Member States’ defence budgets as this is a national responsibility."
"As regards defence capabilities, ways are being sought to improve them by increasing levels of research spending, as well as research collaboration, tackling capability gaps and training."
"For this reason, and following up on the discussion at the informal Heads of Government meeting in Hampton Court, the Presidency has asked the High Representative, in association where appropriate with the Presidency, the future Presidency and the European Commission, to take forward work in this particular area."
"Working with the Presidency, the High Representative will present a summary of his initial orientations ahead of the December European Council."
"One of the Presidency's main priorities, as presented to Parliament on 23 June 2005, is to make progress on financing the EU and the 2007-2013 financial perspective."
"Bearing in mind that a last minute agreement will compromise the timely planning and the sound implementation of the Community's multiannual programmes, will the Council say what progress has been made in discussions on this issue?"
"What measures does it intend to take to obtain an agreement before the end of the UK Presidency?"
". Mr President, the Presidency is fully aware of the importance of reaching an agreement on the new financial perspective by the end of the year and will do everything it can to facilitate this."
"This has been something of a recurring theme of the discussions in the Chamber this afternoon."
"To this end, the Council undertook a series of bilateral consultations with Member States during the summer and discussions on this issue resumed in the Council on 7 November."
"They will continue, of course, at the General Affairs Council on Monday, 21 November."
"The Presidency will continue to work towards an agreement, but until such time as it might be ready to submit to the Council an overall compromise proposal, it cannot comment on what such a proposal might or might not contain."
"– Mr President, do you intend to notify the European Parliament, before the December summit, of the compromise text prepared by the Presidency?"
"Given that the United Kingdom played a leading role in June in overturning the agreement, is the Presidency sincerely willing to move so that an agreement between the twenty-five can be reached?"
"Have you considered in the Council that the British Presidency is in danger of proving to be one of the most inefficient and unsuccessful in the history of the European Union?"
". My colleague the Foreign Secretary indicated that this was the 47th appearance of a British Minister in the course of the Presidency before this Parliament."
"I can assure the honourable Member that I will be back in my customary place in the course of the further plenary sessions of this Parliament."
"Our Prime Minister has committed himself to coming back to speak to Parliament."
"Whatever other criticisms or scepticism may be directed toward the British Presidency, a lack of discussion with the European Parliament is perhaps not one of the most forceful."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, I will take advantage of this opportunity as I have drafted my own question on the same matter, Question No 17, which there may be no time to answer during this Question Time."
"I would like to ask if it is possible that this compromise proposal will also include a cofinancing procedure for agriculture, in order for agreement to be reached on scrapping the United Kingdom’s special rebate?"
". I admire the opportunism of the honourable Member in seizing the chance of a supplementary to raise the issue he was going to bring up in Question 17."
"I would simply, perhaps disappointingly, reiterate to him my earlier response to the effect that it really would not be appropriate, given the delicacy and importance of the issues that are being discussed and that will be taken forward in the course of our Presidency, to try and draw out a particular element of the potential package around which we hope to secure consensus in December."
"Since 1998, the Swedish citizen Lech Sierpinski has been subject to a travel ban in Poland and has, therefore, been unable to leave the country."
"As a foreign national in Poland, he has thus been deprived of fundamental rights for the past seven years and of access to health care and a work permit."
"Moreover, he is no longer able to fund the costs of his lawyer."
"All Member States must fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and have signed the European Convention on Human Rights which provides, inter alia, for the right to effective legal protection and a fair trial."
"The author of this question is well aware of the difficulty of commenting on individual cases but will the Presidency, nevertheless, say whether it considers that anything can be done at Council level to influence a Member State which, in such circumstances, does not satisfy reasonable requirements by providing guarantees of due process of law?"
". I can be brief in answer to this question."
"The Council has never debated this question and it is not within its sphere of competence."
"What progress has been made concerning the issue of Council transparency and openness since the President-in-Office of the Council answered my question H-0567/05(1) on the same subject?"
"Following the campaign launched by British political leaders in the European Parliament, what progress has the Presidency made in seeking to convince the Council to meet in public for the sake of transparency, openness and accountability?"
". Mr President, following the ongoing debate on transparency and openness in the Council and the exchange of views between the United Kingdom Presidency and Members of the European Parliament on this issue, a first discussion took place in COREPER, the Permanent Representatives´’ committee, on 19 October."
"The Presidency is currently exploring, together with the incoming Austrian and Finnish Presidencies, a series of possible measures aimed at further increasing legislative transparency in the Council."
"I thank the President-in-Office."
"Let me say what an enormous relief it is to have a few minutes of not debating REACH in endless groups around this Parliament – a few minutes only, I fear."
"I see that Mr Kirkhope is not here, but I am conscious that he raised this issue in an earlier debate."
"I should like to personally thank the President-in-Office for his efforts in this matter."
"I recognise that he is doing what he can to promote the agenda."
"I have here a copy of a letter from Mr Rasmussen, the Prime Minister of Denmark, stating that he supports a change in the rules of procedure."
"I suspect that similar letters could be obtained from Estonia and Sweden to start off with."
"We already know the British position."
"That is four votes and you need only another nine."
"I know the Council prefers to do things by consensus but in order to achieve something of real substance – a real change – should the Presidency not push this to a vote at the next General Affairs Council and name and shame Member States that do not support this position?"
". I am intrigued by the advice being offered by the honourable Member."
"A strategy of not seeking consensus and naming and shaming is a curious line of argument to advance but I think it indicates the seriousness of the strength of feeling among many honourable Members of this House on this important issue."
"The position of the British Government on this matter has been stated by none other than our Prime Minister, but he is right in recognising that the United Kingdom, although acting as Presidency, is not the sole actor on this stage."
"I fear I will disappoint the honourable Member by pointing out that, because the agenda for Monday is so heavily charged, as not only defence ministers but also development ministers will be involved, we will not discuss transparency next week."
"An options paper will be issued in the coming days and it will be discussed by the Antici Group before a discussion in COREPER II."
"COREPER I will also feed into that process so I am grateful for the generous words of the honourable Member."
"I can assure him it is a matter on which we are making continued efforts but we are convinced that the way forward is not to address it on 21 November at the forthcoming General Affairs Council, but to seek to make what will be important progress in these other fora which I have described."
"Mr President-in-Office, you were intrigued by the questioner."
"I am intrigued by your answer in pretending that the British Government stands in favour of more transparency."
"I have in my hand the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee report published on 24 October."
"It contains an answer setting out the British Government’s position in response to the proposition that there should be meetings of the Council held in public."
"It says: ‘the Government believes that it would not be possible for the European Council to reach agreement on difficult issues which cannot be resolved by the Council of Ministers if it is obliged to work in the full glare of publicity’."
"So, what is the real stance of the British Government?"
"Are you in favour of transparency, or are you in favour of avoiding working in the full glare of publicity, as this answer suggests?"
". I will answer the honourable Member by saying that, not least as befits the country holding the Presidency of the European Union, the answer will be provided in terms of the Presidency's proposals, because what matters is not the view of one country but the view of the Member States."
"When we issue proposals in the coming days, setting out to partners the possible options for increasing transparency in the Council, I can assure the honourable Member, who has spoken with eloquence in terms of the importance he attaches to this issue, that we will be discussing this paper with the incoming Presidencies and also with the Council Secretariat."
"These options will be taken forward in COREPER, as I said previously, on the basis of the options paper at the Antici meeting later this month."
"That, I believe, is the constructive way forward to ensure that we get the outcome which so many here seek."
"Is the Presidency aware of the long history of this issue in that this Parliament has pressed for the Council to meet in public when acting as a legislature ever since it was first elected in 1979?"
"Indeed, the British Presidency in 1976, when represented in the Energy Council by one Tony Benn, took the initiative of saying that Council should meet in public when acting on legislation."
"Would he recognise that we have made a lot of progress together in our gradually evolving Constitution, in that the Council now at least publishes the results of all its votes on legislation and grants the public a right of access to documents, but that it would be worth going one last extra step and actually meeting and voting in public when adopting legislation?"
". I defer to the honourable Member in terms of the detail of his historical understanding of this issue, reinforcing the longstanding interest that the Benn family has taken in this matter."
"It might be of interest to the honourable Member to be aware that this is a matter in which I have been in discussion with Tony Benn’s son, because he is now one of the United Kingdom’s representatives on the Council of Development Ministers and therefore has a direct interest in the position that we take in that and other Councils."
"I am glad to say that his observations reflect quite the weight of history that lies behind the important discussions that we are taking forward with Member States at the moment."
"In answer to the earlier question, I would simply reiterate the point that our own Prime Minister made when he addressed the European Parliament early in the course of the British Presidency: it is that impulse that has driven us to take forward the discussions at COREPER and that we now anticipate we will take forward in the days ahead."
"Mr President-in-Office, I apologise to you and the Presidency itself for being late."
"I spoke with Mr Hilary Benn on Sunday about this very matter when we were at Remembrance Day in Leeds."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office what the position is regarding what I was told by Mr Blair – and indeed what I was told today by Mr Straw – concerning how we go forward with this issue of openness and transparency in terms of the Council."
"I was told by Mr Blair that it would be fine to go ahead as long as it was within the rules."
"I was told by Mr Straw this afternoon that two options were being considered."
"I would like to know whether those options are within the rules or whether we are looking at a change in the rules."
". I am grateful to the honourable Member for reinforcing the contemporary nature of these discussions amongst British politicians."
"I cannot claim to have spoken to Hilary Benn in quite as recent days as he has, but I can assure you that, when I meet him at Cabinet tomorrow morning, I will search out what he told you at the Remembrance Service in Leeds on Sunday."
"In relation to the point he makes, however, he will have to wait just a little while longer because, before he re-entered the Chamber this afternoon, I was sharing with other colleagues the process that we are taking forward now: as he knows, there was a discussion at Coreper earlier in the course of the British Presidency."
"It will not be discussed on 21 November at the General Affairs Council."
"We have instead decided to set out an options paper which will be issued in the coming days of our Presidency and will then be discussed at the Antici before discussion at COREPER II."
"COREPER I will also feed into this process."
"If it would be of help to the honourable Member, I shall certainly ensure that he receives a copy of the options paper when it is issued."
"In an answer to a previous question (H-0692/05(2)) concerning the conclusion of a fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco, including the territories of the occupied Western Sahara, the Council says that 'it supports the UN process'."
"As regards the UN, the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly adopted a resolution on 11 October concerning the right of non-self-governing territories to their own natural resources."
"The resolution was supported by 137 members present, 22 of which are also members of the EU."
"France and the UK abstained, while Denmark was not present."
"On the basis of the Council's previous reference to support for the UN process, and in view of the resolution which was supported by the majority of EU Member States in the UN vote on 11 October, it could be concluded that the fisheries agreement negotiated between the EU and Morocco will not cover the territories of Western Sahara."
"Can the Council confirm that the ports and waters of Western Sahara will not be covered by the fisheries agreement?"
". Mr President, I should like to refer the honourable Member to the Council’s reply to his question H-0692/05 of 28 September."
"In my reply, I stated that Article 2 of the Fisheries Agreement initialled on 28 July 2005 indicates that it applies ‘to the Moroccan fisheries zone under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco’."
"This delimitation of the geographical scope of the agreement is identical to the delimitation in the previous agreement that expired in 1999 and does not in any way prejudice the issue of the status of Western Sahara."
"The initialled agreement is now in the ratification process, which is expected to lead to its formal conclusion in the first quarter of 2006."
"I wish to thank the Council for its answer."
"The problem with it is that it means that the EU has concluded a fisheries agreement whereby the EU will fish in the waters of Western Sahara, which is a country occupied illegally by Morocco."
"None of the EU Member States recognises Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara."
"However elegantly one puts it, there is no getting around the fact that you have concluded, or are on the way to concluding, an agreement that indirectly approves Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara due to the fact that the agreement extends to include negotiations concerning the occupied country’s natural resources."
"I think that this is deeply inconsistent and immoral."
"I therefore wonder whether there is not a lack of unanimity regarding the Council’s policy in this area."
". Let me assure the honourable Member that the political status of Western Sahara is being dealt with within the framework of the United Nations."
"The Council is offering the UN its full support in finding a satisfactory resolution to the question of Western Sahara, and hopes that a resolution of the situation will be forthcoming."
"As I stated earlier, the fisheries agreement does not in any way prejudice the issue of the status of Western Sahara."
"As with the previous longstanding agreement, the new EU-Morocco fisheries agreement applies to ‘the Moroccan fisheries zone under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco’."
"The fisheries agreement does not in any way prejudice that issue of the status of Western Sahara, as the honourable Member suggests."
"Mr President-in-Office, I do not think that one can, as Mr Sjöstedt has just done, simply describe Morocco as an occupying power."
"I would ask you whether the problem of the Western Sahara is not a relic of our own, European, colonial past, and whether we ought not to try to understand both sides – the Moroccans and the other factions – if we are to bring about a real compromise solution that takes account of Morocco’s interests too."
". Let me assure the honourable Member that we are looking for a genuine solution but we recognise that this genuine solution – the political status of the Western Sahara – is being dealt with in the framework of the United Nations."
"The United Nations enjoys the Council’s full support in seeking to find that genuine and satisfactory solution to the question of the Western Sahara."
"We certainly hope that a resolution of this situation will be forthcoming."
"Questions 16 to 36 will be answered in writing(3)."
"Parliament is concerned at the human rights violations in Tunisia that have come to light at the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)."
"On a visit to the country earlier in the year, and in a statement made in September, the President expressed his displeasure at the repression and harassment meted out to NGOs and the media in Tunisia, and pointed out that this runs counter to the spirit of the EU-Tunisia association agreement."
"The information society represents a huge opportunity for freedom of expression and the peaceful exchange of ideas, and enables people across borders and cultures to be brought closer together."
"What should have been a celebration of progress turned sour as a result of the harassment of human rights defenders from Tunisia and abroad and media representatives, and of the restraints on activities in defence of human rights and democracy in Tunisia that have been developed on the Internet."
"Parliament’s delegation to the WSIS led by Mrs Trautmann will express our position at the meeting itself and at the parallel citizens’ summit set to take place this week."
"We deplore the authorities’ attempts to stop this peaceful event from taking place."
"As Parliament made clear in its recent resolution, we stand shoulder to shoulder with all those working peacefully towards the development of democracy and the rule of law in Tunisia."
"The next item is the report (A6-0304/2005) by Mrs Scheele, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council introducing humane trapping standards for certain animal species (COM(2004)0532 C6-0100/2005 2004/0183(COD))."
"Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on her very honest and assiduous work and I should like to say that the proposal for a directive being debated is designed to introduce standards to safeguard relatively humane trapping conditions for the animals trapped."
"This proposal is dictated by the obligation for the European Community to give international commitments to Canada, Russia and the United States."
"These international commitments and obligations derive from the agreement on international humane trapping standards signed in 1998 between the European Community, Canada and the Russian Federation and from another agreement of similar content signed between the European Community and the United States in the form of agreed practices."
"The agreement with Canada and Russia, which has already been ratified by the European Community and Canada, will enter into force immediately after its imminent ratification by Russia, a procedure which, according to the Commission's official information, has already been set in motion."
"Consequently, unless the relevant Community legislation is adopted, the European Community will not be in a position to honour its international commitments when the agreement enters into force."
"The scope of the proposed directive is truly restricted."
"Nonetheless, if it is adopted, it will provide a framework for the adoption of common standards in the European Union in order to limit unnecessary suffering and distress for the animals trapped."
"The proposed standards are based on the results of serious scientific work within the framework of the International Organisation for Standardisation and, more importantly, have been adopted by the World Conservation Union."
"The proposal also makes provision for the Member States to be able to maintain in force and apply stricter national provisions."
"Furthermore, the draft directive adds to and does not subtract from existing standards on the basis of current Community legislation."
"For example, the ban in the European Union on the use of leghold traps based on Council Regulation 3254/91 will continue to apply even after the new directive is adopted."
"I must emphasise that, during the course of the procedure, we are willing to examine the relevant amendments in order to take account of the concerns expressed by various political groups and numerous animal welfare organisations and the Commission intends to continue to work in this direction."
"The rejection of the proposal will mean that the European Union will be left without any trapping standards in the immediate future and that the European Community will be unable to honour its international obligations."
"To close, I should like to stress that I shall take account of Parliament's opinion and I shall evaluate the positions formulated both in Parliament and in the Council."
"On this basis, the Commission will decide on possible action, including the possible withdrawal of the proposal."
"At the same time, the Commission is planning to prepare a study with a view to updating the scientific basis for any proposal on the adoption of trapping standards."
"The relevant consultations with the interested parties will, of course, also be included."
"Finally, I should like to express my wish to maintain good cooperation with you in the future."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after a very tense debate on chemicals policy, it is a great relief to get back to considering a topic on which there has already been a very broad majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and on which I assume there will be one tomorrow as well."
"As Commissioner Dimas said, the Commission proposal of 2004 is the instrument whereby the international agreement is to be implemented."
"My proposal that it be rejected was adopted virtually unanimously by the Environment Committee, with 47 votes in favour, 3 against and 2 abstentions."
"I will now proceed to explain why mine was one of the votes against."
"As the proposal is covered by the chapter on environmental policy, the European Union is obliged to take the latest scientific knowledge as the basis for the legislative proposal."
"Such a basis is absent; all that has been done is to incorporate, almost word for word, the agreement negotiated ten years ago."
"There are also legal incongruities between the proposal and other EU legislation, including, for example, the directive on the protection of animals used for experimental purposes and the habitats directive."
"The Commission proposal would allow the trapping and killing of animals protected by the habitats directive."
"There are, as we all know, certain circumstances under which trapping methods and traps may be necessary, but we stated from the very outset that it was inappropriate to describe the directive as laying down humane trapping standards."
"The proposal is very weak and will do nothing to reduce the suffering of animals caught or killed by means of traps."
"The Commissioner has himself made clear, and I do myself believe, that we have to recapitulate a certain amount of history if the firm rejection by Parliament is to be understood."
"It was in 1989 that Parliament adopted a resolution calling for a ban on the use of leghold traps in the European Union and on the import of furs and fur products from countries in which they were used."
"By way of a response to this, a regulation on this subject was adopted in 1991, which prohibited, with effect from 1995, the use of leghold traps and the import of the furs of thirteen named species from third countries."
"This ban does not apply where one of the two conditions is complied with."
"That is also the reason for this international agreement."
"Suitable legislation or administrative regulations are in force to prohibit leghold traps except where the methods used to catch the animals listed meet internationally agreed humane trapping standards."
"This EU regulation would make it a matter of the utmost necessity that trapping standards be established at international level in order to obviate a ban on imports."
"It was threats on the part of the USA and Canada to contest these import restrictions before the WTO that resulted in the negotiation of an agreement between the EU, Canada, Russia and the USA, which only the EU and Canada have so far ratified."
"The trapping standards prescribed in the agreement reflect norms already in force in Russia, Canada and the USA and can in no way be categorised as humane."
"It was as long ago as 1997 that the European Parliament adopted a report that described the international agreement as wholly inadequate in terms of either animal welfare or the environmental objective and expressed the view that it was wholly unacceptable that the European Union should sign up to it."
"An agreement offering not even the most minimal guarantee that the other parties would abandon the use of leghold traps within a speedy and specific timetable is not one that should even be put forward for serious consideration."
"This House adopted this report by a large majority in 1997."
"So much for the historical review."
"I hope we will, tomorrow, get a broad majority for the rejection of what I regard as a very poor proposal from the Commission, and also that the Commission will demonstrate that it has some grasp of what democracy is and will withdraw it."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Scheele, for the cooperation in the drawing up of the report we are considering today, which was very fair, indeed positively agreeable, even though we were not of one mind on every issue."
"We did, though, eventually agree, and so I can say, quite simply, that there are many roads that lead to Rome."
"This item on its order of business is characteristic of what makes the European Parliament peculiar."
"We are concerning ourselves with the transposition of an international agreement between Canada, the USA, Russia and the EU, even though this agreement was – as the rapporteur said – rejected in 1998."
"Only in the European Parliament can such a thing happen."
"Speaking personally, I do not find this situation so problematic, having, at that time, voted in favour of the agreement or, to put it another way, against its rejection, because I was confident that the participating countries actually would maintain the standards required, and because I was keen that these countries’ indigenous peoples should not lose their livelihood and should be able to live from trading in skins and pelts."
"That is certainly defensible on the grounds that trade was freed up, but something else that was achieved – and this was another reason why I voted in favour at the time – namely that cruel traps that tormented animals were banned, some of which, leghold traps, for example, were no more than instruments of torture."
"What made this achievement possible was years of pressure exerted by the European Parliament, by the Commission, and also by the animal welfare organisations."
"The Commission directive that we have before us today contains all the measures of the agreement that facilitate trade, by which I mean primarily the import of animal skins and furs into the European Union."
"It is for this reason that we believe that its implementation would have an impact on the internal market and should therefore be subject to Article 95 as its legal basis."
"The fact that this is not the case is another reason for us to vote against this report."
"Even though my amendments did not attract the support of a majority in this House, I should nonetheless like to bring them to the Commission’s attention."
"It may be that the time is not ripe for certain regulations."
"I proposed that these Commission proposals should find their way into a regulation calling on the Member States to transpose the agreement, and consequently committing them to all that it would entail – reporting and so on – as well. I regard this as the right approach."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that we need to make improvements to the parameters and also require research, but this is not a task for the European Union, but rather for the Member States, where conditions vary so widely that due regard must be had to subsidiarity."
"That is why we have rejected the Commission proposal."
". Mr President, I will do my best."
"Today – or rather tomorrow, in fact – we face a very tricky decision."
"We will be voting in favour of rejecting the Commission proposal, but I, for one, will do so reluctantly."
"We in this Parliament have a duty to contribute to the legislative process and we will be rejecting the proposal tomorrow without giving an indication as to how things should be done instead."
"That is, to my mind, a missed opportunity."
"It appears that all parties had grievances."
"Some thought the proposal was going too far, while others felt it did not go anything like far enough."
"We ought, though, to decide one way or another. The Commission would also have something to use as a basis if it tables a fresh proposal to implement the international treaty."
"I must, of course, also say a word about the muskrats."
"Needless to say, the Dutch dikes must be protected."
"We cannot promote animal welfare that is at the expense of our safety."
"I am not all that keen on drowning sets, though, and I would urge you as yet to review the trapping of muskrats and the methods used for it."
"To my mind, the following conditions must certainly be met before drowning sets can be installed."
"First of all, we must have reached plague proportions and, with it, damage to the dikes."
"This damage is evident in a number of locations in the Netherlands, namely in Frisia and South Holland, but in Brabant, this damage is far less pronounced."
"The second condition is that the drowning set is only to be used if prevention has proved ineffective or is impossible to implement, and the third condition is if no animal-friendly alternatives are available."
"Whilst it is disappointing that Europe will not table a workable directive in the short term, it is not the end of the debate."
"Neither should this, to my mind, spell the painful end of muskrats."
"For the time being, it is up to the Member States to take their own measures."
"I would therefore urge you to thrash out alternatives and reduce the animal suffering to a minimum."
"Rejecting this directive should not be an excuse in the Netherlands not to enter into the debate of muskrat control, and while I am on the subject, I should like to thank Mrs Scheele for triggering an enormous discussion, which we would not have had without her amendment."
"So let us therefore see the present situation in a positive light and do something that this House has not yet done by seizing the chance to make prevention a priority, developing the necessary alternatives, so that the Netherlands can make an important contribution to a fresh legislative proposal."
". Mr President, my group supports Mrs Scheele’s proposal to reject the Commission proposal."
"I think that she has demonstrated beyond doubt that this is an example of bad legislation."
"For example, the drafting of standards which traps must meet has not been underpinned by sound scientific research."
"The criteria to be met by traps and tests for the same are arbitrary."
"It is, of course, difficult to measure the suffering of animals."
"Where does stress end and the battle for life begin?"
"Moreover, especially in the catch involving live traps, the proposal does not cover the humanity of alternative methods that might have to be used to kill the animals."
"Animals often drown in a different way, are clubbed to death or kill each other."
"There is inconsistency between this proposal and the Habitat Directive."
"Certain animal species that are protected under the Habitat Directive – I would particularly mention the ban on catching and killing such wild animals as the otter, beaver, wolf and lynx – are also listed in the annex to the proposal on humane trapping methods."
"What are we to make of this?"
"Other animals too that fall within the scope of this proposal, including the marten and the badger, are protected or preserved in certain areas."
"In connection with this directive, I too cannot help but briefly mention a typically Dutch safety issue, namely the protection of its low lands from flooding by dike breaches."
"On account of its way of life, the muskrat undermines dikes, which forms a real threat to safety and public health in the Netherlands."
"While that animal is a foreign species and should, of course, be controlled in the most humane way possible, there is at the moment no useable and more humane method of control that is as effective as the drowning set."
"A ban on the drowning set – and I can imagine that the proposal will at some point return to such a ban – makes the effective control of muskrats impossible."
"Dutch safety and public health would be at risk as a result."
"On behalf of the muskrat, we must also find more humane trapping methods that can be used, but until such time as suitable alternatives are found, I think a clear exemption position for the Netherlands or for a situation in which safety is at risk, would be welcomed."
"I would like to finish off with a comment of a more general nature."
"In the European Union, we are indulging in animal protection ."
"A great deal is happening in the area of, for example, cutting down on animal tests. The cosmetics directive or REACH is a case in point."
"We also do something about international animal transports."
"This is all very important but also highly arbitrary."
"We have to ask ourselves what Europe would like to do, or indeed has to do, in the area of animal protection."
"Do we want a ban on collecting lapwings’ eggs in the Netherlands, or bull fighting in Spain or the fattening of French geese for , because those customs are animal-unfriendly or are they national matters to which Europe’s interference does not add any value?"
"It would not be a bad idea for us in this House and in the EU to think about what we do and do not want to do in the area of animal protection, rather than indulging in protection at random."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate our rapporteur on the perceptiveness she has shown in this matter, and we fully support her proposal to reject the Commission proposal."
"We can also endorse her arguments."
"Nevertheless, I would like to stress a few points."
"First of all, Commissioner, I would like to say that I very much appreciate the preparations you have made in terms of following up this project, in view of the European Parliament’s position."
"I would like to stress how inconsistent the Commission’s management of this issue of humane trapping has been."
"We must remember that, in 1998, the European Parliament rejected the conclusion of tripartite agreements with Russia, Canada and the United States, because it felt that they were not ambitious enough to be effective."
"Unlike today’s events, though, the vote in 1998 was of no consequence, because the Council could have concluded the agreements even against Parliament’s wishes."
"This time, however, the Commission has proposed a European directive to implement those same agreements, in other words a project that does not achieve the objectives it has set itself."
"So why, under such circumstances, would Parliament accept such a weak proposal?"
"That is our question to the Commission."
"With regard to the content, too, we find this proposal unacceptable."
"Not only has it been criticised by scientists, as my fellow Members have already said, and by animal welfare organisations, but it also does nothing to reduce the suffering of trapped animals."
"In this connection, I think we must look at the arguments put forward by Mrs Scheele, who explains quite specifically that we are not reducing this suffering at all."
"One final, vital point: this draft is unacceptable because, at the end of the day, it flouts European law, in that its positive list includes species protected under Article 12 of the Habitat Directive."
"It includes the otter, the wolf, the beaver and the lynx."
"And you know, Commissioner – and I am well aware of this, coming from France – how difficult it is to enforce the Habitat Directive, to protect wolves and to try to explain the situation."
"It is therefore for all these reasons that we are rejecting this proposal and that, in truth, Commissioner, we are counting on you to act as an intermediary between Parliament and the Commission and to get it to withdraw this draft."
"Mr President, this proposal for a directive from the Commission is no great success."
"Everyone, from hunters to those whose job it is to protect animals, may be said to be dissatisfied with its content."
"Our political group concurs with the criticism made."
"In particular, the content is obviously not based on the latest scientific findings, as a proposal for a directive of this type should, in fact, be."
"It is therefore time to withdraw the proposal and start again from the beginning."
"As we see it, it is a question of obtaining a balance in the proposal."
"Animal protection must come first, meaning that considerable improvements to the proposal are required."
"When the relevant regulations are laid down, it will, however, be important not unnecessarily to regulate hunting rules in the Member States to a degree greater than that required to protect animals against suffering."
"In the future too, this must, in the main, be an issue for individual nations."
"We hope that the Commission will come back with a new proposal."
"We would thank the rapporteur for her work and shall vote in favour of the report as it stands."
". Mr President, my group supports the proposal to reject this directive, albeit on the basis of arguments that are different from the rapporteur’s."
"Firstly, I take the view that this directive would render the effective control of pests impossible in certain Member States – I am thinking especially of the muskrat in the Netherlands."
"This can have major consequences for public safety."
"As long as the proposal contains no exemption in this respect, I cannot lend it my support."
"Commissioner Dimas said that he could understand the concerns of many organisations."
"I would like to know if he could also understand the concern we in the Netherlands have for the safety of our citizens, if dikes are undermined by muskrats digging burrows."
"My second argument for rejection concerns the legal foundation."
"Protocol 33 to the EC Treaty grants the EU competence in the area of animal welfare only in the framework of agricultural, transport, internal market or research policy."
"The draft directive implements the international agreement on humane trapping methods, which was concluded in the context of the common trade policy."
"Since the proposal harmonises the Member States’ standards for animal traps within the internal market and does not serve a direct environmental goal, Article 95 alone can be seen as the correct legal foundation for this proposal."
"I would like to have Commissioner Dimas’ reaction to this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, for the third time since 1991, in other words in 15 years, our Parliament, as usual during the night sitting, is discussing the issue of traps and their ‘barbarism with a human face’."
"In 1991, for example, we banned leghold traps and imports of fur from foxes, otters, lynxes and 13 species of animal from Canada and the United States."
"The ban was intended to apply as of 1995."
"In 1998, however, the Commission explained to us that it was necessary to extend the life of leghold traps in the interests of Inuits and their traditional hunting practices, even when the Inuit trappers in question are multinational fur companies with premises on Fifth Avenue in New York."
"In this very place, before the Irish Commissioner Mr Mac Sharry, I described an animal from the far North, the bones in its foot shattered, its tendons crushed and its arteries severed, which tears off its own foot and drags itself over the red-stained snow to die 20 metres away under the fir trees, all for the profit of a luxury industry run by people who are about as Indian as I, with the name Martinez, am genetically Swedish."
"This evening, then, in response to the directive on humane traps, which is supposed to enable us to take action to manage fauna, to protect dykes, to protect cultures and to respect the Treaties, I say ‘No! No!’, because, for every muskrat or badger that creates danger, we trap 10 silver foxes that create a profit."
"So, Mr President, Commissioner, let them live!"
"Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for the report."
"The vote in committee produced a clear result."
"I believe that we all, in principle, are glad to see regulations on the protection of wild animals, and so I regard an all-round approach as desirable."
"Let us just consider the great differences between the Habitats Directive, the Birds Directive and the protection afforded to other animals: those differences are not always justified."
"Account must, of course, also be taken of animals’ capacity for causing the sort of damage that endangers lives."
"I believe that we need to draw a distinction and simply give priority to human well-being."
"Let us just remember the breaches in the dams, of which we had such a powerful description from our Dutch fellow Members."
"That having been said, we do, as legislator, have to consider how we can come to the right decisions given the powers with which we have been endowed."
"As the basis of these powers has already, however, been the subject of dispute, considerations of legal certainty demand that this issue be examined with great thoroughness."
"If we follow the reasoning of the Commission and this House’s Legal Affairs Committee, the basis is Article 175 and that immediately following it."
"Since, though, this proposal does not take account of the most up-to-date scientific knowledge, I believe that the whole thing needs to be rejected."
"This is too important a matter for us not to seek out the best for animals as much as for human beings."
"It should also, of course, be borne in mind that the doctrine of subsidiarity requires that the Member States be given the opportunity to enact stringent animal protection rules, whilst also prioritising the safety of human beings."
"Mr President, I am not going to break the mould because I too support the idea of rejecting this proposal."
"As everybody else has said, it is hard to see any animal welfare benefits in what the Commission is proposing."
"I understand that the Commission’s own Scientific and Veterinary Committee queried the proposal, and there are even some question marks about how it was consulted."
"It is also perplexing – and I raised this in committee – to see a list of 19 species to be covered by the directive and then to discover that some of them were actually protected species in the European Union."
"It seems strange to describe how to trap animals that you are not allowed to hunt by law."
"I would appreciate the Commissioner’s comments on that."
"They say that you cannot please all of the people all of the time, but I am afraid that this proposal does not seem to please anybody at all."
"Therefore, I was pleased to hear that the Commissioner is prepared to listen to Parliament and to find an alternative way forward on this issue."
"Mrs Scheele has done a very good job and we have a united front in Parliament, which is very different from the debate the Commissioner witnessed on REACH yesterday, the outcome of which we will see tomorrow in the vote."
"If the purpose of this Directive has been to introduce humane trapping standards for certain animal species, then that purpose has failed."
"Its failure to take into account the latest scientific research evidence is contrary to certain other items of EU legislation and it will do nothing to ease the suffering of the wild animals which are trapped."
"In terms of the psychological and behavioural development of mammals, the main moral objection to the use of trapping methods as a means of killing is that the period between the animal being trapped and becoming unconscious, or its death struggle time, is too long."
"The fact remains, however, that the international agreement entered into by the EU, Canada and the Russian Federation, the environmental component of which this Directive wishes to transpose into EU legislation, is the first of two which deal specifically with the question of wild animal welfare, despite the fact that its primary purpose is to facilitate fur trading."
"I would like to draw your attention to Article 5 of this agreement, which comprehensively obstructs the efforts of countries which have already introduced hunting regulations surpassing international standards."
"If the existing standards only derive from a set of lowest common denominators, parties to this agreement will not be encouraged to consider developing more humane standards."
"Mr President, I would like to echo the comments that have already been made by several other Members in support of the position of Mrs Scheele, the rapporteur, in her report."
"As we have heard, colleagues want to reject the Commission proposal for a number of different reasons; but we are in agreement about the rejection."
"As has already been said several times, this proposal has been criticised by anyone who is involved in this area – by the scientists, by animal welfare groups, by pro-hunting groups – because it is not based on the latest scientific research evidence and it certainly does not prevent, or even reduce, the suffering of animals in traps."
"This Parliament has often shown its political will to protect animals and this weak proposal certainly does not achieve that."
"The standards here are not humane."
"We are not talking about a few animals, but about millions of animals that are trapped every year in the European Union."
"There are many areas where the proposal falls short of what can be achieved or what could be achieved to improve animal welfare."
"For example, it allows traps that are not classed as humane to be used while better traps are developed, but no time limit is put on this."
"The priority is for trapping to continue."
"There are no safeguards, as we have heard already, to protect endangered species from being killed in traps in some areas where we know those species are found."
"The only way to do that would be to ban traps in those areas."
"So for these reasons, and for many other reasons, it is not acceptable and the Commission should produce a new proposal."
"Mr President, the Commission’s proposal concerning trapping leaves a very great deal to be desired."
"Under the proposal, traps are to be tested according to strict standards, special training for trappers is to be introduced and home-made traps are only to be permitted in exceptional circumstances."
"If this proposal is adopted by the European Parliament, it will, in practice, be impossible to engage in trapping in the Nordic countries."
"It is gratifying that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety rejected the Commission’s proposal."
"Hunting issues must be decided at national or local level, not in Brussels."
"I want to draw Members’ attention to the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs has issued an opinion concerning the proposal’s legal basis."
"This opinion has been incorporated into the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and recommends that Article 175 form the legal basis for the proposal."
"This article concerns the EU’s environmental policy."
"The protection of wild animals is not, however, a part of the EU’s environmental policy and does not even come within the EU’s competence."
"If Article 175 were to constitute the legal basis, there would be a great danger of more and more matters such as this being regarded as EU issues and dealt with at EU level."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Scheele, that the Commission’s proposal should be rejected."
"Mrs Scheele is proceeding, however, on the basis that the proposal is not sufficiently far-reaching."
"I am of the opposite view."
"Of course, rules are needed, including in connection with trapping, so that, for example, animal protection is guaranteed."
"These rules must, however, be laid down by the Member States and not in Brussels."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I understand that this proposal will probably be rejected tomorrow."
"That is partly because powerful forces here in Parliament seem to want to regulate trapping in detail and almost put an end to trapping as such."
"It appears almost as though the ultimate objective is that trapping should not take place in Europe."
"For such people, this proposal is quite simply not sufficiently far-reaching."
"Even though they are often described as friends of the environment, they often make demands that are anything but environmentally friendly."
"The fact is ignored that trapping is an important part of caring for wildlife and the environment."
"I can quote, as an example of this, something I heard about the other day, namely that there are species of sea birds that depend on Finns catching, for example, raccoon dogs, which do not naturally belong to the local fauna but which have been imported."
"In my opinion, the Commission’s proposal is not too limited."
"On the contrary, it really goes much too far."
"Moreover, the Commission is trying to extend its powers to issues that the Member States really are best placed to deal with."
"I have two arguments I hope the Commission will take on board with a view to possible future proposals."
"Firstly, I think that we must take the existing international agreements as our starting point and not try to extend them in a way that is in danger of creating new barriers to trade."
"In the last analysis, doing that only hits individual manufacturers and hunters and creates problems."
"What is more, I think that, instead of taking a cue from the Commission and extending the agreement, it would have been enough to demand that the Member States themselves implement parts of this agreement."
"Secondly, this proposal would give rise to a lot of bureaucracy, which might be done away with."
"Member States such as Sweden have efficient systems whereby all traps are tested."
"In order to avoid bureaucracy, it should have been possible to approve the results of tests already carried out on various traps."
"I hope that the Commission will take these arguments on board and not just listen to the arguments of those who wish to put a stop to trapping."
"Mr President, the Commissioner spoke earlier on about our international obligations."
"I would argue that the so-called international agreement is at best ambiguous."
"I am no legal expert, but the Commission must agree that there are serious legal inconsistencies between this proposal and other EU policies, to which both Mrs McAvan and Mr Blokland, from different starting points, have drawn attention."
"Mr Maaten mentioned the Habitats Directive."
"However, there is also the protection of laboratory animals in research."
"These and others are serious and sound policies for the protection of wildlife and animals that are sadly used in laboratories."
"This is an important subject; it cannot be left merely to the luck of the toss."
"Air in the atmosphere and the air we breathe is rightly considered a subject necessary for environmental legislation at EU level."
"I would say to the previous speaker, Mr Fjellner, that this proposal falls into the same category of being important and necessary, but at the moment it fails to take account of many previous decisions."
"As Mr Schnellhardt noted, we have to work with other countries in the world – the United States, Canada and Russia."
"However, for our own credibility, I would argue that we can do better than this and we have to do so."
"I commend the rapporteur for her work and, speaking on behalf of this Parliament’s Intergroup on Animal Welfare, I too call for withdrawal of this proposal, because, sadly, it will do nothing for the welfare of animals."
"In the light of what the Commissioner has heard tonight, I suggest that to avoid humiliation tomorrow, he withdraws it before it is put to the vote in plenary."
"Mr President, I naturally agree with both my own group and the others that have put forward arguments against the Commission’s proposal, and I shall not go over these arguments again in this Chamber."
"In actual fact, I asked to be given the floor just to remind people that animals that live almost unobserved in the wild have better lives than animals kept in cages."
"We have seen dreadful pictures from China of bears kept in cages for the sake of their fur, but it is not, of course, only bears with which we are concerned here."
"In Denmark, we have large fox farms, and these are dreadful too, no matter what type of trapping is practised. Fox farming is outright cruelty to animals."
"I think that we must include other animals as subjects of this debate instead of ignoring this problem and only taking an interest in the cruelty to animals caused through trapping."
"I should like to emphasise that we must broaden our perspective in order to avoid legitimising the brutal treatment of animals on farms in both China and Denmark."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I could not disagree more with the previous speaker."
"I think the farming of animals for fur in Europe is in much better shape than farming animals in China."
"Deer farming, fox farming and mink farming are totally different issues."
"I would like to take this opportunity to express my support for Mrs Scheele’s conclusion that the Commission proposal should be rejected."
"However, I do not agree with her reasons for doing so."
"Firstly, the legal basis of the Commission proposal is questionable."
"This proposal seeks to implement a trade agreement allowing the EU to comply with its international trade obligations, but its contents relate to the welfare of wild animals, for which the EU does not and should not have competence."
"The Treaty only empowers the EU to take responsibility for animal welfare in the context of agriculture, transport, internal market research and areas such as the welfare of farmed animals, fur farming included."
"Secondly, the Commission has failed to provide an impact assessment of the proposed directive."
"The estimated cost of testing for a single type of trap varies from EUR 30 000 to EUR 100 000."
"Carrying out the testing by technical means would make the requirements more reliable, cheaper and easier to measure and standardise across the Member States."
"But there is a problem, as Mr Evans said."
"Laboratory animals are animals too and we have to take care of their welfare as well."
"Furthermore, the idea that home-made traps would require a special permit for each use is hallucinatory."
"How does the Commission think the permit requests of tens of thousands of Finnish trappers would be handled in Brussels?"
"Thirdly, like many of the previous speakers I would like to underline the detrimental effects of the proposal on the conservation of wildlife and nature."
"The raccoon dog, which is not a native species of Finland but is an extremely efficient predator of birds and other wildlife, can only be effectively managed by trapping."
"If the trapping were made as difficult as the proposal suggests, the loss of biodiversity would be enormous."
"In general, it is essential to rely on local knowledge in applying trapping and hunting legislation."
"Only local people have sufficient knowledge of the local flora and fauna to help set up balanced legislation."
"The wrong kind of intervention at EU level can compromise an otherwise noble objective, as in all areas where subsidiarity should be upheld."
"I sincerely ask the Commission to withdraw this proposal in order to avoid humiliation tomorrow."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall try to encapsulate much in a short space of time."
"Hundreds and thousands of animals are caught in traps all over the European Union, and the practice is primarily used to manage animals living in the wild and, in particular, to combat pests, of which muskrats are but one example."
"It was in 1998 that the EU, together with Canada, Russia and the USA, concluded the agreement on international humane trapping standards."
"These countries are the principal exporters of furs and pelts, and the EU, in two decisions, rightly justified this by reference to its competence in general economic policy and, in particular, in policy affecting the internal market."
"The present proposal for legislation constitutes an attempt at transposing this agreement into EU law; the substance of it is that the Commission is arguing for a balance – which certainly stands in need of further discussion – between the need for the avoidable suffering on the part of animals to be limited and the need for trapping as a means of catching them."
"It has to be said, though, that the proposal takes environmental policy as its primary basis, but the EU is responsible for the well-being of animals only in conjunction with other policy areas, such as agriculture, transport, the single market or research."
"It follows that it possesses no general competence with regard to the well-being of animals in the wild."
"This House, of course, is – as of course, am I – all in favour of safeguarding the well-being of animals in the wild, but that, as a subject for legislation, is a matter for the Member States."
"It is because the European Parliament, as the European legislature, must respect the Member States’ rights under subsidiarity that it must reject this proposal for legislation irrespective of the good intentions it contains."
"I have to tell the Commissioner that the enactment of relevant regulations by the Member States will discharge the European Union’s obligations."
". Mr President, I should like to start by saying that democratic procedures include the rejection of proposals and I do not consider that to be humiliating or embarrassing."
"It is part of the democratic process which we must take into account."
"As I mentioned earlier, I have taken account of the position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety concerning the rejection of the Commission proposal and I have heard this evening all the different opinions formulated here, opinions which may in numerous instances have had various starting points but which almost all arrived at the same conclusion."
"The proposal for a directive being debated would have filled a legal gap, given that, if we exclude the 1991 Council regulation, there is no other legislation on trapping standards at European Union level and, at national level, the existing legal framework is very restricted."
"In all events, this proposal would add to the existing legislation of the Member States, not subtract from it: where there is stricter legislation, this would continue to apply."
"Nonetheless, given your concerns and taking account of the Council's position, I wish to inform you that the Commission will examine its next steps on this proposal very carefully, including of course the possibility of withdrawing it."
"At the present stage, however, I would like to say that we need to examine all the relevant parameters."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"- A6-0292/2005 by Mr Romeva i Rueda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the Council's Sixth Annual Report according to Operative Provision 8 of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports (2005/2013(INI)),"
"- A6-0297/2005 by Mr Kristovskis, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction: a role for the European Parliament (2005/2139(INI)), and"
"- A6-0288/2005 by Mr Wuermeling, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Green Paper on defence procurement (2005/2030(INI))."
". Mr President, I would like firstly to thank not just my fellow Members, but also the Commissioner, for being here, although I must express my regret that the Council, significantly, is not here."
"It had promised to attend but, owing to a last minute change to the order of business, it cannot be here. I do not believe that this problem is the fault of the Council, but rather the Bureau, and I regret that we cannot now hold this debate together with the Council."
"Given that my report evaluates the Council’s actions, its absence is particularly regrettable."
"Nevertheless, this is an important, fundamental, issue, as demonstrated by the interest shown by many sectors of civil society in the issue of both arms control and the lack of such control."
"Selling arms is not like selling fridges, t-shirts or computers. It is an issue that has very serious repercussions at many levels and the consequences of mass uncontrolled sales may therefore be disastrous."
"We must remember a significant fact: every minute somebody falls victim to a firearm."
"Furthermore, spending on this kind of export and this kind of purchase prejudices other investments that are often much more necessary for economic and social development."
"Moreover, those exports and purchases often have a destabilising effect from a regional point of view, because they often lead to an arms race which will ultimately present us with a huge problem."
"For all of these reasons, transparency and control in relation to this kind of export is fundamental."
"The figures are clear."
"In 2003, the international arms trade turned over between 34 000 and 43 000 million dollars and the main exporters include European countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Germany, from which 25% of total world exports originated."
"We Europeans therefore have a great responsibility."
"Furthermore, of the main importers, we must stress that China and India are two of the countries that receive and buy the greatest quantities of these types of products."
"We have a code of conduct in Europe approved in 1998 which is insufficient – as we have been saying for a long time."
"It is weak and it is not legally binding."
"In the report that we debated last year, therefore, for which it was also my honour to be rapporteur, we proposed making it legally binding ― which we have also taken up in this new review report."
"In fact, the report approved a few weeks ago by the Committee on Foreign Affairs clearly specified the need to strengthen the code of conduct and turn it into a legally binding text."
"Furthermore, this report raises other issues that are also important: for example, the fact that transfers of production capacity are subject to the code and that special monitoring mechanisms are established for cases in which it has been decided to lift the arms embargo."
"I would just like to say that, with regard to the specific case of China, we must remember that, once again, this House has stated that it is not in favour of lifting the arms embargo in the current circumstances."
"Firstly, because sufficient and reasonable conditions are not in place for doing so and, secondly, because doing so would send the completely wrong message, not just to China, but to the world in general, about how seriously we take this kind of embargo."
"The report also mentions aspects that relate to arms brokering, the regulation of torture equipment, the impact of enlargement and also the role to be played by the European Union in relation to the United Nations."
"The Dutch Presidency promised us – and we are pleased about this – that there would be a review of the code and that it would be strengthened, and also that it would be turned into a common position."
"We are at the end of 2005, two more Presidencies have gone by and we are still waiting."
"We must acknowledge that the British Presidency has placed great emphasis on the need to conclude it and we hope that this will have been done by the end of its six months, but for the moment we are waiting."
"Finally, on the subject of presidencies, I would like to end by expressing my regret that one thing is unfortunately missing from the priorities of the coming Austrian Presidency: there is no mention of the issue of small arms."
"Given the importance of this issue, not just in this House, but in civil society in general, we believe that its absence is very worrying and that it must be included within the context of the need and commitment the Council and this House have repeatedly expressed in favour of an international arms treaty."
"I would insist that this report represents a step forward and I hope that we do not waste more time in relation to this issue, since we do not have time to waste."
". Commissioner, representatives of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, this evening’s debates about combating the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction confirm the European Parliament’s understanding of the need to actively participate in solving the greatest threat to contemporary civilisation."
"It has to be said that the drafting of the report was politically and technically complicated, taking into account the global character and special features of the threats caused by weapons of mass destruction (WMD)."
"However, the European Parliament has been able to tackle the complexity of this issue."
"In this connection, as rapporteur, I would like to express my gratitude both to my colleagues in Parliament and also to the specialists in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Personal Representative and her office, as well as to the Commission’s specialists for their active and constructive collaboration in drafting the report over a period of many months."
"In my view, the most important conclusion is the concern about the fact that, unfortunately, among the international organisations and Great Powers involved there is no common understanding or agreed action with regard to restricting the proliferation of WMD and the materials and technologies connected with them."
"This is worrying because the most influential international organisations and states acknowledge, at the same time, that WMD and their proliferation pose the greatest potential threat to the safety of mankind."
"Among criminal and terrorist circles, there is a growing interest in WMD and their constituents."
"What is more, since the cold war era this threat, far from decreasing, is actually increasing."
"Therefore, the report contains an assessment not only of the jointly implemented policy of the European Union and its Member States with regard to WMD non-proliferation and restriction, but also an examination of aspects of the activities of the USA, Russia and other states that are jointly responsible."
"The report voices dissatisfaction regarding the inability of the international community to reach a consensus at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference held in New York in May this year."
"This is seen as a serious blow for multilateralism."
"As is well known, the 40-plus priority measures put forward by the European Council and Commission to improve the situation did not receive adequate support."
"This confirms the diversity of interests, tactical thinking and action among states with international influence."
"Such a lack of trust does not foster multilateral cooperation but devalues the activity of the International Atomic Energy Agency and other special chemical and weapons control organisations."
"Their information is frequently critical in keeping the issue of weapons of mass destruction subject to international control."
"Similarly, when the report was being debated within the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, differing opinions were expressed concerning steps that could be taken internationally on a multilateral basis."
"For example, there were differing views about Iran’s current politically sensitive nuclear programme."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will touch on one more aspect of the report which is, in my view, particularly pressing."
"I believe that the success of the European Union’s common strategy on WMD proliferation is now to a large extent dependent on the available financial aspects of the European Union’s strategy for restricting the proliferation of WMD."
"It has to be said that currently the absence of a goal-oriented, distinct funding heading is undermining successful implementation of the strategy."
"Unfortunately, there is no clarity at the moment either in the European Parliament or in the other European institutions about the funding of the priorities laid down by the Council’s Personal Representative or of the programmes accepted by the Commission’s global partnership of eight."
"This is absurd, since it would be necessary, according to previous political decisions, to allocate more than 900 million euros over the next five years for the various measures in European Union programmes planned for the restriction of WMD proliferation, for disarmament and for weapons destruction."
"This figure and this level of funding demonstrates the European Union’s ambitions in previous years, but there is a time when the political will to fulfil commitments that have already been undertaken has to be demonstrated."
"This means that the Commission and the Council first of all need to be able to agree on drafting a goal-oriented, effective financial instrument for the needs of the WMD programme within the framework of the next Financial Perspective, as well as within the Community budget, and the funding framework of the European Council’s Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"The problems that have arisen confirm the need for the European Parliament, as an institution with budgetary powers, to participate in ensuring consistent provision for the European Union’s security strategy."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue with which my report is concerned is fundamentally different in character from the things we have just heard addressed."
"It is not about how we deal with weapons at the international level, or about arms limitation, but rather about whether we want to make it possible for the procurement of military equipment to be liberalised within the European single market."
"I would like to start by expressing my very warm gratitude for the input provided by those Members who had a hand in drawing up the report, whether as rapporteur in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or as shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"My discussions and conversations with them have been a source of very useful suggestion, which have been incorporated into the report."
"I also want to thank the Commission for its very good cooperation, which involved it being willing to delay the adoption of the subsequent White Paper until after we had delivered our opinion."
"I am also grateful to the interested parties for taking part in our hearings and thereby helping to prepare the sector for these changes."
"The topic is a decidedly delicate one, as the procurement of military equipment can be said to touch upon the very heart of national sovereignty."
"It was for that reason that the Treaty establishing the European Community, back in the 1950s, included a derogation clause safeguarding the interests of national security."
"Over the past decade, though, we have, progressively and continuously, moved closer together even on fundamental matters of security policy, and the debate on the two preceding reports is a demonstration of how we, in these areas, are taking a fundamentally global approach to policy."
"The procurement market within the European Union remains, however, utterly fragmented, with every country having its own preferred suppliers and purveyors by appointment."
"Instead of competition, there is a fragmentation that prevents our industry from being competitive internationally and entails very high costs in the purchase of military equipment that might be available on more favourable terms elsewhere, and that is a burden on the wallets of the taxpayers who, ultimately, have to pay for it all."
"It was for that reason that we, in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Foreign Affairs arrived, on parallel lines, at the conclusion that the time has come for us to venture a bold step."
"We endorse the Commission’s proposal that this derogation clause, Article 296, should be clarified and made more precise, and we do so because we have established that it is widely abused."
"This clause is used as a pretext for removing practically the whole of the military equipment procurement sector from the internal market."
"There is a black hole in the internal market, and that with a total expenditure of EUR 160 billion per annum."
"We want the public to get the message that the mutual opening-up of procurement markets testifies, among other things, to the Member States’ trust in one another."
"Let us – we want to say to them – take a step forward that will make it possible for state expenditure to be cut back, and let us set in motion a process that will eventually make us more competitive and perhaps even enable us to free ourselves to some degree from certain dependencies on suppliers outside Europe!"
"I need only mention the current procurement arrangements for the refuelling of aircraft or for guided missiles, where we are largely dependent on supplies from other markets."
"Let me conclude with a few brief words on the amendments that have been submitted."
"I believe that the key to our reaching a common mind without regard to party boundaries on this matter has been that we said at the very outset that we would concentrate on the issue of the single market and would not allow the discussion to get bogged down in general policy issues relating to security, the armed forces and peacemaking."
"The result of this has been that Mrs Beer, from the Greens, and I, as a member of the CSU, began the deliberations with largely identical reports."
"These amendments, which are somewhat ideological in character, have made them less so."
"I therefore recommend that you endorse the report, but vote for none of the amendments except Amendment 5."
". Mr President, the rapporteur Mr Romeva i Rueda should again be commended for putting together a report that challenges Member States to attain better, more stringent, harmonised controls on arms exports."
"Whilst the report's primary focus is on stimulating improvement in European practice, it also recognises the EU's potential to stimulate best practice in the European Neighbourhood and in the wider world."
"It advocates an international arms trade treaty."
"The Commission strongly supports opening negotiations on a legally binding arms trade treaty."
"We believe this would be of great value, not least in reducing the spread of illicit small arms and light weapons, which help fuel human insecurity, crime and conflict around the world."
"This is an area where the Commission does not take the lead but where we are fully associated under the CFSP."
"The Commission is regularly involved, with other international organisations and NGOs, in dealing with the consequences of inappropriate or illegal arms sales."
"We are also contributing, through implementing specific projects, to reducing destabilising accumulations of weapons around the world."
"As the report points out, around half a million people die each year as a result of small arms violence."
"In the face of these sobering statistics we cannot be complacent."
"Turning to the second part – the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction – I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kristovskis, on this very important work."
"It is now two years since the adoption of the EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"The non-proliferation regime is seriously challenged."
"The risk of terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction is considered by many a very serious threat."
"The European Union is defining its budgetary priorities for the coming years."
"All of this makes the report not only important but also very timely."
"The area is not new to the Commission."
"As mentioned in the report, the Commission has long been engaged in cooperative assistance programmes to reduce the risks associated with WMD-related materials, equipment and technologies, particularly in the area of the former Soviet Union."
"The Commission has also gained experience by implementing EU joint actions on non-proliferation in Russia under the CFSP framework."
"These actions constitute the core of the Commission's contribution so far to the G8 global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"I, along with the rapporteur and the honourable Members of Parliament, very much regret that the negotiations on non-proliferation in New York were not very successful."
"This does not send a good signal to countries like Iran."
"The EU strategy calls for the creation of a specific Community budget line in this domain."
"The Commission has responded to this call by inserting important non-proliferation objectives in its October 2004 proposal for the Stability Instrument."
"This and subsequent proposals are under consideration here and in the Council."
"A positive outcome to these negotiations is essential."
"While the overall financial issues are being discussed, I would like to express my appreciation to Parliament for enabling, in agreement with the Council, the Commission to implement a series of pilot projects in this area."
"They help to define how Community instruments might best contribute to strengthening EU non-proliferation assistance."
"In early December a high-level interparliamentary conference will take place in Brussels, where a series of independent studies on the way ahead will be presented and debated."
"I am grateful for the excellent cooperation with Parliament in organising this event."
"We hope to see many parliamentarians present on that occasion."
"As requested in the report, the Commission stands ready to provide further information to Parliament on past and ongoing Community programmes supporting WMD non-proliferation and disarmament goals."
"It goes without saying that the Commission looks forward to continued good cooperation with the Council and Parliament in support of these overall objectives."
"Let me now turn to defence procurement."
"The role of the European Parliament in such a sensitive debate is crucial, and I am glad that the Commission will now be able to take Parliament's contribution into account."
"As you know, in the next few weeks the Commission will adopt a communication on the results of the public consultation that has taken place over the last few months."
"It is very important that this communication adequately reflects the position taken by Parliament."
"I warmly thank, on behalf of Commissioner McCreevy, all those who made this possible, in particular Mr Wuermeling, Mrs Beer and Mr Hökmark, who did a remarkable job in their respective committees."
"The Commission, which was urged back in 2002 by the European Parliament to take initiatives in this field, is particularly happy with the content of this House's contribution."
"The ultimate objective of the Commission in this field is to open up defence markets, which are today, as the rapporteur said, highly fragmented, and to increase the efficiency of public spending by encouraging competition and transparency in these markets."
"This should benefit both buyers and taxpayers but also the European defence industry, which is suffering from a market structure which prevents it from competing in the global market place."
"The public debate carried out over the last few months and the various contributions received show that the majority of the stakeholders share the same objective."
"Even Member States now seem convinced that something has to be done quickly in order to move things forward."
"The current negotiations within the European Defence Agency on a code of conduct clearly show the political will to put an end to a situation that is unanimously considered unsatisfactory."
"The Commission is, therefore, ready to play its part in this process."
"In particular, it could clear up those issues where the consultation has shown that different interpretations of the existing rules have led to differences in implementation."
"This could be done easily and quickly, by means of an interpretative communication, under the Community's and the Commission's sole responsibility."
"But also – and perhaps more importantly – it could propose new, more flexible rules for the procurement of defence material, rules which better suit the specific nature of this material."
"This would be neither quick nor easy."
"It would require a new legislative proposal."
"At this stage, a specific directive on defence procurement seems to be, therefore, the most appropriate legal instrument, which could address all the important issues that national authorities need to take into account when they procure defence material, such as security of supply, confidentiality or particular urgency."
"The Commission will carry out the necessary preliminary assessments and consultations and the European Parliament will be closely involved in this process."
"I thank you very much for your support and for your three very important reports."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am to talk about defence procurement and should like to say thank you to Mr Wuermeling for his report on this issue."
"I think it important to state that defence procurement will play a decisive role in enabling Europe to be a leader in military terms and in terms of technology."
"However, defence procurement is also crucial if we are to play a role in terms of research and development in this area."
"This means that we need to have large companies that can operate on an international basis and come up with the best products."
"What we are concerned with here is obtaining better value for money, but we are also concerned with playing a part in developing military technology enabling Europe to hold its own in terms both of security policy and of cooperation with other parts of the world."
"One basic issue is that of how we are to obtain the industrial capacity to be at the leading edge in terms of developing modern technology."
"Europe’s problem is that we have a fragmented market because of historically differing security interests."
"With a declining number of purchases and lower defence appropriations, together with – and this is something important to remember – a significant increase in the need for research and development, Europe is not well placed if developments on our continent are to be more or less in balance with, for example, those in the United States."
"One of the more crucial tasks is therefore to ensure that, when it comes to the type of defence procurement falling within the framework of Article 296 of the Treaty, we can obtain increased cooperation in terms both of procurement and of open competition among producers."
"If we do not succeed in obtaining all this, we shall not be able to compete or play our part in developing the most advanced defence equipment, for such equipment is covered by Article 296, which permits derogations for the Member States."
"If we are to be able to alter this situation, the very first step is to obtain a common code of conduct and, in the longer term, a directive."
"It is, however, important for a start to be made on this work. Otherwise, the foundations of the European defence industry will be undermined."
". – Commissioner, representatives of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank Raül Romeva i Rueda, the rapporteur, for the work he has done in evaluating the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports."
"Since I was entrusted with the task of drafting the opinion of the Committee on Development on this issue, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the fact that we were able to agree on the inclusion in the report of the aspects which the Committee on Development considered most important."
"On behalf of the Committee on Development I would like to express my conviction that the export of arms to poor, conflict-ridden states cannot be tolerated, since it fosters poverty and violations of human rights."
"It is paradoxical for governments to talk about combating poverty and strengthening the rule of law, but at the same time to allow SALW trade to repressive regimes and states experiencing extreme military conflicts."
"It has to be said that the impact of SALW trade is particularly detrimental for development policy in the Cotonou Agreement states."
"We can see a similar view in the 2000 report."
"For this reason, the Committee on Development calls on the Council and the Commission to formulate SALW guidelines precisely for developing countries; emphasises the need for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration measures; repeats the need to draw up a package of new post-embargo instruments, and calls on the European Union Member States, the Council and the Commission to encourage the African Union and Africa’s regional bodies and to strengthen the arms control export requirements regionally and nationally in accordance with the standards of the European Union’s code."
"The need to make the code of conduct on arms exports legally binding is emphasised."
"The Committee on Development would also like to draw attention to the need for a trade agreement on weapons to be in an internationally legally binding form."
"I hope that the opinion of the Committee on Development, which has been put forward for the first time, is an important contribution and reaffirms the truth that security is the primary precondition for development."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, according to Operative Provision 8 of the code that we are examining, Parliament and the Council are obliged to re-examine this document every year."
"It is a fundamental provision, which should in future become the main means of introducing amendments to the code. It has already enabled us to improve the code, making it a dynamic instrument that can adapt from time to time to the problems and changes associated with the arms export trade in the European Union."
"Suffice it to say that the ten new countries that have joined the European Union have been able to add their valuable contributions because of this review mechanism."
"The most important development introduced by the sixth report concerns the possibility of transforming the code of conduct into a common position, thus making it legally binding."
"The Council ought to start working towards this without delay, because a policy regulating arms exports, based on a legally binding common code, can play a key role in fighting terrorism and preventing conflicts."
"The second welcome new element is the ‘toolbox’, intended for countries where an arms embargo has just been lifted."
"In this respect, I think the report is right to emphasise the European Parliament’s courageous stand against lifting the embargo on China until that country significantly improves its record on human rights and on civil, religious and political freedoms."
"There are obviously some aspects of the report where we should have liked to see more tangible progress, for instance as regards information exchange and the denial notification system."
"Nonetheless, the positive results achieved so far bode well for the future."
". Mr President, it is unfortunate that it is at this late hour that we are debating a number of topics that are actually very important and certainly very urgent, namely the problems relating to the non-proliferation target and the non-proliferation treaty."
"That is why I also regret the presidency’s absence this evening, especially since the country currently holding the presidency of the European Union is also a recognised nuclear power."
"Maybe the message could be passed on that the presidency’s presence is very much wanted during debates of this kind."
"There is once again a pressing need for campaigns aimed at stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction."
"If anything, the number of states that have nuclear weapons appears to be growing, and that is setting a bad example to other countries and at the same time, as the Commissioner already said, there is a real and evident risk of terrorists getting hold of weapons of mass destruction or nuclear material."
"The international framework must be reinforced as a matter of urgency in order to be able to face up to those risks."
"Just now, though, we can perceive a trend towards settling disarmament matters outside of international frameworks."
"This year, the international community, including Europe, has failed to adjust, revamp and strengthen the non-proliferation treaty, while the United States increasingly wants to pursue its own disarmament policy, particularly where the fight against the spread of nuclear weapons is concerned."
"Both are highly detrimental to the credibility and effectiveness of the global non-proliferation regime that is still an essential pillar of our policy."
"That is why it is of the utmost importance for us to counter this trend and get a better grip on the spread of not only weapons of mass destruction, but also of nuclear technology and nuclear chemical and biological material; the same applies, in fact, to the exports of conventional weapons."
"The European Union will need to lead the way in terms of where the non-proliferation treaty is heading, but is also doing good work in many other areas, such as the recent proposal, or lobby, for an international arms export treaty."
"At the same time, there are more contradictions in the international regime, which also involves European countries."
"The recognised nuclear powers in the world have a particularly significant responsibility."
"They exert most pressure on countries that want to break free from the international system, and at the same time, they consider modernising the nuclear arsenal, and one of them even refuses point blank to subscribe to the ban on nuclear tests."
"Europe is one of the driving forces – that is another contradiction – behind the international non-proliferation regime."
"One of the absolute priorities in the European Security Strategy is, under European guidance, to try to find a peaceful solution to the Iran issue; at the same time, we invest far less in the clearing of nuclear arsenals than the Americans."
"The Kristovskis report is therefore right to call for increased financial backing for this political priority."
"Finally, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament sets great store by the rule of international law."
"In the Committee, we discussed at great length the paragraphs in the Kristovskis report on the use of violence to prevent non-proliferation, the spread of nuclear weapons."
"We still think that the clause in the report does not do enough justice to our opinion about international rule of law and the role of the United Nations in this."
"If those paragraphs remain unchanged and if Parliament decides tomorrow to back this clause, then I do not rule out an abstention from our group when we come to cast our final votes on this report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like Mr Wiersma, I would have liked this debate to have been held at a rather more civilised hour, since it is one that I – as a member of both the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and also the Committee on Foreign Affairs – regard as particularly important."
"We are all, of course, aware of the fact that the Member States currently evade the rules of the internal market where armaments are concerned by claiming, under Article 296 of the European Communities Treaty, an essential national interest in the procurement of new weapons systems, while not limiting this to real weapons systems, but practising it in the procurement of all types of military equipment."
"Since it appears, on closer examination, that only some 4% are covered by Article 296, it is necessary to find a way of bringing about greater transparency in the award of the remaining 96% of public tenders."
"The Commission has earned our gratitude by taking the initiative, and the report’s rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, has argued in favour of the drafting of a communication interpreting Article 296 and of a directive on public contracts in areas with relevance to security."
"Speaking on behalf of my group, I recommend endorsement of the report, although we do not want to exclude the option of a code of conduct as an additional instrument for creating greater transparency."
"The advantages of a unified system of awarding contracts under the common European defence policy are obvious."
"Europe currently spends some EUR 160 billion on defence, and we must ensure greater efficiency in this; we owe it to the taxpayers to do so."
"Vendors can achieve economies of scale if the quantity demanded is large enough, and so a considerable amount of tax revenue can be saved."
"In cost-intensive research, too, a joint approach will become more and more important in the future."
"It is also of the utmost importance that we should strive for uniform technical standards, thereby enabling troops from different states to carry out operations together, and far from the least important consideration is that shared defence structures help intensify political integration and make for greater solidarity in the European Union."
"I therefore recommend that the House endorse the Green Paper, and also that all three proposed instruments for improving transparency be employed."
"The Commission proposal goes in the right direction for achieving Europe’s strategic repositioning in security and defence policy, which is made necessary by the prospect of our external policy tasks being added to rather than being reduced in number."
"We live in a new security environment, with new threats, terrorism, unstable states, conflicts over the sharing out of natural resources, religious and political fanaticism."
"No EU Member State can face these challenges alone; ‘Europeanisation’ must be the watchword."
"Only a European Union with a single foreign policy, one that makes full use of its own capacities, sings from a single hymn sheet and has made structural fragmentation a thing of the past, will succeed in doing that."
"The fact is that the cost of operations will rise, especially if the armaments market in the EU of 25 Member States continues to be fragmented."
"What is needed to counteract that is better, more standardised policies, and they will also improve the interoperability of European troops, for that is an area in which there are still glaring differences."
"We must aim to enable our troops to operate together."
"According to Eurobarometer, two thirds of the European public are in favour of closer cooperation within the EU in security matters."
"Our security depends on there being a functioning armaments market, and it is for that reason that we welcome the Commission’s initiative and the rapporteur’s report."
"I might also add that I believe that we should be having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
". Mr President, I would like to take this further opportunity to refer specifically to the report by Mr Kristovskis."
"I believe that the issue of weapons of mass destruction genuinely deserves special attention, particularly in view of something that has already been said: if we want to have credibility on the international stage, particularly in this field, the European Union must begin to offer an example."
"The report points clearly to the need to highlight the role of nuclear disarmament and to make a success of the demands of the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"I believe that this is an issue on which we must increasingly insist."
"Secondly, however, we must also remember another point: there are certain NATO countries, including the United Kingdom and France, which, ignoring the situation, are initiating what could be a new nuclear arms race."
"We must warn that this constitutes a risk that must be reduced, and we must be consistent, from this point of view at least."
"I would finally like to draw the attention of this House to one issue: the recent news that United States troops have used white phosphorous in the streets of Fallujah."
"If this is the case, I believe that it is a clear violation of certain key principles that must be respected and which this report demands to be taken into account."
". Mr President, you could say that, here in this House, the weapons come out at night."
"On our order of business we find three reports: Mr Romeva í Rueda’s on arms exports, Mr Kristovskis’ on weapons of mass destruction, and Mr Wuermeling’s on the European military equipment market."
"There is plenty of explosive material in all three of them and they are interconnected."
"My group takes a generally positive view of the report on arms exports, even though there is still room in it for improvements, such as more precise criteria, and even though considerations of peace policy of course make an outright ban on arms exports preferable from my point of view."
"Let us not forget that the production, export and deployment of weapons go together and that there is no war without them."
"Arms exports put peace at risk, and so it is all the more important that the code of conduct be at last made legally binding, which is what the report calls for, and which everyone here in this House would evidently welcome."
"Mr Romeva has earned our gratitude by accepting an amendment from my group, which makes it possible for the code to be made legally binding also with regard to goods for dual use."
"The European Armaments Agency, which has been in existence for a year now, is seen by armaments experts as not only promoting the export of weapons, but also as making monitoring and control that much more difficult, and that is why our amendment moves that this agency, which is claimed to be to do with defence, be abolished."
"I would like to appeal in particular to my fellow Members from the Socialist and Green Groups in this House to join with the Left in bringing about the replacement of the Armaments Agency by an agency for the control of arms exports."
"The Kristovskis report presents us with quite different issues."
"It was actually meant to discuss the means whereby the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction might be combated, but what we have before us is a fire report, which views the Iraq war – a crime in international law – in a positive light."
"I appeal to the House not to support this report – and not merely to abstain from voting, which is what we have just heard the Social Democrats recommending and not to endorse the amendments calling for a tougher line on Iran from the Europe of the Nations Group, to which Mr Kristovskis belongs."
"I appeal to the conservatives in this House not to endorse an interpretation according to which Iran, where weapons of mass destruction are concerned has, for the past 17 years, done nothing but sown and reaped mistrust; that is just so not true."
"The report appears to regard the war on Iraq as a blueprint for an attack on Iran, even though now not even the former Secretary of State Colin Powell asserts that Iraq actually possessed weapons of mass destruction at the time and is now ashamed of his performance before the UN Security Council."
"When it comes to the West’s weapons of mass destruction, the report is hypocritical in the manner customary in this House."
"We therefore propose that the US nuclear weapons be required to be removed from European soil, that the French and British nuclear weapons be mothballed, and that Germany should once and for all renounce its potential for enriching uranium in its research reactor at Garching."
"Turning to the last of the reports, I have to say to Mr Wuermeling that he asserts not only that our industry is not competitive on the international stage, but also, and at the same time, that there was no connection between the reports."
"If competition is what it is all about, then that applies also to competition in export markets and that is why this Article 296 must go."
"I regard this report on the military equipment industry as very frank and honest."
"It is about close cooperation with NATO and the USA, and our group will be voting ‘no’ to this report too."
". Mr President, in these three reports we have another proliferation of crackpot ideas from the European Parliament, but they do show where this place and the European Union intend to head."
"They call for the rejection of a new generation of nuclear weapons, for progressive and significant steps towards nuclear disarmament by Britain and France and for the harmonisation of arms exports – all this when the world is growing more dangerous and not less so."
"The incompetent left-wing utopian dreamers who predominantly make up this deeply stupid and corrupt place do enough damage with their legislative efforts without meddling in defence issues."
"National governments might one day, eventually, be able to undo the EU’s idiotic policies on agriculture, fishing, commerce and finance, but if the EU manages to take control of defence there may be consequences that cannot be undone."
"All these reports are building blocks for a common European security and defence policy."
"This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that a harmonised defence procurement policy appears in one of these reports, despite being an element of the failed European Constitution."
"Britain’s armed forces are being merged into a European army."
"Britain is sleep-walking towards the day when we will wake up and find that we have no independent military and defence capabilities."
"If the day ever dawns when Britain’s national defences are controlled by the European Union, then God help us."
"Yes, may He help us, you bunch of buffoons."
"Mr President, I feel deeply offended by the previous speaker."
"I do not know why he was allowed to continue to say those absurdities to this House and to us."
"I feel personally offended and I ask you to take action."
"It was my personal problem if I thanked the previous speaker."
"I promise to refer the matter to the Bureau for a decision."
"Mr President, wars are often waged under the cover of darkness."
"It is a sign of the times that the fight for peace is also being waged by the Members of this Parliament at night."
"Military spending reached USD 956 billion two years ago, and last year the figure topped USD 1 trillion."
"We are witnessing the return of record levels of spending last seen during the Cold War."
"Military expenditure is increasing by around 10-11% per year, which equates to a fully-fledged arms race."
"The proverb has it that, ‘if you want peace, prepare for war’, but we must ask ourselves whether this is the right response to the problems of the 21st century."
"Is it not the case, as the Vatican representative said at the 59th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, that ‘increased reliance on guns – large and small – is leading the world away from, not towards, security’?"
"We should support the UN initiative to build a culture of peace, and promote the civilisation of love advocated by Pope John Paul II."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Minister Kristovskis, for having drafted a sensible report that is based on a compromise."
"The paragraph concerning the risk of proliferation of Cold War stockpiles of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons is of particular significance, as is the reference to the ban on nuclear weapons tests in space, which was adopted 38 years ago."
"I should like to conclude by saying that our emphasis on the fact that even a justified use of military force must comply with the UN Charter, and be preceded by the use of all possible political and diplomatic means, is to be welcomed."
"The European Parliament cannot work wonders, but it may well be in a position today to give peace a somewhat better chance."
"Mr President, there are three important reports we are debating in this Chamber this evening."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in connection with the report on weapons of mass destruction, I think that the report is sound, robust and well-balanced."
"It is a very comprehensive report, but the subject too is, of course, very important."
"The rapporteur has done a sterling job."
"In the period in which we live, in which the threat comes not from the Cold War but from rogue states and terrorist organisations, it is crucial that monitoring should take place of who possesses these weapons and crucial that the latter should not fall into the wrong hands."
"We neither can nor should get rid of our nuclear weapons, which form a part of NATO’s defence strategy and which are one of the reasons why the Cold War remained cold."
"We must, however, constantly work to ensure that countries that must not have nuclear weapons give up developing them."
"Obviously, I am thinking particularly, in this case, of Iran and of the problems in relation to North Korea."
"We must also work to ensure that countries that possess nuclear weapons illegally, that is to say Pakistan, India and Israel, sign up to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)."
"Means must be linked to ends."
"If the EU’s strategy for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is to continue to have some clout, it will be necessary to give priority to the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and, especially, to give high priority to this particular area in the future too."
"I should like, finally, to say how very pleased I was with Mr Romeva’s report."
"Specifically, I am delighted that Parliament is united in recommending that the arms embargo against China not be lifted."
"Let us each individually work to ensure that this also remains the attitude of our respective countries’ governments."
"– According to a recent US Congress report, arms contracts to developing countries signed by the four main European exporters in 2004 totalled just under USD 5 billion. This is a fivefold increase on the 2003 figure."
"This will serve to hinder development by fostering the proliferation of conflicts in Africa and possibly in other continents, too."
"Against this backdrop, strict and effective rules on arms exports are required, now more than ever."
"Europe cannot promote construction with development aid with one hand, whilst causing destruction, via the unregulated export of conventional arms, with the other."
"It is for this reason that we believe, in common with the excellent Romeva report, that the code of conduct must be made legally binding as a matter of urgency."
"Along with the Commissioner, we welcome the Council’s decision to fight for a proper universal Treaty at the UN containing common rules on the global armaments trade."
"The arms embargo on China, a country that has repeatedly threatened Taiwan, must not be lifted until China has been held to account for the detention and disappearance of those involved in Tiananmen, and has improved its human rights record as a whole."
"The Wuermeling report contains an aspect that is key to the future of the common European defence and external policy project, and this is reflected in Amendment 6 tabled by my Group."
"No world power has completely open defence equipment markets; the United States protects its defence companies with a ‘Buy American Act’."
"We have a great deal to learn from our American friends."
"European preference must be introduced when it comes to the Member States’ defence procurement."
"This is essential if we are to ensure the survival of a sector that makes a significant contribution to the Lisbon Strategy, to technological innovation and to the Union’s strategic autonomy."
"Let us not be naïve and delude ourselves: aeroplanes are not bananas and tanks are not refrigerators."
"Let us not treat this subject as though it were a simple question of markets."
"Parliament must take the lead in what is, more than anything, a political and strategic debate, and what we are proposing is a first step in that direction."
"Lastly, I turn to the report by Mr Kristovskis, which I also welcome. I feel that it is not possible to have a coherent and effective non-proliferation strategy while the five authorised nuclear-weapon states, including two EU Member States, fail to honour their undertakings to disarm gradually, under Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and continue either to neglect, or take action against, nuclear powers such as Israel, India and Pakistan that are not signatories to the NPT."
"This is all the more serious when, in addition to other countries, non-state actors or terrorists seek to get their hands on illegal weaponry."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the most dangerous weapon of mass destruction is the nuclear bomb."
"This bomb, this weapon, has been used twice by the USA, killing hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in a split second."
"It has also been used by Britain, France, Russia and China in nuclear tests, causing immense environmental damage."
"These countries, along with Israel, India and Pakistan, belong to the fearful nuclear club of eight that holds the whole world to ransom."
"They terrorise the entire international community with their warmongering irresponsibility, threatening each other with deadly nuclear games of annihilation, and they violently insult our intelligence by trying to force upon us their view that nuclear suicide is a form of deterrence."
"The governments of these countries, using a logic intelligible only to single-minded warlords ready to sacrifice the whole of humanity in their quest for short-term economic profit, are spending astronomical amounts of money in building a nuclear arsenal capable of destroying the world many times over – and all that we can manage to do is to pass resolutions on ineffective strategies calling for non-proliferation."
"Why do not we call loudly and clearly on the nuclear bomb countries to get rid of their stockpiles of weapons now?"
"Why do we tolerate in our European Community nuclear-bomb disaster countries like Britain and France?"
"Why do we not pass resolutions or take measures against these two countries?"
"And why should a small country like mine, Cyprus, live with the threat of a nuclear disaster because Britain wants to store, against our wishes, nuclear bombs in its colonial British bases on the island?"
"The answer is, in my view, shamefully simple: we lack political courage."
"So, we choose to be hypocrites instead – and life goes on as usual."
"Mr President, in his report, Mr Wuermeling maintains that the discussion is not about foreign, security or defence policy in general, but only about the procurement of goods and services. However, there is of course a link between defence procurement and defence policy."
"Together with the setting up of the European Defence Agency, a common market for defence procurement is a further stage in the military rearmament eagerly welcomed by the European defence industry."
"On the pretext of increased economic efficiency and a reduced burden for European taxpayers, the rapporteur argues in favour of harmonisation and standardisation in accordance with accepted NATO standards."
"If that is not a contribution to the debate on defence policy, I do not know what, in fact, it is."
"For me, it is clearly about increased and intensified militarisation."
"Using George Orwell’s newspeak, I could say that war has become peace."
"Instead of all the talk about increased resources for research and development into new weapons, the EU and the Member States should invest their resources in research into peacemaking and conflict resolution. I believe that this is something that the EU really must do."
"It is through disarmament and demilitarisation that we build peace, not through further militarisation and the acquisition of more weapons."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on the one hand, the great powers, such as Russia, are downsizing their weapons arsenals, while, on the other, the number of states and, alas, criminal organisations who possess the know-how needed to manufacture weapons of mass destruction is on the increase."
"We know that, in 2004 alone, secret services across the globe recorded over 300 instances of illegal handling of nuclear material."
"The more widespread the necessary know-how, the more difficult it becomes to get at it by conventional methods."
"The war in Iraq and the silence in the face of North Korea have given not a few governments the impression that nuclear armament alone is sufficient to deter military interventions."
"It is the possession of nuclear weapons by countries such as Israel that leads others, such as Iran, to believe that they have to develop their own, thus heightening the risk of such weapons getting into the hands of terrorists, and what is called for is rigorous action to counteract this development."
"It will certainly send out a powerful message if we can tighten up the code of conduct for arms sales and thereby prevent EU Member States selling weapons to third states that then use them on their own peoples or for the purposes of aggression directed at other states."
"This code of conduct must not, however, be some kind of toothless tiger, or else we will not only be putting at risk the security of innumerable people but also exposing ourselves to ridicule."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if you ask me, today’s debate is a missed opportunity."
"Firstly, regarding the time of day, this debate was actually scheduled to take place at 11 a.m. today in the presence of the Council."
"It is now taking place at nearly midnight, after an undoubtedly fascinating debate on trapping standards for certain animal species."
"Secondly, the heading is incorrect."
"It is not arms that are at issue here, but the European Security and Defence Policy."
"If, for example, we were to discuss our course of action regarding Iran, this would not be a matter of arms, but of politics."
"Thirdly, I very much regret the absence of the Council, as the defining element of the European Security and Defence Policy is the close dovetailing of civilian and military crisis management."
"This can only be achieved through joint action between the Commission and the Council, and I know how difficult that is."
"How are we to discuss these issues if the Council is not even present?"
"Another reason why this is a missed opportunity is that the field of security and defence, in particular, presents great opportunities."
"Even in the presence of a founding father of the European Constitution such as Mr Brok, I would venture to say that the Constitution is currently at a standstill."
"We are currently at a standstill on the financial issues, too."
"What is not at a standstill, however, is the further development of the European Security and Defence Policy, as just recently the European Defence Agency was brought to fruition."
"This had only been envisaged in the draft Constitution, of course, and is already a reality."
"We have assumed responsibility for security in Bosnia–Herzegovina; there are troops there under European command."
"The mutual defence commitment, which had also first been envisaged in the draft Constitution, is now a reality."
"That means that we are making progress in this field, and I am convinced that we are on the path to a European Security and Defence Union, which is also our common objective."
"This is not a debate that should be conducted in camera, as we are doing this evening."
"I should also like to say a few words to my colleague Mr Lambsdorff."
"I think that Strasbourg is the right place for this debate, as it is the seat of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by adding my voice to Mr Matsakis’s protest."
"During my twenty years in this Parliament, I have never seen a Member behave with such disdain towards this institution and its Members."
"I would therefore ask that effective action be taken against that Member, so that there may be no further incidents such as that one."
"As Mr von Wogau has said, this is not a debate about arms; it is a broader debate, it is a debate on common foreign and security policy, although I will only be able to comment on the report by Mr Wuermeling, on defence procurement."
"I believe that the Commission is right to point out that Article 296 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which currently represents a constitutional obstacle to the development of what we may call a European defence market, may to a certain extent be overcome on the basis of the judgments of the Court of Justice in recent cases, such as the Johnston case, or the case of the Commission against Spain, of 1997."
"Constitutional restrictions remain however."
"That is to say, in the field of foreign and defence policy, there is still a high degree of state sovereignty."
"In this field, therefore, we must act very prudently, from legal and political points of view."
"Until the European Constitution is adopted, which I hope can be done soon, we will have to make do with the legal instruments we have, and there is little we can do with those instruments, but I am very pleased that the Commission is gearing its work, firstly towards a Communication and, possibly, towards a proposal for a Directive, as Mr Wuermeling suggests."
"We must, however, be prudent from a political point of view, because the objective of a common European defence market cannot be to transform the European Union into a military industrial complex, as in the case of certain foreign powers."
"Arms are dangerous."
"I have some military training; what surprised me was that, most of the time, I was not being taught to kill, but rather to protect myself against arms."
"Arms are not toys."
"We cannot use them, for example, for economic or industrial development."
"The purpose of arms must be to protect the European citizens and also to protect those friendly, peaceful and democratic nations that need them for their own defence, but not to do business with them or to turn Europe into a kind of enormous industrial market place which, at the end of the day, will come back to haunt us."
"I believe that the Commission’s proposals are positive, that these proposals will lead to the creation of that common defence market, but that the common defence market must be an instrument for achieving peace in Europe and also peace throughout the world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report shows the Union’s commitment to making the multilateral agreements on non-proliferation and against the development of new-generation weapons universally applicable."
"The report calls for sanctions to be applied to countries that do not comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540."
"Nonetheless, although it is a fact that the European Union Member States are signatories to the multilateral non-proliferation agreements, it is also a fact that two Member States are nuclear states, that Turkey, a candidate country for accession, is a nuclear state and that, even more seriously, US tactical weapons are deployed on the soil of many Member States, including Germany, Italy, Greece and the Netherlands."
"The hundred points of the resolution being examined say very little about Israel, India and Pakistan, which have not signed the non-proliferation treaty."
"With regard to the civilian nuclear programme in Iran, however, the legitimate economic and regional security interests of that great country are ignored and its government is called upon to supply verifiable guarantees as to the peaceful nature of every one of its nuclear programmes."
"This is a ridiculous resolution, which would even have the European Union and NATO persuade the United States administration to give up its programmes. It also welcomes the huge sums of European taxpayers’ money – hundreds of millions of euro – that are to be spent on the strategy to reduce weapons of mass destruction."
"The proposed report is an utter travesty of good sense and is therefore totally unacceptable."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the three rapporteurs, Mr Wuermeling, Mr Romeva i Rueda and Mr Kristovskis, have addressed important fields that need to be considered together to a much greater extent, rather than in three separate reports like this, as they are only outwardly contradictory, and are in actual fact connected."
"We live in a world in which the threat posed by terrorists, who could also potentially come by dirty weapons, is more dangerous now than ever before."
"Assuming that Iran cannot be prevented from producing nuclear weapons – it is already producing rockets with a range of 3 000 km – we shall have a region that extends over Iran, Pakistan, India, China and Russia: one large region – the largest in the world – that is in possession of nuclear weapons."
"We have to consider how to guarantee our security as a small corner of the world."
"This can only be done via collective security within the transatlantic alliance, which also means that Europe cannot leave this alliance, as that would mean we were susceptible to blackmail: on various grounds and by various regions of the world."
"Secondly, we have to make clear that only by producing our own arms will we, too, be in a position to set a course in industrial policy, that this will create jobs, and also that it will give us independence because, if this industrial-policy approach is not open to us and we do not have our own arms industry, we shall be reliant on purchases of additional arms from other regions of the world. This will make us constantly susceptible to blackmail, since we cannot do what we want or, consequently, make a contribution to our own security."
"At the least, it will be very much more expensive, because we shall not be making use of the synergies that this European approach provides."
"The European Union and the Commission need to be given more money for research and other fields, therefore, to ensure that we are in a position to guarantee our own security and to form alliances whilst having independence and immunity to blackmail."
"All of this must be integrated into a code of conduct, which would lend credibility to our fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"In my view, this code of conduct should be legally binding."
"Yet more desirable in my opinion would be the deletion of the Treaty derogation exempting arms exports, unlike all other trade, from the competence of the Commission – which is one of the weak points both with regard to control and with regard to the capacity for action of the European Union as a whole."
"The relevant approaches to this should be sought."
"Therefore – in order to save money, guarantee the security of our citizens and at the same time ensure a more peaceful world – I would invite us to increase the focus on this."
"Mr President, firstly I welcome the report on the code of conduct and arms sales and draw to the House’s attention the fact that many of the demands we made in our previous annual debates on this subject have been realised: in particular the new trade regulation on torture equipment, the common position on brokering, and the new obligation to stop exports if there is a risk to international humanitarian law."
"Most of all I welcome this year’s commitment to make the code legally binding."
"Could the Commissioner comment tonight on the fact that practice sometimes falls short?"
"Why is it that Austria, Luxembourg and Greece, for example, do not produce their annual reports?"
"This year information has been published that shows that France has exported bombs and grenades to Burma and Sudan, and Italy has exported firearms to China and to Colombia?"
"Will she comment on the position of our arms exports to Colombia, a country where there is now ample evidence of human rights abuse by the Colombian military?"
"Many speakers tonight and some of the amendments have referred to the UK position."
"I am proud that my own country, in its previous Presidency, oversaw the agreement of the EU code of conduct on arms sales and in this Presidency has overseen agreement by the European Union, for the first time, to support an international arms trade treaty."
"We take seriously our obligations as a nuclear weapons power."
"The UK Government has reduced the stockpile of nuclear warheads by more than 70%, has reduced the number of warheads on each Trident submarine, from 94 to 48, and has dismantled all of the WE-177 nuclear bombs."
"At the Non-Proliferation Treaty conference on 5 May the British Government spokesman said: ‘we recognise that we have particular obligations as a nuclear weapons state under Article 6 of the Treaty."
"We reaffirm our unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear disarmament’."
"Like everyone else here tonight, I share the concerns about the failure to come to a strong consensus as an outcome of the NPT conference earlier this year."
"But I believe it is wrong to for us to focus on individual countries, whether it be the UK or France."
"We should ensure that all nations undertake their obligations under that Treaty."
"We should welcome the fact that there was an EU-agreed common position in advance of the NPT review conference and take up the mantle of issues, where we, as the EU, should take a lead, such as withdrawal from the Treaty, the universalisation of rigorous safeguard standards through the IAEA additional protocol, and also the question of the transfer of enrichment and reprocessing technologies."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, in discussing defence matters we are entering into important and sensitive areas of national sovereignty."
"Many of us feel that the EU’s defence ambitions are wholly misplaced."
"If you want to empower the European Union as a global actor or if you believe in an integrated European State or, indeed, a European Defence Union, as we heard earlier, then you will have a different view."
"We are opposed to EU meddling in defence, both in principle and in terms of its practical consequences."
"However, we recognise that there are areas in which a multilateral approach can be beneficial, and this is particularly true in relation to non-proliferation and arms export controls."
"Turning firstly to defence procurement, the Wuermeling report is driven by a very strong integrationist impulse."
"It even poses the question, in paragraph 12, as to ‘what extent any meaningful distinction at all can still be drawn between national and common European security interests’."
"Certainly the report seeks to entrench the European Commission’s role in defence procurement and wants such matters dealt with under EU rather than national legislation."
"We already have a situation where the British defence procurement market is open to foreign competition in a way in which the market in France, for example, is not."
"We see British defence companies – important national strategic assets – being taken over by foreign firms."
"While British Conservatives are most supportive of measures to strengthen a genuine single market in most sectors, defence should continue to be the exception and should be safeguarded."
"On the subject of WMD, we attach enormous importance to combating proliferation and to strengthening the security of component materials."
"At the same time, the UK’s independent nuclear deterrent force continues to be a vital element of our defence strategy and one which has not lost relevance in spite of the changed security environment in which we live."
"The British Government must not only take the necessary decisions to maintain our nuclear capability; it must also be prepared to adapt our weapons and the doctrine for their use."
"On the subject of arms exports, while we welcome calls for better verification of the end-use of exported goods and the maintenance of the arms embargo on China, we continue, however, to have difficulty with the idea of a legally binding code of conduct."
"This would extend judicial authority into areas that are more properly the preserve of government and would further extend the reach of EU institutions, including the European Court of Justice."
"Tonight we have a dangerous mixture under discussion."
"– Mr President, let me start by saying a few words to Mr Batten."
"It was interesting listening to this speech by a representative of a list of candidates that also includes two people who, in very quick succession, have been publicly found guilty of abusing the secretarial assistance allowance in recent weeks."
"We should intensify our offensive against this band of hypocrites in this House and in our public-relations activities."
"Now to come to the point."
"It does not make sense for various companies in three major EU Member States to work on the Unmanned Air Vehicle project, for example, in separate projects that have nothing to do with one another, and to duplicate earnings, as it were."
"The European taxpayer does not deserve this."
"Nor does it make sense for three major EU Member States to develop, separately from one other, electronic identification systems for infantrymen, and for there to be insufficient clarity as to whether troops from one and the same European battle group, for example, could identify each other in action if they came from different countries."
"We should also bear in mind that even in 10 years’ time the armies in the EU will still have to use 23 different types of armoured vehicle."
"We can all imagine the kind of compatibility and supply problems that would entail in operational conditions."
"I should also like to warn against one illusion, however: a single European Defence Equipment Market cannot be achieved if enterprises operating under market conditions have to compete with those that are government-backed."
"This is an aspect that has not yet been raised in today’s debate, and I should also like to suggest that it might make sense for Mr Wuermeling to take a closer look at this implication of the debate on Article 296 and draw conclusions from it for the future."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission Green Paper and the Wuermeling report, in particular, respond to the wishes of the population: the European public."
"The public’s answer to the question as to what objectives the EU should set itself is that it should become a Security and Defence Union."
"When the public is asked what it wants, its reply is: a common foreign policy represented by one face and one person, not 25 vested national interests."
"When we look at how the security environment has changed, we do have to ask ourselves the question whether each Member State alone is capable of ensuring sufficient security given the general atmosphere prevailing and the present financial situation of the Member States."
"The answer is ‘no’. That is why we need more Europe in this field, not necessarily more money."
"If, however, we need more Europe but do not have any additional money, we must change our behaviour somewhat."
"We want a common foreign and security policy, we want the evolution of the EU into a political union, we want a strong internal market and we want to reduce our dependence on the United States."
"What needs to be done, therefore?"
"We need common European technological standards in this field, to enable and strengthen cooperation."
"We need to create common defence structures, which are important as regards enhanced political cooperation, integration and solidarity."
"Of course, in view of the maxim ‘more Europe, but not more money’, we need to make more efficient use of defence resources, increase the competitiveness of the European Union, improve military equipment and reduce costs, increase the European dimension in the field of equipment and training, improve cooperation and thus help increase efficiency."
"This debate has shown that we need to increase the European dimension; which may also explain the absence of the Council, because although the large Member States, in particular – I am thinking here of the United Kingdom and France – talk a great deal about common ground, they rank among the stumbling blocks on the path to a stronger Commission in this field."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the safety of workers and citizens must be guaranteed in defence manufacturing processes, and the companies themselves must operate as efficiently as possible."
"Clear rules on defence procurement are therefore required."
"European citizens must be made aware of the importance of having modern and efficient defence firms, within the innovative SME structure, working with technology for civil or military use."
"Moreover, there must be strategic coordination of existing defence companies in various Member States, with the European Agency acting as one of the focal points for technological innovation and for perfecting the products and processes of European firms working in defence-related sectors."
"In any event, we must never allow a military-industrial complex to be set up in the Union’s Europe which would restrict political powers, the kind of complex whose powerful influence General Eisenhower bemoaned when he left the US Presidency."
"Contracts must be transparent."
"Clear and transparent rules on defence procurement can help a great deal in this regard."
"Otherwise, the market will become concentrated on these companies, thereby, in practice, blocking free competition in the European internal market."
"There is similarly an urgent need to encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to take part, as far as possible, in the defence industry’s global manufacturing process."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should like to conclude by saying that the EU needs to maintain constant links between its external policy and the rules on international trade, with particular regard to embargoes."
"In the future, nobody will understand why defence companies in the EU would support the outbreak of unjust wars or prop up dictatorial regimes."
"This is not what Europe was originally set up to do and nor is it what the EU should be doing."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeking to make history by dismantling the established practices of Member States as regards the armaments trade."
"The Green Paper on defence procurement and any future directive therefore require strong political backing, as they will need to penetrate the hermetically sealed environment of the European defence market."
"The aim is no less than to impose far-reaching restrictions on derogations from the general rules of economic competition – Article 296 of the Treaty enables Member States to use and abuse the derogation system – and a number of national monopolies have been profiting from this at the citizens’ expense."
"The defence market is practically sealed off behind purpose-built barriers and dominated by monopolies, and it is difficult to monitor it, since secrecy is maintained even where there is no security reason for doing so."
"The lack of transparency when it comes to public procurement, fragmented research programmes and inadequate standardisation lead to low quality and poor interoperability, and in turn to ineffective national defence systems."
"There is, therefore, ample justification for opening up the EUR 160 billion defence market, not least because most Member States are finding it hard to honour their obligations as regards NATO defence policy."
"If the Commission’s proposal obtains the support of all 25 Member States, they should be expected to work together on innovative strategies, to cut costs and to create fresh opportunities for businesses, not only large corporations, but also small and medium-sized manufacturers and suppliers of logistics equipment."
"The fundamental condition for the opening up of the defence market, however, both for myself and for a number of Members of this House, is to ensure that the EU Code of Conduct on Exports of Military Equipment is rigorously complied with."
"My call for compliance with this Code was incorporated into the text of the report, with the aim of cracking down on the illicit export of arms from advanced democracies to developing countries."
"This is an essential prerequisite and I call on the Commission to ensure that monitoring is made as easy as possible."
"My view is based on the salutary experience of an armaments deal that took place in the Czech Republic 10 years ago."
"I am deeply dismayed that the Council has failed to be present today."
"Mr President, I too wish to express my concern at what Mr Batten said, and urge that action be taken to have him withdraw those insulting remarks relating to Members of this House."
"Commissioner, the European Code on Arms Exports has a number of shortcomings, the most glaring of which is the fact that it is not legally binding."
"There is also, however, a need for clarification of the language and the application of the code."
"There is a need for its scope to be broadened, and indeed there is a need for greater transparency and accessibility of information in relation to, in particular, the annual reports and the denial notifications."
"A number of Members have mentioned that some EU Member States are actually in breach of the code, while declaring themselves determined to prevent the export of equipment which might be used for internal repression or international aggression, or indeed contribute to regional instability."
"They have allowed arms and security equipment to be transferred for illicit end use."
"Finally, on 20 September, in reply to a question I put to you, you indicated that you intend to draft a communication on small arms and light weapons before the end of 2006."
"Might I suggest that it would be more appropriate to have that communication published and debated in this House before the middle of next year, which is in fact when the United Nations are holding a conference on small arms and light weapons."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this late hour, we are debating whether we need military technology in Europe, and what we can do to bring about a European common foreign and security policy."
"First of all, on the subject of something my fellow Members on the other side of the House have called into question, I should like to say – and in so doing explicitly agree with my colleague Mr Brok – that the reason that the European Union needs military technology is that we Europeans cannot be dependent on third parties or leave ourselves open to blackmail when it comes to our security."
"Some fellow Members have also mentioned that the European public expects increased common action among the Member States in the field of foreign and security policy."
"There have already been a few successes in this regard: the mission in Bosnia mentioned earlier is only one of many accomplishments."
"However, if we are quite honest, we have to say that there is still a long way to go before we have a genuinely common foreign and security policy such as that envisaged by the public."
"That is why I expressly welcome the fact that the Commission’s proposal in the form of its Green Paper on the Defence Equipment Market, and the report by my colleague Mr Wuermeling, point in the right direction."
"Through the common rules for procuring military defence equipment, they oblige the Member States to take an important step towards the development of common defence structures and towards stronger political integration."
"The increased efficiency that will result with regard to the considerable expenditure on defence will automatically produce further unification of the European market and thus explicitly benefit the taxpayer."
"I should like to express some views on the form this common code of conduct could take."
"Back in 1958, the Commission developed materials and regulations that could be used as a basis for shaping Article 296."
"Unfortunately, to date these have never been published or used, but it would certainly be worth having a look at what was considered important at that time."
"The creation of a code of conduct must ensure that decisions by the European Armaments Agency on the one hand and the Commission on the other do not contradict each other."
"In this regard, the achievement of optimum coordination between the Commission and the European Defence Agency should be ensured."
"Mr President, I want to use this debate as an opportunity to highlight the impact that small arms and light weapons are having on the human rights of so many people."
"It is not the so-called weapons of mass destruction that are currently causing the vast majority of tragedies and conflicts across the globe."
"It should perhaps be small arms and light weapons that are considered to be the weapons causing the most mass destruction."
"I am impressed with and support the report before us on EU arms exports and I want to congratulate the rapporteur for the job that he has done."
"The EU voluntary code of conduct has had some success in ensuring standards."
"However, the end goal must be to bring about an acceptance for a legally binding code and this Parliament should be consistent in calling for that."
"Time and time again, the EU is happy to take the high moral ground on human rights issues and on calling for adherence to international standards and law."
"We must show leadership and lead by example on the trade in arms to have credibility to bring about change outside the Union in arms trade standards."
"We should not fear a legally binding code but see it as an opportunity for the EU as regards raising standards in arms export policy."
"The four major EU arms suppliers have dramatically increased their share of arms sales to the developing world in the last year."
"In 2004, USD 4.8 billion of business was done, which is more than 22% of total arms sales."
"When one considers that almost half a million people are killed every year by small arms, then the significance of the small arms trade becomes clear."
"I support the concept of the creation of a so-called blacklist of countries that should not have arms sold to them from the EU."
"The criteria for such a list should be applied equally, however, on a set of standards based on human rights violations and instability."
"Finally, I want to urge the Commission to use all opportunities available to it to promote an acceptance for an international small arms treaty in order to move forward a common standard approach for arms sales internationally."
"Too many rogue states, irresponsible governments, military dictators and gangland-style leaders have easy access to weapons that are used to brutal and corrupt effect, resulting in a spiral of demand for small arms and light weapons in the many small-scale conflicts that persist."
"The fact that the developed world continues to tolerate the sale of weapons to such people should be a cause for serious and continuing concern in this House."
". Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the fact that here in Parliament, during the course of debates on my report, certain differences of opinion have arisen, and in order to find a compromise, I propose certain changes to paragraph 34. Thus, after the words ‘takes note’ the following would be inserted:"
"‘... as stated by Hans Blix, that the credible threat of the use of force has played an important role in facilitating the disarmament work of UNSCOM and UNMOVIC.’"
"After that I would like to delete the rest of the paragraph."
"I believe that this proposal will enable also the socialists, who said that they would abstain, to vote for this paragraph."
"Thank you, but you will have to bring that up as an oral amendment during the vote tomorrow."
". Mr President, even though it is late I think it was a very interesting discussion."
"I agree that this discussion could have been much broader."
"We have spoken on rather specific topics, but some of you have said very clearly that there are many more dimensions, taking in a common foreign and security policy and a common security and defence policy."
"I shall now make a few specific remarks."
"Firstly, on arms exports, the Commission can only agree with the substance of the discussion today."
"We are probably already one of the regional actors with the strictest arms controls in the world, but progress has to continue, to strengthen the rules and their implementation."
"Making the code of conduct a common position will be a major step at European Union level."
"In fact the code of conduct on exports of military equipment that was adopted in 1998 contains many common criteria against which applications for export licences are assessed."
"As is stated in the code of conduct, the decision to transfer or deny a transfer is at the discretion of individual Member States and the Commission is therefore not in a position to comment on alleged circumventions of the code of conduct with regard to any country."
"I say that specifically regarding the question on Colombia."
"One of the most important criteria is always the human rights question."
"It is one criterion among others, such as regional peace, security and stability, but it is for the Member States to comment on that issue."
"A reinforced code of conduct which has already been finalised at technical level and which will be introduced at an appropriate moment will increase the scope of controls."
"The reinforced code of conduct will go beyond physical exports of goods and technology."
"It will include brokering and transfer of intangible technology, and it will also contain more explicit language on reverse engineering and on unintended technology transfer."
"Moreover, the criterion on human rights will be further strengthened."
"The European Union is now trying to come up with an arms trade treaty."
"This is at the instigation of the British Presidency."
"Such a treaty on conventional weapons would be based on states’ existing responsibilities under international law and would establish transfer criteria that are consistent with internationally accepted standards of human rights and humanitarian law."
"It should be legally binding, be a separate and self-standing initiative, cover all conventional arms transfers, set out the principles defining illegal transfers, include monitoring, and be broadly based."
"On weapons of mass proliferation, it is now two years since we developed a fully fledged strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"Commitments have been made both by the European Union and the G8 global partnership."
"In this context, it is critical to ensure that financial means will be available for the future."
"The combination of the CFSP and Community tools would allow the European Union to maintain better visibility and also more credibility."
"However, a lot has to be done, as I said earlier, for instance, within the framework of the United Nations, where we were very disappointed at the last negotiations on weapons of mass destruction."
"On the third issue – defence procurement – let me again thank all of you, and the rapporteur in particular, who supported this report and therefore the proposals put forward by the Commission."
"The political sensitivity of this file cannot, and should not, be underestimated."
"However, I agree with Mr Wuermeling when he points out that it mainly concerns the internal market."
"The report correctly focuses on this issue and on the objectives that are pursued by the Commission with its initiatives."
"As I have said, more efficient public spending on defence will contribute to the prosperity of the Union, because it means that taxpayers’ money could be reduced."
"This will be done within the limits of our Community competence and also in full respect for the prerogatives and the sovereignty of our Member States."
"As usual, we will continue to work very closely with the European Defence Agency, as suggested in the Wuermeling report."
"I am glad that the Commission and Parliament share the same views, not only on the objectives to be pursued but also on the measures to achieve them."
"In conclusion, let me say that I am looking forward to discussing these and other questions again, in the high-level interparliamentary conference in early December in Brussels."
"I also thank Mr Brok and Mr von Wogau for this initiative."
"It is highly welcome."
"Perhaps we could also pursue a more security-oriented policy, which has been lacking so far."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
", The European Union’s approach to weapons of mass destruction has been defined, and now we also have to convince other peoples of its validity."
"The EU must prevent the failure of future conferences on the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and it must necessarily strive for all countries to sign the treaty, for the treaty to be obeyed, and for the inspection mechanisms to be reinstated, with the full support of the UN authorities and with the aid of sanctions where necessary."
"We call for a more forceful strategy, involving all EU Member States, that severely sanctions activities that contribute to proliferation and reinforces the ban on chemical and biological weapons."
"The strategy must involve the European Parliament more closely, so as to impose a code to regulate arms exports as well as clearer rules on defence procurement."
"We also stress the need for a moratorium on impoverished uranium munitions."
"The European Parliament’s determined stand against the use of weapons of mass destruction is due to the awareness that such use causes not only the loss of human lives, but above all the erosion of those ethical values – the common heritage of the peoples of the European Union – that underlie our history and inspire the present and future existence of our Community."
"We are going to have a very long and complex vote on REACH."
"In fact, I have been told that this is one of the longest and most complex votes in the history of this House."
"The services that have prepared the vote, as well as the technical staff of the political groups, have done outstanding work in preparing the vote."
"I should like to congratulate them."
"In principle I believe we can get through this vote in not more than three hours, but in order to do that I must ask two things of you: first, please remain silent and concentrate throughout the vote …"
"and second, please raise your hands."
"Please."
"The vote will be long and I understand that you will get tired, but please raise your hands when we vote."
"Here we go."
"Good luck."
"Mr President, I think that a large number of people are still signing, so I think it probably be best if we waited for another couple of minutes, and in that time, I would like to say that the main entrance to the Parliament building has been closed for two months now."
"As a result, I, for one, have suffered a bad fall and have sustained a fracture."
"I would like to ask you to instruct the relevant department to ensure that the entrance area is made safe again."
"We want chemicals to be handled with care, but the same care should apply where the safety of the people here is concerned."
"We have noted your request."
"Mr President, I should just like to call the Bureau’s attention to one matter."
"At the beginning of this week, I discovered my name on 18 amendments that I had not seen and that I had definitely not signed."
"What is more, I did not share the views expressed in these amendments."
"I hope that nothing similar will happen again because it caused a host of problems when I needed to explain that I did not support these amendments at all."
"Mr Andersson, your comment shall now appear in the Minutes and in the voting list, and you may therefore rest assured that the matter is clear."
"Mr President, I would just ask that, following the vote on all the amendments, we have a five-minute break in which to find out what has been adopted and to decide whether to vote in favour of the proposal or against it, or else abstain from voting in the end."
"Granted, Mr Bonde."
"Mr President, the proposal is that the following be added at the end of Amendment 356: ‘highly-diffused inorganic substances or substances on which there is sufficient risk information, such as sodium chloride, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium oxide, gold, silver, aluminium, magnesium, silicates, glasses and ceramic frits’."
"In other words, it concerns substances on which information is already available."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in actual fact, I had requested to speak fearing that the vote on the amendments would have had a different outcome."
"Instead, it seems to me that the vote has been very positive and has made the regulation more balanced."
"Furthermore, I believe that, also as regards the parts on which we voted in favour of a decidedly very strong position, such as the part relating to authorisation, the conditions have been created to achieve convergence with the Council as soon as possible."
"In the debate the day before yesterday on all of the key chapters, the Council demonstrated that there is a strong possibility of convergence between what we are preparing to vote on – and I am hoping for a positive final outcome – and what has taken shape in the Council’s work."
"Mr President, it appears to me that we have secured a victory in respect of registration, which accounts for the lion’s share of red tape, but we have suffered a defeat with regard to the granting of licences, or authorisation, which was not helped by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe not lending a hand."
"Unfortunate though that is, I know that the British Presidency will be very cooperative on that score."
"I also know that on account of the narrow majorities, we have lost at least the key topics by ten or so votes only."
"I also know that at second reading, this House will see to all omissions that have now been adopted."
"I would therefore advise our group to cast a resounding vote in favour."
"I note that the approach followed by ourselves in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe with regard to enhancing the environmental aspect, clarifying the existing ambiguities and simplifying procedures for small undertakings has overwhelmingly carried the day."
"We shall therefore be voting in favour of the proposal."
"I should first and foremost like to thank Mr Sacconi for his extremely patient work, but also the Commission and the Presidency, which are unfortunately not represented in the Chamber."
"We now have the opportunity to devise a very strong piece of legislation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot join with the majority that has endorsed the system of approval, and it is for this reason that we have voted against it."
"What can be adduced in the report’s defence is what it has to say about registration, which was accepted by a broad qualified majority – the only important block and the most important issue to be adopted by qualified majority here in this House."
"This is a decision that will carry weight both in the Council and in the Commission."
"It is only with that in mind, and explicitly rejecting the approval, which we know will be corrected by the Council, that I vote in favour of the report."
"With this vote and the compromise on registration, we are going to get a REACH couched in weak, indeed unduly weak, terms."
"We have, however, obtained a good decision with regard to the granting of authorisations."
"We would rather have a weak version of REACH than no REACH at all."
"We shall therefore vote in favour of the proposal, but do so without enthusiasm."
"Since all the other groups are stating their views, we understand that this has been a complicated vote."
"It has now, however, been stated that the only positive aspect of the proposal, that relating to the granting of authorisations, will be undermined in the Council."
"It has also been undermined through certain exemptions during the vote."
"As a result, a large majority of my group cannot accept REACH in its present form."
", . Mr President, the majority of my group will not be supporting this compromise either."
"In our view, registration in the environmental area has not been thrashed out very well."
"A compromise has been reached in a few other areas, but only by a narrow majority."
"Our concern is, then, that this is not a sound proposal, and it is for that reason that we will be voting against it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for kindly allowing me to take the floor."
"It seemed almost impossible to speak in this fine Chamber during the debate on the highly important REACH provision."
"The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has decided to vote in favour, because we are satisfied as regards the registration procedure and we wholly agree with the content of the regulation in connection with the OSOR principle."
"We do, however, have some concerns with regard to the procedure for authorisation."
"Nevertheless, we are generally in agreement regarding this project, and I should to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, for his commitment and for the work he has done."
"Mr Clark has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, on a point of order, in view of the controversy on the massive number of amendments, I quote Rule 53(1), which reads: ‘Where the Commission proposal as a whole is approved, but on the basis of amendments which have also been adopted, the vote on the draft legislative resolution shall be postponed until the Commission has stated its position on each of Parliament’s amendments."
"‘If the Commission is not in a position to make such a statement at the end of Parliament’s vote on its proposal, it shall inform the President or the committee responsible as to when it will be in a position to do so; the proposal shall then be placed on the draft agenda of the first part-session thereafter.’"
"Commissioner, we in this House are as respectful of the Rules of Procedure as the Commission, at least, and you have therefore been invited to set out your position on each of the amendments."
"I believe that ‘each’ must be interpreted flexibly, and you may therefore speak as you see fit and then we shall vote."
". Mr President, for some of the amendments our position is positive and we agree in full; for some amendments, we agree in part ..."
"... for some we agree in principle; some we reject, and for some we reserve our position."
"Mr President, the Commission takes note of the position taken by Parliament and will not hesitate to draw all the necessary conclusions from a possible rejection by your Assembly, taking account of the Council’s position as well."
"The Commission will have to reflect on the best way to move forward in this area."
"Mr President, I would like to request a fresh vote, since most of those voting clearly supported the proposal."
"You, however, concluded that the report was rejected."
"I hereby request an individual vote."
"No, Mr Baco, there has been a very clear majority of votes against."
"We have therefore taken the correct decision."
"Mr President, I would like to express one regret: since we were dealing with a report assessing the actions of the Council, it would have been very worthwhile and important for the Council to have been present last night."
"It is true that it was an inconvenient time, but it could have attended the debate."
"I believe that this is something that should be provided for in the future, in order to ensure that the Council is here to listen to Parliament’s views in relation to this kind of report."
". – Ladies and gentlemen, late yesterday evening there were also wide-ranging debates on the issues of weapons and the arms problem and, in view of the fact that it was necessary to dispel a few concerns in connection with my report, I have carried on working at this time, with the result that two oral amendments are necessary."
"So, after paragraph 33 there is a new section and, in order to dispel concerns and to ensure the full support of the socialists, I fully confirm that the title of the section has been changed, and is [in English] ‘Strengthening effective multilateralism’."
"The second oral amendment relates to paragraph 34 and is as follows – the following words shall be included after:"
"‘... takes note, as stated by Dr Hans Blix, that the credible threat of the use of force has played an important role in facilitating the disarmament work of UNSCOM and UNMOVIC.’"
"Thus the whole of the last sentence is deleted."
"That, then, is my oral amendment."
"Thank you for your attention; I ask you to support it."
"– Mr President, I should like to ask before the final vote whether we adopted this oral amendment by the rapporteur, otherwise we have to abstain."
"I do not think we voted on the oral amendment."
"I understand that we have already approved it, Mr Wiersma."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of the great majority of the GUE/NGL Group."
"We voted in favour today, even though this legislation it is not as strong as we would have wished, because we need legislation that will protect lives and workers’ health, as well as the environment."
"We are very pleased that the packages we have agreed with others on authorisation and on the duty of care have been accepted."
"The regulation of chemicals within the EU must give proper protection to workers, consumers and the environment while, at the same time, being workable and maintaining the competitiveness of European industry and thereby ensuring jobs."
"We are very disappointed with the Nassauer-Sacconi compromise on registration."
"The challenge was to agree a registration package for collecting the information needed to assess the risks."
"With the deal that has now been agreed, the necessary information will not be available."
"What we need is a strong REACH regulation that will give us the information needed to assess whether chemicals are dangerous, even those chemicals produced in low tonnages."
"We want legislation with mandatory substitution of the most dangerous chemicals."
"The burden of proof must be with the companies and not with public authorities."
"It is with these principles in place that public health and workers’ health is best defended."
"Every serious impact assessment of the REACH proposal shows the immense health benefits of a workable chemicals policy and this is in stark contrast to the exaggerated industry calculations."
"REACH should be a matter of common sense."
"Companies should know what they are doing and should be held accountable for their products."
"– Mr President, I believe that the REACH compromise is a text that will serve as a good basis for negotiations with the Council."
"My group and I have voted in favour of the part on authorisation being adopted, and we did so, even though we are opposed to temporary authorisation for substances being restricted to five years."
"We wish to state in this regard that we are, in principle, in favour of this block, but would have welcomed it if these five years had been deleted, since decision-making on a case-by-case basis is vastly preferable and would be much easier for the industry to manage."
"On the whole, though, we have achieved something unprecedented up to now, namely a degree of environmental protection that is unique in the world."
"Today I voted against the amended proposal and legislative resolution on REACH because, as the votes progressed, amendments to ease the burden on SMEs were generally lost."
"Thus, the balance shifted in favour of restrictions which are so burdensome that they have the potential to drive parts of our chemical industry out of the EU."
"Despite some excessive provisions, particularly with regard to administrative authorisations, I voted for the amended draft regulation on the control of chemicals (REACH)."
"Actually, these provisions replace some obsolete texts that were unsuitable for the encouragement of innovation and for adequate protection of people in an increasingly complex, dangerous and changing environment."
"The amendments proposed by the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and, in some cases, voted for by Parliament, safeguard business interests, particularly those of the SMEs, whilst ensuring the proper functioning of the legislation allowing for the setting up of a European Chemicals Agency."
"With my colleagues in the UMP we shall keep a close watch to ensure that products imported into the European Union are also subject to these Community rules."
"This text, adopted at its first reading, forms a sound working basis and I am delighted because it is an advance for health in terms of respecting the environment, while, at the same time, safeguarding business interests in this very important sector."
"I voted in favour of the compromise negotiated on REACH between the Socialist Group and the Greens, Liberals and United Left concerning scope, substances, authorisation information, transparency and limitation of animal testing and the compromise with the EPP on registration."
"These compromises are not ideal, but they appear to be the best deal currently possible, given the political majorities in the Parliament."
"We do need to test chemicals."
"Recent medical evidence shows that each one of us has 300 more chemicals in our bodily tissues and blood than our grandparents did."
"We also know that there are increasing rates of asthma, cancer and other diseases which probably originate from chemicals."
"Some in the chemical industry argue that such testing is costly."
"But anyone who recalls the asbestos tragedy will know that money invested in the testing now can save thousands of lives and millions of pounds downstream."
"With the burden shared with our fellow countries in the European Union, this is well worth doing."
"And if it can be done while minimising animal testing, so much the better."
". I, along with many of my colleagues have been deeply involved in many meetings and discussions on this particular dossier."
"Indeed the level of divergence on this issue is reflected by the many amendments which have been put forward and which led to such a long and arduous voting session."
"Even though I have many concerns with regard the approval of many of the amendments, and also on the many inconsistencies which these have raised, I voted in favour of the report, firstly to allow the first reading process to completed and secondly, because I believe that when we return to this issue at second reading the text will have been improved."
"I obviously wish to see human and public health being protected, as well as the environment, however we must not loose sight of the fact that to allow new processes to be developed, new products to be created and new innovations to be made available for the greater good, we cannot impose huge restrictions on businesses, which would prevent them from having certainty with regard the business, regulatory and administrative environs within which they must operate."
". I have been campaigning for over three years in support of a strong REACH."
"Today I cast my vote against the report of Mr Sacconi because I believe that the amendments by Parliament have produced a proposal which would be too weak to protect our health and safety."
"This is one of the most important pieces of legislation that the Parliament has dealt with since I was elected in 1999."
"Its purpose is to protect human health but the substantial influence of the chemical industry has resulted in a proposal full of loopholes."
"I do not believe that we can compromise on the health of future generations."
"We know that our bodies are contaminated by chemicals now."
"Children have a right to be born chemical free but today's proposal will not achieve that."
"Therefore I could not vote for it."
"Throughout the extensive voting the following principles were followed:"
"1) We supported the repatriation of authority to member states and within that general statement where possible we supported the interests of SMEs"
"2) We supported all reductions in the use of animal testing"
"– After the vote in the different committees and having listened to the views of both the industry and the NGOs, the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety had established a balance between the need to protect health and the environment and the need for industrial development in the European Union."
"It has been approved almost unanimously by the Socialists, the Greens, the members of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and a large number of the liberals on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, in my opinion, this compromise of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is the position to support."
"I voted against the compromise proposed by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on the registration procedure, because it reduces considerably the number of substances to which REACH applies."
"A majority voted for obligatory substitution in order to assure European citizens that harmful substances will be withdrawn from circulation and replaced by safe products where they exist."
"Other important points have been adopted and I voted in favour of Mr Sacconi’s report."
"This vote is the final step in a long process of negotiation, which has been characterised by huge pressure, mainly on the part of the powerful chemical industry. This has led to the huge economic costs that may arise from the entry into force of standards contained in the first version of REACH."
"Indeed, the UK Presidency accepted Germany’s request to postpone the decision on REACH, scheduled for the next Council of Ministers, on the pretext of the country’s new government being delayed in taking up its duties."
"In any event, this is the first reading of a text that is very much a backward step, although there were some positive aspects on which progress was made and which must now be promoted until negotiations with the Council have been concluded."
"REACH creates a single integrated system for the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals in the EU, the purpose of which is, firstly, to control and replace the most dangerous chemicals (which cause cancer, change DNA and damage the reproductive system, among other serious health consequences); secondly, to provide safety information on all chemicals at registration stage; and, thirdly, to pass on information to consumers, workers and distributors."
"If we continue to buckle under pressure from the European chemical industry, the aims of the programme could be watered down and devalued. This would actually make it far more damaging than the current legislation, if public health and safety are not safeguarded."
". In the expectation of the second reading stage bringing us closer to a solution to the controversial areas of protection of intellectual property and the temporary approval of substances and imported items that will take into account the interests of all parties, I have today, in the final vote, voted in favour of the REACH draft."
". The new regulation on existing commercial chemical substances, REACH, serves to plug glaring gaps in the law and in our knowledge of the products to which we are exposed on a daily basis."
"The register of substances gives the European Chemicals Agency, also created by this regulation, the authority to demand more tests than those provided for under each category, should there be grounds for so doing."
"A strong and efficient agency will provide assurances that products will not be placed on the market without the necessary precautions being taken."
"The sharing of data is strongly encouraged in this regulation and animal testing is only permitted if absolutely essential."
"Further welcome aspects of this regulation are the imposition of a time limit for all authorisations and the mandatory submission of a substitution plan for chemicals considered to be dangerous."
"Although I was pleased with the final result of the vote, I must point out that I object to the inclusion of substances in tobacco products, as they are already covered by their own legislation."
". – I voted in favour of this text."
"Chemicals are present everywhere, and the recent increase in certain types of cancer or leukaemia has to make us question the use of certain chemicals."
"I wanted to approach this text from the angle of public health and environmental protection."
"A powerful REACH system is at least some guarantee for all our people."
"It is right, however, in this text, to safeguard the competitiveness of our enterprises and to avoid all stifling bureaucratic procedures."
"In the same way, it is important to exclude all natural substances from this system."
"On the other hand, I was in favour of the amendment calling for the chemicals involved in the making of cigarettes to be subject to the rules of the system put in place."
"The desired balance, apart from all emotional considerations, accompanied by the creation of a strong and independent European agency, should make it possible for us to achieve these important objectives for our health, our environment, and also for our industry."
"Moreover, I strongly urge that all products imported into the European Union should also be subject to these Community rules."
"You do not wait for an aeroplane to crash before you test it for safety, and neither should we for chemicals in household products."
"This new legislation will require manufacturers to prove chemicals are safe before they are used, ensure that the most dangerous chemicals are replaced with safer alternatives, and introduce a right to know about the health rules of chemicals in products we use."
"Only 143 chemicals have been subject to official controls in the last thirteen years, yet this new EU law at a stroke introduces a comprehensive system of regulation for all 30,000 chemicals on the European Market."
"The Women's Institute, including representatives I met with this week from Cambridge and Bury St. Edmunds, said we should put the environment and consumer safety first, and I am deeply proud that the European Parliament as a whole has been persuaded by their campaign."
". I should like to take the opportunity presented by my statement of how I voted on REACH to congratulate the animal welfare and environmental protection organisations on their great and wide-ranging commitment."
"Rain, wind and cold did not deter their dedicated members from getting involved in something of great importance to people and the environment and drawing attention to the problems associated with the controversial Chemicals Regulation."
"Not least in order to prevent millions of animals from being used in experiments and in order to promote the use of tests that do not involve them, amendments to the Commission proposal are indispensable."
"I have always supported four requirements in the REACH dossier."
"1."
"An extensive and rigorous system of registration for chemicals in order to recognise them, to evaluate their risk, to give information about them to users and to avoid those that are harmful."
"2."
"For those products that are harmful to a certain degree, there must be a strict system of authorisation, and the authorisation for their use must be time limited."
"3."
"The principle of substitution: substitution must be made obligatory for harmful products."
"If no known substitute exists, research must immediately be instigated and authorisation for use must be limited."
"4."
"The setting up of a strong European agency that, while being supported by a network of national institutions with expert knowledge, has the final say in implementing this legislation."
"I voted against the compromise by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe concerning the registration procedure because it reduces considerably the number of substances to which REACH applies."
". From the very outset of the debate on a new European law on chemicals, I have argued in favour of the Commission proposals being revised in order to secure better protection for health and the environment in Europe than was formerly the case, while reducing excessive bureaucratic demands."
"I have therefore supported the line taken by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"With this end in mind, today’s vote saw the adoption of a number of improvements to the Commission proposal:"
"1. the compromise reached by Mr Sacconi and Mr Nassauer on the subject of registration, which markedly reduces bureaucratic demands;"
"2. the exclusion of substances regulated elsewhere or not presenting any potential risk;"
"3. the tightening-up of requirements in respect of chemicals present in tobacco smoke."
"It has to be said, though, that the vote saw the adoption of a number of negative and indefensible points, notably amendments imposing time limits on authorisation."
"This is impractical, bureaucratic and unnecessary in terms of the protection of health and the environment."
"Since improvements had been made to three essential points in the Commission proposal, I voted ‘yes’ in the final vote."
"I hope that the Council of Ministers will reject the nonsensical proposals, such as that for a five-year time limit and will accept those that are more rational, and that the end-result will be that we end up with a workable REACH."
". – There should not be any secrecy or ambiguity surrounding the composition and toxicity of chemical substances."
"For months, a number of chemical companies have tried to torpedo a measure that has been necessary for the environment and public health for a long time."
"Today, no majority could be found for the strong REACH that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supported, but, at the same time, this House rejected many proposals tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which firmly took up the case of the chemical industry."
"Only those proposals on which Social Democrats and Liberals were able to agree received a majority."
"This has resulted in a weakened REACH, in which registration has been eroded and a positive result was secured only with regard to licences."
"Like others, though, we take the view that a weak version is better than nothing."
"The fact that the PPE-DE Group and Union for Europe of the Nations Group have declared here that they can still endorse the proposal, given that the Council and the required qualified majority in this House will ensure that the licensing provisions will not survive at second reading, is reason enough for the two representatives of the Dutch Socialist Party to vote against the proposal."
". – I have been a Member of Parliament for 40 years, 25 of those in this venerable House."
"The REACH dossier is the most voluminous, the most controversial and the most complicated matter that I have had to deal with in all these years."
"This dossier, however, is also the one that, most of all, has given rise to false information, to threats and even to attempts at blackmail."
"Those few people from Luxembourg who enjoy putting their signature to a threatening letter prepared by a powerful organisation, and, similarly, a press campaign denigrating my so-called lobbying in favour of the chemical industry, have not weakened my determination to vote with the majority of my fellow Members, and this is on the basis of well-documented information that I have diligently researched."
"If the directive becomes a reality in that form, it will constitute, at a global level, the best guarantee for protecting health from dangerous chemical substances, without jeopardising thousands of jobs, or putting small and medium-sized enterprises into an impossible situation, nor giving away any manufacturing secrets."
"I hope today that I have made my contribution to countering the perfectionists and the extremists of all kinds in this essential dossier for Europe."
". After a long a complex vote my initial assessment is that Parliament has just about struck the right balance between the vital issues of protecting human health and the environment on the one hand and not over-burdening industry or creating a legal requirement for unnecessary animal testing on the other."
"Parliament will have to examine the package that now emerges from Council to ensure that the delicate balance between these objectives has been maintained."
". If it is the case that 85% of all chemical substances in circulation are not tested to ascertain to what degree they present a risk to people and the environment, then it is high time that this omission was rectified once and for all."
"No longer can we tolerate our people being used as guinea pigs for chemicals to be found in such everyday products as computers or toys, which are absorbed through the skin or the airways, and the risks inherent in which have never yet been put to the test."
"We are already being presented with the bill for this culpable negligence in the shape of increasing incidence of allergies and thousands of cases of bronchial or skin disorders contracted at work."
"It must, of course, be a matter of the highest priority that all those substances suspected of being carcinogenic and/or mutagenic should be tested and taken off the market."
"Things should never have been allowed to come to this pass, in which people work with substances about whose side-effects no information is available."
"The essential thing in future is that it be ensured that newly-registered substances are harmless."
"Quite simply, there must be no more horror stories about toxic dyes in clothing, aggressive fragrances in cosmetics or fire-retardants finding their way into mothers’ breast milk."
"We will certainly not achieve this objective, though, if the original proposal is so watered down that, out of 100 000 untested chemicals, 88 000 stay that way."
"It is for this reason that I voted against the reports."
". I voted in the REACH debate as I did because, as a Labour MEP, I support the overall objectives of REACH: the protection of human health and the environment through increased knowledge about potentially hazardous chemicals."
"I would like to see a rapid, efficient system for collecting the necessary information on chemicals and for tackling those of most concern, whilst minimising animal testing and maintaining the competitiveness of the chemical industry."
"I believe that vertebrate animal testing should be kept to the absolute minimum necessary to ensure that sufficient information is available for decision-making on health and environmental protection."
"I support the UK's proposal for a system of 'one substance, one registration', whereby all manufacturers or importers of the same substance would work together to provide one set of 'core' data for registration."
"That would ensure that an agreed package of information would be assembled at registration, thereby providing coherent information for the benefit of users and consumers."
". I should like to clarify, at the end of this vote, that I have voted in favour of Mr Sacconi’s report solely in order to express my endorsement of the compromise on registration worked out by the rapporteur and myself."
"I certainly do not wish to express my approval of its other aspects, most especially not of the approach adopted towards authorisation, since I firmly repudiate the idea that the authorisation of substances should be limited."
". Our duty in this, as in all, discussions is to protect the interests of the citizens, whether they be immediate interests, or interests which are not yet apparent but which will take on vital importance in the medium and long term."
"I personally voted on the basis of criteria that I consider crucial when there is conflict – at least apparent conflict – between the interests of industry and the interests of protecting the environment and public health."
"First and foremost, I feel that protecting public health and the environment should be a priority, but I do not believe in fundamentalist solutions that take a broad brush to everything, overlooking the economic impact of measures and, more importantly, failing to take account of the global dimension of these issues when it comes to economies that have no compunction about environmental dumping."
"I am also convinced that our strict requirements benefit European industry itself, and act in the interests of competitiveness and technological innovation."
"Lastly, I believe that there is an urgent need to relaunch the European economy and that we must pull out all the stops to ensure that this happens."
"In light of the amendments introduced, I opted to vote in favour, not least because there will be further opportunities to introduce any necessary corrections, as in the section on authorisation."
". – What the world witnessed today is that it is easy to mislead a democratically elected parliament."
"All it takes is a few half-truths and total falsehoods."
"This House has shown the world that whoever shouts the loudest eventually wins the argument."
"Profits in the chemical industry in Belgium alone amounted to EUR 1.7 billion last year."
"That figure will be affected more by the high oil price and the low dollar than by the introduction of REACH in whatever form."
"Not so long ago, Europeans contentedly patted each other on the back for the progressive environmental policy that they pursued."
"We were the pioneers in the world, or so we thought."
"Those days are over."
"This watered down version of REACH shows how things should not be done."
"The White Paper that preceded REACH gave the chemical industry full responsibility."
"They had to be able to prove that the products, from which they derive their profits, do not entail unacceptable risks for health and the environment."
"So many back doors have since been created that it is difficult to locate the main entrance."
"This REACH is a missed opportunity and one that will probably not come round again."
". The REACH vote is one of the most important before this House."
"I would like to record my support on authorisation for block 1 and Amendments 232 and 214."
"I am pleased that these amendments passed."
"Public health is vital and we must decrease our exposure to dangerous chemicals."
"Replacing chemicals which cause cancer and which affect human reproduction is essential."
". – Anyone may guess the consequences of a European Chemicals Agency."
"First of all, evaluation in the interests of safety cannot give any certainty."
"We have antibiotics to show us that."
"Nitrate fertilisers have brought about the agricultural miracle that is in part responsible for a 20-year increase in life expectancy nowadays."
"With REACH, for the sake of protecting rivers from pollution, we would have malnutrition in Europe."
"In other words, under the guise of safety precautions, REACH is really just a preoccupation for the rich and for the Amish."
"The fundamental principle of this project is the post-modern obscurantism that springs from fear in a society that is so concerned with its quest for eternity that it no longer believes in progress."
"The disaster at Seveso, the Aral Sea tragedy, all those ecological catastrophes, none of these will make us forget the miracle of chemistry that, day by day, enhances every moment of our life, with new fabrics from new materials, thousands of colours and thousands of perfumes."
"If God had had to register his human product, born of organic chemistry, with the Agency in Helsinki, the very real potential dangers would have led to authorisation being refused for Man to be put on the market of the living world."
"Here’s the slogan that sums up REACH: ‘No future’."
". Although it forms part of the broader discussion on the REACH regulation, the proposal for a directive before us addresses a subject on which wide-ranging agreement is easier to obtain."
"Ensuring consumers are kept fully informed is a key factor in a genuine market in which there is real freedom of choice."
"The objective here is to adapt the existing arrangements to the needs arising from the new regulation, whilst ensuring that consumers are protected."
"Hence my vote in favour."
"The June List’s efforts are directed towards ensuring that cooperation within the EU is restricted to genuinely cross-border issues, which include both the internal market and many environmental issues."
"We welcome a robust Chemicals Directive that makes the industry’s responsibility for imported chemicals clear."
"We are convinced that, in the long term, it will be a competitive advantage for Swedish and European industry to be at the cutting edge on this issue."
"We have thus opted to oppose the compromises supported by the majority of the European Parliament."
"We are, however, voting in favour of the overall proposal for a directive because the Commission may otherwise withdraw it."
"We believe that low-volume substances must also be subject to basic inspection requirements."
"The Swedish Chemicals Inspectorate and the Swedish Government have both stressed the need to include these in REACH."
"We support a strong substitution principle and would like to emphasise that responsibility for collecting and analysing information about imported chemicals lies primarily with the industry, and not with the authorities of a particular country."
"We are, of course, in favour of excluding natural substances encountered in forestry and mining from REACH."
"Forests and ore, which constitute the backbone of Swedish industry, must not be affected by the proposed legislation."
"Furthermore, we are critical of the amendments recommending that a huge Chemicals Agency be established within the EU."
"We are confident that the national authorities are, in the main, capable of carrying out relevant inspections."
". On Thursday 17 November 2005, the plenary in Strasbourg will be voting on Guido Sacconi’s report, ‘REACH: establishing a European Chemicals Agency – Persistent Organic Pollutants’ (A6-0315/2005)."
"It is my firm conviction that, although the fundamental objective of this Regulation is to be welcomed, its implementation will be faulty and will eventually handicap the EU in competing on global markets."
"The fact is that it piles excessive rules and regulations upon businesses – whether they be large, medium-sized or small."
"It follows that the Regulation is inimical to growth and employment and makes Europe much less attractive as a place for the chemical industry to do business."
"In the final vote, then, I shall be voting against the report."
"I believe that we should send the proposal – in the form in which it stands before us now – back to the Commission from which it originated."
"The June List’s efforts are directed towards ensuring that cooperation within the EU is restricted to genuinely cross-border issues, which include both the internal market and many environmental issues."
"I welcome the Chemicals Directive, which makes it clear that the industry should be responsible for imported chemicals."
"I have voted in favour of the proposal as a whole."
"I support a strong substitution principle."
"Furthermore, I am, of course, in favour of excluding natural substances encountered in forestry and mining from REACH."
"Forests and ore, which constitute the backbone of Swedish industry, must not be affected by the proposed legislation."
"It is important that some prioritising take place in collecting information about chemicals."
"To begin with, data concerning high–volume chemicals must be collated and analysed."
"Chemicals legislation has to be effective, and not just a paper tiger."
"I am critical of the amendments recommending that a huge Chemicals Agency be established within the EU."
"I have every confidence that the national authorities are, in the main, capable of carrying out relevant inspections."
"– I would like to refer to the report on humane trapping standards presented by Mrs Scheele."
"I, like most members of Parliament, voted to adopt the report."
"Mr President, I ask that you call an electronic vote, because your conclusion on the voting did not reflect the will expressed by most of the voting MEPs."
"Mr President, I ask that you rectify this error."
". We support the rejection of the Commission proposal because, as the rapporteur says, it is not based on the most recent scientific developments and does not provide for the use of humane technical resources."
"The Commission’s proposal is a follow-up to the International Agreement on Humane Trapping concluded between the EU, the USA, Canada and Russia."
"This agreement was twice rejected by Parliament, however, and only entered into force because the Council and the Commission argued that they did not want to create trouble with the USA and Canada."
"The issue before us is the actual concept of ‘humane’."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety argues that traps cannot be deemed ‘humane’ if animals undergo a death struggle of 5 minutes or more, when alternatives are available."
"In any event, it is appalling that the Commission accepted the International Agreement without prior consultation with Parliament."
". – In our country, the Netherlands, we have for many years been engaged in battle against the muskrat, an American import that has undermined our dikes and as a result, threatens to make the lowlands uninhabitable for man."
"Despite this, we support the rapporteur, Mrs Scheele, who proposes an outright rejection of this proposal about the humane trapping of certain animal species."
"Humane means both ‘human’ and ‘decent’."
"People have, over the course of time, done the most hideous things – things that may have been human but were certainly not decent."
"In the Commission proposal, amputations, eye injuries, bone marrow injuries and a struggle for life lasting up to five minutes are considered humane."
"Since 1995, wildlife traps have been banned across the European Union, and an import ban has been introduced on animal skins from countries where such traps are still in use."
"There was a proposal to tighten up the requirements for other traps as long ago as 1996."
"A lobby of trappers then managed to sideline the experts."
"Subsequently, an agreement was signed with the USA, Canada and Russia, which was mainly intended to avoid trade conflicts rather than to improve animal welfare."
"This proposal is founded on this flawed agreement, something to which this Parliament has objected before."
". I voted for rejection of the Commission proposal on ‘humane’ trapping standards."
"The proposal did not do enough to protect the welfare of animals and because of the way it was drafted was difficult to amend."
"I hope and trust the Commission will now come forward with a proposal that places profit below concern for animal welfare."
". – We could not but be in agreement with an EU text that proposes the establishment of standards for the humane trapping of animals in order to promote animal welfare and the protection of certain animal species."
"Nonetheless, the Commission’s proposal presented to us is too unsatisfactory for us to be able to adopt it."
"How can we accept carrying out tests to create so-called ‘humane’ traps on animals themselves?"
"Is that not a paradox, to kill animals in order to ‘humanely’ kill other animals?"
"Furthermore, we are told that the welfare of trapped animals should be improved."
"Is that the case with jawed traps that crush under water?"
"This trap does not succeed in eliminating suffering: mink take on average two and a half minutes before they lose consciousness and beavers nine and a half minutes."
"Trapping is held in total abhorrence nowadays and the Commission’s directive does nothing to eliminate it or even to limit it."
"This is an example of the same business-minded approach that is always applied."
"Let us remember that 15% of animals killed for their fur have been trapped and that this figure relates only to commercial furs…"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is extremely important and useful mainly because it aims at making the code of conduct obligatory and calls for it to be legally recognised by all countries."
"Furthermore, I believe that calling for people to subscribe to the logic of marking and tracing weapons is important."
"The problem is that, if this code of conduct, which we debate each year, is not adopted by the Commission and by the Council, it is in danger of remaining merely a declaration of good intentions."
"It is extremely important that those instruments able to serve a dual purpose – both for peacekeeping and for making war – have also been included in this regulation."
"Finally, I believe that the decision to reaffirm the embargo on arms sales to China once more is equally important."
"This report is about drawing up a binding code of conduct on arms exports within the framework of the European Union."
"It is proposed that a new EU body for controlling the Member States’ exports be established."
"Notwithstanding the view taken as a matter of principle on this issue, there are reasons for questioning whether these developments would lead to a more restrictive policy, which is the objective."
"At the same time, the European Defence Agency is pushing for the more extensive coordination and liberalisation of the Member States’ export policies."
"We are opposed to establishing an EU body for arms export controls."
"Nor do we believe that the existence of the European Defence Agency is justified."
"The volume of each Member State’s arms exports should be determined by its national parliament."
"For this reason, Sweden is entitled to conduct a restrictive exports policy in the future too."
"In light of the above, we shall vote against the report in the final vote."
"I voted for this Report."
"I support its call not to lift the arms embargo on China until there has been a clear and sustained improvement in the human rights situation in that country."
"However, I do not believe it is right to treat China differently from other countries with an equally disturbing track record in protecting human rights."
"I would also like to see further debate on the possibility of converting the code of conduct into a fully legally binding code on arms sales."
". Quite apart from all of the questions raised by the report on the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, I feel that the ban on arms exports to China is, yet again, the key point, and is ample justification for me to vote in favour."
"My opinion has been and continues to be that the EU must persevere with its embargo because it is, more than anything, a stand taken by the 25 Member States in defence of human rights, the international order and peace."
"China is and will continue to be a major player on the international stage and a vital economic partner of the EU."
"I feel that one of the ways in which democracy and respect for human rights can be promoted is to develop the Chinese market."
"Yet this is not a path that can be followed unconditionally, and this is where the arms embargo comes in."
"We will be China’s economic partners, but tough partners committed to building a better world."
". I welcome this report which completes the requirements for the creation of a European Union solidarity fund."
"It sends a good signal to citizens that the EU will now be able to mobilise funds for the populations of regions struck by disasters."
"We believe that the United Nations – with its experience, expertise and global importance – is best suited for spearheading global disarmament and ensuring compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"On this basis, we are voting against setting up an EU agency for conversion and disarmament."
"We are also going to vote against the report in the final vote."
"We support, however, the demand for nuclear disarmament and the objective of Europe becoming a nuclear–free zone."
"The demands for limiting the proliferation of nuclear weapons should lead in the long run to all nuclear weapons being phased out."
"I wish to begin by highlighting the fact that Parliament took the initiative of drawing up a report on ‘non-proliferation’ and not disarmament. We feel that while the resolution makes some positive points, it also contains some very worrying ones."
"Within the context of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, leaving open the possibility of ‘the use of force’ is totally unacceptable."
"The fact that such a policy provided ‘backing’ for the colossal exercise in manipulation, and the attack on Iraq and the subsequent occupation, perpetrated by the USA and its allies – based on the outrageous allegation that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction – lays bare its real intentions."
"It is dangerous and disingenuous to link the so-called ‘war on terror’, in conjunction with the USA, with the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"We also regret the rejection of proposals tabled by our group aimed at setting up a European disarmament agency, condemning the USA’s manipulation of the United Nations, making Europe a nuclear weapon-free zone, withdrawing the USA’s nuclear weapons from Europe, and calling on Germany to eliminate its uranium enrichment potential in the Garching research reactor."
"I welcome this report which reaffirms support for multilateral agreements on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and recognises the risks presented by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"Specifically, the report is a response to the EU strategy on WMD which I back."
"I am pleased that the Rapporteur agreed to the removal from his draft of references to specific member states."
". – The responsibility for producing, spreading and using weapons of mass destruction (WMD) (nuclear, chemical and biological weapons) lies solely with the imperialist powers, including countries of the European Union."
"This is the historic truth that the motions for resolutions by the European Parliament try to conceal."
"They are full of bombast and hypocritical interest, without ever naming who produces, spreads and uses these weapons."
"In earlier and in modern times, WMD have always been used to subjugate peoples to imperialist rule."
"Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed by the USA."
"Napalm bombs were used for the first time in Grammo against the Greek Democratic Army and in Vietnam by the USA."
"Depleted uranium was used by the USA and ΝΑΤΟ in the wars against Iraq, Afghanistan and Yugoslavia."
"Chemical and biological weapons were sold to Saddam by European companies and were used recently by the USA in Faluja."
"When and whenever WMD have been used, they have always had the identity of imperialism."
"The motions for resolutions by the European Parliament not only fail to refer to any of this, they shift the responsibility to smaller states and individual sides, often with libellous accusations, in order to create pretexts for new interventions and wars and to safeguard their sovereignty."
". On matters of international policy and world security, commitments made in statements must be backed up by an ability to act."
"We cannot be resolute in our remarks, but indecisive when it comes to taking action."
"In light of the issues raised by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, there is a danger that this may become one of those cases in which vehement remarks are not matched by practical policy, especially – and very significantly – at diplomatic level."
"As I see it, where the EU needs to change is in the clarity of its rhetoric."
"The widespread perception that the EU does not follow its words through weakens our diplomatic position."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report, in the hope that its adoption will lead to the Union redoubling its efforts in this area, not in terms of going down the road of military solutions – and certainly not in terms of encouraging such solutions – but rather in terms of being resolute and decisive."
"We Swedish Social Democrats have voted in favour of the report because we think it important to have clear and unambiguous rules for defence procurement."
"However, there are some wordings in the report that, when interpreted most broadly, could be aimed at a future common defence."
"We are opposed to common European military defence and do not support proposals aimed at creating defence on those terms."
"However, we wish to make efforts to enhance the EU’s capacity for managing crises and detecting and preventing conflicts at an early stage, in the first place using political, diplomatic and economic means."
"Article 296 of the EC Treaty stipulates that the production of, and trade in, munitions may be exempted from the rules governing the free movement of goods."
"A portion of the report before us refers to clarifying and defining more precisely the types of material and services to which Article 296 really should not apply."
"The June List believes that the implementation of the single market is a very important issue, to which priority should be given."
"However, it is apparent from the report that the proposed amendments to the EU’s regulations are largely aimed at deepening military cooperation in the Union by taking a further step towards a common foreign and security policy."
"It is the June List’s view that foreign and security policy is a national issue that should on no account be decided on at EU level."
"We are therefore voting against this report."
"This report is a further step in the process of militarising the EU, which the rejected ‘European Constitution’ attempted to enshrine. The report addresses one of its fundamental pillars, namely the development of the military industry in the various Member States."
"The aim is to help the ‘European’ armaments industry and what is referred to as its ‘inevitable’ concentration process."
"In other words, the report sets out clearly what is at stake, explaining that 6 of the 25 Member States account for 90% of armaments purchases."
"How much, then, is being produced?"
"The report leaves no room for doubt."
"Its aim is to take arms policy out of the hands of the Member States, or rather, certain ‘small’ States, and gradually to set up a ‘European defence market’, in ‘accordance with accepted NATO standards of interoperability’."
"To this end, it calls on the (‘large’) Member States and the large armaments firms to set aside their differences, arguing that steps should be taken to ensure that ‘defence procurement is covered to a larger extent by European Community legislation rather than by national legislation’ and that ‘a restrictive interpretation of national security interests is appropriate’."
"All of which will be under the ‘leadership’ of the so-called ‘European Defence Agency’."
"This is the arms race at its best."
"Hence our vote against."
"– One sector alone still escapes the ultraliberal logic of Brussels: defence."
"Not for much longer perhaps."
"The European Commission in its Green Paper on defence procurement is setting about reducing trade barriers in this sector and opening it up to competition."
"For this purpose, the Commission has decided to attack the main legal obstacle by giving a new interpretation to Article 296 of the Treaty, which stipulates that Member States are allowed to derogate from Community rules on competition for reasons of national security."
"The purpose of this manipulation is to challenge the triple imperative of security of supply, of confidentiality in matters of defence and national security and of national independence."
"At a time when the European arms industry is fighting for survival in the face of massive export of US military products, it is high time for the EU Member States to invest in research and in the working out of common programmes."
"It is not by opening up our defence procurement a bit more that we shall make it more competitive, quite the contrary, we shall make it all the more open to US imports."
"Let us reestablish Community preference and quickly."
". This report is Parliament's response to the Green Paper ""Towards a European Defence Equipment Policy""."
"I welcome its proposals."
"Through these measures the Commission intends to contribute to the gradual creation of a European Defence Equipment Market which is more transparent and open between Member States and which, whilst respecting the sector's specific nature, would increase economic efficiency."
"I am pleased that the UK government has also welcomed the Green Paper as an important and timely initiative to open up a debate on the operation of defence equipment markets in Europe."
". The proposal, advocated by the rapporteur, to promote a European-level defence market and to ensure that such a market will be free and competitive, whilst of course respecting the specific characteristics of the sector, is one that I welcome and support."
"Accordingly, my vote is, without any hesitation, in favour."
"Of the many aspects that I could highlight, there is one that warrants particular focus."
"The defence market is one in which investment in research and development is of key importance."
"All of these proposals must be matched by European determination to modernise, to become more competitive and to invest in technological development, which is an important lever in economic development."
"Given that investment in a defence market is only possible if a clear choice has been made to make that investment, the reasons for voting in favour are even more compelling."
". British Conservatives attach great importance to genuine improvements in the single market."
"We might also support measures that really had the effect of ""increasing economic efficiency as well as competitiveness"" in the European defence market."
"However, this report is driven by the idea of extending EU competence and elevating the European Commission to a controlling position in the European armaments industry."
"Recitals F and G mistakenly blame market fragmentation for Europe's military weakness and lack of interoperability."
"There is no evidence that costs would be reduced by a European defence market, certainly collaborative projects prove costly in both time overruns and money."
"We object to the idea in Paragraph 9 that foresees defence procurement being covered by EU rather than national legislation."
"The proposal in paragraphs 10 and 15 for a directive to supplant Article 296 would have serious national security implications."
"Moreover, the promotion of a system of ""European preference"" for national defence purchases in paragraph 24 is a short-sighted idea that would do further damage to Europe's ailing militaries."
"For these reasons and more, British Conservatives voted against this report."
". We wish to express our unequivocal criticism of the appalling and irresponsible remarks about Israel made by the President of Iran."
"The motion for a resolution before us, however, reveals much about the double standards prevailing in the EU."
"With its biased view of the Middle East situation, the resolution makes proposals that would only serve to intensify the conflict."
"It makes the accusation that Iran supports terror, and yet sweeps under the carpet the major responsibility that the USA, Israel and our very own EU must bear for the worsening situation in the region."
"The motion for a resolution fails to condemn the consequences of the attack on Iraq and the subsequent occupation by the USA and its allies."
"It refers to the Palestine situation as a conflict, thereby glossing over Israel’s occupation of Palestine and its utterly brutal violation of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people."
"The motion for a resolution calls on Iran to honour its international obligations as regards the development of its nuclear programme, without questioning the demands made on other countries in the region that have developed nuclear programmes and possess nuclear weapons."
"The Iranian President’s remarks only serve to complicate the situation in a region that has been completely destabilised by a policy of interference, war and domination pursued by the USA, with the support of its regional and European allies."
". I voted for this resolution."
"The statement by the President of Iran that Israel should be wiped off the map must receive the strongest condemnation possible."
"However, the EU must resist the temptation to join with the USA in demonising Iran."
"I strongly believe with patience and diplomacy Iran could in the medium term become a reliable and constructive partner for the EU in the Middle East."
"If approached properly it could also do much to help stabilise the situation in Iraq."
", . – The statements by the President of Iran that 'Israel must be wiped off the map' must be condemned."
"However, no one in their right mind would believe that Israel was seriously threatened by these statements and that the 'solidarity' of the European Parliament is needed."
"The statements by the President of Iran are mainly for internal consumption, in order to divert the Iranian people from their opposition to the despotic regime and their deteriorating living conditions."
"The leaders of the European Parliament know this is the truth."
"The reasons why they hastened to issue condemnatory votes are part of their more general plans in the Middle East."
"At the same time, they are using the statements as a pretext for accusing Iran of supporting 'international terrorism', thereby defending the US policy which is threatening Iran and Syria with military intervention."
"It is no coincidence that the Prime Minister of Britain, which also has the Presidency of the ΕU today, spoke directly about military intervention in Iran."
"We voted against the motion for a resolution not because we have any feelings of solidarity with the Iranian regime, but because we do not recognise any right of the ΕU, ΝΑΤΟ or the USA to pretend to be the upholders of human rights and international law, when they themselves violate them shamelessly and support all forms of autocratic regimes, when they serve their interests."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues supported this resolution although it is considerably watered down from what I originally drafted on behalf of the EPP-ED Group."
"Restricting the scope of the resolution to President Ahmadinejad's call to 'wipe Israel off the world map' was a wasted opportunity to highlight Iran's apparent determination to make a nuclear bomb and its widespread human rights abuses, including the regular execution of consenting homosexuals and others who commit acts branded by the regime as 'crimes of sexual chastity'."
"President Ahmadinejad's comments about Israel – made three weeks ago – have already been condemned stridently and unreservedly by all major political leaders in Europe and beyond."
"Another round of denunciation by MEPs serves no useful purpose."
"Ahmadinejad's words are an outrageous threat but his actions could give Iran the power to make good that threat."
"This is no time for rhetoric."
"– ...to do an electronic check since, in our view, those that voted clearly supported the proposal."
"You have refused to do an electronic check of the vote, re-assessment..."
"Mr Baco, the competent committee has recommended that the House reject the initiative."
"We have voted and the House, by a very large majority, has voted against."
"The initiative has therefore been rejected and the Commissioner has spoken on behalf of the Commission."
"We have acted entirely in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"– Mr President, I am afraid I do not understand how you can come up with such a clearly incorrect result from the vote."
"We all saw that most of those who cast their votes backed the report."
"Because your assessment of this matter was at odds with that of other observers, I requested that an electronic check of the vote be performed."
"You have refused this and have come to a conclusion that does not reflect the will of the voting MEPs."
"I am speaking here about the report on humane trapping standards."
"The competent committee has recommended that this proposal be rejected and those who voted against it – as I have explained clearly – have rejected it."
"I have therefore acted in accordance with the decision of the House, which has voted against."
"This is why I have given the floor to the Commissioner. Since this initiative has been rejected, the Commissioner had to explain the Commission’s position."
"I can assure you, Mr Baco, that everything has been done perfectly correctly."
"You will note that the whole of the bureau that assists me agrees."
"The only person who does not understand is you;"
"I therefore believe that you should take stock."
"It is not possible that we are all wrong and that you are the only person who has got it right, Mr Baco."
"In any event, if you remain unconvinced, when the sitting is over the Deputy Secretary General and the Members who assist me in the bureau will explain it to you in private to put your mind at rest."
"– The next item is the report (A6-0318/2005) by Mrs Martens, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on a development strategy for Africa [2005/2142(INI)]."
"I understand that Members were very doubtful whether or not it was necessary to hold the debate and the vote today."
"As far as the vote is concerned, our rules allow for it to be postponed."
"On the other hand, there is nothing in our rules that allows us to postpone the debate, unless there is unanimity, but if anyone wishes the debate to take place, according to the rules, it must take place."
"– Mr President, perhaps we had naively believed that the REACH vote was going to end at 11.30 or 12.00 and that this morning we would be able to hold a debate and a vote on two such important issues as European development policy and the European Union’s development strategy for Africa."
"We obviously cannot hold a debate in circumstances that — we in my group believe — neither do justice to the issue nor show respect for the Members who have been rapporteurs for the two reports."
"In view of this situation, we believe that, in any event, it is essential that we postpone the vote."
"We also believe that we should postpone the debates, because we are debating two fundamental issues which are being followed with interest in diplomatic circles, by the countries in question and by non-governmental organisations, at a time when the chamber is practically empty."
"But if it is not possible to change the date of the debates, let us hold it now, in a clandestine manner – that will be the responsibility of those who do not want to seek an agreement in this regard."
"I do not accept the pressure that the Council is applying when it tells us that we must debate it badly now because the Council is meeting next week."
"If everybody is opposed to delaying the debates, however, we will have to hold them."
"In any event, I would ask that we vote on delaying the vote until a later sitting."
". – Mr President, I have to say, speaking as rapporteur, that I am not in favour of the delay."
"All of us in this House have, for whatever reason, agreed on a timetable, and one of the stumbling blocks was that the Council will be discussing this topic next week and that we would like to make our contribution in good time, rather than when everything has been done and dusted."
"That I regard as unworthy of this House."
"If, then, we postpone the debate and the vote, we are not taking our work as a Parliament seriously."
