"On one point I believe that the Commission could require clearer and more consistent behaviour from Minsk: I refer to the situation of the tens of thousands of children who stay with European families for a few months."
"For many years, the Belarusian Government has acted absurdly, sometimes incomprehensibly, often cancelling children's visits at the last minute, mortifying the host families and giving another loud slap in the face to children who, often orphans from somewhat complicated family backgrounds, resented the whole affair."
"Let us try and come to a change of course on this as soon as possible."
"- (SK) Slovakia is today commemorating the 21st anniversary of the Bratislava Candlelight Demonstration."
"On 25 March 1988 Christians who had been demonstrating peacefully for a free press and freedom of religion were brutally dispersed by the police and the army."
"The candlelight demonstration marked the historic beginning of Slovakia's long-awaited freedom and I therefore well understand the fears expressed by my colleagues regarding the EU's changed attitude towards President Lukashenko."
"I firmly believe that President Lukashenko should not come to Prague."
"Based on my personal experience with the totalitarian regime in Slovakia, I do not believe that a totalitarian leader is capable of transforming himself into a democrat in heart and mind."
"This can happen only when he is motivated by pragmatic reasons to do so."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we should listen more to the Belarus opposition, to Alexandr Milinkevich, and only if we can be sure that Belarus has become genuinely democratic should we lift all sanctions against Belarus."
"- Mr Beazley is also on the list, but apparently he has left the Chamber in a huff with me."
"I am therefore unable to give him the floor."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I should like to thank you for all your contributions."
"As I said in my introductory remarks, in the last months we have seen steps made by the Belarus authorities that go towards the expectations formulated in the October 2008 Council conclusions."
"These steps are significant in the Belarus context."
"At the same time, the picture is mixed, and I think the debate here confirmed that."
"We would like see further steps, such as the changes to the criminal court, registration of other media outlets and NGOs in Belarus."
"During the future review of the restrictive measures, the situation in Belarus and steps made by the Government will be taken into account."
"The progress in areas listed in the October 2008 Council's conclusions will be evaluated; we are already doing this on a permanent basis, and also discussing progress with the members of the opposition - for example, I met Alexander Kazulin in Prague just a week ago."
"Subject to progress made towards democracy, human rights and the rule of law, we remain ready to deepen our relations with Belarus."
"I believe that we can offer Belarus concrete incentives within the Eastern Partnership, but not only."
"Now let me turn to the lively debate here on the Eastern Partnership launching summit and in particular the level of participation of Belarus."
"Listen carefully: no decision has yet been taken on this issue, which requires consensus within the EU."
"It will be addressed closer to the summit and I do not want to speculate at this stage."
"But the pressure itself is simply the fact that no invitation has yet been issued."
"I should like to thank you once again for this interesting debate and your valuable input."
"We very much appreciate the interest and active involvement of the European Parliament on Belarus."
"We are also encouraged by your support for the EU's policy of engagement."
"Belarus is an important neighbour of the EU and, therefore, developments there are of concern to all of us."
"It is important that we send a clear and consistent message to Minsk and I am pleased that Parliament has been able to support us on this."
"Engagement is important since it offers us the best way of securing the sort of changes which we wish to see in Belarus and which are important to the EU's wider interests."
"As I said in my opening remarks, I stand ready to keep this Parliament informed of developments, and I am sure that also goes for the future presidencies, not least in relation to the future in-depth review agreed by the Council last week."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, honourable Members, once again I will be very quick."
"As we know, Belarus has made some progress but, naturally, much remains to be done."
"It is also clear that the policy of isolating Belarus has had its day, and that dialogue is the only effective way in which we can influence this country's democratic future."
"Of course, Mrs Schroedter, this is a critical dialogue; that is absolutely clear."
"The European Union has made a commitment in this regard to monitor very closely developments concerning the following five key issues: political prisoners, electoral law, freedom of the media, freedom of NGOs and freedom of assembly."
"Regular reports are currently being drafted and will be instituted by our heads of mission, in Minsk, and the human rights dialogue will supplement this process."
"Naturally, other issues remain, not least the university issue."
"We have asked to assess the progress made in relation to the aforementioned five points, and I believe that this is necessary."
"It is also important that we give our word, by which I mean, if we see progress being made, then we will also take some first steps."
"From our perspective, in fact, this is a necessary process that is still in its infancy and that requires our ongoing attention."
"To that end, monitoring is required."
"I should also like to say at this point - and I hope we have realised that this is absolutely fair and genuine - that bilateral agreements have been concluded in the meantime between Belarus and certain countries, in particular Italy, on child-related matters."
"I believe that this is very important, and we are all the same observing some progress."
"On the issue of visas, the situation is equally clear."
"Individual Member States can reduce the cost of visas for specific categories, including citizens."
"However, a general visa facilitation agreement cannot be created as yet because it would require the entire Eastern Partnership or Neighbourhood Policy to be implemented."
"Lastly, on the issue of nuclear energy, I can tell you that, last November, a Commission delegation travelled to Belarus."
"We held a dialogue on energy and exchanged views on the issue of international safety and security at the highest level."
"Naturally, we shall maintain this position."
"- The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next part-session."
"European conscience and totalitarianism (debate)"
"- The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on European conscience and totalitarianism."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I am very grateful to you for the opportunity to speak to you on a subject which has particular significance both to the Presidency and to all of us."
"It is also a subject which touches the heart of what it means to be part of the European Union."
"Twenty years ago, much of Central and Eastern Europe, including my own country, succeeded in throwing off the shackles of Communist rule."
"It was a turning point for us and for Europe."
"It opened the way for the rediscovery of individual freedom: freedom of speech and freedom of action - and also freedom to improve the quality of our lives."
"The Czech Presidency considered that the 20th anniversary of this event should be commemorated as an important milestone in European history."
"It is an opportunity not only to remember the fall of the Iron Curtain, but also to draw lessons from the totalitarian past across Europe as a whole."
"It was subsequently agreed that 2009 be designated as the 20th anniversary of democratic change in Central and Eastern Europe."
"The Czech Presidency is particularly pleased that this has been included as one of the communication priorities agreed between the institutions for 2009."
"In fact it was our proposal."
"The Member States have been encouraged, and have agreed, to include this theme as appropriate within their communication activities for the year."
"I am grateful to this Parliament for its support for the Czech Presidency and its willingness to participate in a number of events linked to this theme."
"I would like in particular to thank many Members for their support in organising a public hearing on the issue of 'European Conscience and Crimes of Totalitarian Communism' last week in Brussels, where we were together with Commissioner FigeÄ¾."
"This Parliament has proposed that a day be set aside to remember the victims of Nazism and totalitarian Communism."
"It is for individual Member States to decide whether and how they might wish to associate themselves with such an event."
"Speaking for the Czech Presidency, I can assure this Parliament that we are willing to give our support to such an initiative."
"The Presidency has also launched an initiative to establish a Platform of European Memory and Conscience, with the aim of raising public awareness about European history and the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes."
"I am pleased that this initiative has given rise to considerable interest among Member States, many of whom have underlined the importance of focusing on democratic values and respect for fundamental rights as key principles underpinning the European Union."
"There are several reasons why there is value in commemorating such an event and in establishing a permanent communication and research project such as the platform proposed by the Czech Presidency."
"Firstly, we owe it to those who suffered as result of totalitarian crimes not just to remember their experience at the hands of overbearing and unaccountable state regimes, but also to confront the past collectively."
"Only by reconciling ourselves to history can we truly break away from the bonds imposed by the regimes of the past."
"Secondly, it is only by appreciating fully the suffering brought about by such regimes that we can fully understand the present."
"The European Union stands for everything that is the opposite of totalitarianism."
"For those of us who emerged from the grip of Communism, membership of the European Union is one of the main guarantees that we will never again revert to totalitarianism."
"This is a guarantee which we all share."
"It is something to be valued and never taken lightly."
"A collective conscience and memory of the past is a way of reinforcing the value of the present."
"Thirdly, we owe it for the sake of our children."
"There are lessons to be learnt from our totalitarian past."
"Perhaps most important of these is the need for respect for human rights and fundamental values."
"Human rights and freedom cannot be taught in a vacuum."
"The seeds of human rights violations lie in history, sometimes in distant history."
"Knowledge of history, and an understanding of the dangers of totalitarianism, are essential if we are to avoid repeating some of the more terrible events of the past."
"It is not just cynicism and manipulation which have to be avoided: apathy and insensitivity have also to be overcome."
"The European elections will be taking place in a few months' time and I hope that they will be marked by lively and vigorous debate."
"That is the hallmark of democracy."
"It is something we should value."
"I very much believe that the subject of our debate today rises above party politics."
"It is about values more important than party differences."
"It is about how we organise our societies in a way which ensures that everyone has a voice and an opportunity to express their views."
"Given the recent history of my country I have focused in particular on the tragedy of totalitarian Communist rule."
"But there are relatively few countries represented in this Parliament today which have not been touched by totalitarianism in one form or another over the past century."
"Any system which places the state above criticism and challenge, any system which places the creativity of people at the mercy of the regime, any system which diminishes the individual has no place in the sort of societies which we seek to build within the framework of the European Union."
"I therefore offer my support, and that of the Czech Presidency, for the initiatives presented by this Parliament, and look forward to working together in supporting them through greater public awareness and recognition."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, a year ago, in April 2008, a hearing was held for the first time in the European Union on the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes."
"The hearing, organised jointly by the Commission and the Slovene Presidency, marked the start of a process, and the Commission is determined to pursue this process step by step."
"This is a difficult but necessary process, as it is not just an important issue which will help us to understand the European Union's common history, the past, better, but also one which affects the future of European integration - a process which is not just economic but of course also has cultural and historical ramifications."
"It is of course for the Member States to find their own way forward in taking decisions to deal with victims' expectations and promote reconciliation."
"The European Union's role can only be to facilitate this process by encouraging discussion and furthering the sharing of experiences and best practices."
"The Commission regards Parliament's written declaration on the proclamation of 23 August as a European day of remembrance for the victims of Stalinism and Nazism as an important initiative, which it supports in the interests of preserving the memory of totalitarian crimes and raising public awareness, particularly among the younger generations."
"The hearing of 8 April 2008 showed that the Member States in Western Europe need to be more aware of the tragic history of the Member States in the East, which is also part of our shared, common, European history."
"We must respond to this lack of sensitivity if we are to avoid the Union being divided on a serious issue which should instead unite us."
"The Commission hopes that the parliaments of the Member States, to which this declaration is addressed, will implement this declaration in the manner most appropriate in the light of their own history and sensibilities."
"The Commission is now focussing its attention on the report which it will submit in 2010 - next year - as the Council has requested."
"This report will provide the opportunity for further political debate on the need for new EU initiatives."
"To prepare the ground for this report, a study has been launched with the aim of providing a factual overview of the various legal instruments, methods and practices used in the Member States to safeguard the memory of totalitarian crime."
"The study will be completed by the end of this year."
"We are also drawing on the contributions made at the hearing and published by the Slovene Presidency."
"The Prague Declaration of 3 June 2008 on European Conscience and Communism contains a number of ideas and propositions that will also be taken on board when preparing this report."
"The Commission is willing to examine what scope it has to contribute to projects such as a European Memory and Conscience Platform, which was just mentioned by Deputy Prime Minister Vondra, which is designed to promote information exchanges and networking between national organisations active in this field."
"More generally the Commission will examine how Community programmes, for example, the one I am responsible for - Europe for Citizens - might help heighten European public awareness on these issues."
"I am looking forward to the debate."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, it is a great honour for me to have the opportunity to speak today."
"In 2005 we adopted a resolution on the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War."
"We discovered that the European Parliament and the EU lacked the political will to pursue a common understanding and evaluation of European history."
"While the victims of Fascism and Nazism have received decent compensation, millions of victims of Communism have been forgotten."
"I am therefore delighted to announce that the resolution on the European Conscience and Totalitarianism, on which most political families in this house have been working this afternoon, is almost ready."
"Europe will not be united as long as West and East do not agree to joint studies, recognition, dialogue and understanding of the shared history of Fascism, Communism and Nazism."
"Therefore, in order that we in Europe can live with a common understanding in the future, we have drafted a question for the Council and the Commission."
"The question is based on the Council of Europe resolution and the Council Against Racism and Xenophobia's framework decision and it is also based on the Prague Declaration process."
"I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission: 'What concrete steps will you be taking to set up platforms of scientific institutes in the East and in the West for studying the crimes of Communism, Nazism and Fascism?"
"Is the Commission providing funding from the Europe for Citizens instrument?"
"How are you supporting the establishment of 23rd August as 'Victims of Totalitarianism' day?"
"How are the Council and the Commission approaching the question of equal symbolic acknowledgement for the blameless victims of totalitarian Communism?"
"What steps are the Council and the Commission taking to reconcile us with the inheritance of totalitarian Communism as a crime against humanity that is comparable in its consequences with Nazism and Fascism?"
"Finally, will the Czech Presidency pass on its special task to the Swedish Presidency?'"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, my group is not against the debate that is being held today per se, but we do have a great deal of difficulty with summarising the result of this debate in a resolution."
"It gives the impression that we can lay down in a resolution how we should deal with Europe's history, and specifically with the totalitarian past."
"As was apparent in the negotiations that have just taken place, they were all too quickly bogged down by what wordings we could or could not use in such a resolution."
"Let us, please, leave it to historians to decide how precisely our history should be interpreted, knowing that objectivity is impossible."
"Obviously, politicians can help ensure that sufficient attention is paid to the past, and that certainly also applies to the crimes perpetrated by Hitler and Stalin."
"Those crimes must never be forgotten and we must honour the victims."
"We must also all be aware that our fellow Europeans in Central and Eastern Europe suffered under two totalitarian systems and that that is not the experience of people like me, born, as I was, in the Netherlands."
"Mr Geremek, a former Member of this House, quite correctly once commented that we have not yet achieved the reunification of our memories."
"As politicians, we have a responsibility when it comes to organising what it is that we want to commemorate specially, but let us do that in collaboration with historians."
"A day of commemoration for all the victims of the totalitarian systems in Europe in the 20th century is a good suggestion in itself, but let us work with historians to consider what the proper format and the right date for such a day should be so that everyone can support it."
"I, myself, am a historian. I think that if we were to link the day solely to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact it would not do justice to everything that happened in the 20th century."
"It is important to debate this."
"What are the dividing lines between politicians and historians?"
"What do we want to commemorate, and how?"
"The debate will undoubtedly rumble on."
"We, as a group, will certainly get involved."
"As an example of that, I want to show you this book, which will be coming out in two weeks' time under the title The politics of the past, the use and abuse of history and in which we especially left the floor to historians, and we hope that this will really contribute to the quality of the debate in this Parliament and, of course, elsewhere."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (HU) The European Union was born in the shadow of two totalitarian regimes."
"It was a response to the horrors of World War II and the atrocities of the Holocaust, but just as important was its mandate to halt the territorial expansion of Stalinism and Communism, and to keep alive the hope that Europe may one day reunite in democracy and peace."
"The European Union, as one of the most successful ventures in human history, has been able to fulfil both of these mandates."
"There followed a long period of peace and prosperity such as has never been seen before."
"It is no coincidence that Greece, Spain and Portugal, emerging from authoritarian rule, chose to join, and neither is it a coincidence that after the collapse of Communism, every Central and Eastern European country opted for the European Union and not for a third way."
"Another sign of success is the fact that the Balkan states are also looking to the EU for their future, as are certain countries in Eastern Europe or the South Caucasus that in many cases are still living under oppressive regimes."
"When we talk of totalitarianism, we do so not because we want to live in the past."
"No, we wish to look ahead, but we can only escape the errors and sins of the past if we familiarise ourselves with the past, if we process the past."
"Pacification is not possible without processing the past and acknowledging the truth."
"This is one of the most important lessons of the history of the past decades, and this is why it is important that we remember the horrors of totalitarianism."
"There is still much to be done."
"In certain Member States - unfortunately my country, Hungary, is one of these - there still is not complete access to the archives of the secret services of the oppressive Communist regimes."
"It is simply outrageous that people cannot get to know their own past."
"The European Union has an important task, namely, to call upon these countries to rectify this unacceptable situation."
"Secondly, unfortunately in quite a few Member States, including my home country, those holding extremist positions are increasingly gaining ground."
"Today it is mainly the extreme right, at least in our country, but there are other states where it is the extreme left that is pushing forward."
"It is important that we make clear to them as well the horrors of both regimes."
"Among our closest neighbours as well there are oppressive regimes - one of these, Belarus, was just discussed - and thus talk of oppression is not at all limited to past history."
"Europe's conscience cannot be clear without fully examining and remembering the past."
"When we remember the victims, then we are truly fulfilling our obligations, because it is our common obligation and responsibility to make the 21st century different from the 20th, so that the terrors of totalitarianism may never return to Europe."
"Madam President, in the discussion on the subject of the crimes of totalitarian regimes a great deal of time is devoted to the victims, while surprisingly little is said about those who sacrificed their lives fighting against Nazism and Communism."
"I would like once again to recall a man who should become a symbol of an unshakeable attitude and resistance to totalitarians - Cavalry Captain Witold Pilecki."
"He voluntarily entered the Auschwitz extermination camp to organise the resistance movement and gather information about mass murders."
"He managed to escape, only to die several years later from a bullet in the back of the head, dispatched on the orders of Soviet butchers."
"I therefore also appeal once again for 25 May, the date of his execution, to be designated the International Day of the Heroes of the Fight Against Totalitarianism, because many unknown people, who just like Pilecki lost their lives in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms, deserve to be remembered."
"I should like to add one further comment."
"Yesterday in Parliament we celebrated the European Day of home-made ice cream."
"I repeat, we celebrated the European Day of home-made ice cream."
"I do not therefore understand why 25 May cannot be the day when we remember the heroes of the fight against totalitarianism."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (HU) It is 20 years ago that the uprising of TemesvÃ¡r (TimiÅoara) began that would lead to the collapse of the ignominious CeauÅescu dictatorship."
"We cannot think back without emotion or subjectivity to the enthusiasm with which Romanians, Hungarians, Germans of TemesvÃ¡r, people of diverse ethnic groups, religions and communities, joined together bravely to resist tyranny."
"It is no arbitrary party political option but above all a moral question for us to condemn unambiguously the disenfranchising, oppressive Communist dictatorship."
"It is intolerable and unbearable that in twenty years this has not happened."
"Last week Romanian, Hungarian and Bulgarian speakers took part in the public hearing that, in connection with the Prague Declaration, placed the crimes of Communism on the agenda."
"The resolution subsequently adopted states the following: the European Community must abandon the double standard that is evident in the different ways in which Nazism and Communism have been judged."
"Both inhumane dictatorships deserve equal condemnation."
"I ask the European Parliament to stand in solidarity with the victims of Fascist Communism and to help defeat the enduring legacy of Communism in accordance with the aforementioned moral, historical and political exigencies."
"Only in this way can a divided Europe be truly unified and become that which Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke of yesterday, in relation to the 20th anniversary, as follows: 'My friends, today there is no Old Europe, no New Europe, no East or West Europe, there is only one Europe, our home Europe'."
"So be it!"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the efforts to assert that Communism equates to Nazism or Fascism and to create new so-called institutes or platforms for research smack of political opportunism."
"The radical right needs it also because of the forthcoming elections."
"It has nothing to do with objective, genuinely independent assessments."
"There are already enough historical institutes and centres dealing with that."
"I am not blind of course and under so-called Communism there was repression, injustice and coercion."
"Yes, it is necessary to investigate and justly condemn the crimes."
"Yet even Jan Zahradil of the ODS commented at the hearings: 'The identification of Communism with German Nazism is and is not correct."
"It has to be done in a way which takes account of relationships and analyses them'."
"If someone does not want to see the difference between Communism and Nazism, between Communists in the past and Communists in the present, who like myself represent significant numbers of Communist voters here in Parliament after democratic elections, then they are perhaps simply trying to lump me together with the Nazis."
"- (NL) Madam President, it is good that a number of initiatives have been taken to pay due remembrance to the victims of totalitarian systems."
"However, there is no sense in remembering the victims of defunct regimes such as those of Communism and National Socialism, of course, whilst disregarding the victims of current totalitarian threats such as that of Islamism."
"Condemning totalitarian Islam does not in any way imply condemnation of individual Muslims in Europe who observe the rules, values and standards of a democratic state under the rule of law, and for whom faith is a private matter."
"Yet we do have to have the courage to recognise that political Islam, totalitarian Islam - not only Islamic states, or some such states, but also terrorist organisations such as Al Qaeda and related movements - continues to claim many victims worldwide."
"The appropriate course of action, therefore, is for the European Union to take a number of strong initiatives to remember those victims, too, and to ensure that the number of victims of such totalitarian Islamic organisations and countries is reduced as far as possible, preferably to zero."
"After all, we must have the courage to admit - and this, too, is a problem in the European Union - that criticising totalitarian Islam is not always welcome because the spirit of political correctness prevails here."
"What is more, totalitarian Islam was not even mentioned in the Commission and Council statements just now, when what we should in fact be doing is having the courage to contemplate that problem, too, and to take the necessary measures."
"- Madam President, in 1948 President Truman wrote, 'Now we are faced with exactly the same situation with which Britain and France were faced in 1939 in dealing with Hitler."
"A totalitarian state is no different, whether you call it Nazi, Fascist, Communist or Franco's Spain."
"The oligarchy in Russia is a Frankenstein dictatorship worse than any of the others, Hitler included'."
"So the question is why, 61 years later, we still have to argue about the same problems."
"I think that today what we need is not only the economic and political enlargement of Europe but the enlargement of European awareness of the massive crimes against humanity which occurred everywhere in Europe in the 20th century."
"We need the integration of European historic perception - the integration of prejudices and different views of history - as only in this way can we proceed to the better Europe of the future."
"No, we have to deal with, not argue about, the question of dictatorships."
"We must start with the victims - with the equality of victims - because every victim of any totalitarian regime is to be considered equal in human dignity and deserves justice and remembrance as well as Europe-wide recognition and guarantees of 'never again'."
"Therefore I would say that it is hypocritical to shun or postpone this debate on these questions and the reaching of conclusions."
"It is not a matter for academic study."
"We have enough testimonies of mass crimes. We need political and moral will to proceed."
"I am very thankful, both to the Czech Presidency and to Commissioner FigeÄ¾, for their statements, which give hope that we can reach an all-European understanding."
"- (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin my speech by quoting from a poem written by Osip Mandelstam, one of the greatest Russian poets of the 20th century."
"I will quote the words in the language in which they were written, and so in Russian:"
"(the Member then spoke in Russian)"
"They are terrible words."
"For that poem Osip Mandelstam was sent into exile."
"He died near Vladivostok, on the way to his destination."
"In December 1938 his body was placed in a common grave."
"Osip Mandelstam symbolises the millions of victims of 20th-century totalitarian regimes in Europe."
"The Europe of today should remember the victims of 20th-century totalitarian regimes worldwide."
"Those victims are today the foundation of our memory, the lasting spiritual basis of European democracy."
"At the same time we see the entire history of the 20th century."
"We remember the victims of authoritarian systems, the victims in European countries, in nationalistic and militaristic regimes, in Spain, in Portugal and in Greece."
"I would like to draw attention to a seminar held in our group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and to a book devoted to problems of history and politics which our group is going to publish."
"We want to face up to this problem seriously."
"We are opposed to the manipulation of that memory, and to the insulting of that memory, where it is used today in an ideological battle, in a party fight in the European political system."
"We remember the victims."
"The victims of 20th-century totalitarian regimes must be the foundation of today's democracy in Europe."
". - (LV) Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, Europe's common values still do not contain a requirement to make a comprehensive and truthful assessment of the crimes of various totalitarian regimes in Europe and their consequences."
"Half-truths, one-sided interpretations and the denial of historical truth weakens Europeans."
"The framework decision on racism and xenophobia imposes criminal liability only for the gross trivialisation of Nazi crimes, but remains silent about the crimes of totalitarian Communism in Europe."
"It is high time to apply an objective method to the assessment of totalitarian crimes."
"We can make use of the experience of the European Court of Human Rights."
"It bases itself on universally recognised infringements of international rights and principles, which are well-known to all and have been applicable at least since the Nuremberg trials."
"We must, at last, truthfully reflect Europe's recent totalitarian history in the name of Europe's future and Europe's common values!"
"- (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, nearly 20 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, this is the first debate in this House on an issue which could drive a wedge between people in the East and in the West, even in our European Community."
"Why?"
"The view of a totalitarian regime from the outside is very different from the view from the inside."
"The way in which 20th century European history was dealt with and retold differed greatly, especially in the individual Member States."
"Moreover, in some Central and Eastern European Member States, people who disregarded human rights or sent people to camps or to their death without following the legal procedure are still in office and held in esteem."
"It poisons our common future if we fail to acknowledge this properly."
"Europe should therefore not remain inactive."
"I welcome the fact that we have now given this issue a European platform."
"I trust that it will not stop with today's debate and that we and the Commission shall together begin a process to implement the projects which you mentioned."
"I hope that we shall manage through this process to bring perpetrators who are still alive to book and to commemorate the victims, in order to develop greater understanding for each other in the interest of a common future."
"- (EL) Madam President, the escalation in the European Union's wretched anti-Communist strategy is a brazen insult to the people: with the counterfeiting of history, slander and lies, Fascism is being equated with Communism."
"The most reactionary and barbaric regime to which capitalism gave birth, namely Fascism, is being equated with the most progressive idea conceived by man, namely Communism and the abolition of the exploitation of man by man."
"It is an insult to the memory of twenty million Soviets who sacrificed their lives to conquer Fascism."
"This vulgar anti-Communism is targeted not so much at the past; it is targeted mainly at the present and at the future."
"Its aim for today is to reduce grassroots resistance and to shift the burden of the capitalist crisis on to the workers and its aim for tomorrow is to anticipate the inevitable general challenge to and overthrow of the capitalist system."
"That is why it is hitting out at Communists and ruining socialist/Communist prospects."
"It also wants to coerce the Communist parties, who stand firmly by their principles, into abandoning them and integrating."
"You deceive yourselves."
"Communists have no intention of bowing their heads."
"They have defended their ideology even with their lives."
"We will not be signing any declaration of repentance for the imperialists."
"Their overthrow is a social need and we shall serve it consistently."
"We are not afraid of you."
"The social evolution will continue; that is what terrifies you and why you are waging this campaign."
"- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that today we can in fact identify those who practise totalitarianism."
"The first country that comes to mind is China;"
"China is at present a country where forced abortions are performed, a country containing Laogai, a real concentration camp where people work for the big multinationals or the Chinese state and where priests and political opponents are incarcerated."
"China is therefore the first country of which I think."
"The second I would say is Islamic totalitarianism, above all in connection with Sharia law."
"Here, Islam effectively becomes totalitarian law, so that the rights of other religions or of women or of all are in fact suppressed."
"Then there is a resurgence of a certain kind of totalitarianism even in Europe, and I would like to take a moment to look at this."
"Hungary was mentioned before - I was personally present at demonstrations in Hungary at the remembrance of the national uprising in 1956 and I saw acts of repression by the police towards demonstrators and I myself was searched and asked for identification when they knew perfectly well who I was."
"There is therefore a kind of totalitarianism emerging there, but there is also another emerging totalitarianism in the declarations made by Prime Minister Zapatero, but also Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy, on the subject of the Pope's statements in Africa and other events connected with the Catholic Church."
"These Heads of State or Government have never spoken out against other religions, but are quite radical when it comes to intervening to attack the Catholic Church."
"This results in an atmosphere of intolerance in certain countries, as we saw the other day at Notre Dame for example, when worshippers were attacked by anti-Catholic activists."
"- (HU) Christianity and the doctrine of universal human rights presents us with a single measure, that of human dignity and unconditional respect for human life."
"For this reason we must condemn all attempts, so fashionable today, to calculate which inhumane dictatorship killed or humiliated more people."
"A democrat, a European cannot accept the fact that even today, even in this Parliament, there are people for whom the crimes of the Communist dictatorship are excusable and forgivable."
"A double standard distinguishing between victim and victim, crime and crime, suffering and suffering, death and death, is unacceptable."
"Those who try to justify the crimes of Communist dictatorship argue that all those horrors were committed by those regimes in the name of noble ideals, in the name of equality and fraternity."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, this is an enormous lie, and all they have done is to be counted not in their favour but against them, for it was with the promise of noble aims that they deceived people, as the writer IstvÃ¡n ÃrkÃ©ny said on Hungarian Radio at the time of the 1956 Revolution: 'We lied by night and we lied by day, we lied on every wavelength'."
"For this reason, in the name of freedom, democracy and a common European principle we ask, we demand that there be a common European day of remembrance and a monument to the victims of Communism, that a European museum, archive and research institute be established to document the crimes of Communism."
"Let us exclude from the ranks of democrats those who continue to this day to justify the actions of Communism and let Europe back wholeheartedly the condemnation of every inhumanity."
"May as many of us as possible support the Prague Declaration."
"- (ET) I am certain that no one in this hall - not even those who have something better to do at the moment - would condone what took place 60 years ago in the Baltic States, when nearly 100 000 people, mostly women and children, were deported to Siberia."
"This is made all the more regrettable by the fact that in the context of the already ongoing election struggle, some are pointing their fingers at the social democrats, claiming that we do not understand the criminality of these events."
"The words 'socialism' and 'Communism' may indeed mean different things to different members of our party, but no one could justify the crimes that were perpetrated."
"Why is it necessary for us to talk about this - not just for historians, but also for politicians?"
"Because without giving a fair assessment of the past, we cannot be certain that we have done everything possible to prevent it from being repeated."
"This is important, because the shadows of the past have not disappeared."
"While it is difficult today to imagine Hitler being raised onto a pedestal, Stalin's monument stands proudly in the main square of his home town Gori."
"In Russia last year, Stalin was voted one of the 12 greatest individuals in history."
"- (PL) Madam President, it is sometimes said that Nazi totalitarianism originates from the Right and Communist totalitarianism from the Left."
"This is not very precise."
"Racial hatred and class hatred are only two varieties of the same thing - hatred - which devastates the human conscience and social relations."
"We heard one such statement here a moment ago, the statement by Mr Pafilis."
"Hatred gives birth to oppression, and oppression is the negation of a republic, a democracy and a country ruled by law."
"Left and Right are both found in a democratic system."
"Nazi and Communist totalitarianism destroyed democracy."
"Therefore it was not the case that Nazism was on the Right, and Communism on the Left."
"Nazism and Communism were all around."
"Whoever today relativises the criminal character of totalitarianism, be it Nazi or Communist totalitarianism, stands in opposition to the traditions of a country ruled by law and to democracy."
"It is, by the way, characteristic that while the European Right does not relativise Nazi crimes today, the European Left does relativise Communist crimes."
"This is abundantly clear from the attitude of the socialists and Communists to the draft resolution on the matter which we have been negotiating today."
"In this Chamber we are not voting on the truth about history, we are voting on the truth about ourselves, and about our moral judgments."
"(Applause)"
"- Madam President, why is it that democrats feel so restrained about naming dictators and those who dedicated their careers to combating democracy, enslaving countries, persecuting those who dared to speak against them and are responsible for crimes?"
"This evening, we are not talking about totalitarianism, we are not talking in euphemisms: we are talking about Hitler's Fascist, criminal dictatorship and Joseph Stalin's Communist criminal dictatorship."
"When I was 16 years old I lived in Frankfurt am Main, which is two hours' tank drive away from Prague."
"Minister, Alexander DubÄek, whom we honoured in this House, tried very hard to liberalise the system."
"He spoke about the human face of Communism."
"The inhuman face of Communism was Leonid Brezhnev and his predecessors and successors."
"I believe, Commissioner, that if we are to stand by our beliefs we should honour the victims of Communism and Fascism."
"We should make no distinction between these twin criminals - that is what they were."
"The only difference is that Hitler lost the war and Stalin won the war."
"Today the President of this Parliament honoured the memory of those deported from three Baltic States - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania."
"But, Minister, your country suffered: Jan Palach lost his life."
"He tried desperately to demonstrate the limits to which he would go to show that the regime under which he lived was unacceptable."
"I remember listening, aged 16, to Radio Prague as the tanks occupied your capital city in Wenceslas Square."
"'Don't forget us' is what your brave countrymen said."
"This evening, Commissioner, we do not forget those who suffered."
"We should have the courage to name those who were responsible, but we should look to the future to ensure that never again this continent suffers from Hitlerism or Stalinism."
"(Applause)"
"- (ES) Madam President, let us not forget - I agree - and let us not make too many subtle distinctions: from the political viewpoint, all forms of totalitarianism deserve condemnation and Communism and Fascism did irreparable damage to this continent."
"Today we are a united continent of 27 nations and 500 million people who share values of freedom, democracy and human rights, and we ought to condemn equally the totalitarian Communism that destroyed Central and Eastern Europe and the Nazi-Fascism that years before had destroyed many European countries, including my own."
"I lived for 32 years under Franco's dictatorship and I shall not forget that, and nor will some of the speakers, from Greece or Portugal for instance, have forgotten their past."
"I never forgot, even when I was young, the suffering that people were experiencing under Communist dictatorship."
"I was never a Communist and I have always condemned Communism."
"This was not an obstacle to my being an anti-Franco fighter and condemning the Franco system."
"The struggle is the same."
"We must fight for the same principles, the same values and retain a permanent memory of the victims of all these forms of totalitarianism."
"- (LV) Madam President, Mr Vondra, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, those who have studied history in Europe, the majority I believe, know that the Second World War began on 1 September 1939, when Hitler invaded Poland."
"A much smaller number of people know that Hitler was able to do this because on 23 August 1939 he and Stalin had signed an agreement: a non-aggression pact."
"Even fewer people know that for two years Stalin's regime supplied Hitler and Hitler's army with fuel and industrial materials so that Hitler could conquer Western Europe."
"Even fewer people know that for the whole of the 1930s offensive weapons, tanks and parachutists had been prepared for Stalin."
"While Hitler had 400 parachutists ready, Stalin had prepared 1 million parachutists, ready to conquer."
"Furthermore, this foreign policy had been supported in the decisions of the Communist Bolshevik party of the Soviet Union."
"In various closed sessions of the Communist party, resolutions were passed to the effect that the countries of Western Europe should be set at loggerheads so that the Soviet Union would then be able to liberate them."
"There is still more: in relation to domestic policy, on 5 December 1937 those Latvians who had remained living in Soviet Russia began to be arrested and exterminated in their entirety."
"Over a two-year period, 70 000 Latvians living in the Soviet Union were killed solely because they were Latvians."
"So, how should we refer to this regime, where foreign policy was aggressive, and where domestic policy was directed towards exterminating the country's own residents?"
"It was a totalitarian, criminal regime, just like Nazism. Thank you."
"- (HU) It is difficult to write a common European history, since after World War II, the western and eastern halves of Europe lived through different histories."
"Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic states were victims equally of both Nazi and the Soviet dictatorships, yet we cannot equate Nazism with Stalinism."
"No one can dispute that millions fell victim to the Stalinist dictatorship, entire peoples were dislocated, and no one can exonerate or relativise that."
"The Shoah, Nazi Germany's organised industry for the extermination of the Jewish people solely on the basis of origin, was an atrocity unparalleled in human history."
"In Western Europe it is often not understood that for us, liberation from Nazism heralded at the same time a new occupation, the beginning of Soviet oppression."
"For that reason, 9 May is felt differently by old and new Member States, especially the Baltic states, which lost their independent statehood and whose intelligentsia was wiped out."
"It would be good to acknowledge the past without politics, without present-day political bias, and to formulate a common historical narrative."
"In the words of the Hungarian poet Attila JÃ³zsef, 'it is a great enough struggle to admit the past'."
"- (LV) Madam President, several of my fellow Members have already mentioned that today we are remembering the deportations of 60 years ago carried out by the Soviet regime, when it transported people to Siberia."
"We also know, however, how difficult it is express condemnation for the Communist regime equal to that for other totalitarian regimes."
"This is because we are talking not only about the past, but also about the future."
"This week it became known that in Latvia the leader on the list of European election candidates for the Harmony Centre association, whose newly-elected representatives are to join the socialist group here in the European Parliament, will be AlfrÄds Rubiks, the former leader of the Latvian branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, who was tried in Latvia for the crimes of the regime."
"This is a person who is a supporter of Communist ideology and resisted the restoration of Latvian independence to the very last; now he is to be elected by a country which he himself has disavowed."
"This also provides the answer as to why in the future it will continue to be difficult for the European Parliament to condemn crimes equally, and why good and bad totalitarian regimes will always exist. Thank you."
". - (RO) Communism is a deceitful philosophy."
"In theory, it talks about well-being, equality and respect for human rights, while in practice, it has meant lies, discrimination, hatred and even crime."
"Communism must be condemned with all the means at our disposal."
"This was done in Romania in 2006 through the words of the country's president, as a result of a report compiled by a presidential commission set up for this purpose."
"Communism nullifies everything that stands for liberty and makes people dependent on a system."
"Anyone who has never lived under Communism cannot understand how much a person's life and way of thinking can be affected by a totalitarian system."
"If I could turn back the clock, I would make those who have lived their whole lives under capitalism, but yearn for Communism, live in the Romania of the 1980s."
"In Romania the Communist regime was imposed with the help of Russian troops, at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives lost in labour camps and prisons."
"With their only crime being not to submit to the totalitarian system, politicians, intellectuals, peasants, representatives of different religious denominations and, in general, citizens who were model members of the community disappeared."
"While the major problems caused by a bankrupt economic system can be resolved through adequate measures, human beings need time to forget, forgive and adapt to a new way of life, even if it is incomparably better."
"Democracy has provided freedom of thought, expression and movement."
"It must also provide security for tomorrow."
"There is no difference between poverty caused by the lack of material goods and poverty caused by a lack of resources for buying goods."
"The day when we successfully get rid of poverty, the spectre of Communism will disappear for good."
"Fellow Members, Romania and the other countries in Eastern Europe ended up under this system as a result of the decisions made by the world's leaders, only one of whom was a Communist."
"The remainder represented democratic systems."
"Do not forget this historical truth when evaluating, assessing or deciding on the current situation or on the future of the former Communist states, whether members of the European Union or not."
"- (SL) I note with regret that none of the former Communist countries has yet fully investigated and recognised the crimes of Communism in the period following the Second World War."
"Because these regimes were in power for decades after the war, they managed to destroy most of the evidence."
"This is why the criminals, or the perpetrators, have not even been named, let alone convicted."
"History was written by the victors."
"The European Union must call upon all of the countries which were previously ruled by Communist regimes to enable their historians to carry out research and include the whole truth about the post-war era in school textbooks."
"They should also write about the culpability of the Western allied forces which returned or extradited exiles into the hands of the Communists."
"The European Union should also call upon all of the Member States to consider renaming those streets and squares which are named after controversial heroes, such as Tito in Yugoslavia, who were accountable for many post-war killings, by virtue of their roles at the time."
"- (PL) Madam President, when I hear in this Chamber that the Communists are not prepared to hang their heads, despite the tens of millions of victims of the construction of the White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal, the millions of people deported to Siberia from many nations (including Russians, but the Poles alone have to be counted in millions), and the sentencing of entire nations to death, for example the Crimean Tartars, I am astounded and outraged."
"Cavalry Captain Pilecki, who went into Auschwitz as a volunteer, and was later also imprisoned by the Communists, told his wife 'Auschwitz was only a game'."
"My country was affected by both totalitarian systems, and the wounds are still healing today."
"No such system has the right to exist."
"We should honour those who fought against totalitarianism, and we should honour the memory of the victims."
"- (PL) Madam President, the European Community must make every effort to keep alive the memory of heroes and not to allow the trivialisation of totalitarian crimes."
"The fate of those who resisted, of those who, like Cavalry Captain Pilecki, were murdered, should always be in our minds, especially because the idea of European integration arose among people opposed to Nazism and Communism."
"Furthermore, it was this idea which prevented future conflicts and the emergence of totalitarian regimes after the end of the War."
"The establishment of an International Day of the Heroes of the Fight Against Totalitarianism would be a step in the direction of a common understanding of 20th-century European history and part of the common fight against mutual prejudice and ignorance concerning historical facts."
"Keeping the crimes of totalitarian regimes - Nazi and Communist - in the minds of Europeans can make us hope that our continent will never again be the scene of such tragic events."
"- Madam President, there is a further dimension to this debate."
"It is not only a united Europe that needs urgently to look at the entirety of the past, but the same is particularly true of the European Left."
"Without a thorough scrutiny of its past, the Left in some of the former Communist states is obliged - compels itself - to live with a false past, a past from which all sorts of painful events are screened out."
"This further forces the Left to protect this false past and thereby its democratic credibility is eroded."
"Seeing as the Western Left fully accepts this unreconstructed post-Communist Left as a legitimate partner, it too finds itself obliged to defend an indefensible past."
"Consequently, its own commitment to democracy is, to that extent, weakened."
"- Madam President, Europe has a turbulent history with regard to totalitarianism and the restriction of basic freedoms."
"In some parts of Europe the 20th century was hallmarked by such totalitarian regimes."
"It is our moral obligation today to make sure that every citizen of the European Union enjoys the same rights."
"It is highly important that the EU should also support the rights of minorities, especially since many countries all around the world do not respect very basic rights in this sense."
"At the same time I would like to point out that, while the EU speaks out against discrimination and violation of human rights in cases like Tibet, it is clear to all of us that even within the European Union there are ethnic and linguistic minorities which are very often targets of cultural and linguistic assimilation."
"This practice of some nation states in the EU is an aspect that should be seriously reviewed and reconsidered."
"The Hungarians in Romania, the people I represent, are such a case."
"- (PL) Madam President, the suggestion by Mr SzÃ¡jer to establish a day commemorating the history of the victims of totalitarianism is quite right."
"I believe it is right because whilst the Nazi horror is fairly well known, and even some Germans have tried to take it in, paradoxically little is known about Stalinism."
"The paradox lies in the fact that even the Siberians, from Stalin's own country, thought that he was a good man and that the cause of Russia's misfortunes lay elsewhere."
"We cannot hear the millions who lost their lives in Siberia, and we will never know how they suffered, but I know of one of the victims who is still alive."
"That person still feels, even when just walking down the street, that he is no longer alive."
"That is a symptom of having been sent to Siberia."
"Those who survived know what that suffering was like."
"There is a Russian saying (the Member then said some words in Russian) - which means 'if you have not been there, you will be, and if you have been there, you will not forget it'."
"I think we should speak openly about both of these forms of totalitarianism."
"- Madam President, we should do everything we can to halt Europe's moral decline."
"Opportunism is most evident when gross crimes against humanity committed during the last century are neglected."
"Unfortunately, such negligence of crimes of Communist totalitarianism brings with it an appeasement of all neo-Nazis in Germany, Russia or anywhere: any of them could ask, if the Soviets are forgiven, then why should not our ancestors also be forgiven?"
"The roots of that bad phenomenon lie in Nuremberg, where Nazis were simply acquitted of initiating a conspiracy with Stalin in the Second World War."
"The greatest crime was ignored because of due process."
"Why?"
"Because the shadow of Stalin - Hitler's homologue - was cast over the tribunal for two crucial years."
"Even at that time, the West capitulated morally to the Soviets. But there is no reason to stay limited of mind and fearful forever."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, today I will complete my speech here in Czech."
"I will try to summarise and at the same time to answer some of the questions that have been raised here."
"I think there are three issues."
"Firstly I would like to thank everyone participating in last week's hearing and in this plenary debate."
"If it has been the first debate of its kind for a long time then that can only be a good thing and I think that the first conclusion is that we must lead the debate and we must continue with it."
"That is the aim of the Platform of Memory and Conscience."
"Why is it important to have such a platform at the European level?"
"It is important as an instrument against forgetting."
"If we forget the past, of course, we create an opportunity for it to return through the back door in the future."
"This is also a chance to combat the relativisation of past crimes."
"Hitler and Stalin are two of a kind."
"Of course there were countries where Nazism enabled or helped to bring about the subsequent establishment of Communism and its associated crimes."
"Any kind of relativisation, however - and I do not want to politicise here - any kind of relativisation is extremely dangerous."
"Secondly we must retain historical awareness as part of European education."
"And here I think we must boost the financial instruments in order to ensure that awareness of Europe's totalitarian past has a place in the area of education."
"This was one of the findings of the hearing that was held last week."
"This requires resources and I would like to thank the Commission and Commissioner FigeÄ¾ specifically for the fact that the Commission is willing to cooperate in this matter."
"Last but not least is the question of where the debate should lead."
"The Presidency is short, lasting just six months."
"We are at the half-way point and of course I am not pretending that when this Parliament breaks up shortly we can achieve the impossible, but I do think that the idea of creating certain Europe-wide institutions, whether museums, research institutes or foundations, is what we need."
"The hearing last week was presented jointly by the representatives of several similar institutions that exist at the national level and in my opinion there is a very urgent need to have such institutions at the pan-European level."
"However, that task belongs more to bodies that are responsible for continuity than to the six-monthly rotating Presidency."
"If our task was to contribute towards initiating certain debates then I would like to thank you once again for responding to this debate and I challenge those of you who will be responsible for continuity in the future to continue the debate and perhaps one day it will lead to such institutions really being set up."
"Member of the Commission. - (SK) I have already explained the essence of the Commission's mission in my introduction and I can only confirm once again that we are both ready and willing, which is also a factor."
"If the European Commission is willing to assist in this process, then I have already mentioned the next stages, which would involve completing studies of various methods and mechanisms of Member States in this area and submitting the awaited report next year."
"However, I also have something to add which is rather at the margins of the debate."
"Some speakers have made the point that it is the 20th anniversary of the collapse of Communism, the fall of the Berlin Wall and of the Iron Curtain in Europe and that a lot of time has passed."
"In my opinion it is never too late and it would be remiss of this Parliament, this recently expanded Parliament, not to make a statement about the crimes of totalitarian Communism and not to initiate a discussion, because this is an experience that many people have brought to this place and indeed a majority of those in the debate were from the new Member States."
"I too lived most of my life under the totalitarian system in Czechoslovakia and it is from the personal and general experience of all concerned that we should create a European memory, a European fellowship, and at the same time bolster the processes which prevent the return of totalitarianism and the trivialisation and denial of its crimes, or denial of the truth."
"The denial of these crimes actually amounts to a relativisation not only of the truth but also of ethics and morality, leading to further and further problems and to the idea that eliminating people means eliminating the problem."
"The idea that problems can be eliminated by eliminating people is one of the principles of Stalinism."
"I view the expansion of the EU in a broader sense and precisely for that reason I am able to identify the different forms of totalitarianism that have been mentioned, the different forms in different countries."
"We have a responsibility to identify them, to remember and to take adequate steps from the standpoint of restitution, rehabilitation, establishing justice, upholding the supremacy of truth, respect for human dignity and everything else that stands for freedom and democracy."
"I would also like to say that we often feel as if threats come from far away and from outside, and that the dividing lines of today's world have nothing to do with religion or civilisation or culture, but rather with respect for life and human beings on the one hand (defined through human rights) and fanaticism of whatever kind on the other."
"There are many different kinds of fanaticism."
"We are familiar with them even in the world of today and that is precisely why the education mentioned by Alexander Vondra is so important, so that both the young and also the not-so-young will be able to distinguish human respect from extremism, populism, nationalism or fanaticism in any of its many different forms."
"I would like to end by stressing that the European Commission genuinely supports this process and that it will be looking for ways to assist it."
"This debate is just one step but other matters will follow."
"We must do much more at the Member State level."
"I would also like to end by saying that today's expansion of the EU is possible thanks to the sacrifice of many people and that it has not happened through some kind of automated process."
"Neither a united Europe, nor democracy, nor freedom nor the legal state came into being automatically but instead as a result of enormous efforts and frequent bloodshed."
"We must remember this."
"I would finally like to end with what was said by - I think - Mr Tunne Kelam about the expansion of the Union involving not only geography, markets and numbers of countries but also an expansion of awareness, an expansion of memory and an expansion of respect and responsibility."
"If we can include this in the process that we are now celebrating, the five years since expansion, then we will be ready for further processes and for the future."
"If we fail to include it then the path will be much more difficult."
"Thank you very much and my best wishes for an expansion not only of memory but also of responsibility."
"- The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next part-session."
"Written Statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (BG) Justice is one of Europe's fundamental values."
"I support my fellow Members from UEN and resolution which they have tabled, by emphasising that the EU is founded on the rule of law, which is one of the basic features of democracy."
"This is precisely the principle on which the parliamentary elections must take place."
"However, the problem in Bulgaria of vote buying indicates the exact opposite."
"After the previous local elections were repeatedly compromised by the blatant buying of votes of GERB (Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria), DPS (Movement for Rights and Freedoms) and BSP (Bulgarian Socialist Party), ordinary citizens were left feeling that they had no right to choose."
"As a result, this makes them much less willing to vote again."
"In spite of the existing criminal code and the numerous signs of violations of the law, not a single person mentioned in the Commission's report has yet been convicted of these crimes because the relevant law enforcement authorities are clearly unwilling to stop vote buying."
"In Bulgaria the judiciary still shows a lack of determination and the well-known culprits are again preparing pre-election campaigns, while those who sold their votes are now looking for new buyers offering the best bid."
"I want to stress that as long as these violations of the law are allowed in Bulgaria and the state continues not to take any action on the issue, honest voters are in actual fact being deprived of their basic human right - the right to choose!"
"I urge Parliament not to sit back and do nothing."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the problem with totalitarianism in Europe stems from the fact that the experiences of particular Member States in this area are very different."
"Many Europeans simply do not know what life was like under totalitarian systems, and someone who does not understand totalitarianism has a natural tendency to disregard crimes committed under such systems, seeing them instead as events which took place in the course of history."
"However, Communism and Fascism not only actively fought against most of the values of Europe, but were ready to break all the principles of ethics in the name of sick and degenerate ideas - and these systems really did break those principles, bringing pain, suffering and death to millions of people."
"The more Europeans know about the true face of totalitarianism, the better it will be for the future of the European Union."
"This is not a matter of celebrating the sufferings of millions of people."
"It is about understanding the dramatic consequences which came from and are still coming from totalitarian practices in many countries in Europe."
"Solidarity, freedom, empathy, toleration, dialogue - all of these values look somewhat different if we look at them from the perspective of experiences with totalitarianism."
"Let us remember this."
"Establishing an International Day of the Heroes of the Fight Against Totalitarianism would undoubtedly help raise the level of knowledge about a painful past."
"That in turn would contribute to a reduction in prejudice, a limiting of stereotypes and a growth of the hope that never again will we in Europe experience totalitarianism."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.15 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Strengthening security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet (debate)"
"- The next item is the report by Stavros Lambrinidis, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on strengthening security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet."
"rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, we live in an age where everyone - governments, private companies and even criminals - seek the greatest possible access to our electronic data, to our private life."
"The Internet in particular provides details about our private lives, something which was unimaginable a few years ago."
"At the same time, it is clear that it enhances the facility for us to exercise our fundamental rights, such as freedom of speech, freedom of political action, freedom of knowledge and education and freedom of association."
"It is less clear that we are in danger of these very freedoms being violated as a result of using the Internet, with secret surveillance by governments, private companies or even criminals of what we do or look at on the Internet."
"It is therefore even less clear how we can strike a balance here, how we can regulate the Internet in such a way that allows us to draw on its benefits, while limiting its obvious dangers."
"My report attempts to answer these questions."
"Among other things:"
"firstly, it calls for a European initiative to create a global Internet Bill of Rights;"
"secondly, it signals the need for an effective but proportional fight against old and new forms of cybercrime, such as identity theft and the protection of intellectual property rights, while pointing out that legislation must not result in the systematic surveillance of all citizens, suspects and non-suspects, right and wrong, because this would, of course, be a blatant invasion of their privacy;"
"thirdly, as regards citizens' right of access to the Internet, it calls on governments to ensure such access to the poorest citizens in the remotest regions;"
"fourthly, it emphasises that e-illiteracy will be the new illiteracy of the 21st century, just as not knowing how to read or write was in the 20th century and that access to the Internet is therefore a fundamental right which is equivalent to the right to access to schooling;"
"fifthly, it calls for measures to limit consent from users, a major issue which I shall now discuss."
"The question of consent is extremely complicated and, if we do not resolve it right now, it will come back to haunt us."
"Let me give you an example: a few decades ago, no-one knew which newspaper I read; only my family and perhaps a few of my friends."
"That is why - and this is especially true during a dictatorship - the secret services tried to find out, so that they could put me on file."
"So that they could say Mr Lambrinidis reads such and such a newspaper, so he must be a Communist or he must be pro-American."
"Today, every time I read a newspaper, I leave a trail."
"This means that private companies can compile similar 'files', can create a profile for me, of the policies in which I believe, of my eating habits and even of my health."
"Does the fact that I visit these websites mean that I consent to my society going back 40 years?"
"We urgently need to pass sensible laws which strike a balance between combating crime and protecting rights in the electronic age."
"This balance appears difficult but it is not."
"It is feasible."
"We need to stop dealing with cyberspace as if it were something outside our daily life, something separate."
"It is our life."
"That means that any rights or barriers which apply to the police and private companies inside the Internet must also apply outside, otherwise we run the risk of abolishing freedoms for the sake of security and, ultimately, of having neither freedoms nor real security."
"To close, my warmest thanks to the shadow rapporteurs of all the political groups whom I see here in the House for their very considerable support."
"My thanks to all the MEPs in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the unanimous support which this report received from all parties."
"I look forward to its being approved by plenary."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank not only Parliament in general but especially Mr Stavros Lambrinidis for his important report, which provides very timely input to the promotion of fundamental freedoms and security on the Internet."
"Whilst the Internet has acquired a stronger and stronger weight in modern societies and economies, impacting in many areas of our lives, the tremendous pace of technological development raises, at the same time, significant challenges which need to be duly addressed if we want the full opportunities of the Internet and the information society to unravel."
"We particularly share Mr Lambrinidis's concerns on the protection of personal data, an issue which is of utmost relevance to Internet users."
"Let me assure you that the Commission continues to be committed to strengthening citizens' fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms, and in particular to ensuring a high level of protection of privacy and personal data, both on the Internet and in other contexts."
"I firmly believe that the pursuit of adequate privacy protection does not stand in opposition to the need to ensure greater security."
"Indeed, these two objectives can and should be pursued in synergy."
"The stability and security of the Internet were our priorities during the World Summit on the Information Society in 2005, and we are continuing with these objectives."
"These issues and will shortly be presented through a new strategy for the protection of Critical Information Infrastructures and in order to enhance Europe's preparation against large-scale cyber attacks and disruptions."
"This strategy includes an action plan which defines a road map to promote principles and guidelines for the stability and resilience of the Internet."
"Strategic cooperation with third countries will be developed within the strategy, notably in information society dialogues, as a vehicle to build global consensus in this area."
"At the same time, the Commission is convinced that it is necessary to ensure respect for fundamental freedoms such as freedom of expression on the Internet."
"Again, these two goals are not mutually exclusive."
"Your report further elaborates on the possibility of working on global standards, data protection and freedom of speech."
"The Commission participates in the yearly international conferences of Data Protection Commissioners and follows the ongoing work on possible future international standards on privacy and personal data protection."
"We are strongly committed to promoting the high standards of protection which EU citizens enjoy at present."
"Regarding freedom of speech, the Commission will continue to promote this fundamental right in international forums."
"New legislation in this area would not be considered as the way forward for the time being."
"We already have a number of binding international instruments on this subject."
"At this point in time, I believe that it would be useful to engage in effective reflection on the proper ways to enforce the existing legislation."
"So it is about implementation."
"This reflection should also include and help global commercial players to better define their roles and their responsibilities in the promotion and strengthening of the fundamental freedom of expression in the global online environment of the Internet."
"Let me conclude with a general comment."
"I believe we should tackle the serious challenges that this report brings to light and make sure that the concrete exercise of rights and freedoms is not unduly limited on the Internet."
"For example, an essential element of the Commission's strategy for a secure information society, since 2006, has been to have a holistic approach, ensuring coordination amongst stakeholders but also recognising that each of them has specific roles and responsibilities to fulfil."
"We all have responsibilities to make sure that our actions on the Internet do not unduly limit - and, if possible, that they promote - the security of others on this medium."
"It is, therefore, in the spirit of cooperation that the Commission welcomes and supports this report."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to thank the rapporteur, Stavros Lambrinidis, for the important report which he has handled and for his objective in endeavouring to protect personal data, a principle which the majority of us respect, including me personally."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education, I consider that the Internet is an exceptional platform for the dissemination of culture and knowledge;"
"I point this out in order to congratulate and thank all my honourable friends in the Committee on Culture who voted in favour of my opinion."
"Examples, such as digital museum archives, electronic books, music and audiovisual material, can be accessed by people in every corner of the world."
"Unfortunately, however, in the vast world of cyberspace, cultural material is not adequately protected."
"Piracy tends to be the rule rather than the exception and it is authors who lose out from the illegal distribution of their intellectual property."
"In other words, poets, songwriters, composers, producers and everyone involved in creativity in general."
"There are three things which help piracy to spread: technological facilities and the cheap cost of copying, adverse economic conditions and the penetration of the Internet."
"Amendment 4 restores the recommendation of the Committee on Culture for there to be a fair balance between the rights and the freedoms of all parties concerned and for all the fundamental rights of persons, based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, to be safeguarded and protected within the framework of the broad use of the Internet."
"That is why we support this amendment, which reiterates that fundamental rights are all of equal value and must all be protected in the same way."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (RO) This report is the result of collaboration between the members of this Chamber."
"This is why I would like to thank my fellow Members, especially Mr Lambrinidis, as well as Mrs Gacek, Mr Alvaro, Mrs SegelstrÃ¶m and Mr Mavrommatis, whom I had the pleasure of working with, also as shadow rapporteur."
"I think that the report covers the main topics of interest on strengthening security and fundamental human rights on the Internet, referring to the protection of the rights stipulated by the specific regulations in force, including their digital aspects, and to the acknowledgement and development of new principles for controlling the Internet."
"The text maintains a good balance between the protection of the freedom of expression and of privacy and the need to continue the fight against cybercrime, also highlighting the major problem of excessive monitoring of Internet activity, which can degenerate into a new form of censorship."
"The report also deals with the issues concerning the Internet's educational aspect, e-learning, the definition of digital identity and the recognition of users' rights over the content they have posted on the Internet, as well as the protection of data of a personal nature, in the sense of offering the opportunity for users to delete their own posted content permanently."
"These are sensitive subjects in the current climate where social networks are increasingly populated by young people, but not exclusively."
"This is why I have urged fellow Members to vote for this report with complete conviction."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Lambrinidis and everyone else in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs who has made this such a constructive and well thought-out report."
"I would also like to express my thanks for the support I received for my amendments."
"This constitutes support precisely for strengthening the rights of users and consumers."
"The section on the applications of the technology - monitoring Internet traffic, for example - is very important."
"It is good that the European Parliament is now saying emphatically that privacy and the human rights of citizens take priority."
"The report makes clear that Internet traffic may only be monitored where there is suspicion of a crime and as part of a legal process following a court ruling."
"This will be an important basis for the monitoring of civil rights."
"The report brings necessary measures not a moment too soon."
"I am surprised at the amendments tabled by Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"Their proposals weaken civil rights and the privacy of citizens."
"They have not looked critically at what technical progress could bring if we do not pay attention."
"Of course crimes on the Internet and crimes that exploit children and young people must be combated."
"However, the key issues in this context are, for example, the fact that the Swedish Conservative Government has adopted the so-called FRA law, a law that deals with the scrutiny of citizens who are not criminals and have not committed a crime, whereas it should instead be the citizens who scrutinise us."
"The report is a strong criticism of the Swedish Conservative Government, which defied all criticism and introduced this FRA law in Sweden."
"The authorities in Sweden now have the right to monitor Internet traffic without there being either a suspicion of crime or any risk to the safety of individuals or society."
"Following the decision tomorrow, I assume that the Swedish Government will reconsider and ensure that the law is changed."
"Otherwise they will be in opposition to the European Parliament and the elected representatives of the 27 countries of the EU."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Lambrinidis on a job well done."
"He fully involved all the shadow rapporteurs during the drafting of this report and did his very best to reach compromises."
"This report, which addresses the important questions of the information society, is an important step towards creating an Internet which guarantees both security for our citizens and their fundamental freedoms."
"The borders between freedom and security do not end at the borders of the virtual world."
"He has taken account in his report of the fight against cybercrime, child pornography, identity theft and fraud, as well as copyright violation."
"He has tried to involve Europol and makes clear that the current laws of the physical world must also apply to the virtual world."
"At the same time, he has managed to strike a balance between the protection of civil rights, freedom of expression, data protection and the right to the complete deletion of data on the Internet."
"Up to the present day, the Internet does not forget."
"Some of us can be glad that the Internet did not exist when we were still 13, 14, 15 or 16 years old, when we committed the sins of youth which we would not now want to find on YouTube or Facebook."
"He has highlighted the need for access to information and, more importantly, access to the Internet and respect for intellectual property."
"I am well aware that for many Members the report does not go far enough in respect of the protection of intellectual property and copyright."
"Let us work on that with the IP enforcement directive and highlight these points in that directive."
"This report makes clear that censorship on the Internet or blocking access to the network, as planned or already implemented by some Member States in Europe, are measures not worthy of our enlightened society and it also makes clear that the European Union is not following the example of totalitarian states and cutting its citizens off from information or feeding them information on a need to know basis."
"I am delighted that we have a balanced report here which takes account of the demands of an information society and I would be delighted if both my and other groups gave this report the broadest possible support tomorrow, so that we can develop an Internet in the interests of society."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, other Members have already said this, but I would like to reiterate that the Internet should not be criminalised or censored because it provides opportunities for communication, socialisation, information and knowledge, but there is nonetheless a need to develop a global strategy to combat cybercrime."
"In particular, we must protect children and educate and inform parents and teachers about the new potential dangers of the web."
"These are objectives on which Europe must be able to act effectively and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a good job well done."
"However, despite the penalties and fairly high level of protection afforded by Member States' legislation against online abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, the standard of child protection must be raised further, not least because of the ongoing development of new technologies, especially the Internet, and the use of new forms of online grooming of children by paedophiles."
"It was for precisely this reason that I chose to table an amendment to the report, explicitly calling on Member States to update their legislation on the use of the Internet by minors, in particular by introducing the offence of grooming, as defined by the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, of October 2007."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Lambrinidis very much for succeeding in respecting safety on the Internet while at the same time protecting and respecting the invaluable fundamental rights."
"I assume that protection of our fundamental rights as per this report will also receive support when we take a decision on the telecom package."
"There is a clear connection between this report and the telecom package."
"I hope that we are also in agreement at that time that it is important to protect civil liberties."
"As several Members have already said, the Internet has brought with it greatly increased opportunities for the freedom of expression."
"Citizens who do not normally have access to the discussion forums of the large-scale media can stir up opinion and pursue issues."
"It is a new arena for the exchange of opinions that is sorely needed for political mobilisation."
"It provides greater opportunities for citizens to scrutinise the decision-makers."
"What is important is that citizens have the opportunity themselves to scrutinise legislators and other holders of power."
"It has brought about increased knowledge."
"Most of all, we also have the opportunity for exchange and to make contact with people from different cultures and different parts of the world."
"When we discuss this issue it is also important to ensure that we have real freedom of expression and guarantees against censorship and control of opinions, information and opinion-forming, for example."
"Fundamental human rights, the freedom of expression and privacy, are important elements of democracy and must be both protected and respected at all times."
"The Internet is therefore an important factor in our democratic society today and so should it remain."
"I would therefore like us to vote against Amendment 5, which seeks to remove the text 'ensure that the expression of controversial political beliefs through the Internet is not subject to criminal prosecution'."
"If this amendment should get through it would represent a setback for democracy."
"Who decides what constitute controversial political beliefs?"
"It is a democratic right to be able to express different political views."
"The right of Internet users to be able to delete permanently personal data found on websites is also important."
"Of course we must combat crime on the Internet, like all criminal activity, but it must also be done in a legally certain manner in accordance with criminal law, as with other types of crime."
"Internet crime committed against children is particularly serious."
"In this regard we follow the Council of Europe Convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse."
"Other groups have also been affected."
"I am thinking, in particular, about women who have fallen victim to the sex slave trade."
"The sex industry today uses the Internet and the sexual violence that many women and children suffer."
"In this context I would like to remind my fellow Members of the fact that they can support a written declaration that is seeking to put a stop to this violence, and that is Written Declaration No 94."
"Finally, I would also like to mention the danger that we have seen with regard to the so-called war on terror."
"This has, on occasion, led to unreasonable government restrictions on the freedom of expression and the privacy of individuals."
"These restrictions have resulted in a security risk for citizens."
"The security services of various countries have traded the personal data that they have obtained by monitoring the Internet."
"This has put people's lives at risk, for example where someone is forced to flee from their home country on account of political oppression."
"I urge you to give great backing to this report tomorrow."
"Mr President, I am fascinated on a daily basis by how fantastic a tool the Internet is, but, however much the EU might contest it, a global network of computers is not a European one."
"To believe that a decree from Brussels or Strasbourg could change that is quite incredible and very detached from reality."
"It may justifiably be argued that the EU is the wrong forum to solve the type of problem highlighted in this report."
"Allow me to give you a couple of examples."
"The report compares the right to the Internet with the right to attend school."
"That is a bit rich when we know that the right or opportunity to attend school is not a foregone conclusion in many EU countries."
"Protection and the promotion of the rights of individuals on the Internet and the balance that should be found between privacy and security are extremely important, but these are likewise not issues that should be resolved at EU level."
"This is an international problem that must primarily be dealt with at international level."
"Another issue that is close to my heart is file sharing."
"Here we are urged to apply common criminal measures to protect intellectual property rights."
"I firmly believe that it is the Member States that should decide what constitutes a crime and what, if any, consequences it may have."
"For the EU to completely follow the music and film industry's line is utterly unacceptable, particularly in view of the fact that we are attempting to criminalise an entire generation."
"Finally, I would like to say that any attempt to legislate in these areas is going to be difficult, as technology changes much more rapidly than politics."
"- Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for taking on my suggestion, encouraging computer software manufacturers to take additional measures blocking access to pornographic and violent websites."
"This is a matter of particular concern to parents."
"It is a fact of life that our children are often more computer literate than we are."
"Parents may be vaguely aware of the fact that they can activate filters in Internet browsers, but this demands a modicum of knowledge of browser software, as well as a conscious decision to activate the system."
"If, by default, the filter was pre-installed in the 'on' position, it is probable that many more children - including the youngest, who increasingly use the Internet unsupervised - would be protected from unwittingly stumbling on sites which have a damaging influence on them."
"I appeal to manufacturers to respond to our suggestion."
"They should not see this as an imposition or a restriction but rather as a marketing opportunity."
"If I had the choice between buying two comparable computers and saw one displaying a child-friendly label, confirming that filters had been pre-installed, I as a parent would choose that product."
"In time, parents making such a choice would ensure that this became the industry standard."
"I truly hope that we can achieve this with the cooperation of the industry."
". - (RO) The Internet has now reached a new phase, being regarded not only as a vital tool in business, but also as a global forum for expressing different opinions."
"However, this development has generated ambivalent attitudes."
"On the one hand, the Internet continues to offer fantastic opportunities, acting as a catalyst for educational, cultural, economic and social development, while on the other hand, it is perceived as a platform which can be used to promote violent behaviour which has an impact on people's freedom and security."
"In addition, because of its global nature, the Internet has also become a danger to privacy, as citizens' Internet activities are often subject to monitoring by governments, police authorities, companies and even by criminals and terrorists, sometimes even resulting in identity theft."
"In this situation, the legal line must be identified which distinguishes between protecting citizens' security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet and unrestricted monitoring of their activities by various authorities so that the legislation becomes effective and not excessive in the measures taken to combat crime."
"This is why it is necessary to define global standards for data protection, security and freedom of expression through continuous cooperation between Internet operators and Internet users."
"It is also important, and in this respect I fully support the rapporteur, to examine and establish the limits of consent requested of users, whether by governments or private companies, in terms of giving up part of their privacy in return for certain Internet services or privileges."
"Last but not least, I believe, Mr President, that Member States must make efforts to bring their national legislations into line on protecting fundamental rights on the Internet, as this is something which may also help outline a joint strategy for combating cyber crime or terrorism."
"I wish to extend my congratulations to Mr Lambrinidis and the whole team who contributed to producing this report."
"- (NL) Mr President, I should like to add my compliments to those already paid to the rapporteur, who has prepared a fantastic report."
"I wish briefly to pick out a couple of points."
"First of all, in recent years we have seen the storage of personal data by companies and governments increasing hand over fist."
"Governments make use of company databases, but we still see different levels of protection applying to the first and third pillars - which I find extremely worrying."
"The second point - and I am pleased that my amendment on this has been adopted - is that criminals too, of course, turn the Internet to their advantage in all kinds of ways."
"Identity theft is growing alarmingly, and so we must ask the European Commission to create a contact point for this kind of theft - not only as a way of exchanging information but also for the benefit of victims."
"Thirdly, global standards are indeed necessary."
"Work is also under way on these, but such standards must be drawn up in the course of an open democratic process and not by European Commission officials negotiating with officials from the United States."
"Finally, whilst the European Commission often speaks fine words about freedom and civil rights, I have noticed that, led by Commissioner Frattini and also with the help of the Council, countless measures have been taken in recent years that make it possible to spy on citizens round the clock and to restrict their liberties."
"It is high time we evaluated what has been happening and the kind of consequences being produced."
"Therefore, I wish to conclude with a suggestion to the Commission: I would urge it to introduce a separate Commissioner for civil rights and liberties in the coming term."
"- I gave Ms in't Veld a little bit of extra time because she has 400 followers on Twitter."
"I have only got nine."
"Four hundred and fifty now."
"- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of our fellow Member, Mr Toubon."
"I should like firstly to thank Mr Popa, who has done an excellent job of trying to reach a compromise that is acceptable to us all, despite the extreme positions adopted on this issue by some members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"The report raises the important issue of finding a balance between security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet."
"Indeed, while for many this new technology is synonymous with progress and opportunities, it is not without its risks."
"For example, it is essential to guarantee freedom of expression and of information on this new medium, while ensuring at the same time that respect is shown for other fundamental freedoms, such as the protection of people's private lives and of personal data, and for intellectual property."
"The rapporteur, Mr Lambrinidis, who has done an excellent job, has thus taken into account the new types of Internet crime and the dangers they pose, especially for children."
"Unfortunately the report remains more ambiguous and even dangerous on other points."
"The aim of the amendments tabled by Mrs Hieronymi, Mr Mavrommatis and Mr Toubon, is to make it clear that attacks on fundamental freedoms should not be supported in the name of freedom of expression and of information."
"The Member States and Internet operators should keep some room for manoeuvre so that they can find the best solutions for ensuring that the rights of some do not completely prevent those of others from being exercised."
"Laws must apply to the Internet as they do everywhere else."
"The Internet cannot be a virtual space where an act that constitutes an offence in the real world is deemed permissible, and even protected simply by the effect of technology and the way in which it is used."
"The rule of law in our democratic societies is at stake."
"- (ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate my fellow Member and friend, Mr Lambrinidis, on the report that he has drafted and, in addition, on the fairly balanced oral explanation of what he is trying to do with this report."
"I have brought along a book, which is the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"This book was approved by 90% of the Spanish electorate and by the majority of the national parliaments of the countries to which we MEPs belong."
"It did not enter into force because of certain difficulties of a political nature, but this text is a key one, because it incorporates - and personally I see this as a mandate from my voters - the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"I believe that the charter brings together the principles set out by Mr Lambrinidis in his report."
"Firstly, the Internet is an area of freedom, modernity and equal opportunities, where people communicate with each other, mix with and provide information to each other, exchanging ideas and sharing knowledge."
"This right is recognised by Article II-71 of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"Secondly, the Internet ought to protect freedom and the development of the information society in a way that is compatible with respect for intellectual property and protection for users' privacy."
"Specifically, the right to intellectual property and also users' rights to privacy are recognised by Article II-77 of the draft European constitution."
"Thirdly, we need to seek an appropriate balance between the protection of rights, the fostering of content on offer and the legal market in digital content on the Internet, and development which is open to the new corporate models appearing on the net."
"We also have to deal with the protection of personal data, which is recognised by Article II-68 of the draft constitution."
"I therefore believe that the Lambrinidis report covers these concerns."
"Clearly, it does not dwell on the details of the conditions, requirements, consequences and sanctions arising from the misuse of the Internet, but I believe that that would be appropriate for a legislative document, and at the moment that is not what we are debating."
"- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as an artist, I am saddened, I am very shocked by the lack of interest shown in the cultural sector by Mr Lambrinidis's report."
"I would stress that we should at all times safeguard and protect individuals' rights as a whole, in accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and should guarantee the rights and freedoms of all parties concerned."
"The information society is an increasingly important economic sector, but also a major source of innovation and creativity that underpins the modern-day economy."
"This means, among other things, that access for all to a diverse culture and to education must be guaranteed within a context of respect for Community law and that the value of the creative work of authors and performers, including in the digital economy, must be duly recognised."
"However, such recognition means remunerating them for all the ways in which their creative contribution is used so that they can make a living from their profession and can be completely free to devote themselves to it."
"In this context, intellectual property rights must not be seen as an obstacle but indeed as a driver of creative activities, especially in the context of developing new on-line services."
"On the other hand, I believe that, even on the Internet, racist, hate-filled or revisionist discourse must be prosecuted."
"Freedom of expression must be exercised responsibly."
"The right balance must be struck between freedom of access to the Internet, respect for privacy and protection of intellectual property."
"I therefore call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to endorse my Amendments 2 to 6."
"- (EL) Mr President, it has almost become a habit for us to examine a report on the Internet in every plenary."
"This is a good thing, because it gives the Member States and the European Union an opportunity at last to address effectively these topical issues relating to the use of the Internet."
"I congratulate my honourable friend Mr Lambrinidis for agreeing to include the members' amendments in his very extensive report, thereby adding several new aspects to the issue at debate."
"Last time, Parliament examined questions relating to video games on the Internet and the dangers to minors and the financing mechanism of the European Union for a safe Internet for minors."
"Today's debate is convincing me more and more that, in the final analysis, everything comes down to a question of legal approach."
"That is why I think that the only thing that we should call for is a study at legal level into the multiple problems which arise from the use of the Internet."
"The report will therefore be useful as a catalogue which needs to be examined in depth by the legal experts, who will then implement the research work which will provide the various stakeholders mentioned in the report with the tools to draft legislation which will safeguard the principle of the rule of law as regards the use of the Internet in a democratic manner."
"Naturally we cannot speak of democracy when not every citizen has the right, regardless of their financial standing, to use the Internet."
"That is not how things stand today, but we hope that one day it will be."
"- (ET) Ladies and gentlemen, can you imagine life without the Internet?"
"I, for one, no longer can."
"I come from Estonia, which is a world leader in Internet availability."
"This is probably also why we have greater experience of the dangers of the Internet, from the cyber-war that targeted our country two years ago to the fact that, according to international research, our children have fallen prey to cyber-persecution more than children in many other countries."
"Through several of the reports it has passed in recent years, the European Parliament has actually sought to answer the question 'What is the Internet?'"
"A more relevant question today would be whether the Internet world is a separate space, as it were - a virtual world - that is not part of real life, or whether it is a part of the public sphere."
"This is also discussed by Mr Lambrinidis in his report, in which he states that our main task is to find a suitable balance between privacy and security."
"Freedom of expression is immediately brought up whenever the restriction of Internet freedom is mentioned - freedom of expression is the right to disseminate ideas, opinions, convictions and other information, but it also involves responsibility."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and hope that we will all have the strength to find the answer to this question: what is the Internet; can it be regulated, and if so, how should that be done?"
"Since the Internet is one of the clearest signs of globalisation, our approach to the issue must also be international."
"- (BG) Ladies and gentlemen, the content of this report fully lives up to its title."
"It covers the rights in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and aims to protect children from crime."
"Congratulations to the rapporteur."
"The Internet is a world where facts appear which are not explicitly defined as violations of rights and freedoms or as crimes against them."
"Opportunities for expression, finding out information and social contacts are often replaced by the direct opposite of these."
"The Internet provides fertile ground for bypassing regulations and having no restrictions on expression."
"In conditions offering anonymity and without any controls, the upshot of this is disclaimed responsibility when it comes to choosing and using linguistic terms."
"These terms are often infiltrated by slang, cynicism and even vulgarity."
"They evolve into a language of distrust and hatred, pass into everyday usage, become a model to imitate and mould a certain attitude."
"Such language does not contribute to a child's social, spiritual and moral welfare and does not lead to culture and values."
"This is why I am focusing my attention on the need for a separate analysis of the language used on the Internet and its influence on the personal development of the child."
"- Mr President, I am one of those people who would like to ensure the continuity of Internet freedom."
"The creators of the Internet had great faith in the basic goodness of humankind, and I tend to share that faith."
"Unfortunately, very often with the Internet, just as in any human society, we have to face the sad fact that regulations are needed to make sure that those who cannot protect themselves are protected too."
"The safety of an individual is a fundamental right, just as much as the right to free speech and to self-expression."
"Abominations such as child pornography and paedophilia, as well as Internet fraud, must be stopped."
"We cannot tolerate Internet predators of any kind, and while we are discussing this topic of great interest I would like to draw your attention to a much less discussed fact: the Internet is also full of sites that incite hatred, violence and intolerance towards all kinds of minorities, among them ethnic minorities."
"It is an aspect of the Internet that needs our attention."
"We have to make sure that minorities also feel protected."
"It is unacceptable that many extremist groups use the Internet to instigate hatred and xenophobia."
"- (PL) Mr President, I would like to draw attention to several problems associated with the Internet."
"Firstly, I wish to refer to protection of personal data and protection of confidentiality in connection with e-voting, which enables people with disabilities to exercise their rights as citizens."
"Secondly, I should mention protection of intellectual property in connection with artistic material which can easily be passed on via the Internet."
"Another matter concerns the protection of children from harmful content, such as scenes of brutality and pornography, through appropriate filters and educating parents."
"The fourth matter is the problem of protecting children from paedophiles and kidnappers, and also the opportunity to track down criminals using traces they have left on the Internet, such as a paedophile's address, or recordings of crimes made using mobile telephones and then posted on the Internet."
"If the statements made on the Internet by a young man in Germany had not been disregarded, his victims would still be alive, namely the pupils and teachers he shot."
"The next question, which is in fact the most important, concerns respecting freedom of speech, and here the law should be respected just as it is in every other area."
"Some of these problems require new technical solutions."
"I congratulate the rapporteur."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank all the speakers for their committed and interesting contributions."
"I just want to add two points about what I said at the beginning."
"We share, for example, concerns on intellectual property rights and the balanced approach which is needed here."
"This is important for the overall evolution, or development, of the information society."
"Enforcement of these property rights must be duly balanced with fundamental freedoms or rights, which are enumerated in the report, including the right to privacy, protection of personal data and the right to participate in the information society."
"Many of you mentioned children - minors - protection of those who are probably most facing these challenges, and they are sitting at computers daily."
"Here I would not only recommend but would strongly invite partners, Member States and institutions to cooperate with the Safer Internet Programme 2009-2013."
"There is quite a significant budget for this."
"Action has already been taken on undue or illegal content but also against harmful behaviour or conduct such as grooming or bullying, which have been mentioned."
"There are many issues, but I would advocate implementation of serious policies on commitments, whether national or international."
"We have a directive on privacy and electronic communications, a lot of concrete action or action plans, a European programme on protection of critical infrastructures."
"So that is why I said we do not need more legislation, rather due and appropriate implementation, and then, of course, further evolution and improvements."
"Somebody rightly mentioned the telecom package."
"Yesterday's trialogue gives a lot of hope for final agreement."
"I want to conclude by saying that this year was declared the European Year of Creativity and Innovation and the motto is: imagine, create, innovate."
"So we maybe cannot imagine the world without the Internet but it is important to imagine and create and innovate to make it safer and closer to humanity and human responsibility."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission."
"To make the interpreters' lives easier - as I am speaking off text - I will, as an exception, do this in English."
"I respect the sensitivities of those who are concerned about the protection of intellectual property."
"But I have the impression that they are fighting a battle on the wrong report."
"My report is not a single-issue report; it is a report that talks generally about protecting fundamental rights and security on the Internet and, indeed, that is why it received unanimous support."
"However, to the extent that it does refer to intellectual property rights, one would think by listening to some of the speeches that it ignores them."
"Let me read, in particular, how balanced we have attempted to be with this report."
"In paragraph 1(k), we urge the to Council to 'proceed to the adoption of the directive on criminal measures aimed at the enforcement of intellectual property rights, following an assessment, in the light of contemporary innovation research, of the extent to which it is necessary and proportionate'."
"This is what the report states."
"The amendments, however, are anything but balanced."
"Amendments that delete what the report calls for - which is a prohibition to the systematic surveillance of all users, whether or not suspect and whether or not guilty, to protect any security right - are anything but balanced."
"They call on us to totally abandon fundamental rights to protect something else."
"Secondly, amendments that delete or water down a very precise and specific reference in the report - that controversial political speech should not be criminalised - are amendments that I oppose, and I am glad to hear that many others in this room do as well."
"Political speech has to be protected, especially when it is controversial."
"If everyone in this room agreed with each other, we would not need freedom of speech legislation."
"It is when we do not - and especially to protect the speech that may particularly be angering to people like me or others - that we have those laws."
"This reference in the report does not talk about 'criminal' speech."
"It talks specifically about 'controversial political' speech."
"Therefore, I urge everyone to support this particular paragraph in the report and to support the report in general."
"I am deeply grateful to everyone - even those who disagree with me - who was here tonight."
"I know it is not easy."
"Thank you for your support during all these months leading up to this report."
"I look forward to working with you on your reports in the future and showing you similar understanding and support."
"- Thank you, colleagues."
"Thank you, Mr Mavrommatis, for your opinion and special thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Lambrinidis, for his success and for an important and interesting report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 26 March 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - I congratulate the rapporteur on this report."
"I believe the Internet has enhanced Europeans' lives in countless ways."
"It has increased our ability to access knowledge, aided our understanding of the world around us and reinforced our social connections to other people."
"But constituents tell me they are also concerned about the dangers of the Internet."
"We have remarkable technology at our fingertips, but the very freedom it gives us has also left criminals free to abuse the technology."
"This report, in its focus on fundamental rights, will go a long way to making the Internet safer."
"We spoke during the last part-session on the need to tackle child pornography."
"Through balancing liberty and security, the proposals we have voted on today will form a further vital tool in the fight against that threat."
"The report also raises concerns about e-literacy."
"We cannot move forward as a society together if, by promoting new freedoms for some, we restrict the rights of those who are less familiar with the Internet."
"We have gladly taken on board the profound changes the Internet has wrought."
"To move even further forward, our focus should now shift to dealing with the negatives of this revolution just as willingly."
"It is well known that the Internet is increasingly difficult to control, but protecting the fundamental right to privacy on the Internet and ensuring the Internet is more secure must feature among the priorities of Member State governments."
"Using the Internet offers countless benefits, but we must not forget the danger of the abuses which some Internet users are exposed to."
"This is why, in order to limit these abuses, it is our duty to define standards for data protection, security and freedom of expression at both European and Member State level."
"On the other hand, urgent measures must be taken to combat cyber crime and, on this subject, I would like to emphasise the importance of devising a global strategy."
"I insist that in the battle against cyber crime there must be active cooperation between the police authorities, Internet service providers, users and other operators involved."
"I must finish by saying that the right to education and Internet access, as well as the security and the protection of the rights of those who use Internet services must be guaranteed."
"Follow-up to the Declaration of the Sports Ministers of the European Union at their meeting in Biarritz in November 2008 (debate)"
"- The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the follow-up to the Declaration of the Sports Ministers of the European Union at their meeting in Biarritz in November 2008 by Katerina Batzeli and Doris Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education - B6-0223/2009)."
"author. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the informal council of Sports Ministers in Biarritz in November 2008 was the first real European sports forum at the level of transnational cooperation."
"It is a first substantive and important step."
"Principles such as subsidiarity, autonomy and self-regulation in sport are broadly applied at national and regional level."
"However, they cannot answer the basic question of whether sport ultimately has a social role or a purely commercial dimension which inevitably turns a sporting activity into a product of the internal market."
"Today, the intense commercialisation of sport and the fact that it has been opened up to purely commercial sectors, such as advertising through the mass media, have lent it purely economic attributes."
"The Court of Justice of the European Communities has already been petitioned several times to rule, in specific cases, on whether a sporting activity is a service of purely social benefit or if, on the contrary, it also encompasses economic aspects which imply that it is a service of general economic interest."
"Even though the specific social role of sport does not warrant its general exemption from the rule of Community law, it continues to be recognised and to allow limitations, provided that such exemptions are warranted by the social role of sport per se."
"Commissioner, there are certain questions which are also asked in the question by our committee:"
"firstly, the same concern about the autonomy of organisations; the autonomy of sports clubs and federations must be safeguarded."
"However, there are clear cases in which self-regulation does not safeguard equal treatment of all stakeholders;"
"secondly, the Commission urgently needs to give us the necessary guidelines on the question of the definition of the concept of a service of general economic interest in sport and the criteria by which the freedoms of the internal market and the rules of competition are imposed and"
"thirdly, one issue which may not be mentioned in the oral question but which is an issue of major importance is that which has arisen at national level, namely how to manage the rights of state or private radio and television stations to cover sporting fixtures."
"The emergence on the market of numerous new private service providers using new technologies and telecommunications was what basically lured many sports federations into making preferential sales of these rights."
"However, it should be emphasised at this point that it is precisely because of the social role of sport that it would be a mistake to promote a system from which solidarity between clubs is missing and economic competition is strengthened."
"Collective bargaining, a matter which Mr Mavrommatis also addresses in his report, should be promoted as the most suitable and fitting solution for the sport sector."
"Whatever the solution, Commissioner, it must respect not only the legal procedure of the market, but also the public role of sport and the fact that it is a social commodity and must be accessible to every section of society."
"The role of and the way in which sports clubs are organised are important factors in how they negotiate with the European Commission and with the Committee on Culture and Education and the European Parliament."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome the statement by the EU Sports Ministers at their meeting last November in Biarritz."
"They are important in driving the political debate on sport forward step by step and also in strengthening dialogue structures on sport, as was recommended in our white paper in 2007."
"This White Paper on Sport is making good progress in implementation."
"The recent European Council Declaration on Sport, in December, is also a very important step forward and calls for strengthened dialogue with the IOC and the sport movement as a priority."
"The Commission has moved swiftly to follow up both calls from the political side."
"However, dialogue in sport remains a challenging task, given the diversity of sport and the complexity of the sport structures."
"In January, in Lausanne, I met with the IOC President, Mr Jacques Rogge, and representatives of international sport federations."
"The meeting confirmed that sport organisations are really moving away from insisting on general exemptions - 'block exemptions' - from the 'acquis communautaire' for sport, and are ready to address sport-related topics with legal implications on a theme-per-theme basis."
"I think this is the appropriate way to achieve more clarity regarding the application of European Union law to sport, in addition to guidance provided in the white paper."
"We are also exchanging views with team sports."
"My services met last week with the main international and European team sport federations to discuss free movement of athletes and non-discrimination aspects in sport."
"I intend to follow up on these discussions by convening a further meeting at this high level in June."
"Finally, good progress has been achieved in setting up EU social dialogue structures in sport."
"It started in football and I believe it will continue in other sectors."
"Regarding the shape of the dialogue framework, there simply cannot be a single, formal framework for consultation with the sport movement."
"Given the specific organisation of sport, the dialogue must take account of the different levels of sport."
"I am committed to a constructive partnership with all actors in sport respecting the autonomy of sport, subsidiarity principles and national and EU legal frameworks."
"I think this is crucial in shaping the future EU policy framework for sport, which - without prejudging developments regarding the Lisbon Treaty - we might have to implement as early as next year."
"Here I also would like to thank the European Parliament, and especially the Committee on Culture and Education, for its support."
"You also, notably, approved the specific line, or budget, for a preparatory action, which we will soon start to implement. This is an important opportunity and will help us to frame our ideas for the way ahead."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur on the White Paper on Sport, I had the opportunity of presenting the position of the European Parliament at the meeting of the Sports Ministers of the Member States of the European Union in Biarritz."
"The White Paper emphasises the need to respect the autonomy and specificity of sport."
"The political debate on sport in Europe often attributes great importance to the so-called 'European Sport Model'."
"During discussions with European sports stakeholders about the White Paper on Sport, the Commission and the European Parliament agreed that, come what may, the specificity of sport must be protected."
"There are two approaches to the specificity of European sport:"
"firstly, the specificity of sporting activities and sporting rules and"
"secondly, the specificity of the sport structure."
"As far as the second specificity is concerned, the European Union recognises the autonomy of sports organisations and of representative structures such as organisations which organise professional championships."
"However, in order to achieve improved and more effective coordination, there must be minimum regulation at European level."
"Thus, both the Commission and European sports stakeholders believe that most of the challenges can be addressed through self-regulation within the framework of respect for the principles of sound management and compliance with Community law."
"Generally speaking, the European Union is particularly careful when it comes to its approach to and regulation of sports issues, provided that they are in keeping with European law."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Parliament has worked hard on the White Paper on Sport and has thrown its full support behind the request to the European Commission to produce clear guidelines on the application of European law to sport."
"Not only Parliament but also sport organisations from throughout Europe have called for clarity."
"It is inhumane that they are left in the dark because, as things stand, the courts are having to decide time after time on the application of European law."
"The European Ministers for Sport repeated the request to the Commission in Biarritz."
"It is time we heard from the Commission itself whether it has yet started to develop these guidelines."
"Can it tell us when they will be available?"
"Is it prepared to organise a stakeholder conference involving, among others, representatives of the world of sport and of the European Parliament, in order to launch or accelerate this process and to increase clarity for European sport organisations as quickly as possible?"
"This brings me to another, closely related, point."
"Experience has shown that there are currently few or no good mechanisms for dialogue in sport."
"The clearest example is the discussion on the amended Anti-Doping Code of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)."
"They cling desperately to unworkable rules, and there is absolutely no scope for real dialogue with the European institutions and the sportspeople themselves to seek solutions with the potential to produce an anti-doping policy that is effective and does indeed respect the civil rights and privacy of sportspeople."
"I have many conversations with sportspeople and stakeholder organisations who complain that there is a lack of consultation and that WADA and the International Olympic Committee lay down requirements but are not themselves receptive to input."
"WADA's response to yesterday's proposal by UEFA and FIFA alone indicates that an open attitude is completely out of the question."
"With regard to anti-doping policy, to what extent has the European Commission taken it upon itself to establish a consultation on the protection of the civil rights of European sportspeople, and how does it believe a consultative framework for sport should be established - both in general and in this kind of matter?"
"Does the Commission also take the view that this consultation must by definition be mutual?"
"Mr President, the oral question about further steps to be taken following the Declaration of the Sports Ministers of the European Union at their meeting in Biarritz in November 2008 is justified."
"Dynamic changes in society are being accompanied by changes in sport."
"Increasing numbers of problems in contemporary sport remain unanswered, and there is no reaction from employers."
"We are going through a specific crisis in sport. Among other things, doping and trade in youngsters are on the increase."
"Treating sportspeople, especially youngsters, as if they were goods to be traded denies them the opportunity to continue a career outside sport as adults."
"The Ministers rightly call for young men and women athletes to be given access to a dual curriculum of education and sports, and for efforts to provide the relevant facilities and structures to be increased."
"The proposed improvements relating to competition among young sportspeople are good, but they must not cause the exclusion of other sportspeople whose performance is better."
"There are, therefore, a considerable number of threats and doubts."
"The threats have a global character, and so reasonable coordination by the Community in the form of consultative frameworks is acceptable, as long as it is not compulsory."
"There always remains, however, a question about details."
"Referring directly to the second part of the oral question it can be said that all top-down, institutional coordination seems to supplant national governments."
"We must not succumb to that temptation."
"- (NL) Mr President, UEFA President Michel Platini recently presented to the European Parliament excellent proposals for curbing the scourge of trafficking in youngsters in football."
"There is a clear link with the question tabled by Mrs Batzeli."
"The UEFA proposal is clear: end international transfers of young players, of children under 18 years of age."
"Of course, this is a delicate matter, as many see it as an infringement of freedom of movement in Europe."
"The question is which interest and which principle prevails here."
"The answer, we all agree, is proper training for young people and children both at school and in sports clubs."
"Trafficking young children, sometimes from one side of Europe to the other, either with or without their family, cannot be conducive to a balanced upbringing."
"Hence my question to the Commissioner: do you intend to take up the defence of this UEFA proposal, and do you also mean to start up a dialogue on the subject with stakeholders - players, clubs, leagues and federations - in the short term?"
"I have a second question, too: it concerns the 'six-plus-five' rule, which is also intended to protect young players and to encourage clubs to invest more in training their own youth."
"The German Institute for European Affairs (INEA), a research institute, recently carried out a study on this at the request of FIFA and found that six-plus-five is indeed acceptable and compatible with European law."
"Commissioner Figel', what is your view on this?"
"We should also like for you, for the European Union, to enter into dialogue on this with the sports governing bodies in the light of the specific nature of football on which we all agree, and also, of course, looking ahead to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"- Mr President, I thank the Commissioner very much indeed for his opening statement."
"What everyone is asking about is legal certainty."
"I have a couple of questions based on that and also one on the Treaty of Lisbon, should it be ratified."
"As a good Conservative Euro-sceptic, I should say that I hope it never is."
"But I was just wondering, what will this mean - if it is ratified - for sporting organisations and governing bodies?"
"Many of these governing bodies believe that it will recognise concretely their specificity, the specificity of sport."
"So, Commissioner, could you tell us how this recognition in the new Treaty will help sport?"
"Will sport then get derogations from different aspects, like employment law or other laws, that they actually want to try and achieve?"
"On legal certainty, there are so many questions that the Commission should and could be helping sporting organisations with now."
"Should companies from overseas be investing huge amounts of money into sporting clubs within Europe?"
"I have no problem with this."
"I actually see it as direct inward investment and, therefore, a very positive thing."
"But sporting organisations and many governing bodies think this is a bad thing."
"So, what is your interpretation of a sporting organisation banning such a practice?"
"As my colleague, Mr Belet, said, UEFA is currently proposing to ban transfers of under-18s across borders."
"European law recognises a worker as someone essentially with the minimum age of 16, so what happens when a 17-year old challenges the fact that he was not able to move to a big club in a country that was not his own, in the current situation that we find ourselves in?"
"Home-grown players; 'six plus five' with FIFA: what is the clarification of those two points?"
"Also, football is always very interested in these subjects and it seems to drive the agenda."
"However, all of these matters actually affect polo and rugby union and table tennis players - all sports are affected."
"Are we looking at a wider range of sports?"
"Will the Commission actually open up a forum where sport can come and talk to the Commission openly about some of the problems it has and get some of these questions answered on a regular basis - no matter with the Treaty of Lisbon or without?"
"- Commissioner, you have the floor - bearing in mind that we have had many questions, but there actually only two on the oral question."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, that is true."
"Usually questions are easier than answers and usually there are more questions than answers, but I believe that together we can find more and better answers."
"This is all about cooperation, not only between Parliament and the Commission, but especially with the world of sport associations, federations, Member States and stakeholders."
"If they are responsible and responsive they come together and look for solutions which are acceptable and compatible with the law."
"Otherwise we adapt and change the law, whether at national or European level."
"So that is how we should proceed."
"I look forward to maintaining this approach."
"I think much has changed since 2007."
"I do not want to repeat myself or to once again recommend reading the white paper."
"There is a shorter version and also a version with annexes."
"The first time we tried, we put together descriptions of all cases and all decisions related to sport, which made a kind of map showing how sport relates to European Community law or policies."
"Of course we are proposing further guidelines."
"We have proposed - and in Biarritz I introduced - physical activity guidelines, which could help to promote the volume, intensity and quality of physical education training in our societies and especially in schools."
"It should be adopted by the Council of Health Ministers."
"We do not have a Sports Ministers' Council, but in fact the main reason is that it is related to public health."
"We cannot have one large specific set of guidelines for everything."
"I have said that we can address specific concrete issues theme by theme rather than case by case."
"Next I hope we can deal with licensing - how to make a more transparent and more sustainable system and create a set of principles for our licensing policies."
"Of course UEFA or its partners should have the concrete responsibility for this, but we can help."
"It is in our interest to promote principles such as self-regulation, transparency and sustainability, and we can make several other important contributions to improvements in licensing."
"We will support the Anti-Doping Conference."
"This offers a great opportunity to say much more on this, but I am against the establishment of another agency or a European WADA."
"I have also said publicly that there is NADAS, the European network of cooperation between national anti-doping agencies in our countries, whether they are public or private."
"Europe needs to be more active and more united."
"There are lessons to be learned from WADA and we should do so quickly."
"There are disputes."
"We have spoken to Ms Bozkurt about this code of conduct."
"Today I saw on television Sepp Blatter and John Fahey, the Chairman of WADA, discussing how anti-doping and football competitions could go hand in hand after the code of conduct has been adopted, and there is a problem."
"So on anti-doping I think we need more internal cooperation in order to make Europe more credible."
"We have the Council of Europe, we have a convention on this."
"We have many reasons to be more coherent in our contribution to the world of anti-doping or a world which fights more efficiently against doping."
"You have said that dialogue is not easy in this area - I mean not just regarding anti-doping but sport issues in general."
"It is true that sometimes it is difficult, even at international and Europe level or between different disciplines or segments, but I can assure you that a culture of dialogue and openness and a readiness to engage in dialogue is growing."
"I took part in the opening of the EOC office in Brussels, which is very close to Rond Point Schuman and to the Commission, Council and Parliament."
"This means the permanent presence of the European Olympic Committees and the IOC in the European institutions for the purpose of dialogue and cooperation."
"It says something about the importance of this and the mutual readiness to work in dialogue to find solutions."
"With regard to international transfers, I am also in favour of the protection of youngsters and the promotion of training and education."
"In 2001 we adopted decisions or agreements on international transfers."
"The general age level is about 18 years, but in Europe there is a specific arrangement for the period between 16 and 18 years of age."
"Unless severe or very critical problems become evident, we do not need to change but rather to promote better and more training and to work with talent in Europe."
"That is why, for example, we supported the home-grown player rule because this mainly promotes this sort of treatment."
"Of course it is not an absolute rule but it concerns specific arrangements."
"We give preference to, or promote, specificity under certain rules."
"We have said that we will come back to this decision in five years' time to see what the real impact has been - not just the theory - of this new rule."
"'Six plus five', as it stands now, is simply non-compatible with EU laws, as has been shown in a study."
"We have spoken to them and have read the papers but there is nothing new there."
"In substance we cannot say that we agree with the study."
"But I have to say that dialogue - especially following recent events in Biarritz and Lausanne - is real and very concrete between the European Commission and its partners, including FIFA."
"On this specific matter of 'six plus five' we will continue further. Even FIFA says that there is no reason for a hurried approach but rather a need for very concrete and credible answers."
"They do not want to get into formal disputes."
"We agreed to make room for more expertise and for more exchange."
"I think that is very beneficial."
"On the Lisbon Treaty and the recognition of specificity, two special clauses are included in Article 149 of the Treaty on European Union regarding education, youth and sport."
"It also concerns the level of competence."
"This is only supportive action so the Union will not have any power to decide but only to support Member States in the promotion of the integrity of sportsmen and sportswomen."
"It could be helpful to organise a Sports Council as we have for education and youth, which will perhaps be the enlarged format."
"It could help to build the first EU sport policy and sport programme but will not mean a change of architecture or a general derogation."
"Theme-by-theme specificity, which is real and does not mean business as usual, must be defendable vis-Ã -vis the system or the European Court."
"My opinion only reflects the Commission's opinion."
"Our opinion is not the final one when it comes to explanation of European Union law."
"Especially in this area many issues are interlinked."
"We would like to promote an increased legal certainty, which is why we started the process."
"The white paper is there and the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan helps to make it more readable and more concrete but it is a process."
"With the Treaty we can help even more but, without it, we will have to stay only at the level we have reached now."
"I spoke about transfers under 18 years of age."
"With regard to this, FIFA made a very good decision, not only on transfers but on the promotion and protection of minors in sport - in football - and I think this is the right approach."
"So in some areas UEFA sets a good example, for instance concerning home-grown players, and in some areas FIFA sets a good example, for instance concerning the protection of minors."
"I think we can help both and it is important that this is also compatible within the world of football."
"Last but not least - and I am sorry to have given a long answer - with regard to a forum on sport, which Mr Heaton-Harris mentioned, we have actually established this."
"In Biarritz we had a ministerial conference with major partners, but before that there was a forum with more than 200 stakeholders from very different areas of sport."
"It was a very positive, communicative and open forum and we want to continue with this."
"I believe that, under the Swedish, or especially under the Spanish, Presidency, we can hold another one to reflect on the progress we have made and to make a commitment to go further."
"That is where I was when I started answering the questions - working together in a transparent, regular and credible manner."
"If that is the case, Europe is a leading area where sport is protected and promoted, and where we fight against negative phenomena such as doping, corruption, violence and racism around sport."
"I would like to invite you to share this approach because we do not have a better one."
"We do not want to impose anything again but rather to propose, protect and support."
"That is my answer."
"- The debate is closed."
"Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (debate)"
"- The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the negotiations taking place in May 2009 under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) on the conditions for the entry into force of the Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships by Johannes Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - B6-0224/2009)."
"author. - (NL) Mr President, back in the plenary of May last year, the European Parliament took a clear stance against the humanly degrading and environmentally destructive situations involved in the dismantling of ships."
"Yet, on various shores in South Asia, enormous seagoing ships for scrapping are still being dismantled under conditions that are both environmentally damaging and humanly degrading."
"In Bangladesh, for example, not one of the 36 dismantling sites complies with minimum environmental and safety standards."
"One good thing is that, for this reason, the High Court ordered the Government of Bangladesh a week ago to close these 'dismantling yards' within two weeks."
"At the same time, the same High Court banned all ships containing hazardous substances from entering Bangladeshi territory."
"In addition, the Bangladeshi Minister for the Environment has three months to lay down rules, complying with the Basel Convention, for the recycling of ships for scrapping."
"These are the very same important measures advocated by the European Parliament in last year's resolution."
"One could almost be forgiven for thinking that the Bangladeshi High Court had read our resolution."
"I see this ruling as an important victory in the fight against the unacceptable practices mentioned earlier."
"It is essential that the Government of Bangladesh duly follow up on the court rulings."
"This goes not only for Bangladesh but also for other Asian countries."
"I have already remarked that the efforts of individual states will not suffice."
"A global solution to the problem of ship dismantling is still urgently needed."
"In May of this year, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is holding a global conference in Hong Kong, the aim of which is to conclude a global agreement on the recycling of ships for scrapping."
"The resolution by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety must ensure that a clear signal is sent to the Council and the Commission for the negotiations, with the objective of achieving the best possible result."
"With regard to last year's resolution, it is important to add the following five points."
"Firstly, it must be made clear that ships for scrapping that incorporate hazardous substances should be regarded as hazardous waste and hence should fall under the Basel Convention."
"Continuing to debate the definitions is not in the interests of environmental protection."
"Amendment 1, proposed by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, weakens this position somewhat, and thus I cannot support it."
"Secondly, running ships aground for on-site dismantling must be regarded as unacceptable."
"Thirdly, there is a need to take measures - particularly on the phasing out of single-hull tankers - before the end of the lengthy ratification period."
"Fourthly, certification of dismantling yards is to be welcomed."
"Fifthly, the measures should continue to include a mandatory fund within the framework of producer responsibility - as the European Parliament stated last year."
"However, the European Commission appears to be reconsidering this position."
"I should therefore like to hear Commissioner Figel' tell us that the Commission is still prepared to set up a scrapping fund."
"With this resolution, in combination with last year's, the European Parliament is charting a clear course towards a solution to the problems referred to."
"I welcome the high level of agreement on this issue in the Committee on the Environment and the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"It is my hope that the Council and the Commission will make an equally concerted effort to conclude a sound convention in Hong Kong in two months' time, one that safeguards the interests of safety, public health and the environment well."
"I should like Commissioner Figel' to tell us whether the European Commission will be using this clear course as a key asset in the negotiations at the IMO conference, and also what measures the Commission means to take to ensure timely implementation of the convention to be concluded."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Parliament for the very strong interest it has expressed and its continuous involvement with regard to ship dismantling."
"I would especially like to thank Mr Blokland."
"This is a very good starting point for further action at EU level to ensure that the European Union plays its part in solving this international problem."
"These questions are also timely, in the light of the recent ruling of the Bangladeshi High Court that you have just mentioned and the situation in that country."
"As a consequence of this ruling, all ship recycling yards will be closed within two weeks as they have not been authorised by the Ministry of the Environment."
"The import of dangerous ships that are on a list will be banned and all imported ships will have to be pre-cleaned."
"Finally, Bangladesh will start developing a national law on ship breaking in line with the Basel Convention."
"Now, let me turn to the situation closer to home by answering your questions."
"Your first question concerns the phasing-out of the beaching method - the method of dismantling end-of-life vessels directly on the beach."
"I share your concerns about the serious risks this presents to human health and the environment."
"We considered the question of introducing an EU ban on beaching in the impact assessment of our strategy."
"There were some concerns regarding the effectiveness of any such ban since it would be only applicable to EU-flagged ships and could be easily and legally circumvented by changing flag."
"We believe it will be more effective to put our efforts into ensuring that the technical guidelines currently being developed to support the future IMO Convention really do lead to safe and environmentally sound ship recycling."
"The progress in the development of these guidelines is, so far, very encouraging."
"It is very doubtful in any case that the traditional beaching method would be able to comply with the forthcoming guidelines."
"And, regarding your second question, I am pleased to confirm that the Commission is fully committed to working towards an effective and early transposition of the Ship Recycling Convention into EU legislation."
"The Environment DG has already launched several studies and is working on assessing the impacts of the key elements of the Convention."
"I believe that it is extremely important for the European Union to show leadership and the high priority that we attach to this issue."
"This will encourage the ratification by third countries and consequently speed up the entry into force of this convention."
"But I share the concerns highlighted in your third question regarding the importance of not undermining the existing Community acquis."
"We need to safeguard the existing requirements in terms of workers' rights and environmental protection when transposing the IMO Convention."
"And in our study, we will therefore carefully compare the requirements of the IMO Convention with our Community acquis."
"And I would like to stress that we will, in particular, ensure that the 2006 Waste Shipment Regulation is not undermined."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, this question, as explained by Mr Blokland, is very timely, given the diplomatic conference on the convention for the recycling of ships, to be held in May."
"I would therefore like to congratulate Mr Blokland not only on the question but also on the resolution that he has drawn up."
"In the Partido Popular, we are in favour of combating the bad practices and methods in use in relation to the scrapping of ships and we therefore support Mr Blokland's motion for a resolution; there are, however, certain points that worry us."
"The first is paragraph 3 - to which Mr Blokland himself has also already referred - which states that ships should be considered in their entirety as hazardous waste and should therefore fall within the scope of the Basel Convention."
"We have tabled an amendment on this paragraph, because there are differing interpretations, both within and outside and European Union, and we believe that the Basel Convention should be taken into account and that there should be no conflict with it."
"It ought to be the future international agreement on the scrapping of ships, however, that defines the details of its application."
"Paragraph 14 of the motion for a resolution also calls for a funding mechanism that is based on mandatory contributions from the maritime transport sector."
"It really seems to us a little premature to be talking at the moment about mandatory contributions when there has so far been no decision, within the International Maritime Organization, as to what the system is to be that is to be adopted through this funding, and it seems to me that the European Commission does not have a clear response on this subject either."
"Finally, in paragraph 15 there is a call for the Commission to establish clearly that the state with jurisdiction over waste is the responsible state."
"We do not believe that this is a matter for the Commission to decide; on the contrary, we think that this ought also to be decided in an international agreement."
"What is important is to safeguard consistency between the future agreement on the recycling of ships and the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, while taking into account not only the Basel Convention but also all the existing legislation."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for the comments both from Ms Ayuso and Mr Blokland, and especially for the latter's committed work."
"As I said before, especially regarding waste or hazardous waste, here we need to ensure that implementation of the Convention will be fully in line with Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 on shipments of waste, which was adopted relatively recently."
"Regarding funding, there is no fund or mechanism for the time being."
"We have launched a study in order to prepare the potential options or solution, and we will soon start public consultations on this issue."
"So your comments, now and then, will be very welcome, particularly on the establishment of the dismantling fund."
"- The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 26 March 2009."
"White Paper on damages actions for breach of the EC antitrust rules (debate)"
"- The next item is the report by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the White Paper on damages actions for breach of the EC antitrust rules -."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first may I thank the shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr SÃ¡nchez Presedo on behalf of the socialists and Mrs Bowles on behalf of the liberals, who worked very successfully with me on the compromise text being tabled today as a report on the Commission's White Paper."
"We have managed this time to achieve a very large, cross-group majority and a really viable compromise, which can also be used as a guideline for future work by the European Commission and later, during the law-making process, by Parliament and the Council."
"We have made clear in this report - and rightly so - that, where competition rules are infringed, Parliament stands by the view that, according to the European tradition, it is primarily the task of the authorities - both the national competition authorities and the European competition authority - to take action and that this is not creating a second arm, as it were, on an equal footing with official action in the fight against cartels."
"We have deliberately chosen a different path in Europe from the US, with which the situation is often compared."
"There is political consensus in the House that we need a solution for so-called mass claims."
"If the illegal conduct of individuals damages a very large number of persons who suffer comparatively minor losses, then a separate solution is needed for such proceedings, for which normal procedural law is simply not effective enough."
"The creation of such an instrument is also part of providing access to law and further developing the internal market."
"On this we are agreed."
"There was also consensus that we do not want a litigation industry to develop in Europe as it has in America, with turnover of USD 240 billion, which is ultimately of no advantage to consumers and, as we all know from simply reading the relevant books, mainly profits American law firms."
"None of this has much to do with the rule of law, nor do we want it to."
"We agreed that the procedural torture instruments of the American system should not be adopted in Europe."
"This applies in particular to the taking of evidence and costs."
"That is a very important point."
"We also agreed that we were basically of the opinion that, from a point of view of principle, legislation at European level can only be an opt-in solution and that an opt-out solution would only be permissible here where the Member States already have a similar solution and national constitutional law so allows."
"An opt in is not allowed under every country's national constitutional law and it also contradicts the principle of the adult consumer."
"As we insistently complain, the European Commission has completely forgotten to deal with the question of out-of-court settlements in its White Paper."
"The Directorate-General on Competition and the Commission have gone straight for litigation."
"However, as we have known for years from the debate in this House on legal policy, that is not always the ideal way forward and, as a rule, out-of-court settlement mechanisms are often much more suitable for resolving problems."
"Moreover, parallel work by the Directorate-General on Consumer Protection on the same issue has progressed much further."
"This Directorate-General used a broad margin for these alternative settlement instruments in its Green Paper, which is one consultation stage before this."
"We are convinced that the European Commission urgently needs to rework this question."
"One last point, which is also crucial: we do not want fragmentation of the law."
"Now competition law is going off and creating such an instrument."
"Consumer protection is coming along on the same issue."
"We know that at some point something similar will be considered in relation to capital market law, environmental law and social law."
"We consider it absolutely necessary for a horizontal approach to be considered as well and for us at least to support the procedural instruments which are more or less the same in all areas with a horizontal instrument."
"That is also of decisive importance."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome, on behalf of the Commission, Mr Lehne's report, adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and adopted as a sign of strong consensus across the political groups."
"We are also pleased that this report strongly supports the white paper."
"The Commission notes that the report agrees with the findings of this paper, that victims of European Community competition law infringements currently face considerable difficulties in claiming compensation for the harm suffered by them."
"We agree that measures must be taken to ensure full compensation of those victims."
"We also share the view that collective redress is crucial for consumers and small businesses in order to give them a realistic and efficient possibility to obtain compensation in cases of scattered damage."
"The Commission also fully agrees with the ECON Committee report, that excessive or abusive litigation must be avoided."
"To this end, therefore, collective redress mechanisms must include appropriate safeguards."
"Finally, we fully agree that its approach to collective redress must be consistent and that compatibility must, therefore, be ensured between initiatives targeted at various areas, such as competition law or consumer protection laws."
"At the same time, the Commission welcomes the acknowledgement that a consistent approach to collective redress does not necessarily mean that all areas would have to be dealt with in one single horizontal instrument."
"The call for consistency must not unduly delay the development of measures identified as necessary for the full enforcement of the European Community competition law."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (RO) The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has formulated its position based on a certain reality: the negative effects resulting from the breach of antitrust legislation can be felt economically very often at the end of the commercial chain, affecting end consumers and small enterprises."
"In this case, damages for the losses suffered are important but, at the same time, they are difficult to obtain, as many have been affected and small sums are involved."
"As a result, we have requested a package of legislative and non-legislative measures to provide the tool which all European citizens affected by such a situation can use to defend their right to full, proper damages."
"We support all measures designed to eliminate difficulties in achieving this objective: facilitating access to documents, reducing the costs of legal procedures and reversing the burden of proof."
"We welcome the Commission's proposal to combine representative actions brought by qualified entities with collective actions, with explicit agreement expressed."
"However, we consider that 'opt-out' collective actions must continue to be discussed, given the benefit they provide: a 'once and for all' settlement and less uncertainty."
"Although the EU Treaty clearly prohibits cartels and other infringements of competition law, it is still difficult for affected consumers in the European Community to claim their rights to compensation."
"In Romania, for example, a cartel set up in the cement industry was recently fined several million euro."
"However, the current legislation in force does not oblige authorities with the powers to monitor competition to get involved in compensation for victims."
"I would like to stress the need for these authorities to take into consideration the compensation paid or which should be paid when they calculate the fines imposed on companies which are found guilty of abuses, so as to prevent discrepancies between the harm caused and the punitive measures applied, and especially to ensure damages are paid to those affected by such practices."
"This is why I welcome the Commission's intention to improve the methods for guaranteeing the rights of consumers affected by infringement of the law throughout Europe."
"Parliament stated very clearly that there must not be any 'opt-out' system in Europe."
"Therefore, the victims must be identified as quickly as possible at the time a complaint is made."
"The 'opt-in' system guarantees that victims affected by the infringement of competition law will actually be compensated."
"Parliament does not want anyone else, be it lawyers, trade associations or the Consumer Protection Office, to benefit as a result of private actions."
"I also believe that Parliament is adding a new important element which the Commission's proposal has omitted."
"Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms are in many cases much more effective for victims who are entitled to compensation than judicial procedures."
"I am referring to the fact that at the time when compensation is being sought, settlements must be initiated first of all outside the courts."
"They are much less costly than private actions as consumers will be compensated for the losses suffered much more quickly."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report has been approved unanimously in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Not only is this an excellent outcome, but also, given the difficult, complex and controversial nature of the issues in question, it is an exceptional one, which should give impetus to and solidly cement the new pillar of private actions, which is vital in making the policy of Community competence effective."
"This is a new step in the direction of a more advanced and effective policy of responsibilities, which will be more respectful of the rights of victims and more effective in imposing liability on the infringer."
"I would therefore like, firstly, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, who has had the principal responsibility for bringing this task to a successful conclusion."
"The quality of his ideas, his open spirit and readiness to engage in dialogue, and his intelligence in extracting the best compromises have been vital in achieving this."
"I would like to extend my congratulations to the draftsmen of opinions, the shadow rapporteurs and those who tabled amendments, who have made such a positive contribution to enriching the report."
"The Commission's White Paper entitled 'Damages actions for breach of the EC antitrust rules' is a response to a request made by the European Parliament in its resolution on the Green Paper, the content of which it accepts in large part."
"This is the case when, among other aspects, it endorses the complementary nature of public and private legal actions, and positions itself in favour of group actions, although avoiding the excess of US class actions, thus facilitating the claiming of damages; when it proposes access to relevant information under judicial control, although avoiding a fishing expedition, and when it recognises and calls for the bringing of independent actions or follow-up actions and a voluntary compensation system."
"The report stands up for codecision by the European Parliament in the establishment of the legal framework for the bringing of damages actions for breach of EC antitrust rules."
"This position should not be understood as a denial of the policy of Community competence as a legal basis for the legislation, but as an upgrading of the requirements of the ordinary procedure in this sphere, to meet the higher values recognised in the Treaty."
"When a regulation has a significant effect on a fundamental right, such as the right of citizens to effective legal protection - which forms part of the European system and that of the Member States - the democratic principle and respect for national legal traditions - which require that such matters may only be regulated by means of provisions at the legal level, or, in other words, with action by the direct representatives of the public - demands the legislative participation of the European Parliament."
"It also establishes a horizontal, integrated approach for tackling the shared problems which the bringing of private legal actions within competition law may have with other realms, thus avoiding a fragmented, inconsistent approach."
"Private legal actions may be brought by a public body and also by individual or group actions."
"This second arrangement may be carried out directly by the victims or indirectly, through qualified entities, whether appointed in advance or designated ad hoc, such as consumer or business associations."
"Where actions are brought by qualified entities, the group of victims must be defined in the submission of the application, but the identification of each one can be done later on, although it must be clearly established as soon as possible, avoiding unnecessary delays and complying with the existing legislation."
"This solution is very important for cases of lower and fragmented damages."
"The report raises in a balanced way the question of access to the information necessary for bringing follow-up actions."
"The protection of business secrets should be safeguarded, as should the effectiveness of clemency programmes, for which guidelines are requested."
"Conditions are set so that the decisions taken by an authority which is a member of the Community competition authorities network can become binding in another Member State and so that, with full compliance with the principle of liability, the burden of proof is reversed and it is presumed that fault or blame exist when the existence of a breach has been established."
"It is also worth highlighting the acceptance of the 'passing-on' defence for indirect victims and a system that simplifies and reduces the costs of proceedings."
"I would also like to emphasise the positive interaction between public and private actions, both in incentivising compensation for victims and in establishing the five-year period for the bringing of actions."
"I would like to end by expressing my gratitude to the Commission for the dialogue that has been maintained throughout this procedure and by asking the Commissioner to submit without delay the initiatives required for its developments."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Lehne for his report and to confirm that my group will be supporting that report."
"I would also like to say that I find it a little odd that we are having this debate late at night when we have a question on the same subject tabled for tomorrow morning."
"It would have made a great deal of sense to have put both together."
"However, in complimenting the report, let me say that my group's starting point will be 'doing justice' - doing justice for SMEs and consumers across the European Union, where they have to face inappropriate and anti-competitive action."
"A few weeks ago my group organised a seminar at Parliament in Brussels, and I was very struck by certain of our visitors who were at the sharp end of such anti-competitive action, ironically in the cement industry."
"What did they say?"
"Please, please, get on with this: we need something that will allow us to pursue these inappropriate operators in the European market."
"We want a European solution, and we want it sooner rather than later, because, if we do not get it, my forecast and my warning is this: some of our Member States will develop systems that will lead to forum shopping as a result of free movement of judgements."
"So, please - a European system as soon as possible."
"- I shall make sure that your point concerning the agenda is communicated to the Conference of Presidents, which fixes the agenda - sometimes it makes mistakes."
"Mr President, the internal market is the EU's absolute greatest contribution to freedom and prosperity in Europe."
"Among other things, it requires effective antitrust legislation."
"What we are now considering is the issue of damages actions for breach of antitrust rules."
"There are good fundamental reasons for citizens and companies to be able to claim damages."
"Mr Lehne's report indicates, to some extent unintentionally, the problems and the risks involved."
"The white paper talks of a European legal culture, but this does not exist."
"We should not create regulations based on wishful thinking."
"The rapporteur intends us to avoid an 'Americanised' compensation culture."
"This is also wishful thinking."
"On the contrary, the risks of such a culture occurring are high."
"The division of responsibility between the EU institutions and the Member States has been ignored."
"There is no objective analysis of what is required by the subsidiarity principle."
"The principle is quite simply not taken seriously."
"There are also many other unclear points and points that are at risk of being completely arbitrary."
"Paragraphs 7 and 11 together instil a sense of misgiving."
"An obvious starting point must be damages actions on the basis of a breach of antitrust rules."
"It requires the crime to have been established in court, after which res judicata would presumably have to apply, even in the context of an individual claim, so that judgments relating to a single case cannot be revisited."
"Paragraphs 15 and 18 together allow the plaintiff to choose the legal system that is most favourable."
"This creates legal uncertainty and will result in 'forum shopping', which will be a real threat."
"The information asymmetry is to be reduced by forcing companies to provide information to the plaintiff."
"This will result in the subjective handling of important business information, which can be misused."
"There are far too many risks and points that are unclear at this stage."
"The Chamber should therefore reject this report and request a more detailed analysis of the issue before we take a decision."
"- (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first a very big thank you to the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, who has done a magnificent job and has found appropriate solutions to a very difficult question in agreement with the Members from the other groups."
"I see from the debate that we are all agreed that we need a horizontal approach for all collective claims and I therefore ask the Commission not to table separate proposals by individual Directorates General for each separate area, but at best to give us a truly collective legal redress mechanism covering all areas for the European internal market and for European citizens and of course - as Mrs Wallis said - for European SMEs."
"We are united in the thought that the interests of those damaged by a cartel must be effectively upheld and that we must subject the European economy to cartel control in accordance with the principle of the social market economy."
"Nor do we want any abuse of the various national regulations in the form of forum shopping."
"However, this evening's debate has not afforded me very much information on the most effective way of achieving this, because I believe that the potential of collective claims is often overestimated."
"That is why it is important to lay down again certain benchmarks against which we have to measure all collective claim procedures. We must answer the question of whether additional legal protection for consumers or victims in mass claims, cross-border litigation and litigation which affects more than one Member State really is necessary."
"We must allow for the Member States' procedural constraints - opt out, opt in and numerous other points - in the European procedure."
"If this is simply not possible, as the Commission itself has already partially conceded, then we need the Member States' legal instruments on board and a common procedure with the Member States' parliaments in order to serve the interests of European consumers."
"We definitely want to avoid collective claims in Europe along the lines of the US model."
"We want to ensure that compensation is awarded, but only to those who actually sustained losses."
"We want to advise as emphatically as possible against unjustified claims and we want to promote alternative settlement procedures."
"- (SV) Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mr Lehne for a constructive and thorough report, which addresses important issues within competition law and increases consumer protection."
"The European Court of Justice grants individuals and companies the right to damages for breaches of the competition rules, but in spite of that fact the reality is that individuals who have suffered loss as a result of a breach of EC antitrust rules rarely receive compensation."
"We must therefore create mechanisms that increase trust and make it easier for individuals to be able to assert their rights across borders."
"We know that consumers and small businesses are frightened of instigating proceedings because of concern about long drawn-out processes and, in particular, high costs."
"Changes in this regard will promote cross-border trade."
"If we are to have a functioning internal market throughout the EU where people can rely on their case being examined in a legally certain manner and on receiving full compensation for the damages caused, in other words the loss, we must also find new mechanisms to facilitate group claims."
"When we talk about group claims, the subject of the US and its experiences and extremes always comes up."
"We must, of course, learn from this, but we should not allow ourselves to be intimidated."
"Europe must have a European system, not an American one."
"If we do nothing the situation will only get worse."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you all for very interesting contributions, especially the introductory exposÃ© of Klaus-Heiner Lehne."
"This was very interesting, and I now see why you are so consensual and working not only together in committee but also in plenary on these issues."
"There is not much I can add, except perhaps on the legal bases."
"Of course it depends on the objectives and the content of the action proposed, and I want to assure you, as a Commissioner - for another portfolio, perhaps, but I speak on behalf of the Commission - that, in principle, we seek very close cooperation with Parliament."
"How to establish this with regard to a practical, concrete item or issue remains to be seen, but we will strive for close cooperation or as close cooperation with Parliament as is possible under the applicable legal basis."
"On what you have said about fragmentation and a horizontal approach, I think the answer from the Commission - and it is very visible in the white paper - is a consistent, coherent approach, and I think that the European legal tradition and the roots of our legal culture are different from the oft-quoted American ones."
"But I think that we can learn from the others and further build up our system."
"On public enforcement and justice, of course, I think it is very important that we are not going towards lessening this enforcement, and, of course, Articles 81 and 82 are very important pillars of the EU single market and policies."
"They are about justice, and damages actions are complementary to this law enforcement."
"Last - but maybe not least - what was said about out-of-court settlements."
"The Commission is in favour, but the precondition or the base for such an approach, which would be welcome, is an existing and functioning efficient litigation system on damages actions at the level of Member States."
"So I think we need to not only encourage but help our Member States so that such issues and systems are running in the EU of 27."
"Then I think we may also come to these points."
"But, in principle, thank you very much for what was, for me, too, a very interesting debate, and all the best."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, first may I thank my honourable friends for their very helpful contributions."
"I think that we all pulled together and achieved a good result."
"However, I also want to say quite clearly to the Commission, in order to avoid any misunderstanding: from Parliament's point of view, there is no question of your tabling a bill that is probably already fit for nothing."
"Absolutely no question."
"We expect the Commission to take account of what we have decided today and for it to be included in the actual legislation proposed."
"The horizontal approach is not only an important aspect on the basis of the arguments which I expounded earlier; the Commissioner personally also addressed the question of the legal basis."
"With such an important project, an approach must be chosen which ultimately guarantees that Parliament is involved as a legislator on an equal footing."
"If an approach based purely on competition law is chosen, that would not be the case under the Treaty of Nice currently in force."
"This is also a very fundamental political argument in favour of why we consider a horizontal approach to be the right one."
"I think the Commission should consider this very seriously."
"Another decisive point in my opinion is that we still need something on the question of out-of-court settlements."
"You spoke earlier of convergence with the work of the Directorate-General on Competition."
"However, if one compares the Green Paper on consumer protection with the White Paper on competition, one does not necessarily get the impression that there is really any such convergence."
"The most blatant example is the different treatment - or to be more exact the lack of treatment - of out-of-court settlement mechanisms in the White Paper."
"There is still a series of other problems which we expect to be resolved."
"I just want to refer briefly to the question of access to the European Commission's files."
"It is possible in all criminal proceedings in which compensation is being claimed to inspect the public prosecutor's case files."
"Why does this not apply to the European Commission?"
"It is beyond me."
"The same applies to the question of fixing penalties: this also needs to be taken into account from the point of view that it must be possible to claim compensation in future."
"Here too the Commission urgently needs to rework the text and table more specific texts and proposals than those included so far in the White Paper."
"May I say quite clearly from Parliament's point of view, in order to avoid any misunderstanding: we expect more than what is contained in the White Paper and we also expect the Directorate-General on Competition as a whole to follow our suggestions, otherwise there will be resistance in this House."
"- I should like to thank you all for your contributions on this important topic and also thank the Commissioner, the staff and the interpreters."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 26 March 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (ET) Parliament's report emphasises the usefulness of leniency programmes in exposing cartel agreements, and I am glad to be able to say here that a draft leniency programme is presently being discussed in the Estonian parliament."
"This should become an important part of the struggle against cartels, which is important both for the better functioning of the common market and in order to protect consumer rights, because consumer prices may rise as much as 25% due to cartel agreements."
"I do, however, believe that representative actions can also play an important role in the effective implementation of competition law and the improvement of consumer protection, and thus we must also devote attention to this, both at the Estonian and European Union levels."
"Research has proven that representative actions would significantly improve consumers' willingness to stand up for their rights, and in countries where consumer activeness is low because of the fear of the complexity and cost of such undertakings, measures such as representative actions are of crucial importance."

"Food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community (amendment of the Single CMO Regulation) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Sierkierski, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community - C6-0353/2008 -."
"Madam President, Commissioner, today we are discussing an extremely important subject - the programme of food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community."
"It is important because it concerns millions of people who live in poverty and need particular help."
"We support the proposal of the European Commission to increase the budget by two thirds, that is from EUR 305 million to nearly EUR 500 million annually, and to extend the range of products available under the programme."
"Of course, the programme will not solve the problems of malnutrition and poverty among the Community's citizens, but it will certainly help to ease these problems."
"We are against the proposal for the immediate introduction - I repeat, immediate introduction - of co-financing from national budgets, because this could limit or even exclude some countries from participation in the programme."
"Countries where the per capita income is low and where there are also budget problems would be especially concerned."
"This is all the more significant because of the current economic crisis."
"I believe that the Council will manage to work out a compromise in this matter."
"We also support the proposal that food products earmarked for distribution under the programme come from the European Union."
"As far as possible this should be fresh local food, and this will mean we will support home food producers by raising demand. We will also be sure that the food distributed is of the right quality."
"Much controversy has surrounded the legal basis of the programme."
"As we know, the Council's legal services challenged the opinion of the Commission."
"The Commissioner can count on the support of Parliament in this matter."
"I share the opinion of the Commission on setting clear priorities and long-term planning."
"Extending the programme for three years will help to make the expenditure of available resources more effective."
"By adopting the report Parliament will send a positive signal to our citizens."
"Since the EU gives aid to the poorest countries of Africa, and of course we support that, it must also remember its own citizens."
"The EU food programme for the poorest of the European Union, like the 'Fruit at School' and 'Milk at School' programmes, is changing attitudes towards the EU and the common agricultural policy, which have been so heavily criticised by many people."
"Our citizens should know that the food which they receive comes from EU programmes and from EU funds."
"The programme confirms that the EU feels responsible for its most needy citizens."
"This group includes particularly the homeless, families in difficulty, the unemployed, single parents, migrants, asylum seekers and people of advanced age or with limited resources."
"Often they are people with disabilities, or even children."
"It should be remembered that the transformations which have taken place in the countries which recently joined the EU have produced major stratification of income in their societies."
"What is more, in some of these countries disparities in income and living standards are growing all the time."
"Families living in small towns and inhabitants of villages are particularly affected by poverty."
"There are growing numbers of people who cannot afford the basic necessities of life."
"We have a kind of stalemate in the Council, where everyone is waiting for the opinion of Parliament, and I am convinced that adoption of my report will persuade the Czech Republic, which currently holds the presidency, to renew discussion and find a rational compromise in the Council."
"Let us hope that legislative work will finish in May or June this year."
"I would like to encourage those Member States which do not participate in the programme to join in. Finally, on behalf of the millions of inhabitants who benefit from the programme, the charitable organisations which distribute the food and on my own behalf I would like to thank all MEPs, and not only those who supported my report."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, before going into the content of this proposal, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Siekierski, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their work on this report."
"I would like to start by putting today's debate into context, because this proposal is not about paragraphs, political power or promises: it is about people."
"Millions of Europeans are hit by difficult economic times and by the rapid rise we have seen in food prices since 2007."
"There are more people than we realise for whom the lack of adequate food is a daily concern: 43 million Europeans cannot afford a meal with meat, chicken or fish every second day."
"I think that is a striking figure."
"The programme for the most deprived targets those in our society who are in need of food aid: people who worry whether they can feed their children tomorrow; people who do not think about what they will eat that night for dinner but about whether they will have anything to eat; people who enter no restaurant but the one carrying the name of Resto du CÅur."
"With more than 13 million poor people benefiting from the programme, with 19 Member States participating and with the scheme being a stable outlet for intervention products, this programme has certainly shown its value."
"Parliament recognised this already in 2006, when it called on the Council and the Commission to place the programme on a permanent footing for the future and to extend the distribution of foodstuffs, without restricting it to the products for which intervention applies."
"I am pleased to note that the report by Mr Siekierski endorses the Commission's approach and agrees that it is necessary to keep the programme within the common agricultural policy."
"This is particularly important at a time when some claim that feeding people has nothing to do with our agriculture policy."
"Until now, the programme has been financed exclusively by the Community budget."
"Our proposal now includes cofinancing."
"That is a significant change, but I believe it is a fundamental improvement of the scheme."
"Cofinancing will enable the total funds available for this measure to be more in balance with the real needs; it will encourage Member States to take greater responsibility for the programme's management, and it is also a way to strengthen the cohesive element, since cohesion countries will have less cofinancing."
"At the same time, I share the view that we should not run the risk of Member States withdrawing from the scheme."
"Therefore, we proposed a gradual phasing-in of cofinancing rates in order to maintain the difference between the cohesion and non-cohesion Member States."
"I agree that we should do more to guarantee the nutritional quality of the food distributed."
"As the rapporteur mentioned, this could mean including fresh produce, in most cases produced locally."
"But it is not appropriate to outlaw foreign products or products coming from outside the European Union, as proposed in your report."
"That would mean additional and burdensome controls."
"It could be seen as a signal of EU protectionism, and it could even be questioned by our WTO partners."
"That being said, the large majority of the food distributed will in reality be produced in the European Union, mainly from intervention stocks and most probably from the tenders that we are now making, in particular in the dairy sector."
"Given that charities are heavily involved in the scheme, our proposal gives the possibility to reimburse the transport and administrative costs of the NGOs."
"You suggest that storage costs should be covered as well."
"I am fundamentally in favour of this idea, but I cannot agree to your suggestion of leaving it to the Member States to fix the rates of reimbursement."
"We need to set the same maximum rate for all participating countries, not least to make sure that the programme remains efficient and keeps the focus on supplying food."
"Finally, let me stress that the Council is waiting for the outcome of today's debate and vote before continuing its discussions."
"I hope Ministers have used the waiting time constructively."
"And from today's debate should, therefore, be sent a clear message: do not forget those waiting in line at the soup kitchen or waiting for the next food package."
"So do not wait too long!"
"We need to put this food aid scheme on a permanent footing for the future."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (ES) Madam President, the present economic crisis throughout Europe will lead to an increase over the next few years in the number of people finding themselves under the poverty threshold."
"This number has already reached 80 million, in other words 16% of the world population."
"In the face of this crisis, it is of primary importance that we ensure continuity in the provision of food to those people most in need."
"The intervention stocks have so far been a useful tool both for providing the poorest people in the community with food, and at the same time ensuring stability in the prices received by European producers."
"However, these stocks are being progressively eliminated."
"It would seem fitting that the new aid programme for the poorest would also serve as an outlet for European Community produce."
"In this way, we would be helping to keep farmers in rural areas."
"The European Commission's proposal does not demand that the food involved in the programme be produced exclusively in the Community, since it considers that to be contrary to the rules of the World Trade Organisation."
"I would like to remind the Commission, however, that the United States devotes nothing more and nothing less than 67% of its agricultural budget to food programmes for the most disadvantaged, which also has the add-on benefit of preferentially helping its farmers and cattlemen."
"This percentage is in sharp contrast with the expenditure proposed in the new Community programme, which would equate to only 1% of the common agricultural policy (CAP) budget."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, wish to express my sincere thanks to Mr Siekierski for his report."
"I would be so bold as to say that he has produced an extremely good piece of work."
"For more than two decades the European Union has had a programme for food distribution to the most deprived people."
"Thus, in 2006, for example, it was possible to provide support to around 13 million people from 15 Member States by means of various aid measures."
"I believe this programme - and this is something that both the Commissioner and the rapporteur have already said - will play an important part in maintaining and promoting solidarity within our European community, because in my opinion the EU is, and remains, not only an economic common market, but also first and foremost a community of values and solidarity."
"Also in the context of a modern socio-environmental market economy with the three pillars of economy, environment and social affairs - all three being of equal importance so that all Member States can participate in this programme - I support the view of the rapporteur that, as previously, the programme should be funded 100% by the European Union."
"I would like to emphasise that, although it is important for us primarily to use products produced within the Community, it should not, where necessary, remain solely limited to these products."
"Finally, I would like to say that for me, personally, it goes without saying that we should help the poorest of the poor to the extent that we are able to do so."
"I very much hope that today, as the Commissioner said, a large majority will vote in favour of this report so that we can give a clear signal to the Council."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing I would like to do is to congratulate the rapporteur, with whom we have very similar views as regards this programme, and secondly to congratulate everyone involved, because in such a time of economic crisis, it is fundamental to maintain a programme like this, with obvious positive social effects."
"Although we are only involved in a consultation procedure, we must send out a clear political message from the European Parliament at this time of economic uncertainty."
"We must send a message from Brussels and Strasbourg, that we are not only or exclusively concerned with the recovery of the financial system, but that we are also fully aware of the need to develop our social policies, especially those which support the people most in need, the poorest in the European Union."
"We agree with the Commission that this food distribution programme should continue to be considered part of the common agricultural policy for several reasons: because European agriculture has a marked social dimension, because this programme is a tool that works, because now we need it more than ever, and because it has to continue operating."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, like the rapporteur, are against this programme being cofinanced by the European Union and its Member States, since that would mean discrimination between states according to their wealth, which could then lead to a situation whereby the programme could not be put into practice in the most disadvantaged countries."
"It is difficult to comprehend why, at a time when it is most needed, the Commission wants to save Community money from the CAPs most social facet, especially since there is a budgetary surplus every year in the agricultural budget."
"Full Community funding is fundamental for us."
"We need to ensure that this programme will reach out to all countries, and especially those most in need."
"The 43 million potential beneficiaries of this programme require that we make a huge effort and do not avoid budgetary expenditure under any circumstances."
"Austerity, yes, but not where the poorest people are concerned."
"This programme must cover the whole trajectory of the food distributed to ensure that it reaches citizens in all the Member States."
"In order to achieve this goal, we in the Socialist Group, for which I am the shadow rapporteur, have brought forward an amendment proposing that all expenditure arising from distribution, storage and administration be defrayed from Community finances."
"We also agree with the rapporteur that the food should be of high quality, and preferably sourced from the Community."
"This approach is in keeping with this Parliament's position on other similar programmes which we were recently discussing in the House, such as the plan to hand out fruit in the schools."
"Many thanks, that is all. We hope that the Commission will take into account the Parliament's position when it votes and, above all, we hope that it will put this plan into action within the Union as soon as possible."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by making it clear that the distribution of food to deprived people is, for me, not at issue in the forthcoming vote on the report by Mr Siekierski, particularly in these difficult economic times."
"I would therefore also like to make it clear at the outset that it was not easy to find a common line within our Group."
"I therefore respect the personal decision of any member of the Group to deviate from this and not to support our intended rejection of the report."
"Why am I unable to support the result of the committee vote as it stands?"
"There are a number of reasons for this, which have absolutely nothing to do with helping deprived people within the European Union in these difficult economic times."
"On the contrary, amendments tabled by my colleague Mr Busk on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, although unfortunately found not to be permissible, were intended to give the existing system a future-oriented foundation."
"The system in place up to now is an anachronism from the times of agricultural overproduction, which fortunately are now a thing of the past."
"Due to the successful decoupling of direct payments, the intervention stocks have been constantly decreasing in recent years, with the result that, today, up to 85% of the food has to be purchased on the free market."
"However, that has altered the fundamental nature of the programme and has resulted in the loss of the agricultural dimension to the programme."
"Since we are now dealing with a social programme, we need to create an appropriate legal basis for it."
"In this regard, we share the view of the Council's legal services that the only possible legal basis in place of Article 37 of the EC Treaty regarding the common agricultural policy is Article 308, as otherwise it would clearly constitute an encroachment on the national competences of the Member States."
"In view of the impermissible nature of our amendments, the only solution can be a new draft from the European Commission."
"The Commission should also take to heart the principle of co-financing, as whether or not such programmes are meaningful in the mind of everyone can only be satisfactorily assessed at local level."
"Madam President, in the European Union we are currently facing growing social stratification."
"We have millions of people living in poverty, and their number is rising all the time."
"This is happening in spite of the fact that the Socialists have been power in the Community and in many Member States for years, and they are said to be sensitive to poverty and inequality."
"The EU was itself supposed to be a region of general prosperity."
"Many people were naive and believed this, but the time for reflection has now come."
"We must help those people in Europe who cannot cope on their own with poverty and rejection."
"There are many such people in the old EU countries and many more in the new."
"Besides the destructive action of the economic crisis, we can also see the effects of the colonial approach in the past of the old EU countries towards enterprises and banks in the new Member States."
"Workplaces are still being destroyed, as for example the shipbuilding industry has been destroyed in Poland."
"Mr Siekierski's excellent report deals with how to distribute food to those most in need."
"I fully agree with him that the Community as a whole should finance aid for the deprived, and that the food should come exclusively from EU countries."
"The aid should reach orphanages, centres for the homeless and hungry children in schools, and should be distributed chiefly by local authorities, because they have the best information about what and how much is needed."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the food aid programme is essential today."
"As the rapporteur has written, in 2006 in the EU-25 alone 43 million people were undernourished and 79 million were threatened with poverty, which is more than 20% of the total population of the EU."
"The programme has helped one in six of the people in need."
"So the problem is serious, and the phenomenon of poverty has worsened further following recent enlargements of the EU."
"The statistics show that the programme only alleviates the problem of malnutrition but is not eliminating it."
"It is a programme which treats the effects but does not eliminate the causes."
"Is it not paradoxical that it is the inhabitants of country areas who are threatened by poverty and malnutrition?"
"Those who should be producing food are in need of food aid, but rather than this being their fault, it is the effect of policy."
"It is the effect of unsound agricultural policy, which causes the bankruptcy of family smallholdings and increases the number of people who need food aid."
"The sustainable European Model of Agriculture of 1997 is a propaganda myth."
"Family smallholdings were to be a key element in the model, but in fact it is the other way round."
"It is these farms which are excluded, although they make up at least 95% of all farms in the European Union."
"Is it not paradoxical that we give most of the money in agriculture to those whose production is expensive? To large animal farms which damage the environment, while farms which produce cheaply receive symbolic support?"
"EU trade policy exposes us to sudden price rises, and competition policy has led to a monopoly on sales and to overpricing."
"It is high time that these policies were changed."
"It is these policies which have made food expensive, and which are the reason why the number of poor and undernourished citizens of the EU is growing."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, the Lisbon Strategy is a great success in one area at least: the European Union has become one of the most competitive regions in the world where poverty creation is concerned."
"We have thus been able to create 80 million poor people and 43 million starving Europeans, a figure that includes the elderly, who may die quicker and reduce public spending as a result, meaning that the Maastricht criteria can be met more effectively."
"In France alone, 80 million meals are served each year by the charitable organisation Restos du CÅur."
"In order to feed the poor since 1987, we have had a food distribution programme with an annual budget of EUR 300 million."
"EUR 300 million divided by 80, divided by 12, comes to 25 cents of food distributed each month to each of the 80 million poor."
"This food was taken from the intervention stocks, but, since the 1992 reform, where the mountains of butter, the rivers of milk and the bulging refrigerators came up for criticism, these stocks have been used up."
"For 2010-2012, we shall be buying foodstuffs on the market, where non-European goods also appear, for the sake of the WTO and the fight against protectionism."
"This means that, since 1962, we have been feeding our herds of cattle imported oilseeds and, from 2010, we shall be feeding our poor imports, too."
"And all of this is cofinanced in the name of universality."
"The problem, however, Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen - the real problem - is that there are still 80 million poor people after 22 years of having a food programme."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Siekierski has done a great deal of work to produce this report and for this I would like to offer him my sincere thanks."
"I also share his view that a lot of people, particularly now during the economic crisis, are facing the threat of poverty."
"It would be an indictment of Europe if people here in Europe had to suffer hunger."
"However, I have to disagree with the impression given that food has become more expensive."
"That may be true in certain countries, but in Germany it is certainly not the case."
"Partly as a result of erroneous decisions at European level, the price of milk and butter, for example, is lower than it has been for a long time and it has reached a level that is threatening the existence of many farms."
"I have here some statistics which list the prices of food."
"In 1970, an industrial worker had to work for 243 minutes in order to be able to buy a kilogram of pork chops, a kilogram of beef, a kilogram of dark wheat and rye bread, ten eggs, 250 grams of butter, a kilogram of potatoes and a litre of milk; in 2008 he had to work only 82 minutes."
"This means he only required a third as much time in order to be able to afford this food."
"In the explanatory statement it is stated that in Germany alone 9 million people face the threat of poverty."
"A correction is also needed here."
"In Germany, every citizen, every person is entitled to minimum benefit from the state and therefore none of these 9 million people need suffer hunger."
"It is therefore important for the money that is made available here for food aid to be used in places in Europe where people are really facing the threat of hunger."
"It would be a disgrace for Europe if we did not rectify this."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate in which I should like to be taking part would be the one aiming to end all aid measures for the most deprived, due to these having become unnecessary."
"Unfortunately, this is not the case at the moment in Europe and the world."
"In the European Union, many families affected by unemployment or social exclusion have seen their incomes become inadequate to meet their most basic needs and, as a result, we owe them our solidarity."
"The Commission proposal that we are debating merits our approval, all the more so as we must now, as in the past, find yet another way of easily disposing of our surpluses."
"That is not the point today."
"It is even justified for the financial allocations for this programme to be increased."
"I also congratulate the Commission for proposing that this assistance should come from the agricultural budget."
"No group shows solidarity more than farmers and no communities are more involved in mutual aid than rural communities."
"I am sure that European farmers will take great pride in sharing part of the agricultural budget with those who are most in need."
"My political group will therefore reject the proposals of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which question the legal basis of this regulation."
"The Commission proposal can and must, however, be improved."
"The Siekierski report, and also the amendment that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will table in plenary, are good contributions which improve the proposal, particularly with regard to the eligibility of storage costs and the comprehensive Community financing of the programme."
"I therefore call on plenary to adopt this report and on the Commission to accept Parliament's contributions."
"(LT) The report on the amendment of the Council regulation on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community is being presented by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"However, I would like to stress that faced with the current financial and economic crisis, support for the Community's most deprived residents takes on a new - social policy - dimension."
"EU food aid is very important in a period of crisis, as the number of unemployed increases and the subsistence level falls."
"The number of unemployed in Lithuania this February was 16 times the number of jobs available."
"At present in Lithuania about 20% of residents are considered to be living in poverty."
"In 2006 in the European Union 13 million residents received food aid."
"It is forecast that in the nearest future 16% or 80 million EU residents will be living below the poverty level."
"Mr Siekierski's report proposes leaving the food aid programme funding procedures currently in force, only allocating funds from the EU Budget, and disapproving the European Commission's proposal to fund the programmes from the EU and Member State budgets."
"The Commission's proposal really does not match economic realities."
"For many of the EU's poorer countries, fighting the consequences of the crisis, it would be difficult to contribute to the funding of the food aid programme in the current period."
"Funding from the EU Budget meanwhile, as has been the case since 1987, would be effective support for poorer co-citizens, which would show true solidarity."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, finally people are realising that with the new agricultural policy the storehouses are empty and, what is more, all funds have been transferred to direct aid and now we are resorting to the budget to feed the hungry."
"Perhaps if we had used modulation to cream a bit more from those well-hidden persons who receive more than EUR 300 000 a year in direct aid, then today there would be more resources for our most deprived citizens."
"Perhaps if we were to decide what to set aside for the deprived before production takes place, we would spend far less than if we purchased it on the market and we would achieve a policy for supporting certain markets in crisis, such as the milk market."
"Perhaps if we could manage to use those products that are thrown away to rot because they are close to their expiry date or are left unsold on the general markets, we would kill two birds with one stone."
"I do not even want to imagine that behind a noble cause a big market in aid is growing, putting its hands in the pockets of European taxpayers in defiance of those poor devils who are dying of hunger."
"Madam President, feeding the hungry is a basic precept."
"We rightly talk about it in the context of third countries, but rarely acknowledge real hunger in Europe."
"However, gnawing hunger and severe malnutrition deficiencies, even without actual hunger, is a reality even in the most prosperous Member States."
"Hunger in the midst of plenty is, and has always been, a scandal, and, in this report, we are trying to improve schemes to address it more effectively."
"As an impoverished mother, I had reason to be grateful for the free milk given to families of young children in the 1970s in Ireland and for the low-cost milk my children received at school in the 1980s."
"I would like to add one suggestion though, but not within the CAP."
"As a result of some of the policies in the common fisheries policy, thousands of tonnes of edible fish are dumped dead over the sides of fishing boats around our coasts."
"It is time we ended this waste."
"We should land these so-called 'discards' and give the fish to those who need it but cannot afford high-quality protein."
"It would be very hard to find a better and more nourishing food."
"Commissioner, can you speak to the Commissioner for fisheries on the extension of this scheme to include fish?"
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wholeheartedly endorse the Siekierski report on a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions as regards food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community."
"This issue is all the more important given the financial crisis, the effects of which are being felt in the European economy."
"The European Parliament, recognising the pressing need to meet the food requirements of the most deprived, has urged the Commission and the Council to put the European food aid programme on a permanent footing."
"For the rest, ladies and gentlemen, last March, when adopting a resolution on rising prices in the EU and in developing countries, we in this House stated that the right to a sufficient and varied diet suitable for a healthy and active lifestyle is a fundamental right to be permanently guaranteed to all."
"I believe that the food distribution programme for the most deprived should continue to represent a significant element of the common agricultural policy, precisely because the CAP works by stabilising prices and thus protecting those on lower incomes from price fluctuations."
"I do not agree, however, with the co-financing percentages proposed in certain amendments, because they could lead some Member States to limit their participation in the programme."
"Therefore I reject those amendments aimed at altering the legal basis."
"I would emphasise that what is needed is complete funding by the European Union for the food aid programme; thus I am in favour of the adoption of the draft legislative resolution."
"Madam President, you have heard some diverging views around the House this morning on this issue."
"I congratulate, of course, Mr Siekierski."
"At a time of deepening economic recession and the tens of millions of people who are living in poverty and are hungry, of course, as a Parliament, we have to find ways of helping them and providing them with food aid."
"But, as the Commissioner pointed out, there are 19 participating Member States in this project."
"That means there are eight Member States not participating."
"The UK is one of them, and the reason is that they use their own social policy to provide aid for the poor."
"They withdrew from this scheme many years ago."
"The question that many Member States and the Commission are asking is: why are we using the CAP to finance social policy?"
"This used to be perfectly OK when we had massive surpluses - milk lakes, butter mountains and beef mountains - and were required to distribute this food to the poor, using the CAP budget to finance that distribution."
"But now, when there is very little in intervention - and we are hearing now that we have to buy in food even from outwith the EU and use the CAP budget to store and distribute this food - this surely is becoming something that should be better handled by Member States' social policy."
"When you consider that there are people living in complete deprivation in some of the new Member States, like Romania, and many of these people, by the way, are subsistence farmers, they are the people who the poorest."
"Yet we are potentially taking money from them - money from the CAP budget that could help them - to distribute this food aid, the main beneficiaries of which are actually old Member States, like France, Italy and Spain."
"So there has not been a level playing field applied to this distribution of aid, and in future I think we should be very cautious about how we take this forward."
"(FR) Madam President, I believe that the issue of distributing food to the most deprived persons is extremely timely, but I do feel that, ultimately, the Commission's proposal does not match up to the problem."
"The cofinancing issue is of concern to me, and I feel that it is more the issue of liberalism, which has ruled the CAP assessments over the last few years, that should be called into question."
"Food riots and sudden changes in the price of foodstuffs are constant indicators of the limits of agricultural market liberalisation."
"Such liberalisation has always been to the detriment of fragile populations, fragile producers and fragile areas."
"I therefore call for agricultural policy to regain its rights, to resume control at both European and international level and, from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective, for the strategic area of agriculture and food not to be subject to strict market forces."
"Of course, this is an urgent matter, and the Siekierski report responds to this urgency, which I am pleased about."
"I hope, though, that, within the context of the discussions that are starting up on the future of the CAP, it will be pointed out that the main objective is to take a structural approach to combating the hunger and poverty that we are seeing throughout the EU and the world."
"The rural areas are ready to meet our food requirements with sufficient amounts of high-quality produce; they must be given the financial and human resources to assume this big responsibility."
"(PL) Madam President, food and housing account for over 90% of expenditure in many people's personal budgets."
"Keeping food prices as low as possible has great social and humanitarian significance."
"Seventy-nine million people in the European Union were affected by poverty and malnutrition in 2006."
"Now, as a result of the crisis and an increase in the number of inhabitants, the problem has grown significantly and the number of people in need of direct support in 2009 will definitely exceed 25 million."
"Aid is an important element in the common agricultural policy because it releases intervention stocks while maintaining demand for food."
"I support financing food aid, especially from EU funds but supplemented by particular countries depending on their ability, setting clear principles for giving aid, increasing the aid fund by at least EUR 200 million in 2009, extending the list of food products and establishing principles of food purchase."
"Aid has great political significance, because it confirms the cohesion of EU action on behalf of its citizens."
"I congratulate Mr Siekierski on an excellent report."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, for 22 years the programme of food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community has contributed to the implementation of extremely important aims of the common agricultural policy."
"This is about, on the one hand, stabilising the markets by reducing the intervention stocks, while on the other supporting the poorest levels of the population in the Community with food."
"In 2006 alone, 13 million people from 15 Member States benefitted from aid measures within this programme - valuable help that should be retained."
"Now, however, there are justified concerns about the Commission's proposal, which deviates from the old principles and does not want to use food from the intervention stocks alone for the programme, but also food bought on the free market."
"Here, Commissioner, it is definitely a matter of social policy and not agricultural policy."
"The argument that it is only with the additional purchase of food that the range of food offered will be able to provide a balanced diet, in my opinion, goes beyond the remit."
"The rapporteur, Mr Siekierski, is now proposing the removal of co-financing."
"However, this just emphasises once again the aspect of socio-political responsibility, which is why I would advocate co-financing."
"The European Union must be clearly focussed on the well-being of the people."
"There must be no hunger or want: that is something that all of the speakers this morning have once again clearly emphasised."
"However, we must ensure a clear allocation of responsibilities."
"It is not the case that agricultural policy wants to obstruct the aid and support for the poor."
"However, with a fair and correct allocation of tasks and aid, the prospects for coordination and optimisation are also good."
"European agricultural policy is currently facing, and will in future face, great challenges."
"Changes to the content must always be seen in the overall context."
"I would therefore ask the Commission and the Council for appropriate decisions and coordination in terms of social and agricultural policy."
"(ES) Madam President, I should like firstly to congratulate Mr Siekierski on what I consider to be an excellent report, which has garnered a lot of support within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"As we all know, the Community's intervention stocks have been used to provide food aid to those most in need for more than 20 years."
"The problem, Mr Stevenson, is that successive common agricultural policy reforms have been greatly reducing the stocks."
"I would also like to point out here that if we suppress or attempt to suppress this programme we would send out a very bad signal at this very delicate moment in time, when many Europeans do not have enough to eat."
"In this respect, it is clear that when the stocks run out, and as I have already said they are gradually becoming more depleted, we will have to turn to the open market."
"I would like to highlight here something that I see as a very positive element in the report, that when we turn to the market, there should be an obligation that the products be EU produced, locally sourced, and fresh."
"It would also seem appropriate to me that the scheme should remain 100% EU funded, since I feel that at times such as this the aid cannot and should not be dependent on each Member State's capabilities, if we do not wish to go into those capabilities in detail."
"Likewise, it would seem to be a good idea to extend the programme duration to three years."
"Finally, I would like to point out that the European Commission still has time to use the interventions wherever they may be necessary or possible, and that more than one farming sector would appreciate it."
"I am thinking in particular of the dairy producers in my region, Galicia, for whom such an intervention would help to solve the difficult situation that they are facing, and would at the same time help to provide food for the most deprived."
"(PL) Madam President, around 80 million people in the European Union live in poverty, which amounts to 16% of the inhabitants of the EU."
"The economic crisis threatens to increase the size of that group."
"In Warsaw I see a line of people queuing for a bowl of soup every day."
"That is why it is so important to maintain continuity in the Community programme of food distribution to the most deprived persons."
"Direct supply of products will ensure a varied diet."
"However, the Commission's proposal includes the condition of co-financing, which in the case of the poorest Member States may lead to their withdrawal from the programme."
"This would be inconsistent with the reason for introducing the programme, and in particular with the reduction of economic and social inequalities between regions, and would destroy the principle of solidarity."
"I hope that Amendments 17, 18 and 19 will remove this flaw."
"I appeal to the Commission to prepare a programme which will remove the structural causes of poverty and not just its effects, and also for monitoring aimed at establishing how much of the aid reaches the poor, and how much is retained by intermediaries."
"I congratulate the rapporteur."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the distribution of food to the most deprived persons is a very important area of EU activity."
"I therefore thank the Commission for its proposal on this matter, and I thank Mr Siekierski for the report which we are discussing today."
"Member States have made huge advances in improving the quality of life of their inhabitants."
"However, poverty is still one of the most serious problems of contemporary Europe."
"It is estimated that 43 million EU citizens are at risk of malnutrition - that is a shocking figure."
"The distribution programme is helping many of these Europeans."
"I know that not everyone likes the programme."
"I understand that one may have doubts of a legal, economic or political nature, but I would like to know what alternative there would be to the programme, especially because the programme of food distribution also has a beneficial effect on the agricultural market, which is more stable thanks to the programme."
"The EU is a global leader in giving aid to the poorest people of the world."
"It is hard to imagine, that at the same time the Community could stop helping those of its own citizens who are facing serious problems, and therefore I hope that the Council will come to an understanding on this matter."
"(HU) I would like to congratulate the European Commission and the rapporteur, Mr Siekierski on this excellent initiative, a confirmation of the social sensitivity of the European Union and the Commission."
"There are two things I would like to ask of the European Commission."
"The first has to do with co-financing: I agree with the report, but I would like Mrs Fischer Boel to consider the fact that she is asking for co-financing from poorer Member States, those on tighter budgets, just where the need for food is the greatest."
"My second request: transport costs should not be set at 4.5% but, based on the principle of subsidiarity, should be left up to Member States, because lower rates may suffice to cover transport."
"Finally, the EU logo should continue to be printed on product labels, since these are provided by the EU."
"Lastly, as I do not think I will speak up in debates any more, I would like to thank Mrs Fischer Boel for her entire five years of diligence."
"She has made her mark on the history of European agriculture."
"(RO) As a Romanian MEP, my colleagues and I support the proposals which our rapporteur made and we are going to vote in favour of them."
"Families from small towns and rural areas are hardest hit by poverty."
"In the current crisis, extending the food programme and financing it from the Community budget are fully justified."
"We all know that the measures adopted in 2008 and the allocated budget have been insufficient."
"The agricultural and social components can justify keeping the programme as part of the common agricultural policy."
"In new Member States, such as Romania, the programme's administration must obviously be improved."
"Product storage and administrative costs must be managed efficiently so that they do not exceed 20-25% of the market price."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mr Sikierski and congratulate him on the proposals which he has made."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost this proposal - from both the rapporteur and the Commission - is an important pact to provide funding to mitigate the impact of spiralling food prices in the Community, which is putting an increasing number of people in difficulty and making the supply of food aid more costly."
"This new arrangement, which has my support, will make the programme more efficient and up to date both in terms of agricultural policy and from a social point of view."
"Furthermore, I agree that the initiative should be kept within the framework of the CAP, as suggested by the Commission."
"As we know, the CAP currently provides food aid to those groups of the population that live in desperate conditions."
"Indeed, the measure we are about to implement has always inspired broad consensus, so much so that in 2006 13 million people, and 15 countries in 2008, actually 19 countries, I think that from this point of view ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)."
"(PL) Mr President, in this debate I would like to draw attention to three issues."
"Firstly, I would like to remind you that one of the main objectives of the common agricultural policy is to ensure access to food for the inhabitants of the European Union at appropriate prices, and so for those who have low incomes or who have no income at all this means free food."
"Secondly, the income of the inhabitants of the EU, and in particular of the new Member States, leaves much to be desired."
"In all the new countries the number of inhabitants with incomes below 40% of the EU average is as high as 50%, and so almost half of the people in these countries have such low incomes."
"These data come from before the crisis."
"As a result of the crisis, in the next few years the situation will only get worse."
"I support, therefore, continuation of the programme of free food distribution among the most deprived people, for which the EU will set aside nearly EUR 500 million in 2009, which will include around EUR 100 million for my country, Poland."
"I hope that the Czech Presidency will achieve consensus on the final form of the programme in the Council ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SL) While we have been busy trying to eradicate hunger in Africa and other impoverished countries, hunger and poverty have afflicted us at home, in our own backyard."
"That has been the case in my own country of Slovenia, as well, where the need for solidarity assistance is, unfortunately, increasing, despite a high standard of living."
"According to media reports, humanitarian organisations' food supplies have almost been exhausted."
"Given the fact that the majority of EU Member States still have abundant amounts of food, it would really be inhumane if our citizens had to suffer, or even die, because of hunger."
"Survival must definitely be given priority over any other investments, which can wait until better times."
"If the Member States are unable to ensure new funds for food supplies, the most appropriate course of action would probably be for them to release their emergency supplies."
"I endorse this programme, but at the same time I would like to appeal to all of us and to our citizens to be attentive to the distress of the people around us."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Siekierski for his report on the Community programme of food distribution to the most deprived, which represents a valuable tool for regulating the market and must therefore remain within the framework of the CAP."
"Although the average quality of life in the European Union is among the highest in the world, some citizens are unable to buy enough food to eat."
"It is estimated that 43 million people in the EU are at risk of food poverty, a figure that has risen continuously in recent years."
"The rising prices that have been seen for some time on a wide range of goods makes it more expensive to provide food aid, which makes the support provided by the European programme even more urgent."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank everyone for all the comments."
"In general, I hear a very positive approach to the proposal for the most needy."
"Mr President, could I just be allowed to focus on some of the comments that have been raised here today?"
"First of all, I think that we have to keep in mind that poverty is not confined to certain areas or regions within the Member States."
"Unfortunately, it is an issue that all Member States have to face."
"It is true that the extent of the problem and the means available to remedy it are not identical throughout the whole European Community."
"The allocation of the budget to the Member States, as well as the differentiated rates for cofinancing for cohesion and non-cohesion countries, does of course already take into account the financial capacity of every country."
"This means that the bottom line will be that there will more money available for the so-called 'new' Member States than is the case today."
"Regarding the budget, I would just remind you that we have actually increased the budget available for the programme for the most needy by two thirds - up to EUR 0.5 billion - and I think this, together with the newly introduced cofinancing, will help alleviate some of the problems."
"I think we also have to keep in mind that this scheme is a voluntary one."
"Member States that have a social system in place in their own country certainly need not use this scheme."
"We do not seek to replace social policies that are already implemented in Member States and, to a certain extent, also managed by NGOs."
"Our intention is to underpin them by the provision of food, which I still consider the central aim of the agricultural policy."
"I believe that the changes that we have proposed go in the right direction."
"I think the provisions are reasonable and well balanced."
"The programme -when hopefully voted through this Parliament as well - will be able to meet the challenges of the future."
"It will be difficult to be against or to oppose this programme in a situation where unemployment is currently increasing dramatically all over Europe, thereby heavily increasing the number of people at risk of poverty."
"So I look forward to the votes of this extremely responsible Parliament."
"I would like to respond to some of the problems which have been raised."
"Firstly, I said that I am against co-financing but I also stressed that we are now in a period of economic crisis, when the number of poor and unemployed persons is rising."
"We will evaluate the programme in 2011 or 2012 and we will think then about whether to continue with co-financing."
"Let us give ourselves time and not do this during the crisis."
"Secondly, I share the view of the Commissioner that it is difficult to restrict ourselves to distributing only food produced in the EU, because that will increase costs and enlarge the administrative side of the programme."
"Thirdly, let us follow the example of the USA, where large sums, under the Farm Bill, have been set aside for the support of agriculture by financing free EBT cards."
"Fourthly, I encourage the countries which do not participate in the programme to join. The programme is open."
"Fifthly, funds allocated to this programme do not limit farmers' access to the common agricultural policy, because we have savings under the CAP."
"Finally, I would like to go back to sources."
"As we know, the aims of the CAP were formulated under the Treaties of Rome."
"They talk about the need to ensure access for society to food at affordable prices, and to guarantee farmers an appropriate level of income."
"We can say that these are, firstly, production tasks, which define the amount of production which is essential."
"Secondly, they are social tasks, because we are talking about appropriate prices - so that consumers will be able to afford food products, and thus the Treaty of Rome defines certain social objectives."
"And thirdly, there are also economic objectives, related to ensuring that farmers have appropriate incomes."
"When we are talking about affordable prices for the poor, often unemployed, consumer, food should be accessible at significantly lower prices, or simply supplied without charge, of course under special programmes and under specific conditions."
"In summary, it should be said that the CAP also includes certain elements of social policy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12.00 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"Mr Siekierski's report on the distribution of food to the most deprived persons raises issues covered in Council regulations which refer to financing of the common agricultural policy and to specific provisions in that material."
"We have here a situation which proves that there are also large areas of poverty and want inside the European Union."
"Those affected are most often people living in villages and small towns, and this includes many children."
"According to official statistics around 80 million Europeans live below the poverty line."
"It is to be feared that the present crisis and rising unemployment will increase that alarming number."
"The fact that the amount allocated to the programme of food aid for the poorest inhabitants of the EU will rise from EUR 305 million to EUR 500 million is in itself a positive sign."
"However, I think that it is necessary to make changes to the systems in Member States in order to eliminate or at least significantly limit this shameful situation."
"The main cause of this deprivation is unemployment and excessively high food prices (let us only compare the remuneration received by farmers for their products with the retail price in the shops)."
"Our system of social care is also far from perfect."
"Finally I would like to emphasise very clearly that it is essential that the food used for the purposes of the aid programme should be of good quality, and should ideally be fresh and come from local farms."
"Collective redress (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on collective redress."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, since the beginning of my mandate, redress has, as you know, been high on my list of priorities."
"I believe that substantive rights show their strength only when they are backed by enforcement and effective redress for consumers."
"More and more often, large numbers of consumers lose out as a result of the same or similar illegal practices by a trader and do not receive redress."
"The Commission has been examining the problem that consumers face in obtaining redress for mass claims."
"We have commissioned studies, discussed the issue with stakeholders, conducted surveys and an Internet consultation, and recently published a green paper to which we have received more than 170 responses."
"Although the consultation officially ended on 1 March 2009, comments are still coming in and I can already tell you that, the more evidence we gather, the more our belief that there is a problem is confirmed."
"This is why we need to find a solution in the interests of justice and a healthy European economy."
"The green paper on consumer collective redress proposed various ways of tackling this problem."
"A preliminary analysis of the replies received indicates that stakeholders recognise the unsatisfactory present situation on collective redress in the Member States."
"There is consensus about the necessity of further action to achieve effective redress for consumers and thereby restore their confidence in the market."
"Consumer organisations favour binding measures for a collective redress judicial scheme in all Member States in combination with other options, such as the extension of existing alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms to collective claims."
"Business would favour ADR mechanisms."
"In a few weeks' time, once we have properly analysed all the responses, we will publish the replies, together with a statement on the feedback we received, and before the summer we will outline the different ways of addressing the problem of mass claims."
"This will not simply be a repetition of the four options in the green paper."
"Our thinking is developing further in the light of the responses to the green paper consultation."
"Based on the outcome of all the consultations, the Commission will carefully examine the economic and social impact on stakeholders, including the costs and benefits generated by the possible options."
"On 29 May we will hold a hearing to share our preliminary conclusions with stakeholders."
"Let me stress that, whatever route we take, we will not go down the path of the US experience."
"Instead, we will follow our European legal cultures and take into account the existing experiences of Member States."
"Once the options become clear, the European Parliament, Member States and stakeholders will be convinced, as I am, that not only is there a problem but also that an effective solution must, and can, be found at European level."
"Why should reputable businesses suffer at the hands of unfair competitors who profit when consumers are not compensated?"
"And I stress 'compensated'."
"This is the very nature of redress that we are aspiring to."
"Why should consumers give up their legitimate expectations of compensation, and why should society put up with the welfare and justice gap?"
"I am confident that we will find a solution that strikes the right balance between improving consumer access to redress and avoiding unfounded claims."
"Effective redress will boost consumers' confidence in the internal market and in what Europe can do for them."
"This is particularly important in the harsh reality of today's economic and financial crisis."
"As you know, the coming months will be marked by many institutional changes, and this may influence the timing and the delivery of our work on collective redress."
"Concerning the initiative taken by the Commission on damages actions for breach of the European anti-trust rules, I can assure you that the Commission shares Parliament's view that these two initiatives related to collective redress should be consistent."
"Indeed, being consistent does not mean that different policy initiatives have to use the same tools to reach the same goals."
"I can equally assure you that I remain personally committed to this issue and will continue to work on it until the end of my mandate with the same energy and vigour that I have devoted to it thus far, and of course with the kind help and support of Parliament."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, it is a pleasure to welcome Commissioner Kuneva to the House once again."
"Commissioner, I only need to use your own words about your energy and vigour in pursuing the interests of consumers, which, I think from our side of the House and, indeed, for all members of our committee, we have admired, and we encourage you very much to continue that work."
"As far as the collective redress proposal is concerned, I think you are approaching it in exactly the right way."
"We have consistently said that this is an extremely complex issue."
"It involves not just European-level measures but also very difficult issues about engagement with national law and regional law and, above all, as you indicated, the consumer has to be at the heart of it."
"You have been really consistent in saying that consumer confidence in the internal market and cross-border trading is one of the fundamental issues that we have to raise, because otherwise consumers are not getting their rights of access and being able to use and exercise their choice across borders."
"I think that remains at the heart of what you are discussing today."
"Above all, I think the timing and complexity of solutions is important, because you have evoked a wide range of solutions here, but it is quite clear that solutions that may involve some new European-level judicial mechanisms will clearly take far longer and potentially be more controversial than picking up some of the alternative dispute resolution measures or also using the existing consumer cooperation measures that have been put in place."
"I think all of us on this committee recall that, in fact, the enhanced cooperation on consumers was an aspect that was put through our committee in the last Parliament, and we would like to see that become more effective."
"I think there is a vehicle there that can be used to give consumers the sort of redress that we are looking for, not just in collective claims but also in dealing with cross-border claims themselves much more effectively."
"If we can get that sense of priority there and timing and speed to come up with the best solutions quickly, I think that is the way that I commend you to think about moving forward."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for taking up the Socialist Group in the European Parliament's initiative and addressing this matter, as this issue is important to citizens."
"I have my mobile phone here."
"I have heard from many young people that they have a lot of problems because, for one contract or another that they have completely unwittingly entered into - for ringtones for example - a sum of money is deducted each month for five, six, seven, eight months."
"No one goes to court for the sake of EUR 5, but if a million citizens experience the same thing and an undertaking unduly pockets EUR 5 million, that is a case of unfair competition in relation to those competitors within the European Union that behave correctly."
"For this reason, it is very important that we address this issue."
"However, it is also important for the people, for the young people, for parents, who are confronted with this to be provided with legal instruments to truly strengthen their hand."
"At a time when Europe is growing together, when people are shopping on the Internet, it is important that we establish these as cross-border instruments to enable them to really be used appropriately."
"Therefore, in the opinion of my Group, it is precisely the group action provided for by such instruments that must clearly be examined in order to ascertain whether they can be used in the European Union."
"However, as you have also said, Commissioner, we need to design these instruments in such a way as to prevent the extremes seen in the US, for example, from creeping in, and instead tailor them to our own legal system."
"We must work on this and we wish to pursue this matter further in the coming months."
"Commissioner, you know that we are on your side with regard to this matter."
"When it comes to enforcing the rights of citizens, we Social Democrats are always involved."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for the opportunity to contribute to this debate."
"I am pleased, Mrs Kuneva, that at the request of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats you have been instrumental in getting the proposal relating to collective redress from the DG Competition, which to start with planned to regulate this according to the practice in the US, to be developed using a horizontal approach and to actually treat everyone equally within the European Union - small and medium-sized enterprises, consumers, workers and entrepreneurs."
"This is an important step forward, which we wish to support in a very constructive and positive manner."
"We are aware that in many individual cases, of course, a Community claim for the enforcement of collective rights appears to be more successful than individual enforcement."
"However, we remain convinced that the way of skimming off summary actions that protects the consumer the most is not collective redress, but public enforcement of such claims, for example by means of a skimming claim as in the German Law against unfair competition, because individual consumers will consider very carefully whether in fact to file a collective action with a lawyer for EUR 4.99 or whether it would actually be more helpful if, for example, these claims were continually monitored at public level by an ombudsman and enforced by appropriate means."
"Thus, with regard to the question of how to link these two elements, I believe that we need to consider carefully how we can help consumers in the most effective way, as consumers often do not have the time to go to a lawyer, but instead want to find help quickly and easily."
"The second point that I see as important - and here, too, your Directorate General has done a very good job - is that the most interesting element was a discussion in the Bavarian representation in Brussels, where in response to the question of whether, by using European legal means, we can actually rule out the type of collective redress found in the US, a representative of your Directorate General clearly said 'no we cannot'."
"That in our opinion means that we must not disregard this model completely."
"We must continue to discuss it, but to do so with great care and to include the Member States and their legal options in the discussion so that ultimately we achieve what it is we all want, and that is a real European model that is particularly attractive to consumers and that also protects small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Mr President, I know the Commissioner is aware that tomorrow 4 000 consumers will go to the High Court in the UK to seek compensation for severe allergic reactions, hospitalisation and death as the result of the use of a chemical in sofas and household goods, which has now been banned in the EU."
"France, Sweden and Poland have reported similar cases and injuries."
"Across Europe there are potentially many thousands of consumers who have suffered severe injuries as a result of this toxic chemical."
"I believe that citizens support European intervention when it is seen to give real help to consumers to tackle real problems."
"Real help in such cases means giving them the right to take action collectively, wherever they buy goods and services."
"So our committee launched an online consultation on the Commission proposal for consumer rights."
"We received many responses, many of which - from businesses and consumers - highlighted the need for effective access to cross-border remedies and redress."
"There are, I believe, enough cases like the toxic sofa case with enough compelling evidence to prove that a range of options for collective redress is needed, not only to improve access to justice, but equally to deter illegal or unfair business practices."
"Of course in our committee we want consumers to have access to cheap, affordable means, such as ADR, but I believe today's debate is first and foremost about identifying practical ways to give real help to our consumers and citizens, to ensure they get a fair deal, real redress and real remedies."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by saying that we, too, in principle welcome the European Commission's proposal and this Green Paper."
"As previous speakers have said, there is no doubt that there is a 'mass' phenomenon in which relatively small losses affect a large number of people."
"The individual losses are small, but taken together the overall amount is large."
"We need an instrument to deal with this problem."
"In my opinion, it is right to consider something like this."
"Staying with the positives, I also very much welcome the fact that, in its Green Paper, the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection has also placed a definite emphasis on the issue of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms."
"That is very different to the White Paper from the Directorate General for Competition, which was also debated in this House yesterday and which has so far completely ignored the possibility of out-of-court dispute resolution mechanisms."
"I think that the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection has come further in its Green Paper than the members of the Directorate General for Competition."
"However, I would like to make two things quite clear, which in my opinion should definitely be viewed as critical comments."
"In a few minutes at noon, Parliament will adopt my report on the White Paper from the Directorate General for Competition."
"With a huge majority in this House we will demand that the European Commission choose a horizontal approach in dealing with this issue."
"We must not end up with sectoral instruments: one for the area of consumer protection, one of the area of antitrust law, another one for the capital market, perhaps another one for the environment, perhaps another one for social affairs, all contradicting each other, all encroaching on the legal systems of the Member States and leading ultimately to legal confusion that can no longer be managed by any practitioner."
"We have often seen such examples in the past."
"I am just thinking about the debate on the Professional Qualifications Directive, which we later also combined in a single instrument because this fragmentation was no longer manageable."
"The Commission should not make the same mistake again in this case."
"It should advocate a horizontal approach right from the outset."
"That is the clear position of Parliament, as will become apparent in a few minutes."
"One last point: I very much welcome the fact that we have agreed that we do not want a claims industry based on the American model with a turnover of USD 240 billion a year from which ultimately only lawyers profit and the consumers get absolutely nothing."
"We want the genuine rule of law in Europe and we want to keep our traditional system and our understanding of the law."
"(ES) Mr President, in a market without borders such as Europe, it is important that, as well as ensuring healthy competition, we equally zealously safeguard consumers."
"Throughout the last half century, trade barriers have been breaking down for products, but largely these barriers still stand for the consumers."
"Abusive commercial practices are often not reported by consumers or pursued by consumer organisations because of a general awareness that it is difficult to obtain compensation."
"Collective redress saves effort when many people are affected and offers a much better chance of reaching a compensation agreement."
"Due to the cross-border nature of a large part of economic transactions in the European Union, this right of collective action cannot be restricted to national limits"
"We need a real initiative spanning all of Europe, which would have to bring about a certain degree of harmonisation or alignment among existing national systems in order to be effective."
"The model of choice must aim to provide easy consumer access to the system, and avoid exaggerated costs and bureaucracy."
"Therefore, I consider that we must prioritise alternative conflict resolution procedures, since they offer more flexibility, as well as simplified and less costly legal proceedings."
"(DE) Mr President, there is a large consensus in this House that we must provide better protection for consumers, particularly where, in the case of small losses for individuals, large numbers of these losses cause a problem, because they cannot see any possibility of a meaningful individual claim."
"The question is how should consumer protection and the improvement of the same be organised?"
"In this regard, I think it is very important - and I am very grateful to the Commission for this - that we should quite deliberately say that we want to examine all of the alternatives and all of the aspects of this complex issue and only after careful consideration decide on the solutions."
"I would like to address one aspect in this context that has not yet been mentioned."
"We have already found - and in future this may increasingly be the case - that, for many non-governmental organisations and many consumer protection associations, the possibility of arranging mass claims is becoming advertising material."
"This danger should be included quite deliberately in our considerations so that we do not ultimately help those who do not need help and leave those who do need help out in the rain."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank you for all your valuable opinions."
"In a way, I am familiar with most of them because we have been discussing, point by point, the most important parts of your concerns and hopes for having collective redress in Europe."
"I should like to reiterate once again that I am totally with you in not wanting US-style class actions to be introduced into European culture."
"I know that is one of your most important preoccupations."
"As Ms McCarthy also mentioned, this is about damages."
"This is already happening in the UK, but this has nothing to do with what we are discussing and what I am proposing as our future steps in this direction."
"In this respect, I would like to stress the following."
"Checking to see whether there is a real need for collective redress: yes, we are doing that and we will continue to do so after the green paper."
"Respecting constitutional constraints: yes."
"Avoiding US-style class action: yes."
"Ensuring that damages are compensated, including all costs incurred by the consumer but, at the same time, excluding any element of punitive damage: yes, that is what we have in mind."
"Discouraging unmeritorious claims, as referred to by Mr Rack: yes."
"Promoting alternative dispute resolution schemes: of course, because this is less time-consuming, more affordable and easier for both consumers and businesses, and also respecting subsidiarity."
"With these few words, I would like to say that we are fully aware of the challenges and we are ready to face these challenges and make a good proposal, step by step, building consensus and common understanding with you."
"What I really appreciate today is that all of us recognise that we have a problem and that we are ready to address this problem."
"So this really is a very good starting point for the next stage of debates."
"As this is a challenge we face, I would like in particular to stress what Mr Lehne referred to - the common approach, the horizontal approach with Commissioner Kroes."
"Commissioner Kroes and myself, as well as our respective services, are cooperating very closely in order to ensure that our initiatives are consistent and produce synergies."
"The consistency principle does not necessarily rule out that specific situations require specific solutions."
"Each of the two initiatives has a distinct focus."
"Whereas the consumer green paper deals with redress for breaches of consumer protection law, the competition white paper is strictly about competition law infringements."
"Another major difference between the two initiatives is that, whereas the consumer green paper only covers redress for consumers, the redress mechanism suggested in the competition white paper is designed to benefit both consumers and businesses."
"So my challenge is to achieve effective redress for our consumers and thereby restore their confidence in the market."
"From previous discussions, I know that the European Parliament is supporting us in our efforts to achieve this goal."
"Let me stress again that Parliament, together with Member States and stakeholders, will be convinced that not only is there a problem but also that an effective and balanced solution must and can be found at European level."
"I should like to thank you for this fruitful debate and your valuable opinions, and I look forward to working with you on this file over the coming months."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"I would like to congratulate the European Commission's efforts to improve the methods which consumers can use to exercise their rights throughout Europe."
"The options presented in the Green Paper must be discussed in detail."
"However, one thing that is already certain is that option No 4, which would introduce a class of 'opt-out' type actions, offering consumer organisations a share of the compensation payments, is not sustainable (viable)."
"If we want to boost consumer confidence in the internal market, we need to consider a combination of options 2 and 3."
"In other words, we must create a European network of national executive public authorities which will enjoy greater powers to intervene effectively in the case of international claims (abroad)."
"Furthermore, we must review alternative mechanisms for resolving existing disputes and, if necessary, introduce a new mechanism enabling consumer rights to be applied (exercised) more effectively outside the courts too."
"I would like to conclude by emphasising that we must ensure that we adopt a horizontal approach with regard to the collective redress mechanism, thereby avoiding the fragmentation of national legislation and establishing a single, common instrument for all Member States."

"Mr President, by adopting today's report on the programme of food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community we will send a positive signal to our citizens that the European Union is supporting the most deprived and the poorest inhabitants of the Community with free food."
"The programme of food distribution, like the 'Fruit at School' and 'Milk at School' programmes, is changing attitudes towards the EU, and because of this the EU is becoming friendlier and closer to two important social groups - the deprived and young people."
"Therefore I ask for a vote in favour of this report."

"Mr President, it would be most interesting if we could compare the vote on the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the alternative motions for resolutions by 40 members and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group."
"We would find:"
"firstly, that a total of 15 proposals have been amended without sending out any message;"
"secondly, that over and above the quantitative issue there is also the political issue, with the alternative proposal deleting every reference to the role and responsibility of the large commercial retail and wholesale chains;"
"thirdly, that the written statement by the European Parliament with its 439 signatures by members who want branches to be controlled and to operate properly lapses by default; and"
"fourthly, that every unfair trading policy has been deleted or embellished and that it even goes as far as to refuse the recommendation to create a Europe-wide database on farm gate and consumer prices which is accessible to all citizens and consumers."
"The objective of the Committee on Agriculture and of the High Level Group is to examine competitive practices and the transparency of the internal market in the food sector."
"Today we are all being judged."
"(FR) Mr President, it is all the same astounding, that statement."
"I simply wished to say to my fellow Members that I am one of the authors of the alternative resolution."
"We are in the European Union, not the Soviet Union."

"I am sure, Mrs Lulling, that this detail had not escaped the Members of this House, but I gave the floor to our rapporteur because she did not have the opportunity to speak during the debates."

"Mr President, I wish to inform the House that, on a matter of principle, I wish to withdraw my name from the Socialist Group's alternative motion for a resolution on the Auken report."
"Furthermore, after five years of working on this issue, I wish to inform Members that I will be voting against both alternative motions for resolution and voting in favour of the Auken report."
"(Applause)"
"rapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, citizens of the EU, this report is the result of extensive work in the Committee on Petitions, involving Members from all political groups."
"I would like to thank both the Chairman and the shadow rapporteurs for their sterling work."
"As draftsman of the committee's opinion, I have personally been wholeheartedly committed to this matter."
"It has, of course, had a huge effect on the lives of tens of thousands of EU citizens living in Spain and has affected both the Spanish countryside and the Spanish economy."
"The report has now been approved by the committee after being adopted by a two-thirds majority."
"It is a comprehensive text, which differentiates between the many different aspects of Spanish urbanisation."
"There is the problem of the fundamental rights of European citizens, which include the right to lawfully acquired property."
"The European Parliament has already committed itself to respecting these rights, and all Member States are bound by them."
"There is the problem of the disastrous impact of the extensive urbanisation on the environment, particularly in coastal areas and on the Spanish islands, but also in other areas such as around Madrid."
"There is the problem of the resurrection of the Spanish 1988 Coastal Law, which is now suddenly able to deny many people the right to live in their own homes - and in certain cases has even resulted in the demolition of these homes."
"Then there is the problem of the consequences of thousands of allegedly unlawful houses built with the approval of the municipalities but subsequently declared unlawful, whereby the innocent purchaser becomes the victim of corrupt urbanisation practices."
"Finally, there is the problem of the lack of legal certainty and appropriate compensation for the victims of the property scandals."
"I have no doubt about where the responsibility for these extensive infringements lies and I regret that these violations by municipal and regional authorities have undermined attempts by many others to create sustainable development, where a healthy economy goes hand in hand with respect for the environment and for cultural heritage."
"The report deserves a proper debate in which all opinions can be heard."
"It is unacceptable that our new rules prevent this."
"These rules must be changed as soon as possible, particularly when it comes to reports that deal with complaints from European citizens."
"I ask you to reject the two alternative resolutions."
"Although they are based on my report, they are not impartial."
"They do not reflect the detailed and factual assessments that the committee has voted on."

"Interim Trade Agreement with Turkmenistan (vote)"
"- Before the vote"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with Article 170(4), I request on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that the final vote on the resolution and the report be postponed until the next plenary sitting."
"It became clear in the debate yesterday that the majority in Parliament would be able to agree to the signing of the interim agreement, even if it pains them to do so."
"Many Members are hoping that, after years of deadlock, the agreement will enable a new quality of dialogue between the European Union and Turkmenistan."
"However, for the majority of Members it is important that we do not give the Commission and the Council a free ride."
"As Parliament, we need guarantees from the Commission and the Council that, if the human rights situation continues to worsen, at the request of Parliament serious consideration will be given to the suspension of the agreement."
"Yesterday, the Commission unfortunately only conditionally agreed and the Council did not agree at all to this demand."
"I therefore request, on behalf of my Group, that both final votes be postponed until we have the corresponding commitments from the Council and the Commission."
"(Applause)"
"In accordance with Rule 170(4) of the Rules of Procedure, it was a political group that just spoke."
"The procedure asks whether a speaker wishes to speak for or against."
"on behalf of the PSE-Group. - Mr President, I totally agree with our colleague, Mr Caspary, that we should postpone not only the final vote on the resolution but also the vote on his report - the assent report - because it was very clear in yesterday's debate that the Council in particular was not prepared to give the European Parliament sufficient opportunity and the possibility to really monitor the situation in Turkmenistan and have an impact on the situation there on the basis of such an agreement."
"Since we did not get sufficient guarantees, we also support Mr Caspary's proposal to postpone these votes."
"I shall put the request for postponement to the vote."
"(Parliament decided to postpone the final vote)"
"(DE) Mr President, the request was for the final votes only to be postponed, not the vote on the amendments."
"We in the services were not in receipt of this information."
"Only the final vote shall be postponed, then."
"I should point out that we are going to vote first on the amendments."
"(DE) Mr President, my request was to postpone only the two final votes and for us to vote on the amendments so we only need hold the final votes in one of the forthcoming plenary sittings."
"In fact, this is absolutely not what the services had understood, but we shall of course go along with our rapporteur."
"Therefore, if I have understood correctly, we are going to vote on the amendments to the report on Turkmenistan, not to your report."
"Then we shall stop before the final vote."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 2"
"(FR) Mr President, the excellent amendment tabled by my group and which will enable us to carry real weight in the area of human rights would be further improved if we replaced 'the prospect of signing the Agreement' with 'the prospect of finalising the process of ratifying the Agreement', which is the appropriate phrase."
"This is a legal point."
"Can those Members who oppose it please stand up?"
"I cannot see 40 Members standing up."
"Therefore, we shall include what Mrs Flautre said, and I shall now record this paragraph as having been orally amended."
"(The oral amendment was accepted)"
"9."
"Interim Agreement with Turkmenistan ("
"- After the vote on Amendment 1"
"(FR) Mr President, I have a feeling that you have held a vote on the Caspary report, and the amendment tabled by my group has been rejected."
"I myself voted against, because I was on the voting list for the previous report."
"I believe that we should vote again on the Caspary report, for which there was just one amendment, and then not hold the final vote."
"(Parliament approved the request by Mr Goebbels to hold the vote again)"
"10."
"Strengthening security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet ("
"- Before the vote"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I am grateful to everyone for their support."
"There is just one slight point of confusion for me."
"The oral amendment is on the voting list but nobody stood up to support it."
"Does that mean that it fell and did not come to the vote at all?"
"Is that correct?"
"I can confirm that, if an oral amendment is to be adopted, it must be expressed orally, which has not been the case, in spite of my request."
"You have therefore understood perfectly."
"11."
"EU strategy for better ship dismantling (vote)"
"That concludes voting time."
"Voting time"
"The next item is voting time."
"(For details of the outcome of the votes: see Minutes)"
"(IT) Mr President, just a short aside, as Members are still taking their seats."
"We changed the rules of procedure because too much time was being spent on fruitless debates, and we decided not to hold a debate on the Auken report."
"We have wasted a good half hour doing nothing, which we could have employed much better by debating a text that is of great importance to citizens."
"Your comment will be passed on to the competent bodies."
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(SK) During the 22 years of its existence, the programme for distributing food to the most deprived people in the Community has contributed towards implementing two main aims of the common agricultural policy."
"It helps to stabilise markets by reducing intervention stocks and it secures necessary food supplies for the poorest inhabitants of the EU."
"I have therefore voted in favour of Mr Siekierski's consultation report dealing with the new programme for providing food to the poorest people, as proposed by the Commission."
"In 2009 this scheme should include a sum of EUR 500 million, with additional resources from the Member States designated for cofinancing."
"Mr President, just as your own mother and father have been watching the vote today, we also have some visitors from the regions of PreÅ¡ov and Nitra in Slovakia and I would like to welcome them to the Chamber of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of Mr CzesÅaw Siekierski's report and our resolution on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community."
"The report and resolution are of great importance in the context of the financial crisis and economic recession."
"Growing poverty in the EU - when in some countries poverty affects around 20% of the population - clearly shows that the need for food assistance is quite high."
"Under the present circumstances, I fully support the European Parliament's position that the EU food distribution programme, which allocates nearly half a billion euros with the aim of diminishing malnutrition and poverty in the EU, should be fully funded by the Community."
"I would especially like to stress the importance of the Commission's proposal to improve the structure for selecting products supplied under the programme."
"The food should be chosen by Member States' authorities and distributed in cooperation with civil society partners."
"Mr President, feeding the hungry is an essential duty and we have to find a way to see that no person, especially a child, goes to bed hungry."
"I abstained on this report, however, because I find changes in this scheme do not really make sense."
"To have a CAP policy buying in food from third countries - whose poor people are already hungry - to feed our poor, while other CAP policies prevent our farmers from growing enough food to feed the hungry of Europe, simply does not make sense."
"We need to feed the poor, especially in this economic crisis, and I will be advocating changes to the scheme that will achieve this end."
"(NL) Mr President, I voted against the three alternative resolutions, as I take the view that counterfeit goods constitute a serious problem and that we must endeavour to afford the European public the best possible protection against the import of such goods."
"This is to say nothing of the economic implications of counterfeit goods. European customs inspectors must indeed have the right to monitor ships from Indian ports destined for the European Union - by which I mean that this monitoring must take place in Indian ports."
"I also find it regrettable that, when the serious terrorist attacks that have taken place are mentioned in this House, the phrase used is 'political groups', when everyone knows that the groups concerned are Islamist groups."
"I believe that Mr Tannock wished to speak."
"Let me just remind you of the rule."
"It is not the same as under the 'catch-the-eye' procedure."
"You have to register before the explanations of vote begin, but I can be flexible."
"Mr President, I was unaware of that - I thought you could just wave at the appropriate moment."
"This had the makings of a great report."
"I drew up the opinion in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"India is the largest democracy in the world; it is now coming out from many decades of protectionism, embracing global free trade; it is surviving fairly robustly the global financial crisis."
"It would have been great to have achieved a deep free trade agreement between India and the European Union, which is also a very large democratic polity, and it would also be a nail in the coffin to those who are saying that protectionism is the way ahead in global trade."
"So I deeply regret that this report was so amended by the Socialists as to make it unpalatable and unacceptable to those of us who support free trade."
"India also deeply regrets that: the Government of India had stored a great deal of political capital in the idea of this agreement going through in a way that would have been good for India and good for Europe."
"Therefore, we had to vote against it, I am afraid to say."
"Mr President, I extend a very affectionate welcome to your parents, who are present here today."
"I should have liked mine to have been here too, but that is no longer possible."
"We have just adopted the Lehtinen report."
"This is a crucial step in terms of our legislative arrangements, and I sincerely hope that the Commission will listen to Parliament in their regard."
"Indeed, we are well aware that, across the world, the development of techniques and organisations involves a growing number of subcontractors."
"That being said, the employees of our businesses must be better protected, and subcontracting businesses themselves must be on an equal footing, so that we have an economy that works in natural harmony."
"Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely hope that the Commission and the competent services in each Member State will implement our own-initiative report as soon as possible, in order, I repeat, to better satisfy employees, on the one hand, and the balance between subcontracting businesses, on the other."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I, too, welcome the fact that, with the alternative resolution, we have succeeded in assigning the Commission the task of submitting a directive on the liability of general undertakings throughout Europe."
"The basis of this resolution was the Lehtinen report, and therefore much of the work carried out in the committee and by the Groups, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and ourselves, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, has gone into this decision."
"Just how important this is can be seen from the fact that cheap labour can be found on building sites all over Europe and it even jeopardises safety, as shown by the example of the Finnish nuclear plant, where safety standards were not met by subcontractors."
"We therefore urgently need a European directive, because the laws in the eight EU Member States that have general undertaking liability, although very effective, stop at the national border."
"If the present Commission does not issue such a directive, we Greens are firmly resolved to make this a matter of principle when the new Commission takes office, as we want safety for citizens and a minimum standard for workers."
"This is only possible by means of a European statutory regulation, a liability scheme for general undertakings."
"I hope that the Commission will comply with our request and submit a directive."
"Otherwise, we need to question whether it is still worthy of its office."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the report by Mrs Batzeli."
"In my opinion, it calls into question some of the essential cornerstones of our economic system, such as free competition and the basic principles of the social market economy."
"It is clear that appropriate measures to stabilise food prices need to be found in order to ensure sustainable agricultural production."
"Practices which distort competition must be stopped."
"However, an EU-wide database containing reference prices for products and inputs would bring more bureaucracy and reporting obligations, the costs of which would be passed on by the trade to producers or consumers."
"The result would be higher end and consumer prices and lower prices for producers."
"Complete transparency of all business cost factors such as pay, energy costs, purchase and sale prices and the profit margins would lead to monitoring and dirigisme."
"These are not the aims of a social and free Europe."
"The position of farmers in the food supply chain can only be strengthened by cooperation and the inclusion of shared responsibility."
"Mr President, I welcome this report as a shot across the bows of supermarket giants."
"Tesco, for example, recently announced profits of GBP 2.8 billion, while food producers in my constituency struggle to make a living."
"The major supermarkets have been abusing their buying power to suppress prices to suppliers to unsustainable levels and to impose, I must say, unfair and unilateral demands as the price of retaining the contract."
"In the long run, as the UK Competition Commission has pointed out, this will equally damage consumers as choice, availability and quality are squeezed out of the market."
"Thus I support the call for an investigation into the margin share in the production and distribution chain."
"Someone, somewhere, is doing very nicely, but it certainly is not the producer."
"(PL) Mr President, I abstained from the vote on Mrs Batzeli's report, but I think it is a very useful contribution to further work on the subject of food prices."
"Retail prices are very different from the prices at which producers sell their products."
"Retail trade, which is the most visible to the consumer, has very limited contact with farmers, and when looking for better ways to stabilise food prices we have to analyse the whole chain of costs from producer to consumer."
"The proposed system of negotiation is unrealistic in view of the number of entities operating in the market, and limits competition."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted against the report on food prices in Europe presented by Mrs Batzeli."
"The report is based on the idea that free price-setting on the food market is a bad solution and it calls for the introduction of price regulation in this sector of the economy."
"This idea is contrary to common sense and with the historical experience of all the post-communist states, including the Czech Republic."
"We have experienced 100% price regulation and we well remember what a failure it was."
"Free price-setting is the foundation of freedom and democracy and any attempt to restrict it will lead to totalitarianism."
"Free price setting in the food sector has led in recent years to excellent results in the form of relatively lower food prices throughout the EU."
"It has also brought extensive modernisation which has provided consumers with better quality products at lower prices."
"The regulatory measures contained in the report would bring this positive development to a complete halt, resulting only in higher food prices."
"The fact that there is fierce competition in this sector is excellent news for the consumer."
"Those who have higher costs than market prices must adapt to the situation or withdraw from the market."
"It would be absurd to cover their losses out of taxes paid by customers."
"For these reasons I voted against this report."
"(FI) Mr President, first of all I wish to say that I voted against Mrs Batzeli's report."
"While I was reading it I wondered whether we were in the European Union or the Soviet Union, and I believe we are in the European Union."
"Basically, then, we cannot establish regulation of food prices along these lines over Europe as a whole."
"We have to remember that we must ensure that we have good, safe, top-quality food."
"The local food principle is important, and, consequently, at national level these matters can be examined more closely."
"I am concerned that the costs of inputs have risen."
"The prices for fertilisers and feed have gone up."
"The level of trade takes its share, and so when, for example, rye bread comes onto the market, it costs EUR 3, of which the primary producer, the farmer, gets just six cents."
"This is not the direction we should be moving in, and that is why we need to ponder these matters nationally, and, more than anything, establish a system in which farmers, the producers of food, can survive, and in which people can buy good quality, healthy food at a reasonable price."
"Healthy food is what must be made the heart of the matter."
"Mr President, of course this report about food prices fails to reflect the reality of the situation - that food prices in the EU are kept artificially high by a brutal combination, on the one hand, of excessive EU bureaucracy and, on the other hand, by the now notorious common agricultural policy."
"Farm subsidies ensure that inefficient farmers are bankrolled at the expense of the European taxpayer and, at the same time, of course, ensure that the prices that we as consumers pay in shops and supermarkets for agricultural produce remain disproportionately high."
"The one thing that the Commission could do to address the disproportionately high prices of food is to announce tomorrow that they are going to dismantle the common agricultural policy, but of course they will not do that because certain Member States, particularly France, benefit disproportionately from huge sums of taxpayers' money being poured into an inefficient, grossly disproportionate farming sector."
"That is the one thing the Commission should do, but of course they will not."
"Mr President, Fidel Castro lies in his sick bed in his sultry Caribbean island, fading away - and not before time."
"When eventually he passes, there will be only two Marxist systems of agriculture left in the world: the collective farms of North Korea and Europe's common agricultural policy, a policy based on price-fixing, a policy based on the storage and destruction of food stocks for which there is no market, a policy which wantonly passes on costs and unnecessary suffering to the Third World, which is deprived of its natural market."
"We are penalised twice over - as consumers and as taxpayers - by high prices and by high taxes, and yet our farmers are penalised too."
"In my South-East region in England, farming is disappearing as a meaningful part of the economy."
"Our bluebell groves and our chestnut copses and our hop fields are gradually giving way to the spread of concrete."
"It has now been 50 years that our consumers and farmers have been crucified to pay for this bureaucracy."
"Enough is enough."
"(FR) Mr President, we are all infuriated at the level of food prices and the way they are structured."
"Products start at a value of 1 in farms, rise to 6 in supermarkets, and sole starts at a value of 1 in Africa and rises to 14 in French shops, with the result that at 8 p.m. ... the supermarkets close and Europeans rummage through bins."
"However, in the face of this situation which, at the two ends of the chain, does not make farmers rich but does make it difficult for consumers to put food on the table, it is not enough to call for transparency or denounce the distribution oligopolies."
"There is speculation in Geneva on the price of rice, there is speculation in Chicago on the price of maize, there is major financial crime, and there is an International Criminal Court."
"Well, at the G20, the International Criminal Court's powers should be extended to cover major financial crime, and speculating on food is a major crime that is on a par with that perpetrated by Bashir in Darfur."
"That is the real signal that must be sent out."
"I did not wish to cut you off in the midst of your lyrical musings."
"Mr President, I strongly support the rapporteur in her report and salute her sterling work on behalf of citizens right across Europe who have fallen foul of the outrageous property practices in Spain."
"The right to own and enjoy private property is a fundamental right, recognised by the European Convention."
"Yet several constituents of mine, who put their life savings into a home in Spain, now find themselves ambushed and devastated by laws and claims which would deprive them of their property or cost them enormous sums of money in order to retain it."
"It appears that civic authorities in Spain, in cahoots with grasping, unscrupulous developers, have been a terror to those who thought they were buying legitimate homes and properties, and, if this report helps address that, then it can only do good."
"(ES) Mr President, I naturally voted against the Auken report, and I should like to state here that the report that has been adopted goes against the letter of the law."
"It does not comply in any way with the principles of law that the European Union has declared, and it is absolutely appalling that the European Parliament has been capable of approving this document, which has been described by the Legal Services as non-compliant with the law and full of illegalities."
"The report proposes the suspension of all building projects, as if that would solve the problems."
"That is something that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has been advocating for several years."
"This document does not resolve the real problems faced by the people, which have largely been resolved by the changing of a law, as has already been done, and by the efforts that the Spanish authorities are making to correct mistakes that have clearly been made."
"To sum up, I should like to point out that the destruction of the majority of the properties is due to poor application of the Coastal Law by Mr Zapatero's Socialist government, who are acting in an arbitrary manner, and arbitrarily seizing properties in just one area of Spain."
"(NL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the Auken report, as I believe that all citizens in Europe have the right to proper application of all legislation and that the private property of each and every citizen in the European Union must be safeguarded by the governments of all Member States."
"Many people have fallen victim to questionable decisions in Spain and many of them have addressed these to the Committee on Petitions - rightly, in my view."
"All the same, I have mixed feelings, as I think that we must be wary of adopting legislation that is tantamount to introducing yet more European interference to the detriment of the Member States."
"A specific example is the situation in the Flemish periphery of Brussels, where the European Union is starting to interfere in a housing policy that aims to enable young Flemish families to continue living in their local area."
"Mr President, I also supported the Auken report."
"I supported it because many of my constituents in the north-east of England are among the petitioners who petitioned Parliament about this disgraceful and flagrant abuse of property rights by the Spanish Government and local authorities."
"Indeed they were recently the subject of a TV documentary by ITV North East, where some of these heart-rending cases were brought to life and were examined for the public of the north-east to see."
"I hope even now, at this late stage, that the Spanish Government and Spanish MEPs will right some of the wrongs that have been done and will give some restitution to some of these people who have been unlawfully denied their property and recognise that, actually, what has gone on here is a scandal."
"It is a corrupt scandal."
"Many of the deals involving property developers and Spanish local government are, frankly, the result of corruption."
"We serve nobody by failing to recognise that essential point."
"The Spanish Government needs to act."
"I am, frankly, appalled at some of the abuses that have gone on in this Chamber by Spanish MEPs seeking to cover up these practices."
"Mr President, I, too, voted for this report as so many of my constituents - as has been the case across the European Union - have been so badly affected by this particular problem."
"The requirement to have legal certainty about purchasing property is essential and is brought about by this report, which seeks to get the kinds of insurances that are necessary to see change."
"It also addresses the specific issues of complaints concerning illegal practices by local builders and certain local authorities."
"I voted for this report because I believe it is going to help secure a formal process; it is going to highlight something that I regarded in the past as being just a derogatory statement, i.e."
"'Spanish practices'. I would like to ensure that term never sees the light of day again and I would like to see the Commission, the Council and the Spanish Government deal with this issue and come down hard, so that those who have lost out can get compensation or those who are there can feel secure."
"Mr President, before I start, may I say how pleased I am to find out that your parents are in the Chamber, not just because it is nice to have an audience, but so they can see how your fair chairmanship of these sittings has earned you respect across the Chamber, including even from British Conservatives."
"It is 'so true, funny how it seems' that in just a few short days President Obama comes to Strasbourg."
"Looking through the barricades being erected he might reflect, if he thinks at all about the European Parliament, that its two-seats policy is absolutely mad, a complete waste of money."
"Indeed, he will think:"
"'Round and round it goes,"
"And oh don't you know,"
"This is the game that we came here for."
"Round and round it goes.'"
"But soon he will be gone, looking at the hopeless nature of the one-size-fits-all regulation that cripples EU businesses, and doubtless he will think that there is no lifeline that he can throw."
"And"
"'because [he has] nothing else here for you,"
"And just because it's easier than the truth,"
"Oh if there's nothing else that [he] can do -'"
"He will fly away - 'fly for you', out of this place, having felt that you should 'always believe in your soul'."
"'Luck has left [him] standing so tall.'"
"And praise ring in the heavens, for Spandau Ballet have re-formed!"
"(NL) Mr President, transatlantic relations are a matter close to my heart, and I largely agree with the broad lines of the MillÃ¡n Mon report."
"Nevertheless, I have voted against the report, as it contains a number of significant shortcomings."
"For example, it expressly anticipates the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon - yet another instance of that happening here - when the treaty concerned has by no means been adopted yet."
"The Irish voters should be respected."
"The report also speaks of problems faced by Palestinians, but without mentioning Israel's security."
"Last but not least, it reiterates the call for Member States to accept some of the GuantÃ¡namo inmates, alleged terrorists."
"I consider this totally unacceptable."
"It is also unacceptable that the report does not clearly state that the United States cannot interfere in EU enlargement policy and that, therefore, Turkey has no place in the European Union."
"(FI) Mr President, transatlantic relations are very important for us Europeans."
"We always have to remember that the United States of America, as a world leader, shares the same values as the Member States of the European Union: democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion."
"I believe that these are values which unite us and which I hope will also strengthen our relations in the future."
"Now that the United States has a new administration headed by President Obama, much attention has been paid to it and a lot of expectations rest on its shoulders, but we have to remember that neither Obama nor his administration can change the whole world."
"Certainly they will try to do their best, but massive challenges lie ahead, and for that reason the expectations need to be realistic."
"We must nevertheless extend a hand to the United States, since we face common threats."
"These relate to international terrorism: Islamic fundamentalism, which is rearing its head."
"We also face common environmental challenges, and transatlantic relations allow us together to face these and the other problems that are at present so acute the world over."
"Mr President, while I have the opportunity, can I also pay tribute to the fair and impartial manner in which you have always chaired our parliamentary sessions?"
"It is a shame that President PÃ¶ttering does not somehow follow your example in so many ways in this."
"This report is about the United States and US-EU relations."
"Of course America remains fundamental to Europe's security and prosperity."
"Sadly, in this House there are many examples of anti-American sentiment."
"All of us in the EU should be profoundly grateful for the role that the US plays in the world and particularly the role that it has played in our recent history."
"I laugh sometimes when I hear the suggestion that it is the EU that is responsible for 60 years of peace in Europe."
"Everybody seems to forget about the contribution of the US, and, of course, NATO, in contributing towards peace in Europe."
"America should not be a rival of the EU."
"It should be a partner and a friend and we should build closer transatlantic relations."
"Mr President, British Conservatives are proud of our country's special relationship with the United States and the bridge between America and Europe."
"We support President Obama's commitment to multilateral engagement with the European Union."
"However, this report mentions the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty, which we strongly oppose."
"It also calls for the US to abolish the death penalty, which for us is a personal conscience issue."
"Given the British Conservatives' current opposition to the International Criminal Court, we also acknowledge America's right not to sign the Rome Statute."
"We also do not wish to be obliged to resettle dangerous terrorists from the GuantÃ¡namo Bay detention camp."
"This report rightly reiterates that NATO is the cornerstone of transatlantic security and proposes a new transatlantic parliamentary assembly, which will reinforce a mutual commitment to our common values of democracy, liberty and human rights."
"Therefore, overall, the British Conservatives voted in favour of the MillÃ¡n Mon report."
"Mr President, I particularly welcome this report and I share some of the points that were raised just now, but perhaps we should start off by formally congratulating Mr Obama on becoming President."
"I do not think that we have all done that here today, but it is quite clearly a breath of fresh air for what we hope will be a very positive relationship with the United States."
"We are very quick to point out how that relationship can work for us, of course, but we do not point out quite so often what we have to do to strengthen it and work within it."
"For example, trade between us, according to the OECD, is the largest between any two trading blocs anywhere in the world."
"It is right that it also causes us to think hard about regulation and supervision."
"Anything that is decided between us, both economically and politically, is of great importance to the rest of the world and often sets the global standards."
"I, as a member of the US delegation working on the Transatlantic Economic Council, hope that we can take further the work that we have already done there and transpose that into real efforts within this House, instead of seeing some of the silly efforts from some, on issues like chicken, which help blight that particular relationship."
"(NL) Mr President, it is good that Amendment 5 has been rejected."
"This amendment sought to remove an essential passage from the report: essential in that it advocates freedom of expression."
"After all, it is a basic tenet of democracy that the expression of controversial political beliefs must remain immune from prosecution."
"Freedom of expression must be absolute and must certainly cover political views even on controversial issues such as immigration and Islam."
"For the rest, I consider this a very well-balanced report, which strikes a good balance between rights and liberties and takes a stand against censorship."
"I therefore endorsed this report with great conviction."
"(FI) Mr President, this report by Mr Lambrinidis on strengthening security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet is a very important, topical subject."
"I share the opinion expressed in it that it is important to preserve freedom of expression."
"That is one of our fundamental rights and freedoms."
"We always have to remember, however, that when we speak of freedom of expression, that also incorporates a responsibility."
"Responsibility in this matter is the most important consideration."
"When we view Internet sites today, we regrettably have to acknowledge that there is a lot of the sort of material that is of no good to society or human development."
"I am particularly concerned about children and young people, who are our most valuable asset - our future's most valuable asset."
"We need to take responsibility for them right now and must act in such a way that they can gain the best possible knowledge and skills and develop healthy attitudes, and the Internet is one key source of information for them."
"For that reason I hope that we can improve children's safety by increasing the amount of material on the Internet that might encourage, educate and develop them, and not the sort of thing we see today, which there is, unfortunately, so much of there, and which can harm the growth of the overall personality of the young."
"Written explanations of vote"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to ensure genuine access to justice for victims of breaches of competition rules, joint efforts must be made by the EU and the Member States."
"The White Paper presents a series of recommendations aimed at ensuring that those affected by this type of infringement have access to really effective mechanisms to seek full compensation for the damage suffered."
"At present in the majority of Member States there are serious barriers that discourage consumers and businesses from going to court to claim compensation on a private basis for damages suffered as a result of a breach of antitrust rules."
"While there have been signs of improvement recently in some Member States, very few claims have been made over the last few decades."
"The traditional laws and procedures on civil liability in force in the majority of Member States appear to be inadequate."
"I welcome the drafting of a White Paper proposing a Community-level solution to the problem of ensuring access to justice for claimants, thus pursuing general policy objectives (specifically, ensuring broader access to justice by enforcing competition policy and discouraging unlawful practices on the part of undertakings) while at the same time preventing unmeritorious and opportunistic litigation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I intend to abstain from the vote on Mr Lehne's report on the White Paper on damages actions for breach of the EC antitrust rules."
"I agree with some, but not all, of the points highlighted in the report and for this reason I have decided not to vote for the report as it stands."
"I voted in favour of the report compiled by CzesÅaw Adam Siekierski (PPE-DE, Poland) as it proposes the extension of the European food aid programme for the most deprived."
"As a former mayor of Bucharest's 5th district, I was always concerned about providing help to the poor, especially those of Roma ethnic origin."
"Throughout the whole of the European Union 80 million people (16% of the population) are living below the poverty line, and their number is going to increase due to the economic crisis."
"In some of the states which have recently joined the EU poverty affects roughly 20% of the population."
"Full funding is required from the EU budget for food aid programmes as some Member States will be unable to participate in the scheme when cofinancing rates apply."
"We must reduce the load being shouldered by Member States with low per capita incomes or whose budgets are facing financial difficulties, which also includes Romania."
"Products from intervention stocks or purchased on the market must be of Community origin, with preference given to locally-produced fresh food products, i.e. Romanian products to be purchased with European money for distribution to the poor in Romania."
"in writing. - (NL) I voted in favour of the report on the amendment of a regulation on the financing of the common agricultural policy and the common organisation of agricultural markets as regards food distribution to the most deprived persons."
"According to the data, in 2006 approximately 13 million people from the Member States benefited from this programme."
"That is a good thing, but the assistance to the poorest in the EU should be greatly intensified."
"To begin with, let us cut European Commissioners' pay in half or divide it by three."
"The European think-tank Open Europe has estimated that, pension schemes included, Commissioners earn on average EUR 2.5 million over five years, which is downright scandalous."
"The other half of that money would be better spent on poverty reduction."
"Perhaps that is a way of reconciling the European public with 'Europe'."
"I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation on food distribution to the most deprived persons."
"Poverty is one of the most serious problems currently facing the European Union."
"In 2006 nearly 79 million people were threatened with poverty, which clearly shows the need for food aid programmes."
"As the Commission proposal aims to distribute food to the most deprived persons and improve planning so that funds can be used more efficiently, and also bearing in mind that, since it began in 1987, the food distribution programme has already benefited over 13 million people, I believe that the continuation of this programme is necessary and positive."
"in writing. - (SV) We believe that the original purpose of the programme - to distribute intervention stocks to the most deprived persons - was strangely worded right from the start."
"Mixing agricultural policy with social policy may be commendable, but it gets complicated."
"Recently, the proportion of goods not coming from intervention stocks has steadily increased."
"At the last reckoning, around 85% of the food was bought on the open market."
"We believe that the distribution of food to the most deprived persons in the Community should be abolished."
"The circumstances of the most deprived persons in the Member States should be dealt with by the Member States or the municipalities."
"It is these political levels of responsibility which should ensure, via their social policy, that all citizens get their right to a minimum level of subsistence."
"Whether this is done via social security benefits, the distribution of food or by other means should be their decision."
"The European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposes that the food aid be funded in full by the EU."
"The views that are put forward in this committee simply to get agricultural products on the market are astounding."
"As usual, the June List observes that, in this situation, it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision in respect of the EU's agricultural policy."
"Otherwise, the EU would fall into the trap of protectionism and of heavy subsidies to various groups within agriculture."
"in writing. - (NL) The Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) delegation in the European Parliament voted in favour of the Siekierski report, as we support food distribution to the poorest population groups in the EU."
"However, the VVD MEPs do not agree with the provisions of the report that state that the food distribution programmes must be funded exclusively from the EU budget."
"I voted in favour of this report because the food programme whose extension is being considered is a key instrument for helping the deprived who are suffering a great deal in the current economic crisis, even when it comes to meeting basic needs."
"In addition, it is a sensible measure in terms of using the EU's food resources effectively because it distributes the products which have been left unused to those who need them, while, at the same time, boosting demand on the EU's food market."
"I am in favour of such food aid assistance programmes receiving full funding from the EU budget as applying cofinancing rates would significantly impede the process and hamper the implementation of the measures in good time and the achievement of rapid results."
"However, I think that national authorities must be granted more functions with regard to administering the aid on site because they are more familiar with the situation at local level and with the population's specific needs."
"in writing. - (DA) The Danish Liberal Party's MEPs have voted against the European Commission's proposal on food distribution to the most deprived persons because the proposal has been tabled with a legal basis in agricultural policy, even though it is not an agricultural policy instrument."
"The agricultural budget should not be used to implement social policy."
"This is the responsibility of the Member States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski's report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community."
"I believe that the problem of poverty is highly relevant as, even in affluent Europe, more than 80 million people are at risk of poverty and the vast majority of these live in the countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur on the need to expand the range of products provided through this food aid programme and on the fact that the primary source of supply should be represented by reserves deriving from intervention in the agricultural markets, thus constituting an important aspect of the common agricultural policy."
"I also welcome the rapporteur's call for the entire funding for the food aid programme to be provided by the EU, since the Commission's co-financing proposal could lead Member States to limit their participation in the programme, particularly at times of economic hardship such as many states are currently experiencing."
"in writing. - The EU is India's top foreign investor and biggest trading partner."
"Forging an economic alliance is therefore vital to both."
"I support this report because it stresses that the agreement should ensure that increasing bilateral trade brings benefits to the widest number of people and contributes to the Millennium Development Goals, including preventing environmental degradation."
"However I regret that the EPP text replaced the more comm. text which was more progressive."
"India was the European Union's 17th most important trading partner in 2000 and ranked 9th in 2007, while between 2000 and 2006 EU trade in goods with India grew by around 80%."
"As a social-democrat, I welcome the fact that India has made considerable progress in terms of universal primary education, reducing poverty and increasing access to safe drinking water."
"However, I also note that India is still off track on most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) such as infant mortality, maternal health, child malnutrition and the battle against malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS."
"I voted for this report in order to approve the EU-India Free Trade Agreement, in the belief that an FTA offers future potential for an increase in investments, trade and business opportunities arising from the FTA, with an agreement being, overall, a win-win situation for both sides."
"The Free Trade Agreement with India marks another step taken by Europe and India towards opening up the world economy and expanding its benefits."
"It is also a particularly significant sign in the current context."
"I therefore welcome the conclusion of this agreement."
"Having examined it, however, I am forced to make a few more critical remarks."
"In order for free trade to function properly, a set of rules preventing counterfeiting and the use of products prohibited in the destination countries must be respected."
"Indications of origin must also be clear."
"In short, information must be available and transparent and international agreements must be respected."
"Another important aspect is the idea that the benefits of free trade are mutual."
"In other words, opening up borders does not only mean opening up the markets of developed countries to products from third countries."
"The virtues of free trade consist of the mutual opportunity to exchange goods and the opening up of economies; these virtues must be extended to developing or rapidly growing countries."
"This will only happen if the barriers to trade and investment in these countries are also reduced."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the report by Mr Karim on an EU-India Free Trade Agreement."
"This is because I believe that the conclusion of such agreements should be entirely subject to respect for fundamental human rights and democracy, which is far from being the case in the country in question."
"The insertion in the agreement of a human rights and democracy clause is clearly not enough to ensure that such basic conditions are respected, nor is the promise to scale up consultations within the United Nations Human Rights Council."
"Sadly the persecution of religious minorities and human rights defenders in India continues to be reported by the international press."
"In my opinion it is therefore frankly unacceptable to sign economic agreements of this kind."
"in writing. - (SV) This report claims that it is important for workers to be aware of their rights and have a good knowledge of labour law and collective agreements."
"The rapporteur also observes that the Posting of Workers Directive must be complied with and stresses the value of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"These are all desirable demands."
"However, some of the wordings in the report are too far-reaching."
"We cannot support wordings that advocate the introduction at EU level of a Community legal instrument to cover wages, social security contributions, taxes and compensation in relation to work-related accidents."
"These issues are too important for us to be able to support this type of wording or requirement."
"We have chosen to support the alternative resolution tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, as it restricts the wordings on the Community legal instrument."
"In the final vote on the report as a whole we will abstain as, while parts of the text are positive, the wordings relating to the Community legal instrument are too far-reaching."
"in writing. - I support this report which demands responsible and clear rules for Subcontracting in Europe."
"The report will protect employees who work for subcontracting companies by calling on the Commission to establish a clear-cut Community legal instrument introducing joint and several liability at European level."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Lehtinen's report on the social responsibility of subcontracting undertakings in production chains."
"I agree with the rapporteur that subcontracting has reached very high levels in the European Union, which has given rise to various problems linked, for example, to the legal implications for employers and workers and difficulties in verifying compliance with fiscal and social security responsibilities."
"I thus share the rapporteur's view that it would be advisable to adopt a system of 'joint liability' at European level, under which the main contractor would be encouraged to check that subcontractors comply with relevant legislation."
"This would also help to tackle the grey economy by preventing unfair competition on the part of businesses paying their workers at a rate less than the minimum rate of pay."
"in writing. - (NL) According to a study by the Dublin Foundation, outsourcing work to subcontractors is one of the most effective ways of undermining social legislation."
"Subcontractors are found in various sectors, of which construction is the best known."
"This report calls on the Commission to adopt definitive legislation on social responsibility in subcontracting throughout the whole production process."
"All too often, clients pass on the responsibility to subcontractors, who then themselves outsource work."
"As a result, the application of labour law is no longer monitored."
"Those who work for a subcontractor and are near the end of the production chain do not always do this in the best working conditions, and violations of basic standards and lack of respect for fundamental employment rights result."
"It is difficult for social law inspectorates to monitor this, since it is not always clear who bears responsibility at any one time."
"This then tempts subcontractors to take a less careful approach to social-security contributions, to respecting statutory tariffs and to complying with statutory rest periods."
"In some Member States it is already compulsory for clients to bear full social responsibility for all their subcontractors."
"The fact that the cross-border nature of work is now increasing greatly renders a European directive necessary."
"I therefore wholeheartedly endorse this report."
"In January 2009 food prices in Italy rose more than 40% above the average of the first 15 countries of the European Union, demonstrating severe distortions in the transfer of foodstuffs from field to plate."
"According to ISTAT data, in January 2009 the trend rate of growth of food prices stood at 3.7% in Italy, compared with 2.3% in France, 1.9% in Spain, 1% in Germany and 2.6% in the European Union."
"The ISTAT analysis also showed that the main differences between Italy and its EU partners were in relation to bread, pasta and cereals, which contain raw materials such as wheat, the price of which is fixed worldwide and does not differ between the various countries."
"The increase in the price differential between production and consumption confirms the existence of serious distortions in the transfer of foodstuffs from field to plate in Italy."
"The effects have been felt more keenly by low-income families, for whom food is the biggest item of expenditure. Small and medium-sized food-processing companies have also suffered severe consequences."
"The problem caused by the difference in the production price and the consumption price has reached the point where immediate action from the European institutions is required."
"I voted in favour of the report submitted by Mrs Batzeli (Greece) as I believe that the EU must come to the aid of producers and consumers."
"Due to abuses of their market dominance by large retail chains, the prices paid by European consumers are, on average, five times higher than farm gate prices."
"Farmers generally receive around 8% of the final retail price."
"We urge the introduction of EU policies which facilitate direct contacts between producers and consumers."
"The EU must support the use of new technologies and the Internet to provide consumers with more detailed information about products, while, at the same time, facilitating producers' access to the market."
"Measures are also needed to assign greater importance to the concept of 'local products' and to provide more effective support to traditional food markets or other traditional types of commerce."
"Traditional Romanian products must be supported on the European market."
"in writing. - (DA) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament - Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Britta Thomsen, Christel Schaldemose, Dan JÃ¸rgensen and Ole Christensen - have voted in favour of the report on food prices in Europe."
"It is the view of the delegation that the concentration of supermarkets and the lack of competition will mean that both consumers and farmers within the EU will lose out."
"However, the delegation does not agree with the statement in paragraph 6 of the report that it is deplorable that intervention measures are being dismantled."
"This is necessary in order to make European agriculture profitable."
"in writing. - (NL) I should like to give an explanation of vote on the Batzeli report on behalf of the Dutch delegation from the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA)."
"In our opinion, this is certainly not the most elegant of reports."
"Many points are worded in a long-winded way or duplicated."
"We also have our doubts about certain requirements that tend too much towards socialist state intervention, and also about a complete ban on selling below cost."
"This may sound like a nice idea, but is impracticable."
"In agriculture, we consider this an important point."
"With regard to dumping, action should of course be taken by the competition authority."
"In spite of this, we have voted in favour of the Batzeli report, since it contains a number of important elements that the alternative resolution actually seeks to delete."
"I refer, in particular, to the study into the margins in the various links in the food production chain and to the call for the European Commission to look into the power of supermarkets in the field of competition, as the European Parliament has already requested more than once."
"We understand from the European Commission that the study into margins can be carried out partly on the basis of existing data known to the Commission, and thus we assume that this study will not entail any substantial increase in administrative costs."
"I voted in favour of the report on food prices in Europe because I believe that political action is necessary to tackle the rise in prices of agricultural and food products and the discrepancy between the price received by the producer and the price paid by the consumer."
"In Europe, the price paid by the end consumer is approximately five times higher than the price paid to producers, a situation which has impacted on low-income households, in which food expenditure accounts for the largest slice of the family budget."
"in writing. - (SV) As usual, this 'opinion-soliciting' report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development contains proposals that will entail increased costs for the EU budget."
"We do not support the main ideas of the report, which, among other things, regrets the ongoing dismantling of Community intervention measures in the agricultural market. Neither are we in favour of the committee's proposal for 'market management measures'."
"The European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development also needs reminding that the price situation is different in different Member States."
"The committee's proposal to create a Europe-wide database for citizens containing reference prices for products and inputs and information on the costs of energy, pay, rents, duties and taxes from all across Europe is, in our opinion, detached from reality."
"The prerequisites for comparisons between the Member States simply do not exist for numerous different reasons."
"We also find the proposal for a special label for European agricultural products strange."
"What is the motive behind this?"
"An attempt to encourage protectionism?"
"As usual, the June List observes that, in this situation, it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision in respect of the EU's agricultural policy."
"Otherwise, the EU would fall into the trap of protectionism and of heavy subsidies to various groups within agriculture."
"We have voted against this report on food prices in Europe."
"in writing. - (FR) No one is challenging the aims of this report on the gap between producer prices and the prices paid by the consumer."
"Greater market transparency is required in order to ensure that producers are sufficiently remunerated and that the prices charged to end consumers are justified."
"Unfortunately, the text adopted in committee contains proposals that are incompatible with the social market economy."
"These highly authoritarian proposals on price control, margins and markets merely call to mind too many formulas that have failed and that we thought had been definitively consigned to the past."
"I regret that the report focuses solely on distributors instead of taking account of the production chain as a whole."
"Indeed, it is often large processing companies that buy produce from farmers and abuse their dominant market position in order to sell the produce on to distributors at exorbitant prices."
"Furthermore, creating European databases on all sorts of costs and margins, as the report proposes, would result in a considerable administrative cost for businesses, which would be passed on and absorbed into retail prices."
"In order to prevent such bad habits, I have tabled an alternative resolution, which 40 Members have signed to indicate their support."
"Regulation at EU level of the problem of unfair practices used by the large retail distribution chains against producers is very important for Romania."
"Even here the issue of abuses practised by supermarket chains is a concern for both producers and consumers."
"Apart from the accumulation of 'hidden charges', which are compulsory for any product and borne by producers, supermarkets ban producers from selling their products at lower prices in other stores."
"As a result of all these regulations, products are up to 30% more expensive."
"The consumer is ultimately the one who pays the product's overrated price."
"The measures proposed by Mrs Batzeli in her report are aimed at reducing the pressures exerted by supermarkets and promoting a direct relationship between consumers and producers."
"This is why I voted for its adoption."
"The investigation proposed in the report on the distribution of profit margins will allow us to draw a series of conclusions about the right measures for ensuring price transparency in the producer-processor-retailer chain and penalising abusive practices."
"The negotiation of prices between suppliers and retailers must allow the use of different prices on a case-by-case basis and therefore contribute to ensuring a healthy competitive environment."
"The report makes repeated, well-known findings about the monopoly situation that has arisen in food processing and marketing."
"However, it does not state that this situation is a conscious choice by the EU and the governments of the Member States within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy and the CAP."
"The liberalisation of the markets, the incentives for mergers and takeovers and the quest for profit and competitiveness in the food industry have resulted in the sovereignty of the multinationals, in higher consumer prices, in lower farm gate prices and in higher profits for capital."
"The CAP made a decisive contribution towards this development by abolishing minimum guaranteed prices and selling out farmers with small and medium-sized holdings to the WTO, so that the multinationals could obtain raw materials dirt cheap, and persecuting or shrinking the cooperatives, the hypocritical pronouncements of the parties which support the European one-way street notwithstanding."
"One example is milk production in Greece, where the milk cartel is pushing down farm gate prices and holding consumer prices sky high, thereby reaping huge profits."
"Nowadays it promotes the consumption of products with little reduced nutritional value, leaving thousands of livestock farmers, who are unable to market their produce in a country which produces 50% of its requirements, out on a limb."
"The fight for cheap and safe food and for the survival of poor farmers requires a strong alliance of workers, farmers and the self-employed and grassroots power and a grassroots economy."
"The rise in food prices in Europe is clear for all to see."
"It is a terrible problem requiring immediate action from the European Union."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report by Mrs Batzeli, who, I believe, handled the matter comprehensively and has proposed very useful measures to address the issue."
"It is imperative that we take steps to narrow the current gap between producer and consumer prices caused by the unhealthy price transmission mechanism that includes speculation on foodstuffs and a greater involvement of intermediaries."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the growing concentration of marketing and distribution of foodstuffs has contributed significantly to the increase in consumer prices compared with producer prices."
"There is an urgent need for measures such as those suggested by Mrs Batzeli for greater transparency of the pricing structure and profit margins through coordinated action by national competition authorities, for better regulation of the market and of price trends for food in Europe and for effectively encouraging consumers to choose locally produced foods, which by definition help to shorten the distribution chain and support traditional food markets that are currently in serious difficulty."
"in writing. - I have decided together with my colleagues from the European Parliamentary Labour Party, to support the original Report, which offers the most satisfactory response to the hundreds of petitions submitted by European citizens, victims of the massive rush for urbanisation in Spain, overbuilding and coastal destruction."
"The alternative resolutions tabled substantially modified the Report, and did not meet the consistent position we have held for 5 years now."
"in writing. - The report is a cosmetic exercise designed to maintain false hopes, among hundreds of petitioners, during the approach to the EU assembly's elections."
"It purports to be able to take actions, which - as the Committee on Legal Affairs points out - the EU is not competent to take; so that even Auken's threat to oppose the next EU budget, if the report's demands are not met, could not help those who have bought, and then been deprived of, properties in Spain."
"The UKIP will not contribute to this imposture."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report, which follows a huge number of petitions to Parliament by victims and concerned citizens from across Europe."
"This report demonstrates that the massive urbanisation in several regions of Spain has been carried out in a way which abuses property rights, degrades the environment, undermines water provision and quality, and often leaves victims bereft of any redress or compensation when they may have lost their life savings."
"I hope that this report will assist many of my constituents and citizens from across Europe who have been affected by this, in their battle for justice."
"in writing. - Due to a conflict of interest, I abstained from all votes."
"in writing. - (SV) We understand that there may be major problems within the construction sector in Spain and that it may be the case that unsuspecting citizens purchase properties in good faith which it later transpires the construction company did not have the legal right to build."
"However, these are problems that can and should be solved within the Member State's legal framework."
"When all domestic remedies have been exhausted in accordance with Article 35 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, individual citizens can turn to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"There is no reason to introduce any legislation at EU level to deal with these issues or for the European Parliament as an institution to get involved in this matter."
"Nor do we wish to have any involvement with the various alternative draft resolutions tabled by Spanish Members, which add domestic policy complications to the matter."
"in writing. - I am submitting an explanation of vote on the Auken report in support of three separate constituents who have contacted me pleading for help."
"In each of these three cases, the constituent has spent his or her life savings on the purchase of a house and land in Valencia."
"In each case, proper legal procedures were followed at the time of the purchase."
"But, in each case, the constituent has subsequently had to suffer illegal land-grabbing demands by the Valencian authorities."
"These are just three of many thousands of cases of injustice suffered by European citizens owning property in Spain."
"I ask the Commission to act swiftly and decisively in accordance with the recommendations of the Auken report."
"I have voted in favour of the Auken Report, since it clearly criticises the reckless town planning by the Spanish state, and highlights the misuse of Community funds in planning and environment matters."
"I should also like to stress the ineffectuality of the Spanish Members from the People's Party (PP) and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE)."
"They were incapable of reaching an agreement to table an alternative resolution that would achieve the majority they needed; hence they both ended up defeated."
"They have made it quite clear once again that the only issue they can agree on is their opposition to Basque nationalism."
"The Socialists and the PP tried to pressurise their fellow Members to vote in favour of their respective resolutions, which greatly mitigated the criticisms made by the rapporteur."
"I want to make it clear that the Spanish Government participates in a practice that is systematically linked to mistreatment of its citizens, destruction of the environment and large-scale corruption."
"I feel that the powers in question should be immediately transferred to Euskadi."
"in writing. - Thousands of European citizens continue to be victims of a system of massive urbanisation, expressed in a very large number of petitions concerning the abuse of the legitimate rights of European citizens to their property and environment."
"The problem has been caused by public procurement with insufficient control of the urbanisation procedures by local and regional authorities."
"The resolution adopted should begin to bring concrete solutions to people living in the affected areas in Spain."
"Having been involved from the start in the formulation of the Auken report, which has garnered the support of both the Spanish and the European people, I have defended its content wholeheartedly."
"I fully support this report because it clearly reveals the involvement of all the Spanish administrations, from central government to the autonomous regional governments, to the local authorities, in developing an economic model based on urban speculation, which has been devastating for the environment, the economy and social development in Spain."
"This report, which has withstood pressure from the People's Party (PP) and the Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), highlights the leniency of both political and judicial resolutions on this issue, which has led to impunity within the authorities."
"It also includes the declaration of a moratorium on those development plans that do not comply with the criteria of environmental sustainability and social responsibility, so that irregularities can be investigated and a policy of faits accomplis can be avoided."
"Furthermore, the report requires the Spanish Government to set up a working party in which all the administrations will participate."
"It calls for a public debate about urban planning in Spain, which will allow legislative measures to be adopted against speculation and unsustainable development, and will put an end to Ã  la carte legislation practised in autonomous regions such as AragÃ³n and Valencia."
"I voted in favour of the Auken report on the impact of extensive urbanisation in Spain on individual rights of European citizens, on the environment and on the application of EU law, on the basis of petitions which I have received."
"There is a great deal of evidence which shows that excessive urbanisation is being carried out in coastal areas, and responsibility for this lies with central, autonomous and local authorities."
"They have set in motion a model for unsustainable development that has had extremely serious environmental, social and economic consequences."
"As a result of this activity, irretrievable damage has been caused to the biodiversity and environmental integrity of many regions of Spain."
"In response to such charges procedures are slow and sentences handed down do not provide satisfaction to the victims."
"This has caused people to have reservations about the Spanish justice system."
"It should also be emphasised that thousands of European citizens, who bought property in Spain in a variety of circumstances, have become victims of abuses connected with urbanisation."
"These abuses were committed by local authorities, but as a result the properties face demolition."
"In connection with these facts the Spanish Government should be called upon to carry out a thorough review of legislation affecting the rights of individual property owners as a result of massive urbanisation, in order to bring an end to the abuse of rights and obligations enshrined in the EC Treaty."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and say that I welcome her report on the impact of extensive urbanisation in Spain on individual rights of European citizens, on the environment and on the application of EU law; this impact has been particularly negative, as testified by the numerous petitions received from residents in the area."
"I think that in this case the Committee on Petitions has taken due account of the requests from citizens who are concerned about the destruction of the natural landscape, the failure to respect rules on contracts and environmental protection, and the huge-scale building activity."
"The evidence brought by this committee following fact-finding missions in the area have clearly shown the encroachment caused by the construction industry and the need to defend the rights of Spanish citizens as enshrined in the treaties."
"I therefore support the report in question; it is perfectly in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, and I hope that the local authorities in Spain will take the necessary measures without the need for the European Commission to resort to infringement proceedings."
"in writing. - We voted in favour of the report in sympathy with the complainants."
"However, we are of the opinion that the alleged breaches of Spanish, EU and international law should be dealt with and solved by the relevant Spanish authorities, the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights."
"in writing. - I am pleased Parliament voted in favour of this report."
"Many Scottish people have been affected by the Spanish land grab, losing their homes which many have saved a lifetime to afford."
"The Spanish Government must do all it can to bring justice to those people affected."
"Many people were misled and lied to over what they were buying and there must be a legal remedy to the situation."
"in writing. - We voted in favour of the report on urbanisation in Spain because it reflects the result of several years of detailed work by the Committee on Petitions to respond to hundreds of related petitions by several thousand petitioners, including fact-finding visits and discussions with all interested parties and it was adopted by a large cross-party majority in committee."
"We have a duty as elected representatives to ensure that European citizens whom we have encouraged to make use of their free movement rights should not then be subjected to arbitrary or unjustified restrictions in the host state."
"We recognise that the primary responsibility under the Treaties for the monitoring of the application of Community law lies with the Commission."
"We also recognise that the Treaties explicitly exclude any effect on domestic rules governing the system of property ownership."
"However, we also believe, firstly, that Parliament's Petitions Committee, as the 'eyes and ears' of the institutions, should highlight any systematic problems affecting the free movement of thousands of our citizens which are brought to light by the petitions process."
"Secondly, we consider that violations of Community law appear to be at issue, in particular environmental law and public procurement rules."
"in writing. - As a fervent opponent of the EU and its continual meddling in our lives, I have consistently voted against the vast majority of reports that I have been asked to consider."
"As is inevitable, a report will come along that simply demands a different approach and I believe that the Auken report is one."
"I have been approached by many expats, all of whom did everything they could to establish a proper, legal and sustainable life in Spain."
"That they became victims of a clash of bureaucracies is now a matter of history and hopefully this report will compel an equitable solution."
"My action here does not imply a softening of my attitude to the EU and its impenetrable, inflexible and unaccountable structure."
"However, if subordinate bureaucracies will not solve the problems they themselves create, then a solution must be found."
"I hope now that the myriad problems created by the various Spanish authorities will be addressed and that such will be promptly resolved in the best interests of my constituents."
"I have a nagging worry that such intervention may not be the solution."
"In the land of the EU, the only continuing law is that of the unintended consequence."
"I voted in favour."
"I see in Obama's election an important opportunity for a new policy of global commitment, a turning point in the history of the United States and also for the whole world."
"The way forward should be a new policy of global commitment, in which the EU will play its key role."
"We now have the opportunity to renew the global commitment through renewed institutions in view of the upcoming European elections."
"The victory of the Democrat candidate is further proof of the extraordinary capacity for renewal that has been evident so many times at difficult points in US history."
"The new US leadership could lead to an improved EU/US common policy, the two sides working together in an effective partnership on many global issues that the leaders of both continents must face, such as climate change, global challenges, regional issues, defence, economic matters and trade."
"We must tackle these problems together, with determination and creativity."
"Obama embodies what is positive and impressive about the United States and today's complex and globalised world, in which change is constant."
"The transatlantic link remains essential."
"I have faith in the role that the US will continue to play in this regard under the leadership of President-Elect Obama."
"in writing. - (NL) This voluminous report rightly advocates a deepening of relations between Europe and the United States."
"The Middle East, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia, defence, security and economic and commercial matters are discussed in detail."
"It is unacceptable, however, that the rapporteur expressly anticipates the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, when it has become clear that the majority of citizens want nothing to do with the European Constitution or a carbon copy of it."
"It is good that the rapporteur devotes attention to the Palestinian issue, but why is there no mention of Israel's right to security?"
"On account of this bias, I voted against this report."
"The Mon report raises the subject of transatlantic relations in the aftermath of the presidential elections in the USA."
"I endorsed the report, because I think that today it is essential for there to be close cooperation between the United States and the European Union in practically all areas: politics, defence, the economy, energy, the environment, culture, science etc."
"We should be aware that the combined gross domestic products of the United States and the European Union make up more than 50% of world GDP."
"The New Transatlantic Agenda, which has been in force since 1995, should be replaced by a framework understanding on the Transatlantic Partnership, which would be systematically updated."
"The USA and the EU are of necessity engaged in activities to uphold world security and order."
"Of course, this requires cooperation with other countries, especially China, India and Russia."
"I also consider the remarks on the need to reform the UN to be correct, including the need to reform the working of the Security Council."
"Transatlantic cooperation must not ignore the role of NATO."
"Today, we should recognise rapid and effective action to slow down the growing economic crisis to be the most important."
"I will also add that in these relations we should also include a place for Canada, Mexico and South America."
"We should hope that the words spoken by the current President of the USA, Barack Obama, that 'America has no better partner than Europe' will be confirmed by everyday reality."
"This is essential if we are to be equal to the challenges faced by our civilisation."
"The European Parliament's 'huge expectations' from the election of Barack Obama as President of the United States of America in fact only concern the imperialists who, with good cause, expect their interests to be served more effectively."
"The people should not entertain any illusions that there will be a change of policy for their benefit."
"Moreover, the statements and pronouncements by the new US President himself leave no margin for doubt."
"The report calls for closer and deeper cooperation between the EU and the US and ÎÎÎ¤Î, following the election in question."
"It therefore proposes the creation of a body to coordinate the foreign and security policy of the two imperialist centres (ÎU and USA) at an even higher level."
"At a time when competition and antagonism are escalating between them as a result of the capitalist financial crisis, European and American imperialists are, at the same time, endeavouring to coordinate their cooperation in order to deal with grassroots opposition."
"That is the aim behind the call for joint and effective action to tackle 'global challenges', 'defence and security questions' and 'regional issues'."
"The willingness expressed in the report to accept Guantanamo inmates in the EU, should the US so request, is a typical example."
"The people must set up their own common front against the united attack on them by the EU, the USA and ÎÎÎ¤Î and overturn the imperialist order."
"I voted against Mr MillÃ¡n Mon's report on the state of transatlantic relations in the aftermath of the US elections, because I do not think it is right that the European Union, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the corresponding foreign policy instruments, will take on a stronger and more coherent role on the international geopolitical stage."
"Furthermore, I do not entirely agree on the roles of the transatlantic partnership and NATO in collective security."
"in writing. - I attach enormous importance to the transatlantic relationship and have consistently argued for revitalising and strengthening NATO."
"Contrary to the main thrust of this report, however, I do not believe that this should mean replacing the strong links between the United States and individual member states (Britain in particular) with an 'EU-US partnership'."
"The references to the Treaty of Lisbon, which our people do not want, and the proposal that the putative Commission Vice-President/High Representative should co-chair a new 'Transatlantic Political Council', are examples of this."
"In addition, I have specific objections to aspects of the report dealing with EU defence."
"The report welcomes 'an enhanced European defence capability' and explicitly endorses the European Security and Defence Policy, to which Conservative opposition has been constant."
"For these reasons I abstained on the report."
"I would prefer to abstain from the vote on the motion for a resolution on an EC-Turkmenistan trade agreement."
"While I recognise the importance of economic and trade relations in the opening up of Turkmen society, I doubt whether an interim agreement is the best solution for both parties."
"in writing. - (NL) I voted against this resolution because, in my opinion, it would mean Parliament undermining its own credibility."
"This House is always making rhetorical declarations on human rights and emphasising that human rights are the most important objective of foreign policy - yet now it is going to sign an agreement with a country that violates these very human rights on a massive scale."
"The underlying belief is always that the mere fact of signing such an agreement improves human rights in the country concerned."
"We hear the same story from the advocates of Turkish accession: yes, human rights are violated and torture is widespread, but once Turkey joins the EU that will all be a thing of the past."
"The facts prove the opposite, however."
"I have decided to abstain from the vote on Mr Caspary's report on the interim trade agreement with Turkmenistan."
"I can only endorse certain points of the proposal and not the document as a whole."
"This has led me not to vote against it, but rather to abstain."
"I voted in favour."
"Nowadays the Internet has become the basis for all our personal and institutional relations."
"Our personal information is now owned by many companies who frequently make use of our private data without due permission."
"For all these reasons it is clear that we need to protect the fundamental right to privacy on the Internet."
"The Internet can also provide considerable support for other fundamental rights, such as freedom of speech, of political action and of association."
"On the other hand, however, it opens up a wide range of criminal activity."
"An example of this perverted use of the web is the rising scourge of child pornography that is now flooding the Internet and which we have a responsibility to curtail."
"It is therefore necessary to take concrete steps to protect and promote the fundamental freedoms of individuals when surfing the web."
"Our action must be founded on privacy and security, paying constant attention to the fundamental right to education and access to information systems."
"The Internet constitutes a huge technological advance, which allows users to connect with each other, personal, professional and educational relationships to be established, knowledge to be disseminated, and culture to be promoted and enhanced."
"Internet crime has proliferated, however, and the Internet has become a favoured tool of criminal networks, given that it is easily accessible, cheap and very powerful."
"In the last year, cases of Internet abuse of children have risen by 16%, without there having been any effective punishment in most cases or even the ability to find these criminals."
"As regards terrorism, there are already around 5 000 terrorist propaganda sites, which form a means of radicalisation and recruitment, as well as serving as a source of information on terrorist methods and resources."
"I recognise the urgent need to find solutions and develop appropriate legislative instruments to fight crime, without this leading to excessive and unreasonable control through censorship and the secret monitoring of Internet data traffic."
"in writing. - (NL) This is a good resolution that strikes a careful balance between rights and obligations and represents a courageous appeal against censorship."
"Recent years have indeed seen too many attempts, in the name of political correctness, to subject even the Internet to censorship, so that controversial ideas are excluded from not only the printed press but also the World Wide Web."
"Indeed, the Web has long been a thorn in the side of the inquisitors controlling the media, who wish to outlaw any criticism of the multicultural society, for example, via 'racism legislation'."
"Freedom on the Internet is the best guarantee of freedom of expression."
"I voted in favour of the Lambrinidis report on strengthening security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet, because I deem it essential that the European Union takes steps to reconcile the fundamental rights of Internet users with the fight against cybercrime, in order to protect citizens, particularly children."
"As a result, I feel it is essential to develop legislation on data protection, security and freedom of expression."
"in writing. - (SV) The freedom of expression and the right to a private life are absolute rights that must under no circumstances be undermined."
"Naturally enough, we believe that these rights also apply to the Internet, thereby guaranteeing the individual's right to free expression."
"We also think that the possibility of removing personal information from databases and websites should be considered a given and we would urge companies to guarantee that individuals can have their personal data deleted from databases."
"However, we believe that the lack of such a guarantee is first and foremost an international problem which is therefore best solved by means of international regulations and conventions."
"The June List is very much in favour of the guarantee of security and the fundamental freedoms on the Internet, but we are opposed to some of the wordings in the report."
"For example, the report expresses the desire to proceed with the adoption of the Directive on criminal measures aimed at the enforcement of intellectual property rights."
"We are strongly opposed to this, as we do not want the harmonisation of European criminal law."
"The rapporteur also seeks to compare the right to the Internet with the right to access to schooling."
"We are of the opinion that this is an arrogant statement, as the right and opportunity to attend school are far from foregone conclusions in many EU Member States."
"However, the good intentions of the report outweigh the negatives and we have therefore chosen to vote in favour of it."
"I fully support the Lambrinidis report on security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet."
"I think it is very important and necessary, mainly because our presence on the global web is almost universal."
"In a word, the Internet has become part of our daily life."
"We cannot imagine a better source of information, whether we are writing a book, or whether we want to make a sophisticated dish and are looking for an interesting recipe."
"But we are not always aware that our presence on the Internet leaves traces which can be used against us, for example by people engaged in marketing, by intelligence services, and even by identity thieves."
"On the other hand, the Internet can also be a convenient communication tool for criminals and terrorists."
"That is why it is so difficult to prepare reasonable legislation, which in a balanced and effective way will allow people to use all the benefits of the Internet safely, while at the same time curtailing the very real and serious threats connected with its abuse."
"Therefore I support the rapporteur's proposals, which aim to strike the right balance between the privacy and security of individuals on the web, while fully respecting their fundamental rights and freedoms."
"I also think that alongside concern for quality of service, the public authorities are responsible for ensuring Internet access for the poorest people and for those who live even in the most isolated regions of the country."
"Internet use and development are without doubt a source of important progress, especially where freedom of expression and democracy are concerned."
"Striking a balance between such freedom, the protection of privacy and the need for Internet security represents a real challenge for us all."
"This is particularly the case where political action is concerned."
"Indeed, some people on the opposition side or who may hold controversial political views do not have access to the various media and see in the Internet an opportunity to convey their message throughout the world."
"Such freedom should not be censored."
"China, Cuba and Burma, as true totalitarian states, have no hesitation in gagging such freedom of expression by systematically censoring and filtering information with contempt for all the principles of democracy and freedom."
"Internet filtering for the sake of combating pornography, child pornography and terrorism is crucial, but such vigilance must be strictly defined and controlled."
"The Lambrinidis report is the first report to deal with the problem of the Internet from the user's perspective as its main topic."
"I voted in favour of it because I believe that it is a balanced, relevant report which deals with the main topics of interest in this area."
"As rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group on this report, I think that the recognition of the user's rights over the posted content, particularly the right to delete this content permanently, and the request that the future regulatory mechanism define the digital identity and propose specific measures for protecting it are important contributions."
"The report highlights the importance of cooperation between the entities involved in developing the Internet, with a view to devising instruments for self-regulation or coregulation (for example, codes of good practice) supplementing existing legal regulations."
"Given the rapid pace of the Internet's development, these regulatory methods are far more effective than traditional legislation as they are approved and applied by the majority of entities concerned, without any coercion from the state."
"The Internet is the largest public access area in the world and the rate of its development may take us by surprise if we do not decide to deal with this topic in a balanced, realistic way so that future regulation of cyberspace focuses more specifically on the user."
"I have voted in favour of Mr Lambrinidis's report on strengthening security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet."
"I wholeheartedly support the aims of the draft, which are to involve all interested parties, to act on different levels using existing national, regional and international instruments and, lastly, to exchange best practices, in order to provide a response in line with the requirements and problems of different kinds of Internet users and the numerous types of online activities."
"in writing. - I support this report's aims to strengthen security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on safe recycling of ships as I feel that it is vital for this issue to be tackled as an integral part of a ship's lifecycle."
"End-of-life ships should be regarded as hazardous waste, as a result of the hazardous substances that they contain, and should therefore fall within the scope of the Basel Convention."
"I am happy to see that there is a Community will to improve ship dismantling practices."
"The EU's environmental protection goals can only be fully achieved if they are integrated into the various sectors of Community policy."
"As a result, this motion for a resolution aims to speed up all the steps that the Union must take to ensure that the dismantling of end-of-life ships occurs under safe conditions for workers and with adequate protection of the marine environment."
"The global phase-out of single-hull oil tankers and the backlog of old vessels now being withdrawn from the market, many of which contain hazardous substances, allow us to predict an uncontrolled expansion in sub-standard facilities in South Asia, which may even spread to African countries."
"All these reasons lead us to support this motion for a resolution and also all the steps aimed at ensuring compliance with international rules on safety and the environment."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"Our sitting is now going to be suspended."
"It will be resumed at 3 p.m. - shortly - with an oral question on the role of culture in the development of European regions."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"The role of culture in the development of European regions (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Doris Pack, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the role of culture in the development of European regions (B6-0226/2009)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we are meeting at an unusual time, but still, the oral question that we put today was born in the 'A Soul for Europe' intergroup."
"We believe that we will find this soul in our oldest units - the regions - where people communicate with one another with their particular accent, a specific dialect or even a regional language, where the local cuisine has its own specific taste, where truly local fruit and vegetables are sold at markets, where particular folk songs still reside, where particular tales and myths originate: in short, where people feel they belong, where they feel at home."
"The march of globalisation threatens to standardise so much, and many unique features will disappear."
"Only Europe's wonderful regions can safeguard that specialness and they must be able to rely on the protection of the European Union."
"The richness and variety of the regions of Europe - they were often enemies, they were occupied, they were divided up, they were destroyed by war and re-united - must be retained."
"The regions are like our stem cells."
"The European Union has maintained something like a culture of the small and is bound by human rights in this area, too."
"Our brief debate today and the resolution should spur the Commission into finding ways to make the cultural richness of the regions even more visible and into finding ways for the EU to contribute to its preservation and continued development."
"Europe's cultural potential must be used strategically."
"In 2009, the year of creativity and innovation, the possibilities of integrating ideas and initiatives from the public and civil service sector at the local and regional level should be exploited in a meaningful way."
"I would like to say to the Members of the Committee on Regional Development that we have absolutely no intention of curtailing existing regional policy - we merely wish to add to its cultural dimension."
"We implore the Commission to do its part, too."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, allow me first of all to thank you for the opportunity, on behalf of Commissioner FigeÄ¾, to address the place of culture in our policies and its particular contribution to the development of European regions and cities."
"The importance of culture is taken into consideration in different ways at Community level."
"In the context of the EU's cohesion policy, regional and local strategies have successfully integrated culture to support creativity and to promote innovation."
"Cohesion policy supports, for instance, the protection of our cultural heritage, the development of cultural infrastructure and services, the development of regional attractiveness and its link with sustainable tourism, but also the regeneration of local economies and the development of cross-border strategies."
"In 2007, the Commission launched the European Agenda for Culture, which is now in its first stages of implementation."
"This new strategic approach to culture sets common objectives and aims to propel the economic, social and political value of culture by strengthening its transversal role."
"In this framework, the Commission and the Member States are cooperating under a new open method of cooperation to strengthen joint efforts in areas with a direct impact on local and regional development strategies."
"This will, for instance, help maximise the potential of creative and cultural industries, in particular SMEs; promote access to culture, and encourage the mobility of cultural professionals."
"Feeding into the ongoing reflection, the Commission will soon launch an independent study on the contribution of culture to local and regional economic development as part of the European regional policy."
"The results of this study will help underline the value of investing in the cultural and creative sectors and will illustrate the links between such investment, specific regional development objectives and the Lisbon Agenda for growth and jobs."
"The study will also contribute to the preparation of a green paper on the potential of cultural and creative industries, which is currently under preparation and is due for adoption by the Commission in early 2010."
"The Commission regularly organises conferences with representatives from local and regional authorities."
"Let me simply highlight the open days, which every year bring together in Brussels a large number of stakeholders to debate a wide range of issues relating to regional and cohesion policy."
"Aspects relating to culture have been regularly considered in the context of these workshops."
"Moreover, within the context of other European policies, such as the EU's integrated maritime policy, the Commission also endeavours to involve civil society actors in highlighting Europe's rich maritime heritage."
"Thus, next May, during the European Maritime Day celebrations in Rome, stakeholders will examine the links between maritime heritage and sustainable regional tourism, amongst others."
"Finally, I also wish to mention the European Cultural Forum, which will be organised for the first time by the Commission, in the context of the European Agenda for Culture in Brussels, on 29 and 30 September, and will bring together representatives of the cultural sector and national authorities, including local and regional authorities."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to start by welcoming the initiative on such an interesting issue as the role of culture in the development of the regions of the European Union."
"Cultural heritage is an important element in the identity and in the history of the development of the peoples of Europe."
"Protecting and maintaining it is therefore especially important to the education of the young generation and, at the same time, to respect for the European identity."
"Regardless of its European, national or local dimension, cultural heritage is a fundamental value for European citizens."
"We all know that the focus is on the large towns where the most famous museums and monuments are to be found."
"However, it is a fact that the European countryside, which accounts for 90% of European territory, is suffering from abandonment and economic stagnation."
"European programmes with a cultural content therefore help considerably in developing economic activity in the regions."
"It is not only the supply of work and employment, it is the creation of poles of attraction for cultural and historic tourism that will contribute to the sustainable development of these areas."
"We therefore consider that culture contributes directly towards the development of the cultural education of Europeans and indirectly towards economic prosperity, especially in the regions which are most in need of focus and development."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I am very pleased indeed to have this opportunity to discuss this debate."
"It is only unfortunate that we are doing it on a Thursday afternoon when it is not quite as well attended as perhaps it should be."
"I do think this is an important debate in the context of the current economic climate."
"We have already heard discussion about culture and jobs and how culture industries and people working in culture can contribute to the economy and can really help."
"At the precarious times we are facing now - which we have heard already in this Parliament - it is important that we discuss these matters as fully as we can."
"I am here also because I do actually represent one of those big cities that the previous speaker mentioned."
"London, as you all know, is one of the cultural centres of the EU with - as we all have - enormous history and very much to offer."
"It is also the centre of, certainly the British, cultural industries."
"So I think I have a role here to speak for the people that I represent and to fight for those jobs which, when things get bad, are very often the first jobs to go."
"So I very much welcome what the Commission has said about the role of cultural industries, about how we want to preserve and to build on those and how there is an economic role for culture."
"I feel that, very often, that economic role is ignored, and we do not talk about it; we do not even think about it, and we relegate culture to second-class status."
"That is not acceptable, particularly when culture can be so very important in our national and regional development."
"I hope that one of the things to come out of this debate today - that we take back to our Member States, and the Commission and the Council take back - is that we are very concerned about how this regional development happens, how we deal with this and the role that culture can play in that."
"Also, as Mrs Pack has already said, there is the whole question of cultural diversity."
"I think one of the great strengths of the EU, and of the European Parliament, is that we all come together - now with 27 Member States - and are actually very different, in many ways: different backgrounds and cultures, and obviously different languages."
"That is just a start."
"Although the world is getting smaller and although people come together more, there are still these significant differences."
"We should be celebrating them, because those differences are at the very core of the things that we talk about."
"We all want to preserve our identities and how we feel about ourselves, and we need to do that."
"In this context, I think we also need to take on board that we are getting people coming into our continent."
"We are getting people from other parts of the world - many of whom are now in second and third generations in some of our Member States - who come from different backgrounds again."
"I think we also need to take on board that they come with their own culture, tradition and languages."
"Although we integrate them and they learn our languages, they are still there with their own separate identities."
"That is an issue which has not been mentioned in this debate, which I think is an important one and one that we, I hope, can integrate, particularly when we talk about issues such as multilingualism, which we have had good debates on."
"It is an extremely important issue, and I think one we should perhaps give more prominence to than we have done, but in the context of a Europe which is changing."
"We therefore need to preserve our existing cultures and our existing diversity and actually absorb the new diversity which has come, and which is continuing to come, into our continent."
"For all of these reasons, I welcome the support that we are giving to culture and to cultural industries, support to small and medium-enterprises, which I think - in the current economic climate - are possibly going to be the backbone of what we will be looking at."
"If large corporations and large enterprises are losing people, making people redundant and laying people off, it may well be up to the smaller outfits - the SMEs - to pick up this slack and to actually go out there and create employment for those who can work in this sector."
"So I hope we will all recognise just how important the role of culture is in our continent and our society and that those of us who have actually turned up for this debate will take the message back to our Member States, to the regions and to the people we represent."
"I know we have got a good message to say, so let us go out there and spread the word."
"Madam President, regions are an extremely important place for the development of culture."
"It is there that most long-lasting exchange programmes and joint projects between areas of different traditions, customs and achievements arise."
"Regions stimulate the development of culture, and culture - important, attractive projects and events - becomes a magnet which attracts economic investment."
"This is the classic knock-on effect, which is best illustrated by the effects of the splendid European Capital of Culture programme."
"Economic revival always follows the year of cultural events."
"This is understood by the numerous European cities trying to take part in the project."
"Culture is a great opportunity, especially for areas which are underdeveloped but rich in natural resources or tourist and recreation attractions due to their geographical location."
"Therefore it is particularly important to be aware of the significant role of regional authorities and to stimulate their activity by special European Union programmes."
"I expect the Commission to submit a green paper shortly, presenting a broad concept of measures in the area of culture, including the key matter of the level of regions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me finally to draw attention to the initiative to establish the year 2013 as European Year of Learning the Languages of our Neighbours."
"Dynamic development of regional cooperation in Europe is often hampered by problems related to a lack of knowledge of the language and culture of neighbouring countries and regions, and a lack of ability to communicate fully."
"Learning the language of an immediate neighbour can be a great leap forward for mutual understanding and communication, and therefore for strengthening cultural and economic cooperation and consolidating the entire European Community."
"Madam President, I think that in this debate it is worth recalling the characteristic words of Jacques Delors, the former President of the European Commission."
"When asked, after he had finished his term of office as President of the Commission, if there was anything he regretted or if there had not been enough of something, he admitted that the European Union and the Commission had devoted too little time to matters of culture."
"And I think that his characteristic self-criticism could be a signpost for us."
"I agree with the speaker who spoke about the strange priorities of our Parliament."
"We say that culture is important, and that it is not only priorities like institutions, administration and regulations which are important."
"Then we speak about these things on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning."
"Only the debate on Thursday afternoon is about matters which could be called fundamental - about culture, because culture is in fact the foundation of European unity."
"Not only the culture of regions, but also national culture, because the heritage of Europe is in fact the heritage of European nations, and this is perhaps especially true of our cultural heritage."
"I am glad that this subject has been raised."
"I am glad because I suppose it will become increasingly important in the work of Parliament and also of the EU executive, especially the Commission and the Council."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the wording of the questions as formulated by my colleague Doris Pack."
"In my view multilateral support for the European regions is very important."
"There used to be borders in Europe separating states and nations from each other for centuries, creating a kind of psychological no-man's land."
"Fortunately we have now succeeded in eliminating borders through the Schengen agreement, but regions remain divided, cities are cut in half and psychological problems in particular persist, as one piece of territory belongs here or there and another somewhere else."
"In an increasingly integrated Europe these ancient scars on the map and in people's minds are healing safely but slowly."
"The fastest way to make them whole, much more effectively and practically than all of the top-down measures, is to support civic initiatives and the activities of cultural organisations and regional institutions."
"The regional institutions and ordinary people living in this or that territory know best what needs to be done to revive their region."
"There are many projects whose implementation would represent both a step forwards and an impulse for further action."
"I come from the region of Northern Moravia, from Silesia, an area where Czech, Polish and Slovak territory all meet."
"And it is precisely there, in the historic TÄÅ¡Ã­n region which today comprises the Czech town of ÄeskÃ½ TÄÅ¡Ã­n and Polish Cieszyn, that a project has been created called ""A Garden on Both Banks of the Riverâ since there is a river flowing between the two towns which once formed a single urban unit."
"The project is putting in place links between the two river banks that are not only of an urban nature, but are also architectural and above all cultural."
"Both divided sections of the formerly homogenous whole must be linked through the cultural activities of the inhabitants."
"The river between the two towns and their surroundings must become a place of cultural exchange and cultural overlap."
"However, an important aspect of such projects is the new employment opportunities created not only during the implementation of the work but also afterwards."
"The service sector will certainly expand, increasing the attractiveness of the area and supporting the potential for tourism and other sorts of related enterprise."
"The authors of the ""Garden on Both Banks of the Riverâ project were inspired by the example of Strasbourg in France and Kehl in Germany, which were also such close neighbours that they formed a natural urban structure."
"Also here the Rhine flows between both cities."
"What is happening in France and Germany can also happen in the Czech Republic and Poland or anywhere else in Europe."
"There are many more examples of this in Central Europe."
"When we talk of the share of culture in developing Europe's regions it is precisely these projects that come to mind."
"The EU, the Commission and the European Parliament should support cultural projects of this type even more than they have done to date."
"The authors of civil initiatives often complain that these activities are unduly held up by complicated bureaucracy or overly-complicated structures in the relevant ministries and offices."
"Madam President, I come with two questions for the Commissioner."
"One: what is culture?"
"And two: what on earth has it got to do with the European Union?"
"In my region lies the historic county of Northamptonshire."
"Part of its cultural identity, its history, its fabric, comes from its historic ties with the shoemaking industry."
"Shoemaking in the county was first recognised in the year 1202, when Peter the Cordwainer was almost famous within the county."
"In 1452 the court regulated prices and weights for various traders, including the cordwainers, and Northampton itself has served as a home to the shoe industry for all that time."
"In 1841, according to the census list, there were 1 821 shoemakers within the county."
"The county's football team, Northampton Football Club, is still referred to as 'the Cobblers', and in Northamptonshire now we have 34 shoe factories still open, all over 100 years old."
"I am wearing a pair of Barker shoes today from a village called Earls Barton in the wonderful Westminster constituency of Daventry."
"We have a museum, we have cultural events around the shoemaking industry - and it all came before the European Union."
"So, whilst I completely understand the role of culture in countries' regions, I wonder if or how the European Union can help us in these things."
"And what are Europe's regions?"
"I think we should leave it to culture in Europe's regions to develop as it always has done - locally, organically, and not centrally government-led."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for accommodating me."
"I would like to expand our vision slightly and look to the future, not just the past."
"We are in a situation where we are seeing that growth cannot always be continual, rather it is restricted by the limited nature of natural resources and the limited capacity of the earth to absorb and metabolise our waste."
"We can no longer base our view solely on material growth - our concept of development - instead we must see development with stronger reference to quality of life: we must, in essence, dematerialise our society."
"From this perspective, regions are equally important for their cultural wealth - meaning the richness of their quality of life - which is extremely important at a time like the present when our lifestyle must change completely."
"In this context of dematerialisation, a region's wealth in terms of its quality of life is thus extremely important, I would even say absolutely indispensable."
"I would therefore like to direct both the Commission and Parliament towards an understanding of the change in lifestyle that we must effect, a dematerialisation of our societies and therefore a cultural work, which will become irreplaceable as we have to substitute immaterial wealth for material assets."
"This regional experience is thus something that we must try to understand and preserve before it is swept away by a whole series of oversights."
"For this reason I would ask that we proceed with this debate, because it is so essential and because we must simply change our way of life."
"(PL) Madam President, the beauty of culture comes from its regional and local diversity, which changes with the development of society."
"Regional cultures, which are deeply founded on tradition, form a strong basis for national cultures and their many variations."
"With their colourfulness of form and expression they have great appeal, and they provide artistic stimulation, carry experience and emotion, and strengthen the bonds of local society."
"Regional cultures are being pushed aside by the professional artists who draw inspiration from them."
"It is often thought that regional culture has to be an amateur movement, whereas a professional movement should be given strong financial support."
"This is probably the source of the tendency, also seen in the EU, to finance big and expensive projects, including international projects which involve professional artists from different countries."
"Regional and local cultures are gradually dying, and numerous forms of their expression, and their disciplines and creative skills are disappearing."
"Today we can talk of the traditional and folk culture in historically undeveloped regions, but we cannot say very much about their existence in developing regions."
"There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop a programme of research to document the protection and development of regional culture in all its spiritual and artistic expressions."
"These expressions are stated in more detail in my amendment to the resolution under discussion."
"I hope that it will receive the support of Members."
"(HU) Culture creates value in both an intellectual and a material sense."
"Cultural and creative industries employ millions all over Europe, with films, book publishing, musical compositions and publications - what is often called the music industry - being among the most dynamically growing sectors."
"It is no accident that the most successful and popular initiatives of the EU are closely linked to culture."
"Within the exchange programme for European art collections, the public in Budapest can currently view an unparalleled Gustave Moreau and an Alfons Mucha exhibition in an important museum."
"Another such initiative is the cultural capitals of Europe programme which highlights and promotes not only cities but entire regions."
"Less than a year from now, in 2010, this proud title will be held by a little-known small city in the southern part of Hungary, PÃ©cs, where the hundreds of thousands visitors drawn to the area will give a boost to the growth of the entire region."
"I am convinced that it is through culture that the EU can grow closer to its citizens and bring citizens closer to one another."
"When we speak of regional identity in the European Union, it goes without saying that we invoke culture."
"I hope that in the period following the Lisbon strategy there will be even more initiatives and resources available for culture and education than now."
"For the modern, knowledge-based society's economic engine is the inventive and original spirit, that is to say: innovation and creativity."
"(DE) Madam President, thirty years ago I was here in Strasbourg when the directly elected European Parliament met for the first time."
"The Oldest Member was Louise Weiss, after whom this wonderful building, itself a splendid piece of European culture, was named."
"Her speech was the intellectual foundation document of the European Parliament."
"She talked at that time of the type of Europeans we need, united on the basis of a common European culture."
"This European culture is not something new, as many people think, but it is the rediscovery of something that is much older than the nation states, Mr Heaton-Harris."
"Borders, at least on the continent, are mostly rather artificial."
"Culture is deeply rooted in regions that are often divided by artificial borders, and regional culture is of enormous importance as a link between nations."
"One of the greatest cultural figures was the Bohemian Forest poet Adalbert Stifter, who worked in Bavaria, Upper Austria and Bohemia and united Czech and German people."
"This tradition must be kept alive - the culture that is destroyed by nationalism and displacement, the culture of minorities, the regional culture, the culture of European regions that span borders and, in particular, the diversity that we will only be able to preserve together."
"Franz Josef StrauÃ, the great Bavarian European, once said that we will only be able to remain Bavarians, Basques, Germans or Britons if we become Europeans in time - Europe not being a centralising factor, but a common roof against the rain of globalisation and standardisation."
"(RO) The European Union project, conceived rather as a mechanism for economic integration, owes a huge debt to the 'cement' represented by European culture."
"At the same time, encouraging diversity is among the objectives of the European cultural agenda launched during this legislature, along with promoting culture as a means of economic growth and incorporating it in relations with third countries."
"Culture must be viewed from a slightly different perspective if we think about the fact that this sector generates more wealth than the European chemical industry, for instance, providing a living for millions of employees."
"This sector can contribute to the development of disadvantaged regions through grants for cultural cooperation projects in the fields of art and culture."
"For example, Romania has demonstrated that it can implement large-scale projects in partnership with European regions through the programme 'Sibiu, the 2007 European Capital of Culture', which had a major economic impact on the area."
"At the same time, we must encourage programmes promoting cross-border mobility among those working in the cultural sector and the staging of cultural and artistic events on a transnational basis."
"I mention these matters as a member of the Committee on Culture and Education and of the Committee on Regional Development, as well as being a former chairman of a European border region."
"(PL) Madam President, people must eat, move about and take shelter from the cold or rain."
"These are elements of production and commerce which serve to meet fundamental needs."
"However, the kind of fork we eat with, or what our bicycle or the roof of our house looks like, has nothing to do with the economy, but is an expression of culture."
"People have a spiritual need to create, quite simply for the sake of creating."
"They take pride in their work when those who see or touch it express their appreciation and feel better because of it."
"An important point is the fact that cultural diversity is often associated with regions."
"We should never unify those regions and their culture - indeed, we should support that diversity."
"Culture is an expression of the soul of the regions."
"The EU would be a most uninteresting place without the cultural riches which it possesses today."
"Maintaining culture is expensive, and our role is to support culture."
"Without it there will not be an economy or happy people in the European Union."
"(PL) Madam President, the cultural wealth of Europe comes from the great diversity of its regions."
"That diversity needs to be protected."
"KoniakÃ³w lace is completely different from Bruges lace."
"The mixture created by a superficial reproduction of ideas taken from culture leads to impoverishment."
"We must preserve that diversity of all forms and expressions of culture, including multilingualism and material culture, because our diversity is our identity, it is a source of creative development and of enriching cross-fertilisation."
"It also gives a purpose to cultural tourism."
"The culture of the regions needs support and protection."
"I would like to ask the European Commission to develop a programme for this."
"(PL) Madam President, the motto of the European Union is 'United in Diversity'."
"That diversity makes the entire EU exceptionally attractive, and also means that we are very different from countries such as the United States."
"Cultural diversity is in fact based, among other things, on the huge diversity of our regional cultures, a diversity which makes those regions and entire countries extremely attractive to tourists."
"They are attractive to us, Europeans, and they are also extremely attractive to others, who can come to Europe to see, experience and appreciate that unusual diversity."
"Regional culture should therefore be supported if only for this reason."
"But we should also remember that regional culture is a bridge which enables people who live in the regions to participate in what is known as high culture."
"Without this it is difficult to talk of the harmonisation and popularisation of certain models of culture and their perception."
"(PL) Madam President, achieving the unity of Europe while preserving its diversity, identity and cultural heritage is the great value of our Community."
"Individual nations, regions and different local communities cultivate and develop their culture and tradition, and bring that heritage into a united Europe."
"They share their culture with other regions, and in exchange learn about the accomplishments and achievements of others."
"And so they give something to others, and they take something from others."
"In order to maintain the cultural heritage in regions and smaller areas it is also important that funds are available from the EU budget."
"Those who were afraid that after integration they would lose their culture and identity are realising that the opposite is true - that the EU supports regional, folk and local culture."
"Madam President, I rise to support my colleague, Zbigniew Zaleski."
"Somebody once said: 'When I hear the word ""cultureâ, I reach for my revolver'."
"I think that the European Parliament today underestimates, as indeed do our national parliaments and national governments, the importance of education and culture."
"We are always bottom of the pile."
"They say that 'the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world'."
"I think - and this is just my personal point of view - Greece was the cradle of European civilisation."
"One or two Englishmen - Lord Byron and others - did a certain amount of things."
"Perhaps Commissioner Borg from Malta, the country of the George Cross, could answer this question: why can we not spend a little more money on supporting the future of our culture of our civilisation?"
"We spend I do not know how many million billion euro on this, that and the other; please - music, poetry, history, harmony."
"Give us a chance."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for the number of points that they have raised."
"I will certainly forward your points and the concerns that you have expressed to Commissioner FigeÄ¾."
"I would, however, like to express some general points and reactions."
"Mrs Pack spoke about the harmonising of rules at European level and how this impacts on regional diversity."
"I would like to point out that having harmonisation at European level is necessary in order to ensure a level playing field across the European Union so that its citizens can fully benefit from the single internal market."
"This would not, however, mean that such harmonisation leads to less cultural diversity."
"In fact this was also the outcome of the European Year on Intercultural Dialogue."
"Furthermore, the Commission, through its regional policy, promotes cultural diversity and invests in culture, both directly and indirectly, indeed by involving regional authorities and stakeholders."
"In a number of policy areas the Commission seeks to promote diversity and take account of regional specificities across the European Union."
"Concerning the point raised on the issue of culture and the economic crisis and the overall contribution to growth and jobs, let me just recall that the Commission is undertaking a study this year to analyse how the cultural dimension has been integrated into the regional development strategies for 2007-2013."
"The results of the study will highlight the value of investing in the cultural sector, including cultural and creative industries, and will underline the links between such investment, the specific regional development objectives and the Lisbon Agenda."
"On the Green Paper I would like to inform you, as I said at the outset, that this policy document is due in the first quarter of 2010 and its aim is to launch an open consultation process."
"It has three main policy objectives."
"Firstly, to advance a more strategic approach."
"Secondly, to unlock the potential of European cultural and creative industries, and, thirdly, to contribute to the development of strategies aimed at encouraging better linkages between cultural and creative industries and other sectors of the economy, and thus to connect culture and creativity with innovation and the wider economy."
"The regional dimension will of course be fully taken into account in this context."
"I would like to conclude by referring to the statement made by Mr Posselt that culture is often destroyed by nationalisms."
"Certainly not by the European Union: it firmly believes in and upholds unity and diversity."
"I have received three motions for a resolution in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next part-session."

"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am saddened and dismayed to have to inform you today that, last weekend, more than 300 people were drowned when a number of refugee boats went down in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya."
"These boats were carrying people from North and sub-Saharan Africa."
"Some of the refugees were rescued by the Egyptian and Libyan authorities, and some bodies have been recovered, but hundreds of people are still missing."
"I would like, on behalf of the European Parliament, to say how deeply shocked and saddened we are by this event."
"Over the last two years, the European Union has been experiencing an increase in immigration via the Mediterranean, and the economic crisis means that we can expect to see significantly more people fleeing poverty in Africa."
"The large numbers of refugees that tragically lose their lives when attempting to reach the European Union threaten to turn the Mediterranean into a huge open-air graveyard; it is up to us to find solutions to put an end to these tragedies."
"I would ask you now to observe a minute's silence in memory of the dead."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Thank you."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to be able to welcome the 2008 winner of the Nobel Prize for Medicine, Professor Luc Montagnier, who is seated in the gallery."
"I wish you a very warm welcome!"
"(Applause)"
"I am also delighted, today, to welcome a delegation from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)."
"This delegation comprises 15 members of its ad hoc committee on direct elections and additional powers."
"They are on an investigative trip to learn from the European Parliament's experience in this area."
"I hope you have an excellent stay here and that our parliaments will work even more closely together in future."
"I wish you a very warm welcome!"

"Recommendation to the Council on the new EU-Russia agreement (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Janusz Onyskiewicz, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the new EU-Russia agreement."
"Mr President, this report describes the relationship between the European Union and Russia as being of key significance for the Union's economic and political interests."
"It emphasises the role that Russia can and should play in the international arena, notably in our immediate neighbourhood, where it can contribute to the economic and political stability of the region."
"In addition, however, the report draws attention to Russia's disproportionately strong reaction to Georgia's armed intervention in South Ossetia and to the large-scale and unprovoked action by Russian forces in Abkhazia."
"The report highlights the need for meaningful dialogue on security matters."
"This should be a dialogue based on respect for international law and the territorial integrity of states."
"The report points out too that events in the Caucasus and recognition of the independence of both enclaves, Ossetia and Abkhazia, cast doubt over whether Russia really is ready and able to build a common area of security in Europe together with the European Union."
"The report suggests that talks on full compliance by Russia with the commitments and agreements that ended the Georgian conflict should be brought to a conclusion prior to the adoption of any negotiated agreement."
"That would involve agreement on the status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"The report also calls for Russia to enter into firm commitments not to use force against its neighbours."
"In addition, the report points out that recent events involving Russia's attack on Georgia's territorial integrity endanger the relationship between the European Union and Russia, as does Russia's part in the gas supply crisis."
"The report indicates the advisability of replacing the current agreement with a new and broader one."
"Such an agreement should cover all aspects of our cooperation and should be legally binding."
"It should also contain clear dispute resolution procedures."
"Energy security is also covered by the report."
"The inclusion in a negotiated agreement of the fundamental provisions of the treaty concerning energy and the transit protocol is dealt with as well."
"The reference is made despite the fact that this treaty is currently legally binding, and legally binding on Russia, although Russia can withdraw from it."
"The report points to the great latent potential of possible reciprocal economic arrangements based on an equal partnership between both sides."
"Such arrangements could lead to mutually beneficial interdependence."
"According to the report, it is extremely important for Member States and the European Union as a whole to speak with one voice, especially regarding relations with Russia."
"It is also essential that, as they are required to do pursuant to the various European Union treaties, Member States should consult each other well in advance of any bilateral initiatives with Russia."
"This is particularly essential in cases that could have repercussions for other European Union countries or for the European Union as a whole."
"In the report, much attention is paid to human rights and freedoms in Russia."
"It is pointed out that as a Member of the Council of Europe, Russia is bound to comply with the principles on which the Council is founded."
"It is stated that compliance with those principles is vital to the success of negotiations on cooperation between the European Union and Russia."
"It is deemed regrettable that Russia is averse to the introduction of effective measures to ensure that the many cases in which the Russian authorities have violated human rights and been condemned by the European Court of Justice will not be repeated."
"It is worth drawing attention to one of the many recommendations contained in the report, namely that the European Union should continue to support Russia's bid for membership of the World Trade Organization."
"It is considered very important for Russia to abide by the commitments of membership before formally being granted membership."
"In particular, this involves Russia putting an end to the process of abandoning practices that have already been introduced."
"In this context it is worth recalling the great importance attached to the effective protection of intellectual, commercial and industrial property."
"The report contains recommendations relating to human rights, freedom of the media, independence of the judiciary and the gradual narrowing of the permitted scope of action for NGOs in Russia."
"It also covers a range of economic issues, such as maritime traffic in the Baltic Sea and along Russia's northern coast, air traffic over Siberia and reciprocal arrangements for possible unrestricted investment."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for giving us the opportunity to address, during this session, the issue of the relationship with Russia."
"As you certainly know, the Council discussed the relationship with Russia in depth some time ago, when we established the grounds and the rationale for the new EU-Russia agreement, and thus we consider it important that the negotiations for the new agreement are back on track."
"After all, Russia is our biggest neighbour, one of our key partners and an indispensable player on the international scene."
"Nowadays, when the economic crisis is hitting both of us equally hard, it is clear that confrontations will make neither of us any stronger."
"Constructive, rational and mutually beneficial cooperation and fulfilment of international commitments by Russia, on the other hand, certainly could."
"Moreover, a dialogue and a constructive engagement are important means of defending our interests and promoting our values vis-Ã -vis Russia."
"This, in a nutshell, provided the main impetus for our decision to resume the negotiations on the new EU-Russia agreement, despite what happened in Georgia last August."
"The crisis and its implications continue, certainly, to overshadow our relations."
"The negotiations in no way legitimise Russia's conduct in Georgia, including in the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and the EU has its red lines clearly set in this respect."
"Our support for the territorial integrity of Georgia is clearly one of them."
"We continue to expect Russia to behave responsibly and to honour all its commitments."
"This in particular means that we will pay special attention to our common neighbourhood with Russia throughout the entire negotiation process."
"The crisis in Georgia has demonstrated how unresolved conflicts can remain volatile even after many years, and that military action is not a solution."
"We have to remind Russia that it has much to gain from behaving constructively towards its neighbours, and that it has much to lose if it continues on the path of confrontation."
"Russia has, after all, already proved that it knows how to behave towards central European neighbours that are now part of both the EU and NATO."
"We will continue to insist that Russia must abide by its international commitments and respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia and other eastern European countries that make up its common neighbourhood with the EU."
"Full cooperation will also be expected from Russia as much as from Georgia at the Geneva talks."
"I do not intend to set out in detail the current state of negotiations with Russia on the new agreement."
"The Commission as the negotiator for the agreement will certainly be in a better position to update you on the process."
"I should also recall that we are only at the beginning of the process, which could take some time."
"We should not be discouraged if it only moves slowly at first."
"I am sure, however, that by the end of our Presidency we will have greater clarity on what both sides want the new agreement to cover."
"We are grateful to Janusz Onyszkiewicz for his report and the recommendations made in it."
"In general we share many of your concerns as well as objectives."
"I would now like to make a few remarks on the external security part of the new agreement, where the Presidency also plays a role in the negotiations."
"It is of the utmost importance that the new agreement should contain provision to ensure effective dialogue and cooperation with Russia, and should be based on common values, compliance with the existing international commitments, the rule of law and respect for democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"This is particularly important in relation to our common neighbourhood."
"Indeed, it is essential if we are to see a solution to long-standing conflicts."
"Conflict prevention is also an important objective."
"It needs to be pursued through both political dialogue and joint initiatives."
"There is already some movement with Russia on the scope of the political dialogue and external security part of the new agreement."
"But of course the devil is in the detail."
"The most interesting and challenging part of the negotiations is now beginning, as we begin to discuss concrete text proposals."
"Given that negotiations are ongoing, it would not be appropriate to give you the details here."
"I can, however, assure you that we will seek to obtain substantial provisions on strengthening dialogue on the international scene, on the fight against terrorism, on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, on crisis management and on civil protection."
"It was agreed at the EU-Russia summit in Khanty-Mansiysk that our shared aim was to conclude a strategic agreement that will provide a comprehensive framework for EU-Russia relations for the foreseeable future and help to develop the potential of our relationship."
"This remains our objective and one that the Presidency, as well as the successive Presidencies, will continue to work towards."
"We stand ready to keep this Parliament informed of the progress and are grateful for the input which you have provided, in particular through the text of your resolution."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to start by thanking Mr Onyszkiewicz most warmly for this valuable report."
"We have consistently emphasised that we value Parliament's opinion, and I am of course happy to provide you with further information on the course of the negotiations."
"Mr President, Russia is and will remain an important partner for us."
"Our shared interests are complex and overlapping, from economic contacts to, for example, our shared work as partners in the Middle East Quartet or, like yesterday, in Afghanistan and Pakistan."
"Of course, as we are all aware, we also have major differences of opinion, regarding the territorial integrity of Georgia, for example."
"Time and again tensions have arisen over the strengthening of our role in the neighbourhood we share with Russia."
"In this context, it is often wrongly asserted that we are dependent on our large neighbour."
"When it comes to trade and energy, we are, rather, mutually dependent or, to put it another way, we have each become an indispensible partner for the other."
"These, then, are times in which our relations with Russia are hugely important, and in which a unified, visionary EU strategy is absolutely vital."
"Tomorrow, President Obama will meet President Medvedev for the first time, in order to press the reset button, so to speak, for the USA's relationship with Russia."
"This new approach is certainly to be welcomed, but we must not start again from scratch."
"We do not need to reset our relations; instead we should constantly fine tune them."
"This is right at the top of our list of priorities."
"As the Commission noted in its communication of 5 November, the complex and extensive nature of our relations and the many areas in which we are mutually dependent mean that we need to engage consistently with Russia, and I would also say that we need to be sober and results-orientated."
"The negotiations over a new agreement are without doubt the best way of putting forward a unified EU position that defends our interests, with the aim of reaching an agreement on the most important areas."
"As I am talking to you right now, the fourth round of negotiations is underway in Moscow."
"We have now agreed on a general structure for the agreement that should form a legally binding basis for all aspects of our relations in the foreseeable future."
"At the same time, however, we have not set any artificial deadlines for the negotiations: in my opinion, we should take as much time as is needed to achieve a satisfactory result, because the current agreement will remain in force until that point, and there is therefore no desperate need to proceed with great urgency."
"We do not therefore need to wait for the new agreement before we can deal with current issues."
"So far, issues of politics, justice and security have been discussed, such that there is now a better understanding of our respective positions; we have now started to discuss economic issues."
"It should, in any event, come as no surprise to us that the two sides have very different approaches in some areas."
"While Russia has big ambitions for cooperation on foreign and security policy, for example, it is currently less ambitious when it comes to economic matters."
"Naturally, it is in our interest, in the EU, for our trade and economic relations to include legally binding, enforceable provisions, in order to make sure that Russia accepts a system based on clear rules."
"This applies in particular to the topic of energy, where we are striving for acceptance of the principles of the Energy Charter, the main ones being transparency, mutuality and non-discrimination."
"The gas crisis at the beginning of the year has dented confidence in the reliability of our energy relations, and this must be rectified."
"We are therefore trying, in parallel to the negotiations, to significantly strengthen the early warning system, which lays down provisions on monitoring and observation in the event of crisis, in order to avoid conflict and facilitate resolution."
"The agreement that we are negotiating should, of course, also be based on respect for human rights and democracy, and we believe this should be an essential component."
"When it comes down to it, Russia and the EU have, as Mr Vondra said, entered into the same commitments in the UN, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe."
"Our treaty should emphasise respect for these shared commitments and interests."
"Obviously, it cannot resolve the conflicts in Europe all on its own, but it should provide a framework for conflict resolution."
"In parallel to our negotiations, we will continue our efforts in existing forums, in the Geneva talks for Georgia, in the 5+2 format for Transnistria and in the Minsk process for Nagorno-Karabakh."
"Justice and internal affairs are, as I said, of relevance to both parties in the negotiations, and they are areas where I see significant potential for mutually beneficial cooperation, particularly in the fight against organised crime and also in improving conditions for bona fide travellers."
"However, the possibility of abolishing the visa requirement, as Russia has called for, will only be a realistic prospect in conjunction with further improvements in other areas."
"For example, it would make it easier for us to cooperate effectively in general terms if Russia implemented higher data protection standards; research, education and culture also provide numerous opportunities for cooperation in the interests of our citizens, and should be taken into consideration in the new agreement."
"The report we are debating today obviously includes many other proposals on which I have no time to comment right now, but they will of course come up in the debate."
"I would like to emphasise once again that I especially welcome the line that Mr Onyszkiewicz has taken in the report before us and in the proposed draft resolution."
"If further information is required following today's debate, I will of course be delighted to give the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for example, a full briefing at any time, as I did last year."
"To conclude, I would like to stress that it is an important concern to me that the negotiations should progress successfully, and they have my full support."
"A good treaty will, I hope, place EU-Russia relations on a solid and predictable footing for the foreseeable future, and thus make an important contribution to the stability and security of our continent."
"Mr President, it is clear to us and to Europe, to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and to us in Europe, that energy has become a foreign policy tool, an element of change that is capable of sparking conflicts or uniting us, and this is precisely the subject that concerns us today."
"Traditionally, Europe has been united with Russia."
"Our history shows that in its development Belarus was clearly influenced by the West, and Russian tradition, in terms of religion, all forms of education and most value systems, has followed a European way of thinking that has enriched Russia."
"Our culture has also been enhanced by the tradition of scientists from Russia, great mathematicians from Kazan and other corners, and the same is true of its literature."
"I believe we should think of the tensions of the socialist era as an intermission that should be remembered, but they do not constitute a constant factor."
"Our constant experience with Russia has been one of unity; that is why I say that in the area of energy, where Europe has deficiencies, we must let Russia know that our friendship should continue, but with clear rules, as gentlemen always had and as we have always had, but now in the form of written rules."
"We cannot live in continuous uncertainty as to whether our citizens' supply may be cut off once again, and Russia must also recognise that it cannot use energy as a tool to avoid having to recognise the sovereignty of neighbouring States."
"The situation at present is one of people who have achieved independence and who are fully exercising democracy, over whom we should keep watch and over whom Russia has a duty to keep watch, just as it has a duty to provide a clear set of rules for energy exchange and unity through energy."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Onyszkiewicz for producing this important, well-written and balanced report."
"As the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I am delighted that the report also reflects our main priorities on Russia, such as pragmatic cooperation based on a healthy market environment, an emphasis on human rights, a functioning legal state and democracy, all of which are fundamental social values for the EU, as well as an emphasis on respect for the sovereignty of all neighbouring states and for the unity of the EU."
"The new agreement under negotiation must include all aspects of cooperation, be legally binding, and reflect the quality of our relations with Russia."
"However, if the discussions are to reflect our positions and our values we must not forget the role played by Russia in the war in Georgia last year or in the January gas crisis."
"We cannot permit the creation of new spheres of influence in Europe."
"We cannot accept the status quo, or rather the fait accompli in the Caucasus."
"Hence the requirement for unambiguous guarantees that Russia will not use force against any of its neighbours and that it will deal with disputes in our shared neighbourhood together with the EU."
"In our view it is entirely natural to invite Russia to take the first direct confidence building step."
"Many fellow members today rightly emphasise the need for EU unity in relation to Russia."
"However, we can only achieve a genuinely unified position gradually, hence my proposal to set up a consultation mechanism within a Council framework enabling the Member States to consult each other, well in advance of all bilateral issues involving Russia that have an impact on another Member State or on the EU as a whole."
"Only in this way will we arrive at a genuinely unified position towards Russia and only like this will we fully exploit our greatest advantage in relation to Russia, which is our own unity."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) The Socialist Group in the European Parliament considers Russia a key strategic partner."
"The European Union and Russia depend on each other, as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has also confirmed."
"I would like to mention that as far as gas supply is concerned, we depend on each other, because Russia would not be able to sell their gas to anyone else."
"We should be clear about this."
"It is very important that a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement be worked out and concluded."
"This report should have served that purpose, but it does not."
"The Onyszkiewicz report, which has been adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the tone of which is at times explicitly rude, may cause serious damage to the network of relations between the EU and Russia."
"The Socialist Group agrees that Parliament should express its rightful criticisms of Russia."
"The Socialist Group firmly condemns violations of human rights."
"We demand that democratic rights and fundamental values be respected."
"We call upon Russia to respect the principle of the independence of the written and electronic media."
"We call on the Russian Government to take every possible measure to investigate the attacks and murders perpetrated against journalists."
"The Russian law on NGOs endangers the independent operation of these organisations."
"The Socialist Group views with concern the way in which the most recent Russian Duma elections and presidential elections were conducted."
"We are critical of the Russian side in the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, and in the conflict between those two countries."
"At the same time, it is nevertheless our conviction that Parliament's recommendations must serve the improvement of EU-Russia relations and the elaboration of a new strategic partnership."
"This report does not serve that purpose."
"It was for this reason that we voted against it in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are going against the thinking expressed by the Commission."
"They run up against the new United States policy, if they consider that the Obama administration, in particular through the statements of Vice-President Joe Biden, has changed its style, then the European Union will fall behind the new American policy, although this would not be in our interest."
"So our concern is not with the criticism, but with the style."
"It is not didacticism that is needed, but justified criticism."
"It is not for the European Union to be the schoolmaster and give lessons to Russia."
"Therefore, the Socialist Group will only find this draft report acceptable if all six proposed amendments which we submitted are approved by Parliament; otherwise this will simply be a counterproductive report that does not serve the strategic partnership between EU and Russia."
"However, it is in the European Union's interest to develop a successful Russia-EU cooperation."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, foreign affairs demands diplomacy and principle, and this report on a new EU-Russia agreement provides both."
"My group commends its content and congratulates Janusz Onyszkiewicz on his work."
"History teaches us that nothing riles the Russians more than turning our backs to them, so it is in the interests of both Russia and the European Union to communicate, cooperate and trade in ways that build trust."
"Equally, it is dishonest to pretend that Russia's conduct is beyond reproach."
"This is a country that uses energy supplies as a weapon, a country whose cavalier conduct in the Caucasus and the Baltics sets its neighbours' nerves on edge, and a country where the rule of law flexes and bends to accommodate those in favour with the Kremlin, and turns the screws on those who are not, as today's new trial against Mikhail Khodorkovsky confirms."
"Elections, as we know, are no exception."
"Physical abuse, the intimidation of human rights advocates, the murder of independent journalists - Mr Tabajdi, these are the realities of Russia today."
"(Applause)"
"We are saddened that some Members have set their sights on watering down criticism of Russia's human rights record."
"I am surprised at the insistence of some on defining the new agreement as strategic, simply because Moscow wants it."
"Yes, we should build bridges, but we must not be uncritical of things that are unspeakable."
"There are three reasons to explain why some are prone to pander to Mr Putin."
"First, there are those who once sympathised with the Soviets and whose sentimental attachment to the Kremlin continues."
"Second, there are those who think that Russia is somehow different from other countries and the same standards cannot apply and, third, there are those who think that Russia is just too scary to scorn."
"None of these arguments holds water."
"Europe's hard Left has a history of wilful ignorance about human rights in the Soviet era."
"It is not only morally wrong, but politically muddle-headed for them to make excuses for Russia now that she is moving towards the authoritarian right."
"Moreover, human rights are universal and indivisible, or they mean nothing; so the Union should have the confidence to defend our values within our borders and outwith them."
"Lastly, Europe today has a population three and a half times the size of Russia's."
"We have military spending that is ten times bigger, and an economy fifteen times the size."
"We have no reason to cower from the Kremlin, and every reason to stand up for our values."
"We therefore support a new agreement, but let Europe enter that relationship united, strong and with its eyes open."
"Mr President, the Kremlin is using energy supplies as a political instrument in conjunction with the principle of 'divide and rule' in order to corrupt Europe country by country, from Cyprus to the Netherlands."
"This approach is proving remarkably successful."
"By contrast, the European Union remained surprisingly passive during the attack on sovereign Georgia."
"The EU's leaders were conspicuous by their absence."
"Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner were nowhere to be seen."
"Meanwhile, Mr Sarkozy, the President of France, was thoroughly humiliated as the Russians totally ignored the peace agreement he had negotiated."
"It follows that Europe's weakness in its relations with Russia is caused by its own naivety and short-sightedness."
"Austrian, German and Italian energy firms are doing business with the Kremlin on a bilateral basis."
"This leads directly to political pressure by Moscow on individual Member States."
"Germany is building a gas pipeline along the floor of the Baltic Sea in order to avoid Poland, yet Russia has cut energy supplies to Lithuania, the Czech Republic and other EU countries on more than one occasion."
"If Nord Stream is implemented, the same fate may befall my country, Poland."
"The EU's policy towards Russia must be based on the principles of unity and solidarity."
"This is why, if we want our relations with Russia to be effective, it is absolutely essential to consult other Member States that might potentially be affected before entering into bilateral agreements with the Kremlin."
"Mr President, I would like also to thank the rapporteur for accepting our amendments and putting the issue of human rights at the centre of negotiations with Russia."
"I would ask the Council and the Commission not to give way in this area, just as I would ask the rapporteur to support our other amendments on respect for the rights of minorities and of Chechnya, which have been somewhat forgotten in the report."
"We also support the critical attitude towards Russia because, even if Russia is now giving some positive signals, notably with regard to its willingness to conclude an international agreement on the reduction of nuclear arsenals, which are no doubt too costly in this time of crisis, it still remains completely uncompromising on other issues, particularly regarding its neighbourhood policy, reproaching the European Union for interfering in its sphere of influence."
"I would remind you that recently in Brussels Mr Lavrov criticised the Eastern partnership that we set up at the spring summit, just as Mr Putin reacted negatively to the gas agreement between the European Union and Ukraine."
"As you know - and as everyone has stated - the issue of Georgia remains more topical than ever and still remains a bone of contention between us and Russia, which constantly uses its right of veto to prevent any deployment of international peacekeeping forces and even access for our civilian observers to the territories that it occupies and controls."
"It is therefore in breach of the six points of the agreement that the EU concluded with Russia on 12 August, and fails to stop the daily acts of violence along the Abkhazia-Ossetia administrative border."
"Furthermore, no one is fooled by the Member States' dependence, as has been mentioned, on Russia for energy or by the political price that we have to pay."
"Finally, Mr President, faced with a global crisis that spares no one, including Russia, I would like unexpected solutions to emerge and to predispose Russia to accept a constructive partnership, and the EU to carry more weight as a united partner."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing our recommendations to the Council for the new agreement with Russia."
"However, the text of the report does not look to me like recommendations for diplomatic negotiations."
"For the most part the document articulates and emphasises the need to demand, to insist, to stress, to challenge, and so on. This is a lexicon of dictation and I am very pleased not to have the role of the negotiator who is supposed to be guided by such recommendations."
"At the same time we acknowledge that the EU receives, aside from anything else, a quarter of its supplies of oil and natural gas from Russia."
"I sometimes think that we are trying to ask for secure, stable supplies of vitally important raw materials while wielding a cudgel."
"And what do we, the EU, bring to the negotiating table?"
"Where is our position on human rights that we hide behind in relation to, for example, Russian-speaking minorities living within the territory of EU Member States?"
"Where is our opinion on the reunions and actions of former members of SS units in EU countries?"
"Or is it that we do not oppose them but rather support them, in conflict with UN findings for example?"
"Also, how is it that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) can name both countries, Ukraine and Russia, as responsible for the problems concerning natural gas supplies to the EU, but our recommendations only challenge Russia?"
"All in all it is rather like trying to play football with only one goal."
"That is not, as you will surely admit, a proper game."
"So let us not expect any miraculous results."
"Personally, I therefore have a problem supporting the document in its current form."
"Even in the Committee on Foreign Affairs a third of the MEPs were not happy with the draft."
"Meanwhile, the Committee on International Trade, has taken a far more realistic approach to relations with Russia, taking into account what Europe really needs."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, there is no doubt that Russia now has its fair share of the global economic crisis."
"Just this morning I heard on the radio a penetrating report from St Petersburg on medicines that are unaffordable and thus unattainable for the average Russian citizen."
"The latest forecasts by the World Bank point to even stormier weather for the Russian economy."
"What are we to make of the gloomy prediction that, by the end of this year, more than 20 million Russians could fall below the subsistence level of RUB 4 600 (approximately USD 185)?"
"Indeed, Europe and Russia both face the urgent need for resolute action to tackle the crisis."
"Priority, therefore, should be given to joint efforts to improve the global economic climate."
"Yet these require mutual confidence, something I wish to emphasise as, regrettably, the Kremlin's foreign policy stands squarely in the way of this."
"One example is the crisis in Moldova, which continues and is becoming even more complicated, and is not being helped by Igor Smirnov."
"Another example is last week's renewed imbroglio in Ukraine."
"In short, the lack of mutual confidence stands in the way of joint efforts."
"With its report, Parliament is sending this honest, clear message to the Council and the Commission for the negotiations with Moscow and, I sincerely hope, is facing Russia with its head held high."
"- (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, in the draft recommendation of this Parliament to the Council concerning the new EU-Russia agreement, which we are debating today, there are perhaps only two facts than can be agreed with."
"The first is that Russia has enormous significance for the stability and prosperity of Europe and the world, and the second is that we must achieve a strategic partnership with Russia based on democratic values."
"Otherwise I must say that the text is written in the language of a victorious power from the Cold War period, contradicting all of the basic rules of diplomacy and international relations."
"These rules are more about compromise, politeness, equilibrium and respect for the other side at the negotiating table."
"They are not about dictatorial demands and harsh condemnations."
"The terminology and formulation of the report are reminiscent of the letter of the puffed-up sultan to the Zaporozhsky Cossacks, who then gave him an appropriate response."
"The inappropriate russophobia of the text is partially redeemed by the objective statement of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which should become the guide to formulating a new document."
"In my view the current report is damaging both to the EU and to the Russian Federation and therefore to the interests of all citizens of the Euro-Asiatic area."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the EU-Russia summit to be held under the Czech Presidency by Czech President VÃ¡clav Klaus will definitely not use this russophobic rhetoric."
"Not least because the Czech President does not share the mainstream EU view of the Russia-Georgia conflict."
"I firmly believe that in the interests of our citizens, the Council should bear in mind that Russia is and will continue to be a necessary, useful and equal partner in our geopolitical area."
"As has already been mentioned, a quarter of the supplies of oil and natural gas to the EU come from Russia, and half of Russian oil and natural gas goes to the EU."
"If nothing else then, this fact alone is a sufficient argument for trying to maintain good neighbourly relations between the EU and the Russian Federation."
"(NL) Mr President, for the last two-and-a-half years, as Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with Russia, I have been occupying myself very intensively with Russia and Europe."
"I have not only been working on incidents but also keeping an open mind as regards the long-term strategy."
"Thus, I am at a loss to understand what Mr Watson, the Chairman of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, has just said."
"I have not taken a one-sided view in any of these debates, nor have my fellow Members."
"We have discussed the many problems involving Russia."
"Let us not forget, however, that concluding a partnership agreement also means being partners ourselves."
"This entails both parties engaging in mutual consultation on difficult issues."
"Indeed, a partnership agreement can only come about in a spirit of mutual confidence, not if one party only sees problems."
"The United States has a different strategy at present."
"Do we really have to revert to cold sentiments, unlike the United States, which is offering openings?"
"That is not a sensible course of action."
"We need a partnership agreement, a strategic partnership, as we have just one large neighbour."
"We are dependent on this neighbour for our energy supply, and it is dependent on us for our funds."
"Since we in Europe have values to defend, however, we also discuss common values and human rights with this neighbour."
"Discussing just the negative aspects is not a good start to the new strategy we really need towards our large neighbour."
"Therefore, I should like to thank the Commissioner for her response, as it contains positive elements to help us really achieve something of benefit to 500 million European citizens."
"(NL) Mr President, I should like to start by complimenting Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on what she has just said."
"I wholeheartedly agree with her arguments, and I also hope that they will influence her group tomorrow when it votes on our amendments to this report."
"I wish her every success in this."
"My group has great difficulties with this report by Mr Onyszkiewicz, which is why we voted against it in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"It is comprehensive, and rightly so; the agenda for relations between the EU and Russia is indeed extensive."
"It is true that the rapporteur has endeavoured to address all these fields in his report, for which I commend him."
"Yet the report takes the wrong tone."
"One cannot say that these relations are crucial, as the rapporteur does, and then just include examples of everything that is wrong, or going wrong, in Russia, without also noting the mistakes we ourselves have made in the past - over the last 20 years - in relation to the Russian Federation."
"Russia is not a candidate country, but rather a strategic partner that wishes to cooperate in areas of common interest."
"This necessitates constructive, rational behaviour, and I fully agree with Mr Vondra that this must form the basis of our approach."
"Contrary to the impression given, the Copenhagen criteria do not apply here."
"I am in favour of a pragmatic approach based on interdependence."
"They need us and we need them."
"Whether it be in the field of trade, energy cooperation, climate or nuclear non-proliferation, we can find solutions only if we work together."
"That is the strategic interest - we persist in using the word 'strategic' in this debate - behind the negotiations on a new agreement."
"We must conduct these in good faith whilst also respecting Russia's interests."
"Our rapporteur rightly devotes a good deal of attention to the neighbours that the European Union has in common with Russia."
"Here, too, the principle holds that cooperation is more productive than confrontation."
"We want to avoid at all costs fighting over spheres of influence."
"Instead, the European Union should focus on reviving a weakened Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)."
"Within this framework, we can then look at improving the approach to the frozen conflicts we still have in Europe, whether they be in Georgia, Azerbaijan or Moldova."
"Not everything is hunky-dory in EU-Russia relations, of course."
"The report rightly discusses this."
"We have condemned Russia's invasion of Georgia and continue to do so."
"We are concerned about authoritarian tendencies in Russia."
"Thus the dialogue cannot only be positive and, as a member of the Council of Europe, Russia can do better."
"Nevertheless, with all due respect to the rapporteur, he would do well to press the reset button."
"Persisting with a polarising attitude now the United States Government has chosen a different approach to Russia is counterproductive."
"Our problems are global, and everyone's involvement is needed to solve them."
"(HU) In his inaugural address, President Medvedev stated that his most important task was to protect freedom and restore the rule of law."
"Unfortunately, he has yet to fulfil this promise."
"It is our duty to remind him of his promise, and to give more support to the independent media, civil society and the victims of human rights violations."
"We are striving for a pragmatic partnership with Russia, and a partnership agreement is in our interest."
"This can only be realistic, however, if Russia for its part demonstrates a constructive, responsible and cooperative behaviour."
"In January, confidence in Russia's reliability as an energy supplier was shaken."
"Therefore, the core element of the agreement must be energy partnership."
"It would help build confidence if Russia were at last to ratify the European Energy Charter and the Transit Protocol."
"We expect the European Union to take unified and decisive action on behalf of those Member States, which depend to a large extent on Russian energy supplies."
"(LV) Thank you, Mr Onyszkiewicz, for your very balanced report."
"Russia is a very important partner for the European Union."
"Joint action can have a positive effect in overcoming the economic and financial crisis."
"This must not, however, permit us to depart from our principles and values."
"We must demand that Russia restores human rights in Russia, restores freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of association."
"We must insist that Russia's programme for supporting Russian compatriots should not be misused as an instrument for reinforcing its political influence in certain EU Member States."
"In order for a new agreement to be signed, Russia must fulfil its commitment on Georgia's territorial integrity."
"The broad agreement ought to include an energy security strategy, based on ratification of the Energy Charter."
"We must also demand an adequate assessment of the effect of the northern gas pipeline on the environment. Thank you."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Onyszkiewicz has spoken very lucidly on the importance of human rights in cooperation with Russia, for which I thank him."
"I think it is particularly important to make it absolutely clear that Europe does not value economic links, that is to say gas connections, over human rights."
"Normal partnerships are based on two reliable parties that trust each other."
"Strategic partnerships run the risk of having only limited defensibility and reliability, which is why the EU has to protect itself against unreliability."
"As long as Russia continues to abuse human rights so seriously and fails to reach a minimum level of democracy and rule of law, as shown, for example, by the cases of Anna Politkovskaya or Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev, we cannot have a good, normal partnership."
"(CS) The report from Mr Onyszkiewicz is undoubtedly one of the most important documents to appear at the close of our electoral mandate."
"I must underline that I am very, very disappointed by what is in the report."
"One of the minor issues that I can agree with is that we all consider good relations with Russia to be a key question."
"The concept of the report lacks balance in my opinion and I firmly believe that in this original form it will not help improve our mutual relations."
"I consider it a misunderstanding, to put it politely, that the report wants to entrust consultation powers to an EU High Representative."
"If this were to be Mr Solana then, as far as I am concerned, the man who ten years ago unleashed the senseless so-called humanitarian bombing of Yugoslavia and who, in breach of international law, is organising the break-off of part of a sovereign state, does not have my confidence."
"I also see a lack of balance precisely in the fact that the report criticises Russia for its programme to support Russian citizens living abroad, while at the same time remaining silent on the position of Russian-speaking non-citizens in the EU."
"In my opinion the report is also deliberately silent on the so-called Pole's Card problem, which breaches international law."
"(ES) Russia is a very important international player, a permanent member of the Security Council and the G8 and a major military power."
"For these simple reasons the European Union should try to establish a relationship of dialogue and cooperation with Russia."
"What is more, many Member States depend on Russia for energy and have significant trade with it."
"However, the relationship should go further and be more ambitious."
"Russia is a European country and member of the Council of Europe; it has made commitments in the area of human rights and democratic freedoms and should share a set of values and principles with us, including respect for international law and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states."
"Nevertheless, recent events indicate a worrying trend in Russia; for example, the use of energy resources as a tool for exerting pressure, including cutting off supplies, or the Georgia crisis last summer and subsequent events."
"All of this has led to an erosion of trust in Russia as a European partner."
"We must now try to regain that trust."
"We want a constructive relationship with Russia as true European partners, but in order for that to happen Russia's behaviour has to change."
"In the European Union, for many reasons, some of which are historical, Member States have differing ideas of our relationship with Russia and, therefore, it is not easy to reach a common position."
"This is one of our weaknesses and one of our problems."
"However, together with approaches that may be called pragmatic or realistic, in this Parliament there is increasing belief in the idea that those partners, with whom we want very close links, must behave in accordance with international law and with respect for basic rights and freedoms, especially if they are partners who belong to the great European family."
"This Parliament was delighted with the commitment President Medvedev made to human rights and the rule of law at the start of his term of office, but his words must be backed up by actions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to believe that, in the future, the European Union will find in Russia a permanent, structural partner that shares our values, but today it seems clear to me that such a future is quite distant."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like start by thanking Mr Vondra and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner most warmly for their contributions, which were much more realistic and, in our view, more to the point than Mr Onyszkiewicz's report in its current form, which I find very regrettable, as I hold Mr Onyszkiewicz in very high regard on a personal level."
"I therefore do not entirely understand why we have a report before us that does not use this common basis - criticism on the one hand and willingness to cooperate on the other - as a denominator, as the Council and the Commission have done."
"Let me run through our criticisms once again, by which I mean our criticisms of Russia, just to be clear."
"In terms of the neighbourhood, we do not understand, and are critical of, Russia's behaviour towards Georgia, but the world has long been aware that Russia is not the only guilty part here."
"The only thing is that certain circles here do not want to accept that."
"We have to see both sides."
"When I look from Mrs Zourabichvili to Mrs Burjanadze, at how former allies of the President of Georgia are now in opposition to President Saakashvili and how human rights are not exactly prized very highly there either, I do ask myself why it is only Russia that is criticised, and not Georgia as well."
"As for the energy crisis involving Ukraine, we are now well aware, and you know this as well as we do, that Ukraine, and its internal political situation, has to bear some of the responsibility, but it is always Russia alone that is criticised."
"Although Mr HorÃ¡Äek, who now apparently wants to solve the governmental crisis in the Czech Republic, says here that we should not prioritise the energy issue over human rights, nobody is actually doing that."
"Tell me, specifically, do you now want us to say 'we do not want your gas until you respect human rights'?"
"You must say openly, honestly and clearly what you want, and not just throw soundbites into the discussion."
"My third point relates to human rights."
"We are bitterly disappointed at the attitude to human rights in Russia; certainly, we find it unacceptable."
"We will never remain silent when human rights are being abused."
"As I have just said, we must address human rights abuses clearly wherever they occur, be this in Georgia, Russia, or our own Member States."
"This includes the rights of Russian citizens or non-citizens, some of whom, unfortunately, face problems in certain EU Member States."
"That goes without saying, but we must do it to the same extent everywhere; to the same extent and with the same criteria."
"Fourthly, I am deeply saddened that Russia - and its leadership - is not developing the kind of perspective of its own history that many of our own countries have developed."
"I am referring here to the debate we have already had, and to tomorrow's vote on the resolution on history."
"Russia's image would be hugely improved if it took a more critical approach to its own history, in other words if it depicted Stalinism not as a major national achievement, but as a crime that it needs to confront."
"Of course, there have also been very clear statements on our part, but we have to say, for all countries, for all totalitarian regimes, that we are not prepared to accept totalitarian regimes, and not prepared to accept a lack of engagement with history."
"It may therefore still be an option, if at least one or two of our side's proposed amendments are accepted, which attempt to restore the balance and to pursue precisely this dual strategy: major criticism of Russia, but also a willingness to enter into partnership with Russia."
"(SV) Madam President, the rapporteur is quite right to say that the EU must be able to speak with one voice on important matters relating to Russia."
"Unfortunately, the Russian leaders now seem to view relations with third countries as a zero-sum game."
"Put simply, if I do not punch you on the chin, you will punch me on the chin."
"Deeper cooperation between the EU and Russia would actually be a win-win situation, and we need to make Russia's leaders see this."
"There is a risk that the severe economic crisis in Russia will further exacerbate the attitude of its leadership in relation to close cooperation with the EU."
"It is therefore particularly important for the EU to speak with one voice."
"Whenever the EU has spoken clearly and plainly, the Russian leaders have stopped in their tracks."
"The Georgia conflict, the gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine at the beginning of the year and the provocations surrounding the statue of the bronze soldier in Estonia all show that a united EU can cause the Russian leadership to rethink."
"(PL) Madam President, the report we are debating contains a fairly detailed account of recent violations of human rights on the territory of the Russian Federation."
"These cases clearly prove that Russia disregards all the standards that apply throughout the free world."
"I therefore call on the Council and on the Commission to start to demand that Russia complies with the commitments it has made to respect human rights."
"This should be a precondition for holding further talks on an agreement."
"At joint meetings with the Russian side, I have often heard Members of the Russian Duma say something along the lines that no more time should be wasted on human rights and that we should move on to substantive issues, namely trade."
"We cannot agree to such an approach."
"There is nothing more important than freedom, health and life itself."
"These values are often overlooked in Russia, though the value of money is invariably recognised."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Onyszkiewicz for his hard work and honourable results."
"By the way, this is the last stand by the outgoing European Parliament on relations with Russia, and the strongest message this Parliament has delivered is consistency based on our common European values."
"It is therefore opportune for us to remember that the basis for our relations with Russia continues to be our colleague MalmstrÃ¶m's report of several years ago; a report whose suggestions have still not been carried out."
"In the mean time, we are left in a sort of limbo, repeating again and again how important relations with Russia are."
"That is true, but there is no need to repeat it."
"We need to become confident in our own strength, our own values and potential, as Graham Watson has proposed, and to live up to these values."
"We also have to conclude that there has been a qualitative change for the worse in Russia."
"Last August, Russia almost occupied a sovereign neighbouring state."
"It is not enough just to criticise, or regret, continuing human rights violations in Russia."
"The question is how to link these human rights and values to our practical behaviour."
"Otherwise, we will be jointly responsible, at least indirectly, for gassing human rights and democratic values in Russia in exchange for gas from Russian pipelines."
"Madam President, obviously there are two schools of thought in this House when it comes to Russia, reflecting the ambivalent attitude of the Member States."
"In essence, it is not about Russia - because many agree that this power is inevitably a strategic partner of ours - but about how to respond to her behaviour, which does not always conform to our standards."
"Thus, while the first school suggests keeping Russia accountable for every departure from those standards - and obviously Mr Onyszkiewicz's report is in this category - the second school is more accommodating, motivated primarily by pragmatism."
"The question is, therefore, which of these two attitudes ensures better management of our common issues (economics, trade, energy, security, research and education), satisfying our interests while avoiding abdicating our own standards."
"Which one will have more impact on Russia's behaviour?"
"Although I personally am sceptical about anybody's capacity to really influence Russia's behaviour one way or another, I still plead for an EU position combining pragmatism with integrity."
"In the end, although this report is nominally about Russia, in reality it concerns us too."
"(PL) Madam President, it is common knowledge that in the long term the content of all agreements with Russia turns out to be more of a wish list than a set of legally binding measures."
"Nonetheless, it is important to maintain our efforts to regulate our relations with Russia in the best manner possible."
"Clearly, this cannot be achieved on the basis of current conditions, whereby the European Union's population, numbering almost 500 million individuals, and responsible for over 20% of the world's GDP has to pander to a much weaker and less populous partner."
"I mention this because often the interests of particular EU Member States conflict with Europe's internal solidarity."
"Russia has no compunction in exploiting such situations."
"Of course we need to deepen our economic cooperation with Russia, but we must require our partner to abide by the same standards that are binding for all EU Member States."
"There can be no question of condoning violations of human rights."
"Madam President, my congratulations to the rapporteur."
"I think this is an extremely important report."
"Russia's strategic thinking, it seems to me, is one of the most significant problems facing the European Union at this time."
"If we do not understand how Russia thinks about itself in the world, we shall not actually make sense of what the Kremlin says and does."
"There is in fact a logic to Russia's actions, but this is not the same as ours."
"While the EU has made the peaceful resolution of conflict the centre of its thinking, Russia has no compunction about using force, as we saw in Georgia last year."
"So the real key is how Russia sees power."
"In the European tradition, power should be supervised by democratic institutions."
"To Russia, power is to be concentrated in the belief that, through such concentration, power will be more effective."
"This is very dangerous for states that Russia sees as weak."
"They automatically become targets for the expansion of Russian power."
"The recent secretive purchase of a large shareholding in the Hungarian energy company MOL by a Russian enterprise is thus more than a mere commercial transaction; it illustrates how Russia moves into an unoccupied space."
"From the perspective of power, the European Union and European integration are inexplicable, meaningless processes for Russia."
"In Russian eyes, the transfer of sovereignty is an abomination, not a way of securing peace."
"So - and it is vital that we recognise this - for Russia, the European Union is the problem."
"Its success is a puzzle and, above all, it is an obstacle to the maximisation of Russia's power."
"The European Union's future success therefore depends on recognising how Russia thinks about power."
"Very differently from Europe."
"And let there be no illusions about this."
"Madam President, last month, on behalf of Parliament, I went to the administrative borderline in Georgia, established by the South Ossetian separatists following the Russian military invasion."
"Looking at the checkpoint, where there was no formal communication on either side, it certainly did look like a scene from the Cold War."
"If we are not to move backwards, one concrete step the Russians could take is to help instigate full access for the very successful European police mission to both sides of the line so that they can properly fulfil their ceasefire monitoring duties."
"It would be a small but concrete step to build confidence, and I call on them to do so."
"I also share the view expressed by many in this Parliament that, the more European solidarity we have, the better Europe-Russia relations will be."
"This fact was underlined again this week by Russia's attempt to get separate, not common, agreements with EU countries on the import standards for fruit and vegetables."
"In this respect, I regret the speech today by the leader of the Liberal Democrats that sought to paint the Socialist position as soft on human rights."
"Not only will we vote to criticise Russia for breaching international election standards, for undermining freedom of expression, for the incarceration of political prisoners and for the intimidation and harassment of human rights defenders, but the speech simply demonstrates the very same point-scoring on Russia, which is itself an example of the lack of solidarity which holds us back."
"Russia is affected by the economic crisis - like every country - suffering from the plummeting oil price, with a one-third devaluation of the rouble and a 75% drop in their stock market."
"Today President Medvedev is playing a full part in the G20 meeting in London."
"I believe that now the time is right, when Russia does need our cooperation and may be more open to change, if only we have the determination and the unity in the European Union to pursue it."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on reading the text of this document one gets the impression that whoever wrote it seeks not an improvement but a deterioration of relations between the European Union and Russia."
"If that is Europe's aim then this is an excellent document; if not then it is terrible."
"For my part, I think it is a terrible document."
"How can we picture a future of new tensions with a country we recognise as indispensable as regards our own interests?"
"Over the next 40 years we will have to rely on the traditional energy resources in which Russia is rich."
"Can we do otherwise?"
"We cannot."
"Secondly, the manner and tone."
"In these pages Europe is speaking an imperial language, not the language of one who respects his interlocutor."
"This contradicts our neighbourhood policy, and it would not be right to use it even when dealing with a small country, much less so when dealing with a large country that demands respect, and with good reason."
"It is a question of realism, first and foremost."
"The European Parliament is, I fear, about to adopt a document written in the spirit of the Cold War - old-fashioned, pointless, damaging and counterproductive - at the very time when the new US President is opening a new dialogue with Moscow."
"With this approach, Europe can have no claim to leadership."
"I hope that the Commission will not accept these recommendations."
"(SL) You have raised many political problems during this debate, but I would like to draw your attention to another challenge which was not mentioned in our report."
"This is the area of climate change, one that has so far been tackled mostly by scientists."
"However, if we want to tackle it successfully, we also need to back up such action with robust and decisive political measures."
"This is a global challenge and a challenge which demands mutual responsibility."
"This is why I think that we ought to avail ourselves of every opportunity to urge Russia to assume its share of responsibility for both mitigating climate change and adapting to it."
"We also ought to urge Russia to take a more active part in international negotiations, as it is the eve of the Copenhagen conference."
"Colleagues, I would also like to remind you that taking appropriate action on climate change is a matter of ensuring human rights."
"(SK) I will be very brief because most of what I wanted to say has been said by my colleagues from the party of the European Social Democrats."
"In my opinion the report lacks balance and is russophobic."
"I myself come from a country which lived for many years under a regime that was not easy for most people, but precisely for that reason I do not understand why sensible men and women in this noble Chamber now want to adopt a document through which we will once again be pointing the finger at someone and blaming them for something."
"I had assumed that this Parliament was capable of understanding the current situation in the world."
"I absolutely reject the idea that anyone here wants to trade natural gas and oil for the protection of human rights."
"The European Social Democrats wants to protect human rights and they have always protected human rights, but on the other hand we can see the obvious reality before us."
"Before the EU, before the US, before Russia and before the entire world."
"We will only be able to confront this reality with a foundation of good joint agreements."
"(FR) Madam President, Russia is our largest neighbour, a great country that in the last century had illusions of imperialism but also went through some terrible experiences."
"To emerge from such a trauma takes time and perseverance, and we too must be patient."
"Negotiating a new agreement will therefore be difficult and painful."
"The report is demanding but fair."
"Consistency between an effective partnership with our six neighbours in the East and good mutual cooperation with Russia constitutes the greatest challenge for European politics."
"Progress will depend on us genuinely reconciling our ways of life and understanding fundamental values, which must not be betrayed."
"(PL) Madam President, the main obstacles affecting our contacts with Russia are the latter's use of gas supplies as a means of political blackmail, its threat to Georgia's independence, the genocide in Chechnya, and its failure to conduct fair trials concerning the murders of Anna Politkovskaya and Alexander Litvinenko."
"Unfortunately, Russia has not taken a single step forward towards establishing democracy and respect for human rights, which does not augur well for future negotiations and cooperation."
"We must conduct a single common policy of solidarity if we want our negotiations to prove successful."
"This is very important in the case of such an important neighbour of the European Union."
"Madam President, how can Mrs Ferrero-Waldner refer to Russia as a partner and Mr Vondra seek assurances on democracy and human rights?"
"Russia is a gangster state where troublesome political opponents, dissenters and journalists are simply murdered."
"The Russians even have a law that allows them to murder anyone - Russian citizen or foreign national - on foreign soil whom they deem to be a threat or a nuisance."
"Such a murder was carried out on my constituent Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 in an act of state-sponsored terrorism."
"His family are still waiting for justice to be done and his murderers brought to justice or trial in England."
"Personally I do not want the European Union to negotiate agreements with anyone on anything."
"But, if the Commission is serious, why did it not request the extradition of the suspects as a sign of goodwill and a precondition for opening negotiations?"
"(RO) The potential for solid cooperation with the Russian Federation is directly proportional to the challenges and difficulties which we have to face."
"Russia has chosen for some time a form of discourse and course of action which put the prospects of pragmatic collaboration second and encourage a tough approach to international relations which we cannot agree with in any shape or form."
"Since the conflict in Georgia, we have remained at a point where we can see differences between us in the stance we have adopted on crucial subjects."
"The Russian Federation believes that the presence of its troops in countries in the region is acceptable and that they even have the right to intervene when Moscow considers it necessary."
"Russia's involvement in unresolved conflicts even makes itself felt at the EU's border, with the impact this has on all of us Europeans."
"I must remind you of what I have actually proposed in my amendments."
"The presence of Russian troops in the separatist region of Transnistria has already affected the Republic of Moldova for almost two decades, as it makes its journey towards progress and the freedom to choose its own future."
"The Russian Federation must withdraw its troops from Transnistria to provide the foundation for this partnership."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, I would like to thank you all for this interesting debate."
"I think it is very necessary regarding our future relations with Russia, and a number of important points have been covered in the debate."
"I can support much of what has been said here."
"For those who speak of the need for engagement, I think it is clear that a new agreement is of great importance for the further development and intensification of cooperation between the EU and Russia."
"It is also clear that the new agreement must continue to improve on the current partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA)."
"It has to reflect the realities of today's cooperation with Russia."
"Our relations now are a lot deeper and more wide-ranging than they were only a decade ago."
"For those who speak of energy, we must clearly state that the EU wishes to strengthen cooperation with Russia through the instruments we have - the meetings of the Energy Dialogue and the Permanent Partnership Council on Energy."
"There will be a meeting of the Permanent Partnership Council on Energy during this Presidency."
"The objective is to promote trust and transparency in EU-Russia energy relations."
"We cannot afford another disruption of the energy supply."
"We should also strengthen the early warning mechanism and make it more operative."
"To those who speak of human rights, I think that the application of the rule of law, an independent judiciary and full respect for human rights - including free and independent media - are necessary to promote stability and prosperity in Russia."
"The EU follows the human rights situation in Russia with concern and we raise - and will continue to raise - those concerns at our EU-Russia meetings."
"For example, the conduct of cases such as the resumption of the Khodorkovsky trial will be a kind of litmus paper for us regarding the rule of law in Russia."
"For those who speak of leverage, I agree very much that we have to speak with one voice when talking with Russia, and we need this kind of debate to shape the form of this one voice."
"Unity and solidarity are essential, and we will work very hard to achieve this."
"It is important that the Member States inform and consult each other as much as possible about bilateral issues with Russia which could have repercussions on other Member States and the EU as a whole."
"Parliament's suggestions in this regard are worth considering, although, given the existing Council structures, I am not entirely sure that the creation of a formal consultation mechanism is the most practical way forward."
"I strongly feel, however, that some kind of mechanism or common approach is needed to complement the existing framework of EU-Russia relations."
"There is definitely some room for improvement in our policy towards Russia, and unity and solidarity are indeed the key words in this context."
"We already have quite intensive political consultation in the Council when it comes to showing solidarity, but this is also a question of political will."
"I agree that we need greater trust and understanding between the EU and Russia."
"We need to overcome the suspicions of the past and build on the real and substantial relationship which has evolved over the years, but this is certainly a two-way process and we need two to tango."
"The new agreement is one way to do this."
"The other is through a better dialogue."
"Parliament has an important role to play here and I can, therefore, agree with the suggestion that the role of the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee should be strengthened under the new agreement."
"The parliamentary dimension - like civil society contacts - has much to offer in terms of communicating and promoting the fundamental democratic principles and values on which the EU is founded."
"We therefore look forward to remaining in a dialogue with you as the negotiations progress."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, debates on Russia are never easy."
"Russia, on the one hand, is an important global partner, but, on the other hand, it is also a big neighbour, and there I think you have two sides that do not always easily converge."
"On the one hand, being a global partner, we see Russia as a real partner, as I said before."
"For instance, in the Middle East, in seeking a solution between Israel and Palestine and on many other of these issues."
"Or on Afghanistan and Pakistan, yesterday in the conference in The Hague, Russia had an important part to play; or on Iran, or on the non-proliferation issues, or on the big global issues like climate change, which was also mentioned, or now the financial and economic crisis."
"Everybody is being affected by that."
"This is true for us, but it is also true for Russia and for many other global partners."
"Therefore I think we have to see this very clearly, but at the same time we also have to see Russia as a great neighbour, where sometimes we do not see eye to eye in the common neighbourhood."
"And we have a common neighbourhood - some of you have mentioned that, be it Moldova or Nagorno-Karabakh or, of course, Georgia."
"There we have to make sure we come much closer to each other, but also speak frankly on the difficulties and the differences that exist."
"One of these issues is the 'Eastern Partnership', and we discussed the Eastern Partnership only last week in Parliament."
"The chief goal of the Eastern Partnership, which is concerned with six of our neighbouring countries, is to help those countries who want to come much more into line with the European Union on certain key issues like standards of governments, freer trade and others. In these activities, I think it is important that we have these countries as partners."
"But at the same time we have also said, on the multilateral platform, that we are, in principle, open to third countries like Russia on an ad hoc basis, as appropriate; certainly Russia is also a full member in the Black Sea Synergy, where regional matters are handled."
"So there is also a chance to work together in order to overcome some difficulties that exist."
"On the other hand, gas."
"With gas, we know - I said it clearly before and I will repeat it - we are interdependent; we know that."
"As we also know, the gas crisis has diminished the trust in our partners."
"It has underlined the importance of energy provisions in the coming EU-Russia and EU-Ukraine agreements, and they will be there."
"We must step up the work to create an internal energy market, but also increase efficiency and diversify supplies."
"The new agreement with Russia should therefore lay down, as we always say, legally binding reciprocal commitments."
"And, in parallel to the new agreement and for the short term, we are working with Russia to make the early warning mechanism more efficient, as I said before."
"We should also foresee monitoring and conflict prevention and resolution, and this should also involve Belarus and Ukraine."
"We know that Russia is a very important energy partner for us, contributing 40% of the gas we import and 20% of the gas we consume."
"This is, as I said before, a relationship of interdependence."
"Since we represent over two thirds of their export revenue - which has made a very significant contribution to Russia's economic development - it is essential that there should be no repeat of the events of last January, and therefore we are working with both the Ukrainians and the Russians to prevent that."
"On human rights we do not always see eye to eye."
"On the one hand, the EU and Russia share common international commitments, as I said, through the instruments that we have signed together at the UN, at the OECD and at the Council of Europe."
"These commitments reflect values and include the obligation to respect the decisions of the bodies they set up."
"That is particularly true for the European Court of Human Rights, but it is also evident that the EU and Russia interpret commitments differently."
"The European Union and Russia have chosen the path of dialogue on these issues, and this is the right way."
"This means that we must also listen to the concerns the Russian side expresses sometimes with regard to some developments inside the European Union including, for instance, the issue of Russian-speaking minorities."
"But it is also true, as the President-in-Office of the Council said, that there are clear concerns about the failure to respect human rights in the Russian Federation, and continuing cases of attacks on human rights defenders, journalists and others reflect badly on Russia."
"We raise these issues regularly with the high authorities: myself with Sergey Lavrov, and President Barroso with his interlocutors."
"We also use our twice-yearly human rights consultations to do so as well."
"The discussions in the bilateral meeting between President Barroso and President Medvedev on 6 February also included an exchange on human rights."
"President Medvedev himself suggested that these exchanges continue at the 21-22 May summit, and we shall take him up on that."
"For instance, the attack on human rights activist Lev Ponomarev last night is the latest reminder of how difficult the situation for human rights defenders is in Russia."
"But let me say that the two strands have clearly been reflected in the mandate that the Council has given the Commission to negotiate."
"Both are there, and this is the content of our mandate."
"Therefore, I think the right way is to follow up on this mandate and, as I said, we are always ready to report on the follow up of our negotiations, as we have just been doing."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 2 April 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"I welcome Janusz Onyszkiewicz's report on EU-Russia relations."
"I believe that the EU's relations with Moscow must be established on a pragmatic basis, avoiding any preconceptions."
"Firstly, proper cooperation is needed in the area of energy supply, which is of mutual interest."
"However, to achieve this, it is vital for us to have solidarity among EU Member States so that they can present a united front during the negotiations with Moscow on gas imports."
"This is the only way in which we can guarantee European citizens gas supply security at affordable prices."
"We have a responsibility to avoid triggering a new gas crisis."
"Secondly, we must cooperate with Moscow in tackling jointly problems concerning our common neighbourhood and relations with the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"This approach must be based on the norms of international law, with respect for the states' integrity and sovereignty, thereby avoiding any authoritarian trends."
"We must make progress in settling unresolved conflicts, such as those in Transnistria, Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"Russia is an important partner for the European Union."
"The EU expects its partners to cooperate with it in a reliable and honest manner."
"Interdependence may be mutually beneficial but it does not have to be so."
"The opposite can also be the case, and it can prove a source of disquiet and conflict."
"We should do all we can to ensure that economic cooperation, security, energy security, respect for the principles of human rights and democracy become a positive and constructive feature of our relationship."
"Whether this actually comes about largely depends on the Russian side."
"Russia may opt for the West's values and standards."
"Nobody will force Russia to make such a choice or indeed any other."
"Russia has to choose for itself."
"One thing is very clear to me, however, and that is that Europe will not change its values at the request of Russia or any other country."
"We are being consistent or even stubborn, but not because acting differently would mean abandoning our values."
"If Europe departed from its fundamental values, it could no longer be Europe."
"That is why we will always recognise the territorial integrity of Georgia, for example."
"We are not acting in this way out of any particular affection for the people of Georgia."
"Our stance is based on loyalty to the principles on which our world is based."
"Acting to the detriment of this world would amount to suicide."
"The EU certainly does not want such an outcome, nor, I suspect, does Russia."
"It can definitely be said that the recent gas crisis and the conflict in Georgia have created new tensions in relations with the Russian Federation."
"Russia must stop using situations of this kind in a way which is not in keeping with international procedures and refrain from creating new spheres of influence."
"At the same time, the EU must make every effort necessary to reduce its energy dependency on Russia as much as possible."
"However, it is equally true that Russia is one of the EU's neighbours and a crucial actor in the international arena."
"There is major economic potential in the EU's relations with Russia, which the European Union cannot afford not to tap, especially in the current global climate."
"This is why we must continue to invest in dialogue and cooperation with the Russian Federation, devising a coherent strategy based on common, mutually beneficial commitments."
"The only way in which this cooperation can be successful is for the EU to speak with a single voice and commit to a dialogue which is subject to conditions, but at the same time constructive, based on common values, respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and current international norms."
"Relations between the EU and Russia suffered a great blow last year."
"Today, after the events that took place in Georgia, and after Russia's recognition of the enclaves of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Russia's preparedness to build a joint security area with the European Union, and the parties' positions in matters concerning Kosovo and the common neighbourhood diverge more than ever."
"Continuing disputes with gas suppliers and the politicisation of energy resources do not increase trust."
"I am glad that my colleague Mr Onyszkiewicz's report calls on Russia to confirm obligations agreed to at international level, especially as a member of the European Council and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and expresses to the Russian government concern for the human rights situation and the shrinking civil society in Russia."
"In its report, Parliament has also drawn attention to the situation of minorities living in the Russian Federation, and calls upon Russian government agencies to ensure the survival and sustainable development of the cultures and languages of the indigenous peoples living in the Russian Federation."
"The European Union's relations with Russia must be based on partnership and not confrontation."
"Our relations with Russia are indeed of decisive importance from the point of view of pragmatic cooperation, and our cooperation has to date benefited international stability."
"At the same time, that partnership must be based on the following values: democracy, the market economy, the promotion of human rights and freedom of speech; not only commercial interests and seeing one thing in connection with those interests, while obstinately closing one's eyes to other things."
"in writing. - The relations between the Russian Federation and the European Union have seen several challenges in recent years."
"After the conflict between Russia and Georgia had unleashed in August last year, one might have felt inclined to think that good fences make good neighbours."
"In this case I am glad that the proverb had it wrong and the past President of the European Council Nicolas Sarkozy successfully mediated the crisis."
"After the fall of the Iron curtain the European Union has forged a close interdependence with the Russian Federation that ought to be used to introduce a common understanding of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, while fostering reliable economic relations."
"Frequent discords in recent years have distracted us from actually progressing towards that goal and the dialogue between the two entities has in fact become rather icy, taking the shape of ""pragmatic cooperation."""
"I very much support the suggestion to the Council and the Commission to continue to insist on an agreement based on a shared commitment to human rights, as stated in the report, because with no common values we are likely to end up with another unexpected crisis that calls for emergency measures."
"in writing. - (DE) The comprehensive new partnership agreement between the European Union and Russia is, in my view, very welcome."
"Russia is the EU's third-largest trading partner, as well as having major strategic importance in terms of Europe's energy supply."
"The agreement with the Russian Federation lays the groundwork for improved cooperation between the two parties."
"In light of how important the EU and Russia are to each other, this agreement must not, however, remain simply an act of political will; we must also be able to ensure that it is implemented."
"Parliament's recommendation to the European Council primarily emphasises the importance of protecting human rights and the freedom of the media in Russia."
"As the intention is for us to progressively build on our relationship in economic, security policy and education policy terms, it is extremely important that all our partners respect European values."
"It is the only way for the partnership between Russia and the European Union to be developed to the satisfaction of both sides."
"Securing a new agreement between the EU and Russia is one of the main challenges facing the European Union's diplomats."
"The European Parliament's role is to provide active input into the nature and content of the agreement. The report provides a detailed analysis of the main aspects of the relationship between the EU and Russia."
"In particular, it contains an indepth study of the problems associated with our current relationship."
"I believe that adoption of the report will amount to a significant step forward towards a new partnership agreement between the European Union and Russia."
"The key elements of such an agreement should be the subject of detailed consultation and also of hard negotiation between both parties to the new agreement."
"The report refers to a range of problems whose solution is particularly important to individual countries."
"I should like to recall the difficulties concerning trade exchange between Poland and the Russian Federation."
"Problems of this nature can only be resolved if the EU adopts a united stance."
"The report contains an extensive list of issues that must be settled."
"It will not be possible to achieve a compromise on all of them in the short term, due in part to cultural and social differences."
"Russia is a country in which the fundamental principles of democracy are often not respected."
"It is notorious for violating human rights, and restricting freedom of expression, including freedom of opinion."
"President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin exert their influence over the Russian media."
"The latter are therefore unable to serve their fundamental purpose, which is to disseminate information in a reliable manner."
"We should nonetheless bear in mind that Russia is one of our main partners."
"Russia plays a leading role on the international stage."
"It is also a major energy supplier and an important trading partner."
"In my view we should speak out against Russia loudly and clearly."
"We should criticise it for its shortcomings in terms of democracy, for its failure to respect civic freedoms, and for violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other states."
"We should call on Russia to respect the rights of national minorities and to comply with the international treaties it has signed up to."
"I refer to the Charter of the United Nations, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Energy Charter Treaty."
"At the same time, however, we should remember that partnership with Russia is a very important issue for the European Union and the whole of Europe."
"Opening of international negotiations in view of adopting an international treaty for the protection of the Arctic (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and the Commission statements on the opening of international negotiations in view of adopting an international Treaty for the protection of the Arctic."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, as we all know and can read every day, the Arctic is increasing in importance, and it deserves greater attention from the European Union as well."
"This was brought out in the resolution Parliament adopted in October."
"I welcome the opportunity this afternoon to address this issue, which I know is of particular concern for you."
"Only three EU Member States have territories within the Arctic region."
"Nevertheless, the effects of climate change and of human activities in the Arctic region extend far beyond the Arctic itself."
"What happens in the Arctic has significant implications for the EU as a whole."
"So far, issues with an Arctic dimension have tended to be addressed by the Union within the context of sectoral policies such as the maritime policy or the fight against climate change."
"Although cooperation within the framework of the new northern dimension covers European Arctic areas, the Union has not developed a broad Arctic policy bringing together all the relevant individual policy areas."
"This is now changing."
"In March last year, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner submitted to the European Council a joint report on climate change and international security."
"This report highlighted the new strategic interest in the Arctic region."
"It drew attention to the far-reaching implications of environmental change for the Arctic and it recognised that these could have consequences for international stability and for European security interests."
"The report called for the development of a specific EU Arctic policy based on the growing geostrategic importance of the region and taking into account issues such as access to natural resources and the possible opening-up of new trade routes."
"The Commission subsequently presented a communication on the EU and the Arctic region last November."
"This took up the various strategic challenges of the region and proposed concrete actions in three main areas: the protection and preservation of the Arctic in cooperation with the population; the sustainable use of resources; and strengthening multilateral governance of the Arctic."
"This last point was covered in last October's resolution."
"In its communication, the Commission specifically proposed, as one of its policy objectives, that the EU should work to uphold the further development of a cooperative Arctic governance system based on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and advocated the full implementation of all existing obligations, rather than proposing new legal instruments."
"This is one of the key elements in the communication."
"In its conclusion last December, the Council gave a clear welcome to the communication and considered that it constituted the first layer of a future EU Arctic policy."
"The Council agreed with the Commission that the EU should aim to preserve the Arctic in cooperation with its population and that it should address Arctic challenges in a systematic and coordinated manner."
"It considered that the goals of the EU could only be achieved in close cooperation with all Arctic partner countries, territories and communities, and also noted the intergovernmental cooperation in the region."
"It also welcomed the Commission's intention to apply for permanent observer status to represent the European Community on the Arctic Council."
"The Council specifically stressed the importance of multilateral cooperation in conformity with the relevant international conventions and highlighted, in particular, the UNCLOS."
"In line with the Commission communication, it did not express any support for the specific idea of an international treaty."
"On the basis of this position, the Council is now taking forward work on the details of the proposal for action set out in the Commission communication."
"I hope it is clear from what I have said today that the Council is taking this issue very seriously."
"We fully recognise the growing strategic importance of the Arctic region."
"We agree that the Europeam Union should have a comprehensive and coherent policy."
"The Council will certainly keep this Parliament fully informed about further developments and is grateful for your continuing interest in this subject."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament for its interest in the Arctic and also say how much we appreciated your resolution on Arctic governance last October."
"It gave political impetus to the Commission's own work on the communication that has already been mentioned, 'The EU and the Arctic region', which was adopted last November."
"Now, why is this so important?"
"We share your concern that the Arctic region deserves international attention as never ever before."
"Scientific evidence shows that climate change is occurring much faster in the Arctic than in the rest of the world."
"In the past six years alone, the ice cap has lost up to half its thickness near the North Pole and may have passed a tipping point."
"That is a clear warning sign we would be foolish to ignore."
"The radical transformation of the Arctic is having an impact on its people, its landscape and its wildlife - on land and at sea."
"Therefore, now is the time to act."
"That is why we adopted the communication, which is the first step towards an EU policy for the Arctic, laying the foundations for a more comprehensive approach."
"The communication focuses on three broad goals: protecting and preserving the Arctic, in full cooperation with its inhabitants; promoting the sustainable use of resources; and beefing up multilateral governance."
"The proposals in the communication are the outcome of a very thorough analysis made by the Commission."
"This involved consultations with all main Arctic stakeholders, including both EU and non-EU Arctic states."
"This was all the more necessary because many EU activities and key developments of global scope, such as the integrated maritime policy or climate change, have an effect on the Arctic."
"So, based on these discussions and in light of the motion for a resolution tabled for discussion today, let me stress that the Arctic region differs from the Antarctic in a number of key aspects."
"Unlike the Antarctic, which is a vast, uninhabited continent surrounded by an ocean, the Arctic is a maritime space, surrounded by inhabited land belonging to sovereign countries."
"So the idea of establishing a binding legal regime specifically designed for the Arctic is, unfortunately, difficult, because none of the five Arctic Ocean coastal states - Denmark, Norway, Canada, Russia and the United States - is in favour of such a regime."
"I therefore fear that such a proposal would at this stage not only be ineffective but could prove to be detrimental to the EU's role and credibility in overall Arctic cooperation."
"Rather than expending efforts on that cause, the EU's interests and objectives are better served by building greater multilateral cooperation and making better use of the existing legal instruments."
"Through the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and other general conventions, there is already an extensive international legal framework in place."
"The UNCLOS is also the basis for settling disputes, including maritime delimitation."
"We want to see these conventions fully implemented and, very importantly, adapted to the Arctic specificities."
"For example, we propose a regulatory framework for sustainable fisheries management where areas and species are not yet covered by other instruments."
"Secondly, we will work closely with the International Maritime Organisation, developing and enforcing solid international standards for safer Arctic navigation, respecting human safety and environmental sustainability."
"This means either extending existing legislation or adopting new legislation."
"Thirdly, we will also defend the internationally recognised principles of freedom of navigation and the right of innocent passage."
"Coastal states should avoid discriminatory steps concerning navigational rules."
"Any measures will have to be applied in full compliance with the International Law of the Sea."
"Fourthly, it is not realistic to propose an international moratorium on the extraction of Arctic resources."
"The bulk of the estimated reserves of minerals, oil and gas are either on the sovereign territory of the Arctic states or in their exclusive economic zones, and some of them have far-reaching plans for further exploration activities."
"However, we insist that the extraction and use of Arctic resources must always adhere to the highest possible standards for the environment and sustainability."
"We share Parliament's concerns about the urgency of action in this region, and our communication puts forward a set of coherent and specific proposals."
"Based on this, we look forward to continued cooperation with you as we develop an EU Arctic policy."
"Let us never lose sight of our common goal, and let us work together with the Arctic states and the international community to find the best and most effective way of preserving and protecting the Arctic for future generations."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I have participated in a number of meetings in the Arctic region focusing very much on climate change."
"Normally the first day in such meetings is devoted to the serious effects for the region, its wildlife, the livelihood of its people, and so on, because of global warming."
"The second day is very often devoted to opportunities in terms of geological exploitation."
"Something of a contradiction."
"I would submit that rapid exploitation of geological resources would, of course, entail very serious risks."
"I agree that you cannot draw an exact parallel between the Arctic and the Antarctic - I agree with the Commissioner there."
"At the same time, since we do not have a careful, sustainable environment framework in place for the kind of activities that are now being explored by the nations in this region, I think this resolution sends a very important signal: be careful."
"The fact that all political groups are behind it, I think, is significant."
"We list three alternative ways forward: one, an international treaty, with, of course, special provisions for this region compared to the Antarctic; two, a moratorium, pending new scientific research and a better understanding of the region and its vulnerability or sensitivity, but also pending the results of many energy alternatives that are now developing very progressively."
"Maybe in the future we will not need those fossil reserves at all."
"So I think that, even if colleagues in this Parliament may differ on the margin about the most responsible way forward, I think it is very significant that we are all behind this resolution."
"I want to stress that we want to go beyond just enhanced multilateral cooperation and dialogue; we want to ensure that the safety of the environment and the livelihoods of the people are protected."
"Mr President, I would like to quickly remind you about what is happening in the Arctic so that everyone understands what is at stake in this debate."
"At the North Pole global warming is sharpening appetites for control of the area's natural wealth."
"The melting of the ice will make it easier, as you have said, to exploit the vast oil and gas reserves and to open up a navigable waterway between the East and the West, which will save thousands of kilometres for cargo ships but will unfortunately prove disastrous for the environment."
"Claims to sovereignty over the area by the five border countries - Canada, Denmark, Russia, the United States and Norway - leads to obvious tensions."
"The Canadian Minister for Foreign Affairs announced this week that Canada's sovereignty over the Arctic's lands and waters was long-standing, well-established and based on historic title."
"He said that the Canadian Government would also promise increased political monitoring and a greater military presence in Canadian Arctic waters."
"These words echo the Kremlin's announcement of its intention to deploy military forces in the Arctic in order to protect its interests."
"Until now, regulation of this strategic area has come from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, signed by 150 countries on 10 December 1982."
"It lays down that coastal states exercise control over an area up to 200 miles from their coasts and have economic rights over the resources of the seabeds, but this area can be extended if the states can prove that the continental shelves extend beyond 200 miles."
"They have until May 2009 - and that is very close - to put a request of this kind to the UN."
"Russia took the initiative in 2001, hence the current unrest."
"As far as my group, and Mr Rocard, who initiated this debate in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and who has recently been appointed ambassador for the Arctic, are concerned, given the implications for energy, the environment and military security, the Convention on the Law of the Sea is not adequate for the Arctic."
"The North Pole is a global asset that must be protected by a binding charter, in which the European Union must play a leading role."
"We want a North Pole that is clean and above all without troops."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this debate clearly follows on from our resolution last October on Arctic governance."
"Our group has no problem in supporting the wish for an Arctic treaty, but more in the light of a quest for a new mode of governance."
"The treaty is perhaps more symbolic, but what we do insist upon is working with - and respecting - the nations and, more particularly, the peoples of the Arctic."
"It is people, as you have already said, that distinguish the Arctic from the Antarctic."
"There are already international structures - the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) rules, the International Law of the Sea - but there is a need for something more tailored and more specific."
"We should build on the work of the Arctic Council."
"Commissioner, you should join it as soon as possible and you should help build its political capacity."
"At all costs, we have to avoid a retreat into old-style sovereignty, territorial claims and intergovernmentalism."
"A new style of governance is needed for this fragile area of our globe in which every citizen of the world feels they have an interest or a stake."
"We also have to prove our credentials for Arctic involvement, and our record as Europeans is not good."
"Our sailors and traders devastated the Arctic environment in the 17th and 18th centuries with the so-called 'rape of Spitsbergen'."
"It is our industrial emissions that have led directly to acute climate change in the region, and we now threaten to impose our values and our traditions on the peoples of the Arctic at this very sensitive moment."
"We have to listen to them and work with them because, quite frankly, their record of protecting their environment is better than ours."
"Our group will not therefore support the 50-year moratorium."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I live on a lovely island - a beautiful island - which has been systematically destroyed by the European Union over the last 15 years."
"I have seen the European Union Landfill Directive, which has had industrial waste - laughingly called 'compost' - thrown upon the land."
"I have seen hundreds of thousands of fish dumped in the North Sea."
"Near my own village, I have seen what used to be wonderful fields of wheat and barley and dairy cattle being turned over to things like miscanthus and all sorts of other biofuels, wrecking our environment and pushing up the cost of food."
"The European Union wants us to meet our objectives of renewable energy."
"Thirty-five thousand wind turbines the size of jumbo jets, the biggest desecration of my beautiful island since the Industrial Revolution."
"And now you are looking for a remit over one of the last wildernesses in the world, the Arctic."
"Well, Mr President, colleagues, let me tell you that I agree with Mrs Wallis."
"Your record is appalling and the answer has got to be, for goodness' sake, keep your nose out of this."
"Mr President, yes, the Commissioner is right."
"The Arctic is quite different in many ways from the Antarctic, and it was only a few months ago, on 8 October 2008, that I spoke to this House on this very topic."
"The Arctic, as I said then, plays an increasingly important geostrategic role in our world, and over the past decade several critical issues have emerged in this region."
"We are now faced with the opening of hitherto closed seaways, a direct result of climate change."
"This comes as no surprise, since the Arctic is warming at a much faster rate, with an increase of two degrees in the last hundred years, compared to an average of just 0.6 degrees in the rest of the world."
"This highly vulnerable ecosystem is coming under increasing pressure from resource-hungry nations which wish to exploit its potential without having due regard to its fundamental importance as a stabilising force in the world's climate."
"I agree with Mrs Wallis's point that a call for a 50-year moratorium on any exploitation is neither practical nor reasonable, but I think a limited moratorium on new exploitation - pending fresh scientific studies - is something all civilised nations could perhaps agree to."
"Apart from this, the EU counts amongst its Member States no less than three Arctic nations along with two other EEA neighbours, accounting for more than half the numeric membership of the Arctic Council."
"This is reason enough for us to be able to assert ourselves, in the best sense of that word, on the global stage on this issue."
"The Arctic is critical for global climate, and for this reason alone we must be part of a new style of governance for this beautiful and - as the previous speaker said - one of the last wildernesses of our world."
"(ES) The Arctic region is one of the most fragile on our planet."
"The consequences of unrestricted exploitation of its natural resources would be catastrophic, not only for the surrounding area and the indigenous population, but for the world as a whole."
"The thawing of large areas has made those risks a reality, creating the need for a new global regulation to protect the Arctic, similar to the existing one for the Antarctic, while bearing in mind the differences that have already been highlighted in the debate."
"We need an international treaty between all parties involved, which no doubt includes the European Union, in order to protect the unique Arctic environment, to ensure the full sustainability of all kinds of human activity and to implement multilateral regulation of shipping in new sea lanes that become accessible."
"In the years since it was created, the Arctic Council has been a model of cooperation in managing shared problems."
"In these times of difficulty or uncertainty, we should take that spirit and understanding to a higher level so as to avoid neighbouring States or other international players becoming involved in geostrategic arguments and forgetting what should be our common goal: preserving a great shared heritage."
"Mr President, today we are discussing the protection of the Arctic, which is a very hot topic - not only in the European Union."
"Firstly, because the Arctic region is thought to contain huge energy resources - as much as 20% of the world's undiscovered technically recoverable reserves - the temptation to exploit these resources is irresistible."
"Secondly, the Arctic environment is exceptionally fragile."
"The whole of the international community stands to be affected by many of the changes that are already taking place."
"Thirdly, territorial disputes hang over the Arctic."
"We risk triggering major conflicts between countries wanting to protect - including by military means - what countries in the region consider their national interests."
"It is time for the European Parliament to make its position clear, as it has taken almost no part in this debate until now, with the exception of our resolution, passed in October last year, calling for an international treaty for the protection of the Arctic."
"It is important to mention that EU Member States and the EEA associated countries comprise more than 50% of the membership of the Arctic Council."
"As it is for the United States, the Arctic should be a strategic priority for the European Union."
"I fully support our draft proposal that the Commission and the Council should work towards establishing a moratorium on the exploitation of the geological resources in the Arctic for a period of 50 years, pending fresh scientific studies."
"We, the European Parliament, should call on the Commission to initiate negotiations with the Russian authorities on a number of important issues which are listed in our draft resolution."
"It is time to include the Arctic on the agenda for the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit."
"(DA) Mr President, Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark with significant responsibility under Home Rule."
"The Arctic is not uninhabitable."
"It is not an unregulated landmass like the Antarctic."
"On the contrary, the landmasses are part of the Arctic countries and four million people already live there, a third of these being indigenous people."
"These people and their nations have a legitimate requirement to exploit the resources and the opportunities found in the area."
"It is only the sea in the middle that has international status and in this regard the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) forms the relevant legal basis."
"This approach was also confirmed by the Arctic coastal states in the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration."
"In addition to UNCLOS, there are a large number of other relevant international and regional instruments."
"There is scarcely any need for more governance. At most there is a need to adapt the instruments already in place."
"Denmark has submitted a proposal to the Arctic Council to examine the existing agreements with a view to updating them."
"This will and should happen in cooperation with the Arctic states and the Arctic peoples."
"Mr President, the Antarctic Treaty serves as a shining global example that territorial claims by littoral states can be set aside in the interests of peaceful cooperation and scientific research."
"As the world confronts the issue of global warming impacting on the melting of the two caps and causing rising sea levels, and as frozen Arctic maritime passages re-open to navigation, it is important that an analogous arrangement be found for the frozen - or should I say thawing - North of the Arctic."
"The scramble for sovereign claims and Arctic mineral resources, as evidenced by the melodramatic planting of the Russian flag on the sea bed, must be rejected."
"The EU should try and convince the five Arctic littoral states - the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway and Denmark - of the wisdom of such an approach."
"(DA) Mr President, as a Dane involved in tabling this motion for a resolution together with Mrs Wallis in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am not necessarily very popular."
"However, I think that the main approach taken by the resolution is a good one."
"It is good that the EU is focussing on the Arctic region."
"It is also good for the small nations of Denmark and Norway that the EU is involved in this matter, so that we do not only need to play with the big boys of the area, the US and Russia."
"However, I would like to say that I am unable to vote in favour of the moratorium that has now been included in the resolution."
"Firstly, it is quite unrealistic."
"Russia and the US will not accept it under any circumstances."
"In addition, however, I also think that we need, as Mr Rovsing said, to take account of the people who live in the region and the people of Greenland naturally expect, and naturally have the right, to be able to utilise the natural resources on their territory, just as every other nation can on its territory."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I would simply like to remind you that it was the polar bears on the ice floes who showed us how much chemical pollution was affecting the whole of the world."
"DDT was found in their fat, and we all know very well that that is not a substance that is used on the ice floes."
"In any case, I would like to thank the Commission for the proposal it made after the discussion we had here in Parliament, because it is really urgent, on account of climate change, to protect the only area that is sheltered from human predation."
"We must remember that."
"There is, of course - and here I am taking up what Mrs De Keyser said - political urgency, because, after all, we are forced to do something for the Arctic."
"Indeed, some of the owners of part of this continent have designs on it."
"We know very well that Russia, which we spoke about recently, wants to establish its frontiers beyond its maritime area and extend them over the continental shelf."
"It is therefore an urgent matter for us, because Russia also wants to place its flags there and install military units, just as Canada does."
"What is missing from your proposal, perhaps, is what we asked for last time, that is, an international treaty for the protection of the Arctic, which will allow us to ensure its protection once and for all."
"(SL) We are witnessing both natural and human crises taking place in the Arctic."
"Our efforts should be directed towards ensuring that they are not followed by a political crisis or a crisis of any other sort. The call for a responsible approach towards the Arctic is an SOS and an issue of global governance."
"I welcome, in particular, any effort which respects the indigenous people of this region."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, who has cooperated really very closely with the European Parliament and is certainly the hardest-working Commissioner in this field: I really do appreciate it."
"She was also present at our meeting with the European Economic Area last week: after all, the Nordic dimension is particularly important here, and Diana Wallis, too, has repeatedly stressed that Europe bears a very particular responsibility in this connection."
"I think that, particularly in a financial and energy crisis, it is incumbent on us to take an even greater interest in this field and also to respond to the wishes and needs of the population in this regard, because, ultimately, man and nature are not in opposition, but should complement one another."
"From this point of view, I think we can point to some pleasing successes, particularly in energy policy, and perhaps we will be able to intensify cooperation in this field."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I welcome this timely debate."
"As a result of the quest for resources and climate change, the Arctic region is on the brink of a profound change."
"It is not only the region itself which is likely to be affected but, as many here today have recognised, also the EU as a whole."
"Against the background of these developments it is important that the EU approaches the Arctic in a comprehensive and strategic manner covering a whole range of issues, such as environment, transport, biodiversity, climate change, maritime affairs, energy and research, as well as protection of the livelihood of the indigenous peoples."
"I consider that the Council is now taking this issue very seriously."
"It broadly supports the suggestions set out in the Commission's communication."
"This should constitute the basis for an Arctic policy, which needs to be developed in a comprehensive manner."
"To those who are talking about the new treaty, there is no Council position at the moment because the Council is only now in the process of examining the Commission proposals."
"I would just like to recall the Council's conclusions from December."
"In the conclusion we say that the objectives of the EU could only be achieved in close cooperation with the Arctic countries, and the EU should enforce its participation in conformity with the current international conventions."
"As I mentioned earlier, the Commission proposals are now being studied in much more detail."
"They will, I believe, facilitate agreement on an overarching response to the many varied challenges which we face in the Arctic region."
"I welcome the interest of this Parliament and I am ready to come back to you to report once the Council has reached a position."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as I underlined at the beginning of this important debate, the European Union has to play an increasing role in protecting the Arctic environment, in promoting sustainable exploitation of natural resources and in enhancing Arctic multilateral governance."
"We are committed to the preservation of the Arctic and, at the same time, our aim is to contribute to a cooperative system that will guarantee sustainability, as well as free and equitable access."
"In order to succeed in these important endeavours, we have to cooperate closely with all the Arctic states and Arctic stakeholders, as I have said."
"In this regard, the Commission proposes to promote the full implementation and elaboration of existing obligations, rather than proposing new legal instruments in order to enhance security and stability."
"Strict environmental management and sustainable use of resources, as well as open and equitable access."
"At the same time, the EU has already highlighted that, for areas beyond national jurisdiction, the provisions on environmental protection under this Convention remain rather general, and we will continue to work within the United Nations towards the further development of some of the frameworks, adapting them to new conditions or Arctic specificities."
"For example, a new UNCLOS implementation agreement on marine biodiversity beyond the areas of national jurisdiction could take the Arctic into account, and we have also submitted our application to the Norwegian chair of the Arctic Council."
"The acceptance of the Commission's application requires the unanimous decision of all the members of the Arctic Council."
"This decision, which is due on 29 April - i.e. very soon - might be negatively affected by an initiative that perhaps proposes an Arctic Treaty, so we should be careful about that."
"Finally, let me say that the Arctic coastal states have a clear preference for the UNCLOS as a basis."
"The European Union has to take this into account when we want to develop even stronger cooperation for the benefit of the Arctic, its inhabitants and its wildlife."
"In this context, we should not weaken the existing frameworks for cooperation as this would not really serve our objectives and interests."
"Nor would it correspond to the spirit of your own draft resolution."
"In conclusion, I consider that the conditions are not yet right for an international treaty on the Arctic, and that we should rather focus our efforts on ensuring the effective application of the existing legal frameworks, thus filling the gaps that might exist, and adapting the rules to the specificities of the Arctic."
"This seems much more feasible."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 2 April 2009."
"Equal treatment of persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Buitenweg, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation - C6-0291/2008 -."
"Mr President, on Monday, the daughter of a friend of mine received a letter, a rejection letter from university."
"She had been rejected not on grounds of intellectual ability, but because she has a disability."
"The letter stated that the university was unable to offer her the care she needs."
"She got through secondary school fine, so it was no problem there, but now she has been sidelined."
"The report we are discussing today touches the heart of our society."
"Do we want people to be considered second-class citizens on grounds of their age, sexual orientation, religion or belief, or disability, or do we prefer a society in which everyone can participate fully?"
"When people are turned down for rented housing or loans on account of who they are, not only are they themselves unfairly treated, but society as a whole also sells itself short by writing people off."
"I have looked forward to today with eager anticipation."
"There is a great deal at stake in tomorrow's vote."
"The European Parliament has been calling for European directives on equal treatment between persons ever since 1995, and the Treaty of Amsterdam gave us a legal basis for this at long last."
"In 2000 some important directives resulted from this: the Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, whose scope covers both the labour market and the supply of goods and services, and also the Directive intended to combat discrimination based on religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation - although the latter directive is restricted to the labour market."
"That began to cause problems, as discrimination is banned in more spheres even in the gender field."
"Parliament has always opposed the hierarchy of grounds for discrimination that has arisen."
"After all, why should it be possible to refuse someone a loan for being homosexual, but not for being black?"
"The protection should be equal."
"We have all argued in favour of this horizontal directive, and there are differences between us, in terms of the tone and sometimes also of the precise substance."
"Yet up to now the vast majority of Parliament has had the will to put right the current imbalance, and it is this message we must convey to the Council tomorrow, so I hope for as broad a majority as possible."
"There are many people I should like to thank for their contribution to the report."
"First of all, the draftsmen, in particular Mrs Lynne of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Many of her suggestions have been incorporated into the text."
"I should also like to thank shadow rapporteurs Mr Gaubert, Mrs Bozkurt, Mrs in 't Veld and Mrs Kaufmann."
"In Dutch we have a saying that translates literally as 'jump over one's own shadow', which means surpassing oneself - looking beyond the point one has always been harping on about - this is a good point for shadow rapporteurs."
"In my opinion, we have succeeded in doing this."
"I am really proud of the compromise adopted by a vast majority in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"It has improved."
"I also wish to thank many more people who contributed to this, but one in particular: Mr Cashman."
"I wish to thank him for all the advice he has given me, for all his lobbying activity, and also for his inspiration and friendship over recent years."
"Moving on to the content, the report prohibits discrimination on four grounds."
"We had already regulated this for the labour market, but it now applies also to the supply of goods and services, social protection - including social security and healthcare - and education."
"Not all distinctions are regarded as discrimination, however."
"For example, insurance companies are still permitted to differentiate according to age or disability, provided they can give an objective justification for this."
"Provision must be made for many people with disabilities, but limits have been laid down as to what is considered reasonable."
"Derogations are permitted under certain conditions, therefore, but equal treatment is the rule, and that is what the vote is about tomorrow."
"Do we see Europe as nothing more than a market, or do we see it also as a fount of civilisation?"
"I must say that, in any event, Amendment 81 shows where Mr Weber and 41 others stand."
"You do not want to see equal treatment legislation full stop."
"It makes no difference what compromises I attempt to reach, as you simply object in principle to anti-discrimination legislation."
"Thus you are not making amendments, you are rejecting the whole proposal."
"This is where our paths diverge - no middle ground is possible."
"Let us wait and see tomorrow which way the majority in Parliament wishes to go."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the great interest in this proposal, the proof of which lies in the large number of amendment proposals it has given rise to."
"This shows that the fight against discrimination in everyday life is a constant priority for most of us, even during a serious economic crisis."
"I also welcome the excellent report submitted by Mrs Buitenweg and approved by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, as well as the remarkable contribution from Mrs Lynne and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"The draft report supports the ambition and the attempts of the draft directive submitted by the Commission."
"In my opinion the rapporteur has managed to reconcile different viewpoints and to achieve a broad consensus between the various political groups."
"I would like to applaud the supporting role played by Parliament in submitting the draft directive."
"As far as the proposed amendments are concerned, I agree with many of the improvement suggestions contained in the draft report."
"Nevertheless I would like to say that this draft requires unanimous consent in the Council and we must therefore remain realistic."
"I know that the problem of multiple discrimination is fundamental to you."
"I am fully aware of the fact that people who are victims of multiple discrimination are very seriously affected."
"However, at the same time I do think that as this directive applies to only four possible causes for discrimination, this problem cannot be definitively resolved at a legal level."
"In the Commission Communication on non-discrimination of July 2008 we committed to launching a discussion on this issue among the newly-established groups of government experts."
"The discussion has been launched."
"So the question of multiple discrimination is not being neglected."
"I could agree to a reference to multiple discrimination in the areas covered by this draft directive."
"I agree that we must define the division of powers between the EU and the Member States more clearly."
"The directive will not change the definition as such, but our aim is to achieve the greatest possible degree of legal certainty."
"I also accept that freedom of expression must be taken into account when considering cases of alleged victimisation."
"However, we ought to be aware that the concept of victimisation requires strong proof."
"Human dignity must be at stake and there must a hostile or humiliating environment."
"I agree to the inclusion of the concept of 'discrimination' by associationâ in the sense of the recent judgement in the Coleman case, but this concept should be applied only where there is direct discrimination and victimisation."
"As far as financial services are concerned, I agree that there is a need for service providers to implement a certain level of transparency, but I have certain doubts about the formulation used in your draft."
"I fully agree that the directive should not apply to purely private transactions."
"The positions of the Commission and Parliament are very similar here."
"As far as the physically disabled are concerned, I can support a reference to the open definition of physical disability used in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities."
"I also agree in essence with some of the comments on the concept of physical disability that are included in your amendment proposals."
"However, I think it is necessary to point out that the wording of the legal regulation must be very precise."
"I agree with some of the other ideas that were expressed, but in my opinion it is necessary to ensure that Article 4 is concise and intelligible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to hearing your opinions, which I will respond to in the debate."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for all the hard work which she has put into this report and the close cooperation that we have had on this."
"We have worked very closely together, not just on this report, but, as she knows, along with other people, we have both been working on this issue for many years now, for the 10 years since I came into the European Parliament."
"I remember that we sat together on Article 13 hearings all that time ago."
"Now, eventually, we have got to the situation where we are debating an anti-discrimination directive, a possibility at long last that we might push through anti-discrimination legislation on all grounds not covered - disability, age, religion or belief, and sexual orientation."
"We have waited many years for this."
"Let us just hope that we get that large majority."
"I have campaigned on disability and age for many years, but I was convinced quite some time ago that we could not leave anybody behind."
"We could not just go forward with a disability directive, and then an age directive, because I thought sexual orientation and religion would be left behind."
"That is why, in the own-initiative report last year, I asked for a single directive to cover all areas that were not yet covered."
"I am delighted that has happened."
"I am also very pleased we got such a large majority in Parliament for that own-initiative report."
"I know from the Commission and the Council that this was one of the reasons they thought it was safe to bring this proposal forward."
"That is why we have to get a very large majority for this report tomorrow."
"I would also like to say a very great thank you to Commissioner Å pidla."
"I have thanked him at other times, but I wanted to thank him in the plenary because, without his support and help, I honestly do not believe that we would have this proposal on the table at present."
"So, Commissioner, a sincere thank you from a lot of us, for pushing this forward."
"I know you have been doing a lot of work on this yourself."
"We got it through the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"We now need that large majority."
"Everyone should be treated equally across the EU."
"A wheelchair user or a guide-dog user should have free access anywhere within the European Union."
"Somebody of a different sexual orientation should be allowed to use any hotel room that they want to, and stay at any hotel when they go on holiday."
"All older people should have the right to have access to health care, whatever their age."
"People of a different religion should not be discriminated against."
"I urge all of you who are thinking of voting against this, please do not."
"This is the bedrock of the European Union."
"We were founded on human rights and anti-discrimination."
"Please vote for it."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety we have primarily looked at the need to guarantee equal treatment as regards health."
"Other areas have been covered very well by other committees, and above all by the rapporteur and the Commissioner, and we therefore decided to clarify the issue of health."
"Our first step was to note the great disparities that still exist between Member States in terms of access to healthcare."
"Access to healthcare is a fundamental right confirmed by Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and it is one of the chief tasks of the public authorities of the Member States to provide equal access for all to a quality healthcare system."
"Therefore, while we are aware of the different competencies of the European Union and the Member States, it is important for the EU to do all it can in terms of guidelines, but also in terms of directives, which we are gradually tackling and drafting, together with resolutions and regulations."
"We must pass these on to the Member States, where possible, with this essential objective."
"In particular, the amendments that we as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety have highlighted are those on encouraging the promotion of health literacy programmes, continuing to promote action to combat violence against women, fighting the denial of medical treatment on the grounds of old age, but above all - and I come back to this issue - promoting equal access to quality services in all Member States."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (DE) Mr President, as the Committee on Culture and Education's rapporteur for the new anti-discrimination directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, I warmly welcome the Commission's proposal and would specifically like to thank Mr Å pidla."
"Eurobarometer polls show that approximately three quarters of the population of the EU think that action needs to be taken in this field."
"The Committee on Culture and Education called for amendments and additions in three areas."
"Firstly, the inclusion of gender."
"We agree with the compromises achieved."
"We wish to guarantee access to media and education, and regulate against multiple discrimination; some good compromises have been achieved here."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has supported this comprehensive horizontal directive."
"If German conservatives and liberals now reject the directive in its entirety, they will be revealing their true colours: they want to continue to discriminate against gay people, and to broadcast propaganda."
"There is no need to fear extremists such as Scientologists under the new directive: it will still be possible to reject advertisements or refuse to book assembly rooms."
"The Committee on Culture and Education votes unanimously in favour of the horizontal framework directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor to report the positive outcome in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, and it is not by chance, as our committee is accustomed to conducting in-depth examinations on equal treatment, equal opportunities and prohibiting discrimination."
"The opinion we passed in committee sent out several strong messages, which will, I hope, be taken on board when the text is adopted."
"This directive does not close or complete a cycle."
"If that were the case, the field of gender discrimination could be weakened as a result."
"This directive should become an opportunity to revive work on the anti-discrimination directives, beginning with the addition of two new concepts that we all agree on: multiple discrimination, where two or more risk factors are present, and discrimination by association, which concerns those close to or connected with the person directly affected."
"Both of those are crucial for women, as well as for other groups."
"This directive should represent an impetus to improve national legislation, above all in countries such as my own, where the tide must be turned."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hardly dare take the floor here any more; given the overall atmosphere here in plenary, I hardly dare ask questions any more."
"Of course we are all against discrimination, but one dare not question the route we are taking here for fear of being pushed into a corner."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we do all agree on the destination here, and I would appreciate it if we could all refrain from suggesting otherwise."
"What we are arguing about is the route, and that must be a legitimate subject for discussion, even by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"First of all, I have something to ask the Commissioner: given that the old directive, the existing anti-discrimination directive, has still not been transposed in ten of the Member States - given that infringement proceedings are underway against ten Member States - we seriously have to ask ourselves why we need to revise this directive when the old one has not even been transposed yet."
"Is that a serious question that we are allowed to ask?"
"That is why referral back to committee really is an argument that we should be allowed to raise here."
"On the second issue, too, we are allowed to talk about the content."
"For example, there is the question of why the churches, which were close partners of the Left when it comes to the protection of refugees, are now coming to us."
"The churches, which used to be your partners, are now coming to us and saying that they have difficulties with certain wordings."
"When media people, newspaper publishers, come and tell us they have questions, we should discuss those questions seriously."
"When we discuss families, the Commissioner says that he does not want to impose anything on the Member States, but, of course, what we are doing with this directive is harmonisation by the back door."
"The list goes on."
"There are various arguments that could be raised that give our group cause for concern, considerable concern."
"It is possible to raise these things, even if one is committed to fighting discrimination."
"The Left in this House today is very pleased with itself, because it is once again creating new legislation on a number of points."
"We should therefore be allowed to wonder whether, in the end, the legislative approach will actually bring many new benefits for the people we are trying to protect."
"There are other basic values that are worth taking into account: for example, if we are to include private contracts as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wishes - not just commercial contracts, but also private ones - we must be allowed to wonder whether contractual freedom is not an important basic value that we in Parliament should be protecting."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is opposed to discrimination, and will always work to combat it, but we must be allowed to argue in this Parliament about how to do so."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Tomorrow, we shall have a unique opportunity to take a historic step in the fight against discrimination by saying 'no' to this phenomenon."
"Indeed, we have rather a strange situation at present, with differences in protection against discrimination."
"There is no reasonable explanation for the fact that the law against discrimination offers protection beyond the workplace to a black homosexual on grounds of skin colour, but not of sexual orientation."
"Tomorrow, we shall be able to show that the European Parliament no longer tolerates discrimination on grounds of age, disability, sexual orientation or religious beliefs."
"After all, Europe is there for everyone."
"It is unacceptable that someone wanting to rent a car or a property should be turned down on grounds of his or her religion."
"In addition, wheelchair users should be able to use cash machines or have access to trains and stations like anyone else."
"There is no good explanation for a bank allowing someone aged 65+ to be thousands of euro in the red but refusing to grant them a modest loan."
"We are all growing a little older and if we think about it, these are things that will affect us too before long."
"The differences of opinion may not have made for easy negotiations, but we can be proud of the result achieved by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs - to which, what is more, all parties committed themselves at the time."
"The proposal is reasonable and realistic."
"Adjustments may be necessary in order to afford people with disabilities access to goods and services, for example, but this does mean they will be able to participate actively in society once more."
"These adjustments will not impose a disproportionate burden subsequently, and also due account has been taken of a good time limit for implementation."
"Adjustments do not need to be carried out immediately; we do not expect Member States to adapt railway stations straight away."
"What we do require of Member States is that they already start taking accessibility for people with disabilities into consideration in future building and transport design."
"In addition, I cannot stress enough how important this report will be to European citizens - the people this is all about."
"We should bear in mind that, according to the Eurobarometer, 87% of Europeans would like to see measures taken on the grounds for discrimination under this Directive."
"That includes your voters, Mr Weber."
"Our group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, is delighted with the proposals to combat the problem of multiple discrimination that now form part of this report."
"Can you imagine that a black female wheelchair user can feel discriminated against?"
"Very few countries are familiar with the concept of multiple discrimination."
"In most cases, when reporting a case of discrimination, this woman would have to choose from possible grounds for discrimination."
"It is more likely that the various grounds are interconnected and there is not just one ground for her being discriminated against."
"This woman must have the opportunity to lodge a complaint and obtain redress and justice."
"Therefore, we call on Parliament to retain these important provisions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to support this Directive."
"This will enable Parliament to state clearly and unambiguously that discrimination can no longer be tolerated and that Parliament considers the rights of all its citizens equally important."
"Let us take this step."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to start by adding my heartfelt compliments and thanks to the rapporteur, who has done a fantastic job."
"My group is delighted that, almost five years after Mr Barroso promised to do so, a proposal for a directive is finally on the table."
"Discrimination runs counter to the European Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Yet treaties, conventions and solemn declarations are of little use in court."
"European citizens must be given an instrument to enforce their rights."
"This, not milk quotas or public procurement rules or the Structural Funds, is the raison d'Ãªtre of the European Union, Mr Weber, a European area where everyone is free to arrange their lives at their own discretion."
"A single European area where everyone is equal before the law, enjoys equal opportunities in society and is treated with respect."
"A directive alone will not suffice to bring this about, but it is a precondition."
"This Directive is about Europe as a community of values, and values cannot be negotiated by 27 governments in the course of the usual trade-off of national interests."
"We determine values together as citizens, in an open debate, and the European Parliament is the appropriate arena for this."
"Yes, Mr Weber, some areas are very sensitive, particularly the grounds of sexual orientation and religion."
"We have a responsibility towards all our European citizens, however, we cannot let Europe turn into Animal Farm: 'All Europeans are equal, but some Europeans are more equal than others'."
"Freedom of religion and of conscience are fundamental rights for which I would fight on the barricades."
"In a free Europe, everyone must have the freedom to hold their own convictions."
"This is the cornerstone of democracy."
"Freedom of religion must not be misused as a licence to discriminate against others, however."
"Yesterday, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights published its second report on homophobia in Europe."
"It is a disgrace that, in 2009, millions of people are still having to fear discrimination, hatred, violence and even murder in Europe, merely on account of their sexual orientation."
"I can reassure Mr Weber that laws on marriage are and remain a national competence; this Directive does not change that."
"In 21st century Europe, a ban on marriage on grounds of religion, racial origin or sexual orientation is an anomaly, however."
"Many people think it perfectly acceptable for the government to ban marriages or partnerships between two adults of the same sex."
"Yet would we consider it acceptable if - as has happened in the past - the government were to ban marriages between Jews and non-Jews, Catholics and Protestants, blacks and whites?"
"This is unacceptable."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote in favour of this report, in the interests of the citizens we all represent."
"Compromises are not ideal for anyone, ourselves included; but let us surpass ourselves, as Mrs Buitenweg says."
"Finally, I would urge the Council, too, to follow Parliament's recommendations."
"It is true that each Member State has its own issues, but the European Parliament has shown that differences can be bridged and that we can agree on rights for all European citizens."
"Mr President, the European Commission maintains that this proposal is not aimed at amending matrimonial law and adoption law in the Member States."
"The Commission claims that it does not wish to change the legal status of the Church and of religious bodies involved in care and education."
"The Buitenweg report rides roughshod over these limits in every respect."
"It overturns guarantees for national family and adoption legislation in Amendment 50."
"Pursuant to Amendments 12, 29 and 51 the report represents an attack on the freedoms of religious educational institutions."
"Amendment 52 of the report undermines the guarantee of freedom for religious communities themselves in Member States."
"It is abundantly clear that the European Left wishes to reduce European integration to a single issue."
"In effect, it is obsessed with pushing through the latest homosexual demands by any possible means."
"This amounts to the most serious attack ever perpetrated against the credibility of this House."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I must insist on one fundamental fact."
"The European project will only have credibility if Europe is perceived as a place where every kind of discrimination is outlawed."
"This is the basis for the today's debate."
"Therefore, it is a surprise that some of my fellow Members, who are so pro-European in all other debates, turn completely anti-European when it comes to rights and liberties."
"This attitude cannot be tolerated."
"It is unacceptable that anyone should suffer discrimination in the European Union today, on the grounds of a same-sex relationship, disability, age, or for having a non-mainstream belief or religion, as has also been mentioned."
"This is not the Europe in which I want to live, and is certainly not the Europe that I am working for every day, both inside and outside of this House."
"For this reason, I believe the proposal for a directive was necessary."
"In its conception and principles, it is good."
"It may not be what I, or many of us here would have done, but it is a good starting point."
"I hope that the majority will vote for the Buitenweg report tomorrow, as I intend to do, as I believe it to be the correct course of action."
"I am also very anxious that the other item dealing with the implementation or re-implementation of Article 7(2) will be passed."
"This guarantees a fundamental issue: that all associations and organisations working in the anti-discrimination field must also be allowed to represent and defend victims of discrimination."
"We must remember that these persons form part of the most vulnerable groups, and we therefore need to have a guarantee that they can be represented and duly defended."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, for all her work."
"This matter was particularly safe in her hands."
"Parliament has been calling for this directive for years, which does indeed mean that it is of fundamental importance that it be adopted before the end of this parliamentary term."
"At the same time, it is vitally important for the Commission to table a proposal for combating sex discrimination as soon as possible, so as to put a stop, finally, to the existing hierarchy of forms of discrimination."
"In other respects, I cannot help but be surprised that, in Amendment 96, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is trying to remove discrimination on the grounds of belief from the scope of the directive."
"So, ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE Group, do we really need to point out to you that the legal basis on which this proposal for a directive rests - namely Article 13 of the EC Treaty - has been in law since the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force in 1999, 10 years ago?"
"Do I need to remind you that all of the grounds for discrimination listed in Article 13 are regarded as equal, without distinction?"
"In addition, ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE Group, it cannot have escaped your notice that Article 10 of the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights treats the religion and beliefs of every single person as equal."
"You know, Mr Weber of the CSU, I have certainly heard your arguments, but I really must say that, God knows, they are antediluvian."
"Your Amendment 81, rejecting the entire directive, comes with a quite frankly cynical justification attached, namely that the transposition of the directive apparently - and I quote - 'entails excessive bureaucracy'."
"You know, Mr Weber, I simply cannot comprehend these attempts to deny people their rights, particularly with this justification, and I hope that your Amendment 81 will be clearly rejected in tomorrow's vote in plenary."
"The EU must finally take another step forwards in the fight against discrimination in our society."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, this House champions civil liberties, one of which is freedom of education."
"An important freedom is parents' choice of a school for their children."
"Christian schools and establishments in my country deliberately opt for an admissions policy that is in keeping with the identity of their school."
"The Netherlands leaves scope for an admissions policy that is in keeping with a school's fundamental principles."
"Requirements can be laid down that are necessary for the realisation of the school's purpose and fundamental principles."
"Parents may choose a school that is conscientious in this regard and takes the Bible seriously."
"This is an extension of freedom of religion, and respects the convictions of parents with regard to the interests of their child's education."
"However, Amendments 29 and 51 restrict the freedom of schools to make these choices on the basis of principle, and furthermore I share the view of Mr Weber and others."
"This proposal does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Aside from the administrative problems, this in itself seems to me sufficient grounds to reject the Commission proposal."
"I shall be voting against Mrs Buitenweg's report."
"I hope that other groups, too, can see that this represents a serious infringement of our citizens' freedoms."
"Anyone valuing freedom of choice for parents will not allow this freedom to be curtailed."
"(NL) Mr President, reports on anti-discrimination directives always bring out the worst in this House; this is particularly regrettable, as they often contain a great deal of good proposals and ideas for helping people with disabilities, for example."
"This does not change anything in substance, however."
"The amendment by Mr Weber, Amendment 81, does indeed state all the essentials; this Commission proposal is not a good one."
"It has to go, not only because it entails far too much red tape, but also, in particular, because it essentially infringes the principle of subsidiarity."
"Unfortunately, we all know that this amendment does not stand a chance, as this House never loses an opportunity to show its most politically correct side and always opts for more bureaucracy and more decision-making over the heads of European citizens."
"Aside from this, aside from the infringement of the principle of subsidiarity, this report also contains numerous proposals that run directly counter to elementary democratic principles and principles of the rule of law."
"One example is Amendment 54."
"While the whole report makes a big hoo-ha about not discriminating against people, this amendment advocates discrimination on grounds of non-politically correct beliefs - but then, at the end of the day, this is what a great many other aspects of this report set out to do."
"Hidden in a catalogue of worthy principles and pseudo-good intentions lurks the judicialisation of political correctness."
"It is not about anti-discrimination measures, then, but very often about genuine muzzling laws to undermine freedom of expression yet more, and strengthen a kind of progressive opinion terrorism still further."
"The essential question is and remains: what on earth has this got to do with Europe?"
"Leave to Member States what is theirs, for heaven's sake."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, when the European Union is, at times, seen as over-keen on regulation and quite rightly criticised for this, this can be traced back, quite simply, to reports such as the one we are now discussing."
"As much as I support realistic measures to combat any form of discrimination, I must also criticise the points being discussed here, because they are simply not justified and will not have the desired effect."
"It is unacceptable that, as has already been mentioned, faith schools, for example, can be sued for rejecting teachers of a different faith, or no faith, or that insurance companies can be sued for undertaking a risk assessment if it results in a distinction on the basis of age or sex, or that there is a risk of absolutely all residential buildings having to be constructed to be barrier free."
"Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that is the direction we are heading in; we will no longer actually be supporting disabled people, but making all housing unaffordable."
"Housing that nobody can afford, instead of assistance for disabled people - surely that cannot be what we are aiming for here."
"Then there is the criticism of the reversal of the burden of proof."
"If I think that, as an MEP with 25 applicants for an assistant's position, I could have a case brought against me just for the appearance of discrimination or a feeling of discrimination, I will simply not be able to work any more, but spend all my time battling with the evidence I need to provide just because the feeling is there, even though I have not discriminated in any way."
"On top of that, there is the vagueness of many of the terms."
"Overall, this factsheet that has been published is a precursor to this directive, which starts to discuss whether we are still allowed to use 'Miss' and 'Mrs', or whether we need to get rid of all words ending in 'man', such as statesman or sportsman, because it could all be discriminatory."
"Ladies and gentlemen, some of what is being called for here is quite simply nonsense, and I will therefore be voting against the report."
"(FR) Mr President, first of all I wish to thank our rapporteur, in particular for the work she has done and the result that has finally been achieved."
"Article 13 of the Treaty is our cornerstone, and I must emphasise that Member States can guarantee a higher level of protection."
"It is only a matter of minimum standards and, let us be clear about this, it is not possible to lower the current level of protection in individual Member States on the basis of this new directive."
"This is because, to be even more precise, some Member States have a very high level of protection; such cases do exist."
"Freedom from discrimination is a fundamental right for everyone living in the European Union."
"However, whether it is due to a person's appearance or simply their surname, we realise that discrimination does all too often exist."
"As regards people with disabilities, we must ensure that they are no longer discriminated against for using a wheelchair, because access to many places is all too often difficult."
"Improving European legislation is a prerequisite for combating discrimination - I repeat, it is a prerequisite."
"We need this legislation."
"From a very young age our children suffer discrimination that traumatises them, and they carry the burden of this discrimination for the rest of their lives."
"I must draw your attention in particular to multiple discrimination."
"The Commission omitted to include this in its proposal."
"We therefore propose a precise definition of these types of discrimination."
"It is absolutely essential that we strengthen legislation in order to make equal treatment effective whatever the differences."
"In this respect we ask for Member States to take measures to promote equal treatment and equal opportunities regardless of religion, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"In conclusion, I must add that we hope that, for 2010, there will be a Commission proposal putting gender discrimination on the same footing, as this would put an end to any hierarchy of rights."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like those who have spoken before me, I would like first of all to thank our two rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg and Mrs Lynne, for the outstanding work that they have done in what was, I would point out, a context of enhanced cooperation."
"Although I personally feel very much in line with the overall position defended by Mrs Lynne, I want to applaud the intelligence, openness and conciliatory spirit shown by Mrs Buitenweg throughout the discussion in our committee in order to try to end up with a report that is balanced and that would be supported by a large parliamentary majority."
"I hope she will be successful and that the more radical elements, on one side, I think, and sometimes on the other, will not succeed in affecting the vote."
"In this respect - and let me point out that I am not known as a left-wing fanatic - I have to say that I am surprised and dismayed by the amendment tabled by our fellow Member, Mr Weber, whom I respect, and several others."
"Mr Weber, I listened to your speech, and none of the arguments you used seemed to me to have any intellectual basis."
"You have stated fantasies, you have not stated reasons."
"If one reads the justification for your amendment, one can only be dismayed by its weakness: refusing to combat discrimination because of fear of excessive bureaucracy."
"When you try to turn this proposal into a conflict between left and right, you are wrong."
"Combating discrimination is not a matter of right or left, it is a matter of humanism and of respect for fundamental rights."
"(Applause)"
"That is why tomorrow, I hope and believe, you will be defeated."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, any initiative aimed at combating discrimination of any kind must be supported."
"Recent statistics show that in Europe, where society is so advanced, a minority of citizens say they have suffered discrimination."
"No one, therefore, can remain indifferent."
"However, the concept itself remains so wide and abstract that some clarification would be desirable."
"Without prejudice to fundamental human rights, which remain unquestionable, we cannot fail to recognise the sovereignty of each Member State to legislate in line with age-old traditions, civilisations and cultures."
"Intervention of this kind is almost always a case of safeguarding a population's identity."
"Let me give an example relating to sexual orientation: it is my personal opinion, but I believe that human dignity must be guaranteed irrespective of sexual preference."
"Homosexuality is a choice that pertains to the private sphere and must under no circumstance be punished, but nor must it be protected."
"Freedom of opinion: where does protection against direct and indirect discrimination begin, and where does it end?"
"Freedom of religion: at my niece's school, for the first time this year, there was no nativity play."
"The head teacher banned it because there were children of other religious faiths present."
"In my view, since the nativity play is a demonstration of culture more than faith, in order to prevent one form of discrimination, another was created."
"Having respect for other people's religion does not mean, Mr President, that we should be ashamed of our own!"
"That is why - I shall finish here - our fear is that this proposal for a directive tends towards unnecessary reverse extremism, and the cure could prove worse than the original problem."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this directive finally closes the gaps in anti-discrimination law, and allows the European Union to meet its international obligations to protect human rights, as well as its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, your arguments against the directive are populist and misleading."
"What right do you have to deny people with disabilities unrestricted access to education, or older people equal treatment regarding insurance and financial services?"
"What concept do you have of humanity?"
"Unrestricted participation in society is a human right, and for that reason we will fight for this directive and for equal opportunities for all."
"In my view, it is totally inhumane to require victims of discrimination to provide proof of the discrimination."
"If you, ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE Group, delete the shift in the burden of proof, you will be putting at risk the basic right of some groups to protection of their human dignity, and we find that unacceptable."
"We want equality for all in protection against discrimination, and we Greens will fight for that."
"We will not allow human rights to become a plaything for populist scaremongering."
"I can predict right now that you will lose tomorrow; the majority of this House will vote in favour of the human right of protection from discrimination."
"Of that I am certain."
"Mr President, I will be voting against this report and this proposed directive for three reasons."
"First of all, I dissent from the belief that the EU, rather than national governments, should be legislating on these issues, believing every Member State is best placed to decide if it needs to strengthen such legislation."
"If ever there was a subsidiarity issue, this should be it."
"My second reason is that the new offence of harassment has the alarming prospect of, in fact, curbing the rights in respect of freedom of speech and freedom of religion, particularly for those who proclaim a Christian message."
"Christians preaching the gospel, particularly in a public place to people of other faiths who take offence and who claim it is an assault on their dignity, could be breaching this law."
"Likewise, defending and promoting a biblical approach to heterosexual marriage could allow litigious gay rights activists to claim harassment."
"The third reason is that the measures within the directive are disproportionate and inadequately balanced."
"It compels the Christian printer, for example, to accept an order to print material which offends his religious beliefs, whereas he should be free to conduct his business according to his conscience."
"Without essential balancing mechanisms, this directive will become an instrument which in fact creates discrimination."
"Thus, to me, it is an unnecessary directive infringing basic rights, particularly of people of faith and conscience, and illustrates all that is over-reaching, meddling and wrong-headed within the EU."
"(RO) The Commission's initiative to extend the application of the principle of equality of treatment to other areas of social life as well, using a global directive which bans discrimination outside the workplace, based on disability, age, religion or belief and sexual orientation, is, in principle, necessary to be able to finalise the anti-discrimination legislative package."
"The introduction of the concept of multiple discrimination and the special attention given to the rights of the disabled mark a step forward."
"This proposal for a directive remains, however, a delicate and controversial subject."
"This legislative text must maintain a balance between the European Union's powers and Member States' powers by clearly defining its scope of application."
"Aspects of family law, including civil status, reproductive rights and adoption rights must not be included as part of the scope of application of the proposal for a directive, a fact which must doubtlessly be made clear from the legislative text."
"The use of the institution of marriage cannot be accepted in any way other than in the Christian sense."
"Another legally accepted designation can be found for other partnerships."
"The principle of subsidiarity must also be respected in aspects linked to educational content and organising national education systems, including denominational schools."
"The European People's Party has always supported the promotion of diversity as an important objective of the European Union and the fight against discrimination."
"Unfortunately, the text contains provisions which are unacceptable from the perspective of religious doctrine."
"Paradoxically, the left intends to discriminate in this way."
"In fact, it is me being discriminated against simply because I sincerely believe in God."
"Mr President, it has been an interesting debate and it would be funny if it was not so tragic."
"Most of the opposition I have heard this afternoon is, I think, sincerely felt and believed, but it is not based on the facts and it is not based on the text before us."
"Nothing in this report undermines subsidiarity or proportionality."
"Indeed, if it did, it would be corrected by the Council of Ministers."
"So I urge you, even now, to vote in favour and allow the Council of Ministers to do the right thing to make sure that it is absolutely proportionate and subsidiarity is respected."
"Mr Weber, Europe was born out of the values of the Second World War - a determination that we would never look away again whilst one group of individuals or other groups were targeted or made a scapegoat and led away to concentration camps and work camps."
"A determination that there would be no hierarchy of oppression."
"Yet, sadly, you want to have a Europe that is not based on those decent values, a Europe that believes and respects that all human beings are born equal."
"Those opposed to this have to answer to their conscience, to their religion and to their voters as to why you believe some people should be treated differently from others, that they should not have equality."
"I stand here fortunate, as a gay man - and if I chose to be gay, is it not interesting that one obviously therefore chooses to be heterosexual? - fighting for equality, not just for gay men and lesbians and bisexuals and transgender people, but for people on the basis of their age, their religion, their belief, their gender, anything that is perceived to be different that could be used to take equality away from them."
"I believe the litmus test of any civilised society is not how we treat a majority, which, interestingly, is made up of so many different minorities."
"The litmus test of any civilised society, as people listening in the visitors' gallery will tell you, is not how we treat the majority, but how we treat the minorities, and, in that instance, some Member States are sadly lacking."
"Shakespeare said, rather brilliantly, 'the evil that men do lives on, the good is oft interred with their bones'."
"Look to yourself, imagine if it were you who was different - who had a different religion, a different belief, a different age, a different sexual orientation - would it be right that you should have your human rights taken away from you?"
"The answer has to be 'no'."
"Now is the opportunity for the House to do that which is right and just and good."
"At this point in the debate Mr Å pidla will have to speak."
"He will explain better than I the reasons why he has to do so."
"I am giving him the floor immediately."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) In a few minutes I will have to attend the negotiation proceedings over the Working Time Directive, and you will surely agree that that is one topic which cannot be avoided."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to the debate on the report and I have to say that I listened with some emotion, because it expresses the essential elements and the enormous depth of this problem."
"The basic question is what does this directive defend?"
"This directive defends human dignity."
"We cannot believe that it is any less of an affront to human dignity to be discriminated against on grounds of disability, for example, than on grounds of age."
"We are talking about human dignity and it is the same for everyone."
"I have to say that this directive, as it has been submitted to the Commission, is one which came into being organically, out of a profound debate in Parliament and countless debates at Commission level and therefore it is a directive which is well thought-out and which expresses a firm and clear approach to values."
"It was also said in the debate that non-discrimination is based on values which we applied and which we became aware of after the Second World War."
"Whether or not it is true that we developed a deeper awareness of the significance and constitutive weight of certain values after the Second World War, these values have very deep historical roots."
"In antiquity there was no fundamental concept of human equality - the concept was first formulated in the Christian religion."
"I well remember one encyclical or perhaps a papal bull from the 9th century called Oriente ian sole which clearly stated, 'is it not true that the sun shines in just the same way on everyone?' From that moment this concept has echoed through the whole of history."
"Of course, the debate included many questions of a technical nature or of a seemingly lower order than the questions we have been talking about just now."
"I would like to touch on them."
"The first question was about the creation of senseless additional bureaucracy."
"I think that this can be rejected for one simple reason."
"The directive does not require new structures or new bureaucratic bodies."
"The directive only extends the application of that which already exists, so it does not in any way involve more bureaucracy."
"There was also the open question of subsidiarity."
"This question was examined with exceptional care because it is a fundamental question."
"Article 13 of the Treaty is clear."
"It provides a firm legal basis and a directive which rests on this legal basis does not conflict with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Another fundamental principle of this directive is the question of, for example, transference of the burden of proof."
"This question has already been resolved in previous directives, so there is no new discovery in this case either."
"However, I would like to say something about the burden of proof."
"The aim of this directive is to strengthen the ability of individuals to defend themselves - that is the fundamental aim."
"This would not be possible without transferring the burden of proof."
"Irrespective of the fact that in many legal systems the burden of proof is already transferred for far less important reasons or for reasons of comparable importance."
"A classic example of transferring the burden of proof is the so-called assumption of paternity and there are many more examples."
"It was also said in the debate that some of the terms were too open."
"Ladies and gentlemen, most constitutional terms are open and require interpretation in a given set of circumstances."
"For example, I remember in the German Constitution there is the formulation 'possession obliges'."
"This is a typically open formulation which is redefined of course in different specific cases."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there was some exaggerated talk of potentially heavy costs, especially in relation to the physically disabled."
"I can state that the directive does not propose any fixed or concrete matters but speaks about reasonable conformity and I can state again that that if reasonable conformity is applied from the outset there will not for the most part be any excessively high costs."
"I must say that if we regard potentially higher costs as acceptable in relation to health and safety at work, where we are protecting human life, then in my opinion any higher costs that are involved in protecting human dignity - although I do not believe that they will be substantially higher - also exist in proportion to the interest that is being protected, because equality and human dignity, ladies and gentlemen, are interests that have been woven into the Treaty and they are interests that we must defend with all our might."
"In my opinion there is nothing more significant for the European Union than the concept of non-discrimination."
"Although I am a supporter of the internal market and although I am a supporter of many other areas of European policy, I believe that the concept of equal opportunities and non-discrimination is the deepest bedrock of all."
"Mr President, it is clearly right that we end the complicated patchwork of laws, with different people protected against discrimination in different situations, in favour of a single equality regime."
"The woman refused a bank loan, the disabled person refused access to a building, the gay man refused accommodation, a black person barred from a club, and so on, should all be protected on the basis of similar principles."
"I just want to mention two issues."
"One concerns protection from harassment."
"It is rightly made clear in the text that what is barred is the creation of an intimidating environment for an individual, not perceived offence towards a group."
"It is important to be very firm about the preservation of freedom of speech, which is usefully stressed through a specific mention which is added by the Parliament."
"On faith schools, I fully support the right of parents to have their children educated within the principles of a particular faith, so long as that faith itself does not propagate discriminatory and prejudicial attitudes."
"But we must not condone the creation of ghettoes, where only children of a specified faith are admitted to a school and others are excluded."
"The Commission text allows discriminatory access and I am not persuaded that Amendment 51 resolves the problem."
"I will probably vote against both."
"(LV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think anyone in this Chamber is in favour of discrimination."
"Similarly, I think that people in this Parliament are opposed to discrimination."
"This document - this proposal for a Council directive - undoubtedly contains many fine proposals, but I think many of the proposals included here are based on a Christian outlook and the Christian religion."
"I would like to say that one directive cannot achieve what needs to be achieved during a long process of education, because that is a question of ethics and attitude."
"Going further, while this directive, or proposal for a directive, includes many good things, there are, however, several places where it goes too far."
"On these points, in fact, by creating opportunities for one group of people, it restricts the opportunities of another group."
"Indeed, I would go as far as to say that a series of points create opportunities to meddle in the sphere of private activity, and that is counter to our basic values."
"In addition, now the elections are approaching, and we are increasingly hearing questions from our voters, as well as criticisms. I think that the same thing will be happening in your countries."
"The most frequent criticism that we hear is that there is too much regulation from Brussels, too many restrictions and too much red tape."
"We ought therefore to avoid infringing subsidiarity or creating excessive restrictions."
"I believe that this document should be reconsidered."
"(SV) Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Buitenweg, Mrs Bozkurt, Mr Cashman and others for an extremely good report."
"I, along with many others, am surprised and shocked at the leader of, and speaker for, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Manfred Weber, who proposed, in Amendment 81, that Parliament reject the proposal for a directive because it violates the principle of subsidiarity and would entail a disproportionate amount of bureaucracy, according to the Swedish translation."
"Commissioner Å pidla has commented on this."
"I am sure that all women with disabilities and all of the other groups who had counted on the European Parliament to safeguard the human rights of citizens for their group too are deeply disappointed that the PPE-DE Group's leadership compares human rights with bureaucracy."
"I therefore urge the whole House to vote against the PPE-DE Group's Amendment 81 tomorrow."
"I also think it is important that women do not continue to be discriminated against by insurance companies simply because they are women and older, but as a group are healthier and live longer than men."
"I hope, too, that Parliament will have the courage to clarify that tax-funded education is there for everyone."
"Religion is certainly important to many Europeans, and I respect that, but we live in a secular society."
"No, Mr Weber, your market's freedom of contract is not as important as the fundamental human rights of citizens."
"Ask the citizens of the EU - they are wiser and more up-to-date than you PPE-DE Group members."
"The expectations on us are high and I hope that everyone has the courage to vote in favour of this tomorrow and not against it as you have advocated."
"(NL) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur."
"It cannot be said often enough, she has done an excellent job."
"It was no easy task."
"Some fellow Members seem to be particularly quick to take offence."
"The starting point of this Directive is crystal clear: equal treatment for absolutely everyone - homosexual or heterosexual, woman or man, old or young, black or white, disabled or otherwise, religious or humanist, and so on."
"This, Mr Vanhecke - who has left the debate yet again - has nothing to do with so-called political correctness."
"The shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur herself have put in a great deal of effort to reach this compromise, a compromise that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, too, would be able to support."
"No one considers the text flawless, and I can only hope that a substantial majority in the PPE-DE Group will come to their senses by tomorrow's vote."
"I am all for freedom of religion but, Mr Weber, you have some cheek setting yourself above others and treating equal opportunities as senseless bureaucracy with your hand on the Bible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barrot will replace Mr Å pidla for the final part of this debate."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the heart of a strategy of non-discrimination boils down to the following assertion: the person always comes first."
"We consider the person before considering the fact that he or she is in some way different - disabled, for example, or homosexual - and we therefore love, safeguard and defend the person; that is the heart of the strategy of non-discrimination."
"If this is true, it is true; therefore anyone who has a religious faith is a person, as the fact that he or she is a person comes before the fact that they have a religious faith."
"Therefore, we must be careful, because the statement made in Article 3 according to the wording proposed by Amendment 52 of the report by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs introduces a principle diametrically opposed to Declaration 11 in Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"This Amendment 52 negates the concept of preserving the status under national law of churches and organisations based on religious or personal beliefs, and at the same time, Article 3 and the corresponding Recital 18, according to the wording proposed by Amendments 51 and 29 of the aforesaid report, limit - in my view - the scope of the competence of Member States in terms of access to educational institutions based on religion or personal beliefs."
"In short, I am convinced that if we want to defend the person from the outset and in their entirety, we must also defend those aspects that characterise the person from a religious point of view."
"In addition, I think that Amendments 92, 89 and 95 could be a reasonable point of contact for those who want the directive to be adopted, and we could therefore find an effective place for dialogue at that level."
"Mr President, the Chair of our Committee, Mr Deprez, spoke for so many of us in this House when he said that this was not a report about sectional interests or a report of the Left, but a report by Mrs Buitenweg, which was full of thoughtfulness, sensitivity and compromise where people were concerned."
"The rapporteur has created a report which does not bind business or over-regulate business, as we have seen in the long journey of the two previous directives - the Race Equality Directive and the Employment Directive - which, I would say to Mr Weber, has not bound or over-regulated businesses in Germany or in my country."
"She has created a directive about fundamental rights, which do not create that bureaucracy which Mr Å pidla spoke about."
"I tabled amendments on strengthening equality bodies, which already exist."
"In the United Kingdom we have the Equality and Human Rights Commission, who recently supported the case of a European citizen - Sharon Coleman, the mother of a disabled child - who brought a case against her employer for disability discrimination by association, something fundamental to Mrs Buitenweg's report."
"The European Court of Justice ruled in her favour and, as a result of this judgement, we have extended rights to Britain's carers - people who care for disabled people."
"I would say to people in this House that you will grow old, you may be disabled and you may care for somebody with a disability."
"That is the reality for tens of millions of European citizens."
"That is what this report is about."
"It is not about sectional interests or concerns about who is going to dominate one other section of society."
"I would say that this report is not Left or Right - it is about fundamental rights."
"As Mr Cashman said in his speech, people out there, before the European elections, will look to see whether we protected fundamental rights without doing anything bad to our businesses and our economy."
"That is what this report does."
"Let us support it."
"It is practical and it is right."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my support for Mrs Buitenweg's work."
"As I understand it, what was supposed to be a compromise will not perhaps be a compromise at all, but that is not important."
"The important thing is that we manage to come to a decision."
"If anything, on some points my concerns are the opposite of Mr Mauro's."
"Religious freedom?"
"Of course, 100%."
"Freedom for religious educational institutions?"
"Of course, 100%."
"No religion can ever, under any circumstances, be a reason, an excuse, or cover for carrying out any kind of discrimination."
"There can be no prospect of tolerating exceptions whereby a church or religious institution can discriminate against teachers or students whose behaviour does not conform to a given faith, because of the risk of intrusion by the ethical state and the many religions that can lay claim to the same legitimacy."
"That is not the way forward."
"After all, our treaties and the European Union already, unfortunately, extend more protection than needed to the national states with their lengthy lists of exceptions to fundamental rights and freedoms."
"Let us not add further exceptions to those that already exist."
"(PT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, I, alongside my colleagues from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, voted for this report in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"That is because of the excellent work by the shadow rapporteur, Mr Gauber, towards trying to find a balanced compromise."
"I would also congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, on her work and join her in calling on everyone to avoid a radicalisation of positions and to seek the broadest possible consensus."
"As in all compromises, there are points on which we successfully make our opinion prevail and others which we find harder to accept."
"We are talking about a compromise which has to take into account the legislation, accepted practice and various cultural traditions existing in the 27 Member States."
"I consider the 10-year period in which buildings can be adapted to enable disabled people to access goods, services and resources to be positive, as well as the fact that, where difficulties at the structural level that are impossible to overcome persist, it will always be possible to find alternatives."
"I also add my voice to those expressing concerns in relation to insurance companies - the fact, for example, that they, as well as medical opinion, have been given consideration."
"I cannot, however, accept the idea of eliminating the reference - agreed on in committee - to the principle of subsidiarity in topics relating to the law on family, marriage and reproduction."
"These are exclusive competences of the Member States."
"The same applies to Article 8, which Amendment 90 of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats aims to remove because, given the existing legislative traditions in many Member States, it is not possible to accept the inversion of the burden of proof as that will cause insuperable legal problems."
"If these key points are adopted in plenary session, I will be unable to vote for this report."
"I will never, however, be able with a clear conscience to vote against a directive that prohibits discrimination between people irrespective of their religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"In conclusion, Mr President, it is also a case of defining which Europe we want to help build."
"I am fully in favour of a Europe that ceaselessly fights all forms of discrimination."
"(ES) Mr President, the proposal for a directive which we are debating today projects the principle of equality as a brand mark of the European project."
"As such, we must approach it with an ambitious focus, with the aim of working towards the inclusion of all citizens of the Community, and we must implement it in both public policy and administrative operations, as well as in relationships between individuals."
"We must move forward to allow all citizens to exercise and enjoy their rights to the full, without discrimination on grounds of belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, or of course, multiple discriminations."
"We need to emphasise that the principle of equality, and the ban on discrimination, must be respected in the arenas of both Community and national policy, so that we can turn the principal of equality throughout Europe into a reality."
"We must also achieve an adequate level of protection against all grounds for discrimination listed in Article 13 of the Treaty."
"This initiative should arm us with better tools for fighting possible discriminatory behaviour, which to our shame, is still a reality today, as highlighted in yesterday's report on homophobia by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"Fellow members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, do not muddy this debate with empty excuses, because a vote against this report is clear evidence of an ideological viewpoint."
"The fight against discrimination is of crucial importance, and represents the bedrock of the European Union's values."
"For this reason, we have both a responsibility and an obligation to take a step forward today, in this Parliament, towards a commitment to, and defence of equality throughout Europe."
"We cannot give up on our desires and hopes to make progress and simply relinquish such a fundamentally important matter, based on our values, to the category of hopes and dreams."
"The citizens of Europe, and most importantly, the most vulnerable, would not forgive us."
"(HU) Pursuant to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, every citizen enjoys equal rights and freedoms and equal protection of the law without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status."
"But I would like to emphasise that decisive and effective action is required against every form of discrimination, for discrimination is still strong in Europe and affects many different layers of society."
"In many cases it is not enough to prohibit all forms of discrimination, the introduction of various positive measures is also essential, such as in the case of people living with disabilities."
"Many countries - Italy, France, Finland and Spain, to name but a few - have granted autonomy and adopted positive measures in the interest of protecting national minorities."
"The European Union and its Member States also have a duty to guarantee equal rights and equal treatment of citizens in institutional form."
"We need independent institutions working at European level that can monitor and guarantee that States commit themselves to the principle of equal treatment not only in theory, but also adopt concrete steps in order to implement this directive effectively."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to ask you if you consider the fact that I am talking to you sitting down back here and have not risen like all my other fellow members an insult to this House."
"The European Parliament was and must continue to be a supporter of the horizontal directive, which will guarantee equal treatment and protect European citizens from all forms of discrimination."
"This directive must supplement the existing European legal framework, especially as regards people with disabilities and the obligation to guarantee effective and non-discriminatory access."
"We have included important proposals."
"We have introduced protection against multiple discrimination, by stipulating in the report that effective and non-discriminatory access must be guaranteed."
"In cases where access cannot be guaranteed on the same terms and conditions as for people without disabilities, we must be given a proper alternative solution."
"The report sets stricter criteria in order to assess if measures to safeguard effective and non-discriminatory access will involve disproportionate costs."
"There are some points included in the report which do not satisfy all of us, which is why we shall support certain amendments which have been tabled and which strengthen cohesion."
"In any event, I consider that we should support the report, thereby sending the Council a clear message that we must, at long last, have effective European legislation which puts an end to the discrimination which undermines confidence in the fundamental European values of equality and the rule of law."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a journalist, I would like to draw attention to a change in this directive that is of great concern to me personally."
"Specifically, I find it incomprehensible that, when the directive has not yet been transposed in 10 out of 27 Member States, we are going a step further and trying to stick an additional directive on top of it."
"Opinions may be divided on that, which is fine, but what really disturbs me, as a journalist, is the fact that it is damaging the freedom of the press in the Member States."
"Let me give you two examples of this."
"Mr Weber's proposed amendment, which merits our support, means that it will also be possible to limit the freedom of the press, for example, if a publisher is required to accept an advertisement from neo-Nazis or anti-Semites."
"I think that is totally inappropriate and goes completely against the principles we have in the EU, and I object strongly to it."
"We cannot allow this to happen."
"The same applies, of course, if we have anti-discrimination; then people who we do not want to encourage in the EU, but rather need to take action against, will have even more opportunities, for example in the property market."
"In my homeland, we see neo-Nazis trying to buy property almost on a weekly basis."
"If property is being rented or sold, we cannot prevent left-wing or right-wing extremists from taking it."
"They will make use of this new amendment, and I object strongly to this and will vote against it."
"I am therefore in favour of supporting referral back to committee or, if this is impossible, of voting against it."
"Mr President, over the years Europe and the rest of the world have fought to battle discrimination on all levels."
"Our progression as decent humans demands that we do just that, respecting perfectly the subsidiarity principle."
"As Mrs Buitenweg has stated, the Commission has promised, for over four years now, to pass a broad and inclusive proposal on the human rights of all people."
"This is now coming, finally, to fruition."
"I strongly believe that no person should ever be discriminated against on the basis of his or her religion or belief, disability or age."
"On the contrary, as a Christian believer I call upon the European Parliament and each individual to not only stop discrimination but to help those who are being discriminated against because of their disability."
"This help can come from us in different shapes and forms."
"Each Member State has constantly persisted in improving equal access to those who need it the most."
"As Europe continues to integrate, it is paramount that we remember that we are all different yet perfectly equal in all regards."
"(BG) Mr President, Commissioner, we are discussing an extremely important directive, which will provide an opportunity to resolve issues which are still controversial in the area of non-discrimination."
"I feel it is especially important that it reaffirms the right and freedom of religious beliefs and the application of the principle of non-discrimination in this area."
"At the same time, the directive explicitly refers to Declaration No 11 on the status of churches and non-confessional organisations, in which the European Union respects and does not prejudice the status under national law of churches and religious communities in Member States."
"The right is also recognised of Member States to draft and implement specific provisions in this area."
"It goes without saying that the European right must be harmonised with the right of Member States to regulate individual areas."
"This is a complex subject."
"Relations must be made clear so as to avoid infringing anyone's rights, including the rights of those who belong to the churches sanctioned by legal regulations."
"(DE) Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, since I am the one who has been quoted the most in this debate, I would like the opportunity to respond once again."
"I have said that anyone who asks questions is the bad guy in this debate."
"All the speakers who have vehemently spoken against discrimination have talked about the principle."
"Once again I would appreciate it if we could not dispute the principle and instead work to combat discrimination."
"Even when, for example, we discuss environmental issues and we disagree with regard to the prohibition on CO2 emissions, then we disagree on the means to achieve it, but we all agree on the objective."
"Why are we not allowed to disagree on the means with regard to discrimination and how we want to combat it?"
"Moreover, if newspaper publishers sit in our offices and express their concerns, we should be allowed to bring up those concerns here."
"Mr Cashman, you are not doing the issue and your concerns any favours if you marginalise anyone who simply asks questions."
"That is purely and simply what we are doing here."
"Mr President, as the shadow rapporteur on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the Socialist Group, could I commend Mrs Buitenweg and also my colleague Mrs Bozkurt?"
"Thank you for your cooperation."
"On behalf the Disability Intergroup, I am delighted that the 1.3 million people who signed the petition calling for an extension of anti-discrimination rights to disabled people have had their call listened to."
"I am also delighted that we agreed across party lines that there should be a horizontal directive and there should be no hierarchy of discrimination - a promise made to us by the then Portuguese Presidency of the European Union when the Race Directive was passed in 2000."
"Frankly, this promise has taken too long to be realised."
"I condemn the Conservatives who want to make that delay even longer."
"This debate is not just about showing our support in Parliament, but is also about appealing to the Council to get on and agree to this now."
"I would ask our German friends not to block it, please."
"There are issues about private contracts that you are concerned about, but on public duties you are far ahead of the game."
"Let us actually raise our vision and get this agreed."
"I am delighted that today the future Swedish Presidency has committed itself to completing this in the EPSCO Council before Christmas."
"I hope very much you will be able to do that."
"Mr President, it is incredibly hard for a rapporteur to do a good job when the largest group is conducting a kind of flip-flop policy."
"In the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supported this report, because it represented a reasonable compromise."
"We worked together with Mr Gaubert, who seems to have disappeared; at least, I have not seen him."
"In any case, however, we worked together on exactly the same text and now he is opposed to it!"
"It looks as though the coordinator, Mr Weber, is primarily imposing the position of his German national party on the PPE-DE Group."
"Mr Weber, you yourself told me personally just last week that it was not about the substance but about sending out a political signal."
"Is that not true?"
"Is that what you told me?"
"Well then, you cannot now hide behind details - if you wanted to do that you could have simply tabled amendments."
"You did not do so."
"What you really want is the rejection of the entire proposal."
"You simply do not want it, so do not pretend you have the same ultimate objective."
"I have heard plenty of things to which a straightforward answer can be given."
"For example, a great many people have asked what business this is of Europe's."
"Yet there are already a great many directives that have provided protection on the labour market for a long time now, and protection against discrimination on a great many other grounds is also provided outside the labour market, but the protection for some people lags behind, for example in the case of disability, age, sexual orientation and religion."
"We are not introducing a whole new invention, therefore, but rather repairing existing legislation."
"We are not introducing a new competence; we are ensuring that people are simply treated equally and that some categories are not regarded as more important than others."
"Mr Pirker spoke about the labour market."
"That is not what this is about at all; that was a different directive."
"This is not about the employment of teachers."
"Let us please stick to the facts."
"The burden of proof is a tricky point, as the Commissioner commented before."
"This, too, is nothing new; it is also contained in the other directives."
"It is absolutely not true that people will be able to simply accuse you and you will have to defend yourself."
"Nor are we talking about criminal law here."
"People must first provide real facts in other fields to back up why they think they are being discriminated against, and then you have to give your reasons for accepting or turning someone down for a property."
"With regard to the media, as the text states, provision is already made for rejecting advertisements that are not in line with the identity of a publication: it is all there, in Article 54."
"As regards the churches, they do not even need to comply with all these requirements in their entirety, although they do need to when performing social tasks."
"In the Netherlands, for example, they perform some social care services."
"It is unacceptable for them to be exempt when performing social tasks purely on account of belonging to a church."
"These are the very specific points that are mentioned in the report."
"We have done our best."
"We have accommodated you throughout."
"Indeed, your amendments are here in the text, and now you are going to vote against it after all, on account of all kinds of party-political positions."
"I must say, this is a personal blow to me, as I held out my hand to you."
"A great deal of your text has been incorporated into the report, and I think it disgraceful that you are now washing your hands of it!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 2 April 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) Human dignity and equality are the two great values on which the modern culture of human rights is founded."
"However, it is often the case that grand words are used to disguise their opposites."
"Equality, for example, means handling identical situations in the same way, but it also means handling different situations in different ways."
"My reservations regarding the report in question derive from this preliminary consideration."
"No one can have the slightest doubt that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats recognises the full dignity and equality of the disabled, the elderly, the sick, the poor, refugees and immigrants."
"I have the impression, however, that an attempt is being made to latch on to this established movement in order to impose discrimination against the family founded on marriage between a man and a woman and against religious freedom, especially as concerns religious schools."
"I will never tire of fighting for equality for the smallest, the poorest and the defenceless."
"For precisely this reason it pains me to see the Europe of human rights, through its laws and practice, implement discrimination of the harshest kind, between born and unborn babies."
"We are not discussing this today, but it would be appropriate for it to enter the European consciousness when reflecting on dignity and equality."
"By some fate of the calendar we are discussing this directive today, while we are voting on it tomorrow, which is World Autism Awareness Day."
"This augurs well."
"It is clear to us that in reality there are major discrepancies between Member States' national legislation on the rights and interests of people whose life is affected by autism."
"The discrepancy is even greater if we compare the everyday lives of the people affected."
"There is a long way to go to achieving European standards, but some progress needs to be made."
"Autism must be recognised as a separate disability among mental disabilities and specific strategies must be devised for it."
"This may seem costly to some, but receiving equal treatment is an absolute must, as it is for those suffering from other disabilities, so that we can respect ourselves and the values of European society."
"in writing. - I am a Socialist, which means I believe that all human beings are equal."
"We need to fight discrimination wherever it is found not just in the workplace."
"Indeed, there can be no hierarchy among discriminations."
"Everybody is different, everybody is equal."
"The purpose of the directive is to implement the principle of equal treatment between persons, irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation outside the labour market."
"It sets out a framework for the prohibition of discrimination on these grounds and establishes a uniform minimum level of protection within the European Union for people who have suffered such discrimination."
"This proposal supplements the existing EC legal framework, under which the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, applies only to employment, occupation and vocational training."
"Discrimination is a serious problem in Europe and beyond."
"According to a special survey undertaken by Eurobarometer in 2008, 15% of Europeans claimed to have been victims of discrimination last year."
"The European Parliament has waited more than four years for the proposed directive."
"The latter represents an attempt to implement the principles of equal treatment of individuals regardless of religion, belief, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"This is to apply not only regarding access to employment, but also in relation to goods, equipment and services, such as banking, housing, education, transport and health care for example."
"In addition, the document defines minimum framework standards to ensure protection against discrimination."
"Member States are free to increase the level of protection offered should they wish to do so."
"They may not, however, refer to the new directive in order to justify lowering existing standards."
"The directive grants injured parties the right to compensation."
"It also states that Member States should not only express the wish to overcome discrimination, but also have a duty to do so."
"A significant number of Member States of the Union have already introduced provisions guaranteeing a varying degree of protection beyond the labour market against discrimination on the grounds of religion, belief, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"The present draft directive will allow the introduction of cohesive European provisions in this area."
"It will make a strong statement to the effect that Europe as a whole does not condone discrimination."
"Freedom from discrimination is a fundamental right and should be enjoyed by everyone in the European Union."
"Recently, equality of opportunity has been an increasingly strong theme in Community decision-making."
"The objective of the proposed directive in equal treatment is to apply the principle of equal treatment of persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"Freedom from discrimination is a fundamental right and should apply to every citizen of the European Union."
"I firmly insist that we must combat every form of discrimination."
"The road we must follow in this regard is a long one, and it is clear as well that we can only move forward one step at a time."
"This entails, first, supplementing and consolidating legislation, second, transposing the legislation containing new, consistent and unified principles into national law, and finally their implementation in practice."
"Although these would demand significant work and time if taken individually, our goal is to succeed, within a reasonable timeframe, in showing concrete steps forward and in living in a Europe that is truly free of discrimination."
"I would like to congratulate my fellow member, Mrs Buitenweg, for her report, which opens up the way to supplementing the legal structure for eliminating all forms of discrimination."
"Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union sets out the aim of combating discrimination based not only on sex and ethnic origin but also religion, belief, disability, age and sexual orientation."
"In spite of the adoption and transposition into national law of directives 2000/43, 2000/78 and 2004/113, there has to date been no common protection against discrimination on the four grounds mentioned above outside the area of employment."
"The proposed directive is intended to fill this gap and we hope that, in addition to prohibiting discrimination, it will provide a legal remedy for those suffering disadvantages in all 27 Member States."
"The effective implementation of the directive under consideration and the compensation for the deficiencies noted in the course of transposing and applying the earlier directives would supplement the defence available to European Union citizens against discrimination."
"In addition, adoption of the proposed directive does not require any change to the relevant national laws."
"Therefore, I sincerely hope that the Council will be able to guarantee the unanimous support required by the Treaties and that each Member State will contribute to enabling the European Union to take an enormous step towards fulfilling our fundamental values and objectives."
"in writing. - (DE) The legal basis used, Article 13(1) of the EC Treaty, is not appropriate considering that, in the opinion of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), the principle of subsidiarity is not being adhered to."
"It is not within the remit of the EU legislator to lay down the regulations in question, thereby seriously encroaching on the self-determination of the Member States."
"Combating discrimination of all kinds and helping the disabled to participate in public life are important tasks."
"However, proposing to extend the anti-discrimination regulations to practically all areas of life is out of touch with reality."
"The reversal of the burden of proof laid down in the directive will mean that it is possible to open legal proceedings on the basis of accusations not backed up by sufficient evidence."
"Those affected would then have to pay compensation even if they have not actually committed any acts of discrimination but are unable to prove their innocence."
"Defined in this sweeping way, this reversal of the burden of proof is therefore questionable from the point of view of its compatibility with acting as a state under the rule of law."
"It will create uncertainty and facilitate abuse."
"That cannot be the raison d'Ãªtre of a progressive anti-discrimination policy."
"A further consideration must be that the Commission is currently pursuing infringement proceedings against numerous Member States in relation to inadequate transposal of the existing European directives on anti-discrimination policy."
"There is as yet, however, no overview of those regulations that have been transposed so as to make it possible to determine the need for new regulations that has been claimed."
"Germany, in particular, has already gone far beyond previous stipulations from Brussels."
"We therefore voted against this report."
"in writing. - (FI) When it is implemented, the Equality Directive will be one of the most important steps forward this electoral term for a social Europe and a Europe of the people."
"When it applies to all groups of people and discrimination criteria, legislation on both active and passive discrimination has an enormous impact on the lives of many EU citizens."
"In this regard I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work."
"Both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe the daily lives of a huge number of people are being made difficult by discrimination in one form or another."
"This should not be possible in today's society, where there is respect for human rights and equality: everyone should have an equal opportunity to participate in society."
"Non-discrimination is the hallmark of a civilised society."
"It is especially important that the Directive covers all discrimination criteria."
"Although there are huge differences between groups and individuals that face discrimination, we need to address the problem of discrimination as a phenomenon consistently, without specifying any particular group or groups."
"A fragmented approach would inevitably make different discrimination criteria unequal in value and would also cause fissures, which people, who encounter discrimination for all the many different reasons, would be in danger of falling into."
"in writing. - (ET) The European Union is based on the joint principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"Article 21 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights states that any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. [this is a direct quotation from the legislation]"
"The recognition of the uniqueness of each individual and their equal right to the opportunities offered by life is one of the attributes of Europe's united diversity, which is a central element in the union's cultural, political and social integration."
"Although the development of many areas in the EU has until now been very successful, it is surprising that we still lack common rules to deal with violence or abuse against the handicapped or concerning sexual abuse, and not all Member States sufficiently recognise those citizens' fundamental rights."
"We must recognise that the European legal framework for the struggle against discrimination is not yet perfect."
"I wholeheartedly welcome the new directive, which creates in the EU a common framework for action in fighting discrimination."
"The above-mentioned framework will probably lead to the implementation of the principle of equal treatment in Member States more widely than just in the labour market."
"Fighting discrimination means investing in the consciousness of a society whose development takes place through integration."
"In order to achieve integration, however, society must invest in training, awareness and the promotion of good practices, in order to find a fair compromise in the benefit and interests of all of its citizens."
"Thus a great deal of effort is still required on our part in order to eliminate discrimination in Europe."
"The right not to be discriminated against is a fundamental right which has never been questioned in terms of its applicability to EU citizens."
"Equal treatment irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation is one of the basic principles of European integration."
"This long-awaited directive, whose history is just as complicated throughout the consultations in Parliament, is based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty and governs protection against discrimination, emphasising equality of treatment whatever the grounds."
"There can be no doubt at all about the need for this directive, given the large number of people, roughly 15%, who claim they are discriminated against at EU level."
"I would also like to stress the importance of comparing this new directive with those already in force for combating discrimination."
"This is a task which will be accomplished through cooperation between the Commission and Member States."
"I am pleased to be able to highlight, in this respect, the progress which has been made in this area in Romania over recent years, as indicated by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"Last but not least, I believe that this directive will have a significant impact, given the social protection measures, the social benefits and easier access to goods and services, which it will guarantee."
"ERDF, ESF and Cohesion Fund: provisions relating to financial management - New types of costs eligible for a contribution from the ESF - Investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy for housing (amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 on ERDF) (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the recommendation, by Mrs GarcÃ­a PÃ©rez, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund concerning certain provisions relating to financial management (17575/2008 - C6-0027/2009 - 2008/0233 (AVC))"
"the report by Mrs JÃ¶ns, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1081/2006 on the European Social Fund to extend the types of costs eligible for a contribution from the ESF - C6-0454/2008 - 2008/0232 (COD)), and"
"the report by Mr Angelakas, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 on the European Regional Development Fund as regards the eligibility of energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in housing - C6-0473/2008 - 2008/0245 (COD))."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, firstly I should like to thank all of my fellow Members in the Committee on Regional Development, who have worked hard towards bringing this important agreement to the table today."
"This agreement concerns the modification of certain rules, in order to allow a series of changes to be immediately implemented."
"The European Union is being confronted with an unprecedented economic crisis, which has led to a recession in most of the Member States."
"Within the framework of the European Economic Recovery Plan, the European Commission has adopted a series of measures to introduce changes in the Structural and Cohesion Fund rules, in order to stimulate investment."
"These changes contain two clear priorities: an increase in expenditure, to improve liquidity, and the simplification of the rules to allow projects to be approved more quickly."
"This package of modifications has been conceived as a temporary response to a critical situation, although in fact it does also answer the European Parliament's call for greater simplicity and flexibility, reiterated on many different occasions."
"I should like to make a brief statement concerning the proposed modifications, so that we all understand their importance with regard to achieving the objectives we have set out:"
"an increase in aid from the European Investment Bank, and the European Investment Fund, as well as greater financial support for technical activities related to project development and implementation;"
"simplification of the eligibility of expenditure;"
"an increase in pre-financing for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF); the total amount of additional advances through this measure will be EUR 6.25 billion;"
"an acceleration in expenditure on major projects by amending the present maximum rate of 35% on advance payments, allowing advance payments of up to 100% for State aid beneficiaries of public benefits."
"We in Parliament are aware that these measures must be passed as quickly as possible in order to meet the immediate need for liquidity in the Member States, and we know that these measures will definitely also have positive repercussions throughout all of the regions and municipalities of Europe."
"Last week we were debating the future of the Cohesion Policy, and unanimously agreed that it has brought about huge advances in economic and social development in many of our regions."
"At this moment of great uncertainty, it is more important than ever to defend these principles of solidarity and cooperation between territories, as the people need to see that we in Europe are capable of helping to find a way out of this crisis which is placing millions of people in situations of real difficulty."
"Today more than ever, we need strong tools with which to solve these problems."
"By putting these modifications in place, we will be facilitating the acceleration of, and investment in projects that will also be important in creating jobs."
"Moreover, thanks to the European Social Fund, we can develop training and retraining initiatives in order to bring the most vulnerable sectors of society, and those experiencing the greatest difficulties, into the labour market."
"This can be the case for women, disabled people, or the long-term unemployed."
"We must not forget that these sectors are the most vulnerable in times of crisis."
"I also want to reiterate here, as we stated in the report's explanatory statement, that despite being aware of the need for urgency that was necessary in tackling this issue, Parliament would like to have had more involvement in developing these proposals, in terms of the quality and quantity of dialogue."
"Therefore, being mindful of the problems in Europe at this time, we fully support this proposal for measures to modify the Structural Funds, in order to move forward towards a solution to the present situation."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a rare event - so much so, in fact, that it highlights the importance of the discussions, the current revisions and the urgent need for action - as this is the very first time that we will have adopted a proposal for a regulation from the European Commission on the structural funds for which there are almost no amendments."
"I am relieved to find that we are so unanimous in our discussion of this proposal for a regulation from the Commission regarding the European Social Fund, and I would like to thank you all for following my recommendation not to table any amendments in respect of the European Social Fund."
"It is very clear that the financial and economic crisis demands that we all take responsibility, once again, for the optimum and, above all, rapid qualification of our workers, especially now."
"More and more people are suffering from the effects that this international financial crisis is having on the labour market."
"They expect answers from us, they expect protection and, above all, they need answers now and not in a few months' time."
"The revision of the European Social Fund Regulation that we will adopt tomorrow will therefore enter into force immediately."
"This will make a significant contribution to reducing the bureaucracy associated with the European Social Fund."
"The allocation of funds has been made simpler and this will also speed up the disbursement of funds."
"Application procedures that drag on for months and complicated methods of calculation, which until now were required to prove scheme participants' eligibility for individual bus and tram tickets, will be a thing of the past."
"However, sometimes I ask myself why it has taken such a dramatic crisis for us to take this step."
"Of course, it is never too late and with this revision we are at least ensuring that the funds can be used to the full and hopefully will also very quickly reach those who are most affected in the best possible way."
"We must enable these people to be reintegrated into the labour market as quickly as possible."
"They must absolutely not be allowed to slip into a longer period of unemployment, because at the present time it is easy to fall from there into a precarious situation or into poverty."
"What has changed?"
"Or should I say what will change when we adopt this tomorrow?"
"In future, project applicants will be able to use flat rates in their calculations and also be able to apply for lump sums up to EUR 50 000 for each measure."
"As for all of you sceptics, I would like to reiterate that checks on the correct allocation of funds will remain in place, as, firstly, both flat rates and lump sums will be determined by the Member States themselves and, secondly, the Commission will examine in advance whether these - and I quote - are fair, equitable and verifiable."
"The procedure does actually appear to be in order, as, surprisingly enough, our budget controllers had no objections to this regulation."
"Thus, we are simplifying the procedure."
"However, we are not changing the main priorities of the European Social Fund."
"There is no reason at the moment for us to do this, as the project applicants are given sufficient scope to be able to react appropriately themselves to the specific needs of the labour market."
"Finally, I would like to say that we are also making available to the Member States an increase in advance funds for this year of a further EUR 1.8 billion for training and further training measures and I think that this is a clear signal from this House that we are acting quickly in this crisis and are showing solidarity here."
"I would like to apologise for the fact that I am unable to stay with this debate to its conclusion, as I now have to attend the Conciliation Committee for the Working Time Directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too want to take my turn in thanking my fellow Members in the Committee on Regional Development for the spirit of cooperation in which we worked."
"Following the credit crunch which hit us several months ago, we all know that the Commission issued a communication on 26 November 2008 on a European Economic Recovery Plan for the Member States and their regions, based on strengthening the European economy and reinforcing the core values of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs."
"Among other things, this programme urges the Member States to re-programme their operational programmes for their structural funds and the energy sector, paying particular attention to improving the energy efficiency of buildings, given that the construction sector is one of the industrial sectors which creates large numbers of jobs."
"As such, it has become necessary to recast the general Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 on the Structural Funds."
"Within these frameworks, and more specifically as regards the energy efficiency of buildings, I undertook to recast the regulation in question as the rapporteur for the European Parliament."
"As rapporteur, therefore, I should like to point out the following."
"To date the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has only considered expenditure incurred by Member States which joined the European Union after May 2004 as eligible expenditure for housing, especially for energy efficiency and renewable energy in housing."
"Firstly, I considered it useful in my report to focus the framework of the review of the regulation on facilitating energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy in the housing sector on all 27 Member States."
"I believe that this proposal is of major importance, given that it is based on the economic situation of a state or region rather than on the accession date."
"I should like here to point out that there are major problems in accessing housing in numerous towns and regions in Europe, which are not necessarily on the territory of a new Member State."
"I then considered it useful to support a spending limit for the investments in question of 4% of the total ERDF budget and to delete the reference relating to low-income households, a recommendation that was included in the Commission's initial proposal, leaving it to the discretion of the Member States to determine the categories of households that will be eligible."
"On this basis, I considered it to be of decisive importance to leave the category of eligible households in the hands of the Member States, with the facility for the Member States to lay down specific criteria of interest, such as the financial standing of owners and the geographical areas (island, mountainous, non-mountainous and so on)."
"Finally, the increase in the lump sums to EUR 50 000 is important, because it mirrors current costs."
"I wanted in this report to express the European Parliament's positions on this issue, thereby also representing the compromise achieved with the Council within the framework of the codecision procedure on the changes which we made to the initial proposal."
"The review of the regulation in question does not affect eligible expenditure in housing and strengthens the activity of important sectors of the economy such as the construction industry and the sectors which build energy systems and renewable energy systems."
"On a more general note, it is in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, in that it provides support to the Member States; it is in keeping with the principle of proportionality, because it applies to all the Member States; it promotes the objectives of cohesion policy, as set out in Article 158 of the EC Treaty, and it does not increase the Community budget for the period 2007-2013, but does speed up payments of advances and interim payments."
"I should like here to clarify how important it is that we have added three additional forms of eligible costs: indirect costs, flat-rate costs and lump sums."
"To close, I should like to say that Commissioner Barrot is here with us today, representing the Commissioner for Regional Policy, Mrs HÃ¼bner, and, as agreed, will make a binding statement by the Commission on the evaluation of the new measures for 2010 in connection with all three regulations."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs GarcÃ­a PÃ©rez, Mrs JÃ¶ns and Mr Angelakas."
"You have prepared three high-quality reports on the proposals for revision of the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund regulations, submitted by the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament within the context of the European Economic Recovery Plan adopted in November."
"These three reports - relating to the general regulation, the regulation on the European Social Fund and the regulation on the European Regional Development Fund - testify to Parliament's concern to see the European Union provide itself with resources that will enable it swiftly and effectively to combat the effects of the crisis in terms of growth and employment."
"Cohesion policy is a powerful lever for stimulating the real economy."
"EUR 347 billion in appropriations for 2007-2013: that is how to create a solid foundation for budget stability and public investment in the Member States and the regions of the European Union."
"It is for this very reason that cohesion policy plays such a large part in the EERP."
"Indeed, in this recovery plan, the Commission has recommended actions falling under the four priority areas of the Lisbon Strategy: individuals, businesses, infrastructure and energy, and research and innovation."
"The Commission has also suggested that a judicious combination, linking strategy and human resources, may act as a catalyst for key investments, which will enable the European Union to restore lasting prosperity."
"As regards cohesion policy, the major objective of this strategy is to speed up both the implementation of the programmes and investment in projects benefiting EU citizens and economic activity."
"The rapporteurs have just gone over the details of the regulatory amendments submitted to you."
"I shall focus on one or two of them."
"Firstly, to improve the management of the funds, facilities are being offered to the Member States, not least additional advances of 2% or 2.5%, amounting to a total of EUR 6.25 billion in 2009."
"It is vital that this money is channelled quickly to beneficiaries, so that more finance is available for priority projects."
"In terms of energy efficiency and renewable energies, the amendment made to the ERDF regulation will mean that up to 4% of the total amount of the ERDF contribution can be invested in housing."
"This equates to a total available envelope of EUR 8 billion for all the Member States."
"This will increase the contribution made by cohesion policy to combating climate change."
"With regard to major projects, the amendment tabled in the general regulation is aimed at relaxing the financial management rules, allowing the management authority to include in expenditure declarations to the Commission expenditure linked to major projects that have not yet been the subject of a Commission decision."
"The financial and economic crisis also has a particular impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"It was therefore crucial, within the context of the recovery plan, to facilitate their use of financial engineering instruments so that they can carry out their projects, in particular thanks to JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises)."
"The other proposals for revision of the general regulation are also along these lines: direct contracts with the European Investment Bank, greater recourse to technical assistance for major projects, and eligibility of in-kind contributions in the case of financial engineering."
"In its proposals the Commission has also sought to simplify the criteria for allocating aid from the ERDF and the European Social Fund."
"Thanks to the convergent amendments tabled by Parliament and the Council, the regulations specific to the ERDF and the ESF will be changed in an identical fashion, so that new types of eligible costs, calculated on the basis of flat rates, will be added to Community cofinancing."
"These changes will simplify the expenditure justification procedure."
"They will reduce the workload and the number of supporting documents to be provided, without distorting the principles of sound financial management."
"Such rationalisation will facilitate absorption of ERDF and ESF appropriations without undermining the principles of these two funds, which remain relevant in these times of crisis."
"This is therefore more than just a timely response to the crisis; this is a response to the repeated calls for simplification of the Structural Funds made by the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors."
"Mr President, I am grateful to the three rapporteurs for their support for these series of measures, which are going to enable us to speed up the implementation of the projects on the ground."
"These legislative measures are going to be accompanied by recommendations to the Member States."
"These recommendations were the subject of a Commission communication adopted on 16 December."
"The Commission has emphasised that the operational programmes may be reoriented so as to focus support on priorities resulting from the crisis."
"The European Parliament has also expressed its concern to respond to the urgency of the situation by ensuring that these three regulations are adopted as quickly as possible and that the measures are applied promptly in the Member States."
"I am grateful to Parliament for sharing this ambition, as it will mean, in particular, that advances are paid to the Member States for May."
"The Commission has taken account of Parliament's call."
"It has made sure that the measures adopted under the recovery plan will be rigorously monitored and that a report on the implementation of the measures and their actual results will be presented to the European Parliament."
"Thus, during the second half of 2010, the Commission will draft a report on the implementation of the measures adopted within the framework of the recovery plan in the area of cohesion policy within the Union."
"This report, which will be drafted - I repeat - during the second half of 2010, will be based on the annual implementation reports drafted by the Member States in June 2010."
"The latter will then be invited to present in these reports a review of the implementation of the measures adopted under the recovery plan, showing the results obtained in the context of cohesion policy."
"So, Mr President, the Commission has adopted a declaration along these lines, and I shall convey it to the European Parliament."
"I am grateful to all the Members, and especially to our three rapporteurs, for their attention."
"Looking ahead as I am to a fruitful debate, I am at your disposal to listen to your comments on the proposals for revision of the regulations that have been submitted to you."

"Commission statement"
"Angelakas report"
"The Commission welcomes the efforts made in a very short space of time to adopt the amendments to the Regulations on the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund tabled within the framework of the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"This result is the product of fruitful and effective cooperation between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission, with the support of the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee, for the benefit of the national and regional economies of the European Union."
"The legislative package will help to facilitate the implementation of the operational programmes and to accelerate investments for the benefit of the European economy, in particular through several simplification measures."
"During the second half of 2010, the Commission will draft a report on the implementation of the measures adopted within the framework of the recovery plan in the area of cohesion policy within the European Union."
"This report will be based in particular on the annual implementation reports drafted by the Member States in June 2010."
"The Member States are therefore invited to present in these reports a review of the implementation of the measures adopted under the recovery plan, showing the results obtained in the context of cohesion policy."
"Mr President, as the permanent rapporteur for the Structural Funds within the Committee on Budgets, I have two reasons for welcoming these reports this evening."
"The first reason is that the Structural Funds represent the main heading in the European Union's budget, and the second reason, which I along with my colleagues would emphasise this evening, is the speed with which we have worked to provide practical and prompt solutions to the economic crisis, despite having a tight budget, which we will of course have to renegotiate with the Member States when the time comes."
"Moreover, in this regard, I would also repeat that we have to be genuinely willing to take out a European loan to support these measures."
"Facilities for improving cash flow, for speeding up the use of the funds and the emergency measures, which we have been looking forward to for a long time, are what is needed to revive our European economy at this time of great uncertainty."
"This is what European action stands for, this is what our Europe stands for: boosting high added-value sectors and anticipating, now more than ever before, the end of the crisis by investing in traditional areas, but above all in all those sectors that can help to eliminate the risk of unemployment for our fellow citizens."
"However, and this is my message this evening, although Parliament has been able to react quickly and well, it is important now for the Member States to organise themselves so that they can rise to the challenges, as delays, representing billions in aid, can be seen in the administrative inertia of the Member States themselves, in their difficulty in deciding on their strategic objectives and in their refusal to cofinance projects."
"Thus all is set in Europe and, as we say in my country, 'a word to the wise is enough' - that is addressed to the Member States."
"Rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (RO) The financial crisis has imposed much more prudent credit policies, which are necessary for the banks, but harsh for the economy."
"The adverse effects are being felt in the real economy, especially by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and public authorities."
"They have projects intended to improve social and regional cohesion, create jobs, use local resources and facilitate entry or a return to the labour market."
"The common budget, which is usually important, is nowadays a crucial source of funding for stopping the accumulation of adverse effects."
"For this reason, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs supports the simplification of the rules and quicker access to the Structural Funds and European Social Fund."
"This offers a two-fold benefit for those countries with less experience in accessing these funds."
"We think that it is necessary and welcome for European financial institutions to be involved in funding arrangements, amending the structure of eligible costs, eliminating ceilings for advance payments or prior notice."
"However, accessing the funds is not an end in itself."
"The financial impact extends beyond EUR 6.3 billion."
"This is indeed a considerable sum."
"As representatives of our citizens, we are interested in the funds being used to achieve the objectives for which they have been created."
"We are issuing a blank cheque today and we require the necessary transparency in how this money is being spent."
"We also hope to create a positive precedent."
"In the past, numerous initiatives, especially social, were rejected on the grounds of having no legal basis."
"Amending this regulation proves, if there ever was any need to, that where there is a political will there is also a legal basis."
"Let us not forget this fact."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in response to the global financial crisis, the European Economic Recovery Plan states that cohesion policy is contributing significantly to public investment by the Member States and the regions and should act as a means of recovering from the current crisis."
"It suggests, specifically, the adoption of action in areas prioritised by the Lisbon Strategy in order to achieve growth and employment."
"All the instruments set in motion aim to accomplish this purpose and obtain faster results."
"To this end, the main aim of broadening the scope of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and streamlining the European Social Fund is to respond to the many situations of social and economic emergency that require support."
"I am sure, now as in the past, that the more complementary their activities and scopes are, the more effective they will be."
"However, as there was no provision for making new funds available or for new courses of action on the ground, it is particularly important for the European Social Fund to be used to its full potential in the fight against unemployment and the rapid increase in competitive pressure on the European economy that have resulted from the current financial crisis and economic slowdown."
"I would like to stress that the Committee on Regional Development has repeatedly identified the simplification that the European Commission is proposing as essential to improving the management and implementation of the Structural Funds."
"We were asked to deal with this as a matter of urgency, however, and we took that into account when adopting this regulation package; this House has never ducked its political responsibilities."
"For this reason, although the peculiarity of the moment has brought many views to the surface, we shall refrain, for now, from submitting further amendments for the sake of the swift procedure and real benefits to the public intended by the proposal."
"However, we point out the need to launch an assessment of this fund straight away, with a view to carrying out an additional review as soon as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to welcome Mrs GarcÃ­a PÃ©rez's report."
"As part of cohesion policy, the reforms are very important and are aimed at alleviating the adverse effects caused by the financial crisis."
"The flexibility allowed in distributing Community funds will provide national economies with immediate cash flow, which will enable them to invest in the real economy."
"This will have an immediate effect and we will definitely see the initial results in the following months."
"The European Commission is supporting Member States' economies based on four major priorities, the most important of these being increasing the pre-financing from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Social Fund and increasing the support from the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund."
"In fact, in 2009 the pre-financing which the new Member States in particular receive may help to overcome the crisis, as well as establish social and territorial cohesion."
"Great importance must also be attached to the report on the eligibility of investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy for housing."
"The renovation of residential heating systems must feature on the European Union's agenda of priorities, bearing in mind the added value generated by this measure."
"At a time when heating costs are constantly on the rise, Member States must also include in their programmes to combat the financial crisis projects which take into account energy efficiency."
"They offer the following important benefits to the economy and population: a cash flow injection into the economy, along with job creation, a reduction in heating costs, protection of the environment through cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the provision of social cohesion and support for low-income families."
"In Romania 1.4 million flats urgently require investment for renovation."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing these three reports in the face of the largest and most difficult economic and financial crisis that has so far been experienced in the history of the European Union."
"It is, of course, right that cohesion policy has to play a part in assuaging the consequences of this economic crisis."
"However, I would like to take this opportunity to stress once again that, although it is correct that the cohesion policy budget is the largest individual budget in the European Union, it is, unfortunately, also correct that the Member States contribute slightly over 1% of their GDP to the European Union's budget."
"This means that, even if we spend over EUR 6.25 billion on funding interim payments and advance payments, it is merely a drop in the ocean and it is just not enough."
"It will mitigate the consequences, it will enable leverage, but national efforts, too, will continue to be necessary."
"Perhaps we should bear that in mind in connection with the next debate on the Financial Perspective."
"Our Group has discussed the three reports very intensively and could have brought a number of other good ideas to the debate."
"In many instances - as Mrs JÃ¶ns has already said - we were surprised that it has taken an economic crisis to actually make a reduction in bureaucracy possible in the Commission."
"We will not table any amendments because we know that rapid action is now needed in the regions and because we also know that we will have to talk about changes to structural policy elsewhere."
"We are therefore supporting the entire package proposed by the Commission and we hope that it will reach the regions as quickly as possible and that the money can indeed help to combat the financial crisis."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and I shall of course vote in favour of these three reports."
"We shall vote for them not because they are totally satisfactory - as my colleagues said, we would have liked to have tabled a number of amendments - but because swift action is required."
"Mrs Krehl made this point just now."
"Forgive me for wondering though, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, whether we simply do not have a clue."
"We are here in comfortably heated and well lit surroundings."
"Do you know that, right now in Europe, there are 30 million homes with leaking roofs and damp in the walls?"
"Of course, with the 4% from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) we are going to be able to remedy this situation for around 1 million homes."
"This work, if we oversee it, Commissioner - as I am going to put a request to you in a moment - will create 250 000 jobs and improve the situation in 1 million homes."
"This will save 40 million tonnes of CO2 and reduce the energy bill of each family by EUR 450 per year."
"Those are the figures that I place at your disposal and that have been finalised by an important European organisation known in particular for its serious approach."
"This therefore means that the importance of the decision that we are going to take not only to guarantee a recovery but also for the well-being of our fellow citizens, comes down to one major condition: that the decisions taken by Parliament today, in concert with the Commission, take practical effect in the coming weeks and months."
"Commissioner, we listened to you carefully just now."
"You told us - and we believe you - that, by 30 June 2010, you will have asked each Member State to submit a report to the Commission."
"I and my colleagues, of all political persuasions, from the Committee on Regional Development are game for a bet."
"In all the countries, the operational programmes have just been adopted, and we know that the majority of the management authorities in these countries will not want them to be changed."
"In 15 months' time, on 30 June, Commissioner, do not employ too many staff to draft the reports, the analysis of what will be done, as you will not achieve a great deal if you wait for the Member States, the management authorities and partners to set to work."
"We therefore have EUR 8 billion available on the one hand, and 30 million particularly deficient houses on the other."
"What needs to be done?"
"Commissioner, I along with my colleagues am going to make a proposal to you along these lines."
"The European Commission should go beyond its rights and act firmly - I was almost going to say violently - towards the governments and the management authorities to instruct them to apply these provisions as quickly as possible."
"MEPs love voting for texts."
"That is our job."
"However, we especially love it when these texts are applied."
"We need the Commission, we hope that the Commission will listen to us."
"Mr President, we are today considering reports on regional policy that introduce beneficial changes and simplification."
"We can only regret that it is the crisis that has forced us to respond swiftly and hopefully effectively to the current state of affairs."
"I welcome the opportunity to introduce greater flexibility, because there is no question of increasing the European Union's budget."
"I would like to make that quite clear."
"We have heard references to quotas today."
"This represents a mere drop in the ocean, as the European Union's budget amounts to around 1% of the GDP of the Member States."
"We can but hope that the little drop will be a revitalising one."
"We need it to be!"
"I also welcome the increased flexibility made possible by support from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund."
"I am glad simplification of eligibility for expenditure is to be introduced with retroactive effect."
"It is good that we are increasing payments in instalments and speeding up expenditure on large projects submitted in advance, and that it will be possible for payments to be made prior to confirmation."
"I can but reiterate my hope that all this will prove revitalising."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, view the financial crisis and the climate crisis in relation to each other, as the adverse effects of climate change on the regions are long-lasting and give rise to enormous costs."
"They cause a strain on economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"Therefore, we must take action now."
"Building insulation and the use of renewable energy in housing under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) are an initial step in this regard."
"However, what use is this progress if, at the same time, Member States are permitted to invest ERDF funds in road planning and colossal waste-incineration plants, the use of which aggravates climate change anew and harms the environment?"
"This is half-hearted and inconsistent."
"Nor does your dynamic speech, Commissioner, answer the question as to why the Commission is rejecting our proposal to orient regional policy as a whole more strongly towards environmental and climate protection."
"Does the Commission lack the courage to assert against Member States a revision of the ERDF Regulation that is oriented towards climate objectives?"
"Why is there no Commission action plan on regional policy?"
"The reservations about climate protection on the part of the Directorate-General for Regional Policy have prevented our amendments receiving majority support in committee."
"However, we shall be re-tabling them and requesting a roll-call vote."
"Then we shall see whether voters can trust you, too, to support climate protection."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, between 2007 and 2013 regional policy will become the main heading in the European Union's budget with EUR 347 billion allocated to the Structural Funds."
"Will this development help to protect our economies from the effects of the global economic crisis, as the Commission is claiming it will?"
"Forgive me for having my doubts about this."
"Firstly, the increase in regional expenditure is penalising some Member States, and France in particular."
"This increase comes at the cost of the common agricultural policy (CAP), thus at the cost of French agriculture which, until recent years, was the main beneficiary of the CAP."
"Moreover, the proportion of the Structural Funds paid to French regions keeps on falling, the vast majority being given to Eastern Europe, destroyed by more than 40 years of communism."
"Thus France, which contributes 16% of European budget revenue, is giving more and more money to Brussels but getting less and less of it back."
"Above all, European regional policy, far from protecting its beneficiaries from the economic crisis, is making it worse, as it forms part of the ultra-free market logic of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The Commission's proposed changes to the management of the Structural Funds will therefore not enable our nations to tackle this crisis, which is the consequence of the ill-considered opening up of borders and the deregulation of the financial markets."
"Now more than ever we need to build a new Europe, a Europe of sovereign nations founded on the following three principles: economic and social patriotism, European protectionism and Community preference."
"Mr President, the world economic downturn is hitting each of our countries and each of our regions."
"It is right that tonight we agree emergency action to speed up European funds to people in need, at a time of need."
"In particular, I welcome of the cutting of paperwork by allowing flat and lump-sum payments, allowing spending on energy efficiency in housing, bringing forward some GBP 6 billion of spending to start this year, and making it easier to work with the European Investment Bank loans."
"Already, when a building society call centre in Hertfordshire, in my constituency, shed jobs, within 24 hours we were able to call in European-funded response to redundancy aid, showing how Europe can give real help to our local communities."
"With respect to the changes we are agreeing tonight, the East of England Development Agency is welcoming the fact that more business-led, bite-sized and bespoke training provision is to be allowed, and says it will help us more quickly to meet our region's commitment to help 124 000 people through European social funding alone."
"Finally, I was very proud that Commissioner HÃ¼bner came personally to Lowestoft, in my constituency, to launch our GBP 100 million European regional development programme and its emphasis on helping business in our communities adapt to low-carbon growth."
"The economic crisis must not deflect any of us from meeting the long-term challenge of climate change."
"Indeed, investment in environmental technologies in management should lead recovery efforts."
"The East of England intends to stand firm to this objective."
"Mr President, I too welcome this proposal because it is a direct and tangible response from the EU to the current economic crisis."
"We are responding using the instruments at our disposal, but I strongly agree with my colleague Mr Beaupuy when he says that we need to get our act together and do something quickly for families and communities."
"Secondly, I welcome the simplification and flexibility introduced in this proposal."
"This is badly needed anyway."
"Time and time again I hear from groups who access funding who are complaining about the red tape and the bureaucracy."
"While this package will not solve all their problems, it will help."
"Thirdly, I am particularly pleased that the in-kind contributions are now recognised as eligible expenditure."
"In my report on the contribution of volunteering to economic and social cohesion, which was endorsed by this Parliament, I called for this very measure to be put in place."
"This means that the contributions of volunteers and others will now be taken as contributing to the various projects and, while it has taken the current economic crisis to move us fully in this direction, nonetheless, it is most welcome."
"This measure will recognise in a practical way the contribution of volunteers and voluntary time and how it, too, can be part of our response to the current crisis."
"In this way we are working together with our citizens as partners."
"We know from the satellite accounts published by various Member States that the non-profit sector accounts for between five and seven per cent of GDP."
"We are now recognising and valuing this and saying to our citizens: your efforts, your time, your commitment are important, and we are working with you."
"I support the changes proposed by the committee responsible to the Commission's proposal on energy efficiency and investment in renewable energy in housing. The committee's proposal will encourage a growth in demand and a faster flow of money into measures to increase energy efficiency."
"Member States are now being given opportunities to direct these resources so as to achieve the maximum effect in increasing energy efficiency. The most comprehensive results would be produced by use of these resources on objectives that would give free rein to consumers' initiatives to increase energy efficiency, and the most encouraging measures would be those that reduce the risks for those who are themselves thinking about investments in energy efficiency."
"I concede that the committee ought, however, to give some guidelines on this matter for further activity by the Member States."
"Such an approach would not only have a multiplier effect for the stimulation of the economy, but would also foster more rapid dissemination of an understanding of energy saving in the Member States."
"The amount of resources available will, however, require the Member States to restrict the number of recipients of assistance, and in that sense it would be sensible to be guided by the Commission's proposal, by directing these resources, first of all, to lower-income households. Thank you."
"(PL) Mr President, we are today discussing particularly important changes."
"They are important not only in terms of a response to the difficulties related to the financial crisis, but also because they may affect the nature of political cohesion in the period after 2013."
"Clearly, the introduction of such significant changes cannot be perceived solely as a temporary measure."
"For the first time ever we have witnessed how the European Commission, acting in agreement with Parliament and the Council, has taken action that had long been the subject of debate and which had appeared very difficult."
"Essentially we have witnessed genuine simplification, genuine acceleration and of course a change of strategy through the inclusion of investment action in the area of energy saving measures."
"This sends out a very positive signal to the effect that we are able to react to the situation at the programming stage and not adhere dogmatically to principles laid down earlier."
"The European Parliament tends to be perceived as a rather junior partner of the Council and the Commission."
"Nonetheless, this House is determined that its actions will demonstrate our readiness to cooperate in a swift response to the new challenges before us."
"(HU) I think we should actually be celebrating today."
"Parliament has for many years been advocating that we should not only provide financing for sham measures in the area of housing but that we should resolve to undertake genuine measures."
"A significant proportion of the EU population lives in tower block apartments."
"By developing these housing projects, we can tangibly improve the material circumstances of their residents and reduce the buildings' energy consumption as well as creating and preserving jobs."
"The current changes are making it possible in my country to renovate 90% of the tower blocks, and this is at any rate an enormous step."
"However, as the funds will only continue to finance such renovations in urban areas, we cannot rejoice unreservedly."
"The impoverished population of rural areas, who are in greatest need of funding, are once again left to their own devices."
"As we do not wish in any way to jeopardise the tower block programme, which is important to us all, we have agreed not to submit amendments at this time after all."
"In return, however, we expect the Commission to include our recommendation in its package before the summer recess."
"The first and most important step towards effective and sustainable social integration of the most disadvantaged areas is to put an end once and for all to exclusion and ghettoes."
"Renovating settlements that have been set apart is simply pointless."
"Instead of renovation, reconstruction supported by complex programmes that create social employment is the solution."
"Dear colleagues, we will truly have cause to celebrate when, in the place of uprooted rural ghettoes, people working in newly created social cooperatives will, upon returning to their new homes, tell their children to study and strive because they can become anything they wish."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent preparatory work."
"The proposed amendments to the Structural Funds Regulations will expedite the use of funds and simplify the rules, and so they are really worthy of support."
"This way we can ensure that Structural Fund money can be spent on recovery and can prevent the adverse impact of the recession on the economy and employment."
"This is also a good start to the reform of the EU's structural and regional policy, whose aim must be to simplify and expedite procedures and give a boost to flexibility and the achievement of results."
"While we cut bureaucracy with regard to European Union regulations and focus on getting better results, we need to make sure that the Member States are also heading in the same direction."
"More power needs to be given to the regions and local actors, and central government needs to relax its tight control."
"(PL) Madam President, the current crisis calls for stimulation of economic activity, support for job protection and protection of those who become unemployed."
"The Commission's proposal to broaden the scope of costs covered by the European Social Fund is a step in the right direction."
"The inclusion of funding for lump sum payments, and also for direct costs and mixed costs, and not setting an upper limit for payments are all particularly helpful measures in terms of making better use of European Social Fund resources."
"The introduction of lump sum payments for direct costs and for indirect costs up to EUR 50 000 will simplify administrative procedures."
"It will eliminate the delays in implementing the Fund's aims."
"In view of the urgency of introducing these measures, I support adoption of the proposal without amendment."
"I should like to thank Mrs Harkin for drawing attention to recognition of the value of voluntary work."
"(RO) I would like to begin my speech by welcoming the idea of these coordinated measures."
"I would also like to give a special thanks to the rapporteurs for the work they have done."
"We are all aware of what the effects of the crisis are in each of our countries, ranging from a fall in economic growth and job prospects to a rise in the budget deficit and recession."
"The EU's Cohesion Policy can be an equally credible and effective instrument in this context as well."
"As we are very well aware, Europe has been severely affected by this crisis and the fact that the EU has managed to respond so quickly in finding solutions is encouraging."
"The decision to modify the regulations for the existing funds which have already demonstrated efficiency is the most appropriate one."
"The procedure for creating a specific crisis fund would have been far too long."
"Simplifying the cost eligibility criteria, increasing pre-financing from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund and speeding up the expenses for major projects are measures which, I hope, will help Member States to get out of the economic and financial crisis."
"While Europe is going through the current economic crisis, we are aware that it is experiencing an energy crisis too."
"The measure allowing the ERDF to be used to invest in energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy for housing should have a major impact, in my view."
"Romania, like the other countries in Central and Eastern Europe, has many problems with multi-storey residential blocks."
"The old buildings are extremely poorly insulated and a large number of residents are unable to pay to have their homes insulated out of their own pocket."
"We hope that this measure will help Europe's citizens to make energy savings, so that they both end up with more money in their pocket and help the situation with global warming."
"The current Romanian Government has stipulated that this is a zero priority measure and the facilities which have been approved mean that this priority is already guaranteed."
"(EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today's package of amendments to the provisions of the Structural Fund regulations is an important step towards simplifying and directly activating resources, both at European and at national and local level."
"It is an important step in invigorating the European economy in the middle of an unprecedented crisis which is harming the real economy at all levels more and more every day."
"It is a step which corresponds to the European Parliament's long-standing demand for even simpler procedures and greater flexibility in the application of the rules of the Structural Funds."
"What is the response of today's leaders to the massive crisis we are currently experiencing?"
"Where are the European policies?"
"To ensure that the required liquidity reaches its recipients and the implementation of projects starts immediately, the Member States need to respond to the circumstances."
"Cohesion policy resources must be made available immediately and promptly to the real beneficiaries at regional and local level."
"The purpose of activating operational programmes should be to safeguard jobs, entrepreneurship and competitiveness and make use of the natural, cultural and human resources of each region."
"Only the immediate activation of programmes will help to protect cohesion and prevent the creation of new divergences."
"May today's crisis be an opportunity for us to unite our voice, so that there is a European voice in solving all the problems we are experiencing."
"Madam President, accession to the EU provided access to the European Union's structural and cohesion funds, from which the Republic of Estonia benefitted by around EUR 800 million in 2004-2006, while another EUR 3.4 billion have been allocated within the financial perspective 2007-2013."
"Despite the gravity of the economic crisis, the objective of the European Union funds, which is to level out the differences in development within the Union, is closer to being achieved."
"I very much welcome the Commission proposal to the Council to commit an additional EUR 6.3 billion to counteract the negative effects of the economic crisis, which is to say to accelerate implementation of the funds for the benefit of the real economy."
"However, I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs GarcÃ­a PÃ©rez, that a uniform approach is needed in all the Member States in order to avoid increasing disparities within the European Union and misuse of European taxpayers' money."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are many ways of tackling the lasting effects of the unforeseen financial and economic crisis."
"This revision package, this legislative measure within the European Economic Recovery Plan, was conceived as a good - albeit not quite sufficient - response to this temporary, though exceptionally critical, situation."
"It responds, amongst other things, to the request for greater simplification of procedures and increased flexibility in the application of the existing rules under the Structural Funds Regulation that has been repeatedly put forward by the European Parliament in recent years."
"I should like to emphasise that it is also to be welcomed that an amendment to Article 7 - 'Eligibility of Expenditure' - is to enable EU Member States and regions to invest in energy-efficiency and renewable-energy measures in housing with the support of the EU Structural Funds, and that this measure is not only intended for low-income households."
"The relevant amendment rightly eliminates the reference to 'low-income households', therefore, and instead imposes a ceiling of 4% of the total European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) allocation for each Member State for such expenditure."
"This is just one of the many improvements proposed."
"In short, bringing this overall package to fruition would accelerate expenditure and thus make available further liquidity from the ERDF, European Social Fund (ESF), Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds for the implementation of the necessary objectives, and would simplify rules allowing for a speedy implementation of programmes."
"In my opinion, this represents an effective, albeit as yet insufficient, contribution to dealing with the current crisis."
"(PL) Madam President, the European Union is faced with a widespread crisis whose effects are currently impossible to anticipate."
"We have noted a reduction in the pace of growth, increased budget deficits and a dramatic increase in unemployment."
"European cohesion policy with a budget of EUR 347 billion for the years 2007-2013 seems to be one of the most effective instruments with which to stimulate investment again and provide additional public funding for national economies."
"The Commission has already adopted a series of measures aimed at introducing changes to the existing package of regulations concerning the Structural Funds."
"The changes are aimed at accelerating expenditure, increasing liquidity in relation to the implementation of projects and simplifying measures facilitating swift implementation of projects in the regions."
"The main areas of action concern increasing support from the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Investment Fund (EIF) and simplifying eligibility of expenditure."
"Lump sum payments and speeding up expenditure on large projects are also advocated."
"I welcome the swift action taken by the European Commission and the proposed legislative changes."
"A further important change has so far been overlooked and is called for, however. That would be to create a management and control system guaranteeing genuine liquidity across the European Union's entire economic system."
"(CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission proposal has opened the opportunity for all Member States to invest Structural Fund resources in converting and repairing tower blocks and other buildings."
"This is particularly important for the Czech Republic because up to 26% of Czech citizens live in aging tower blocks."
"If the proposal is passed tomorrow and also formally approved by the Council of Ministers in April, it will open up the possibility of investing a further CZK 16 billion in heating systems for flats and houses, and not only in the Czech Republic."
"I also personally welcome the elimination of the requirement to use the funds only for low-income households, which I consider problematic because internal domestic rules define these in different ways."
"In my opinion the Member States should have the opportunity to decide which categories of building are eligible for financing in accordance with their rules and to determine their own criteria according to their needs."
"We must enable better quality and cheaper housing for everyone, not just for those living in social housing."
"It is regrettable that it took the financial crisis to push us into supporting more investment in housing and the introduction of these measures throughout the EU."
"However, I wholeheartedly welcome this decision, because people have to spend their money very carefully today and in this way we will help them to save on their heating and hot water bills, and thus to reduce the cost of housing."
"According to an estimate from the CECODHAS organisation, European households can save an average of EUR 450 a year on these expenses, and that is tangible assistance."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on the good work that they have done on these reports, which I commend to the House."
"I think this support should be very warmly welcomed."
"If Member States take this opportunity to use up the 4% of European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funding to facilitate investment in energy efficiency in the housing sector, this will make a positive contribution both to our economies and to the environment."
"It is good to see a proposal such as this, which tackles problems of the economic crisis and the environment simultaneously, coming from the Commission."
"The report is especially good news for many of the old Member States, and I am glad to see that old EU Member States will now be allowed to utilise a proportion of ERDF funds for interventions which promote energy efficiency in the housing sector."
"I am glad to see that the criteria for eligibility have been widened and will not be limited to low-income housing."
"However, we must also be aware that this does not represent any increase in funding."
"It is now up to the national and regional authorities to make use of this opportunity to redirect the percentage of their ERDF funds for funding towards these projects."
"This may entail reprioritising parts of their operational programmes. I feel that, in the long run, this will be well worth it."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, these measures from the Commission appear to be sound, more or less."
"Directly awarding contracts to the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund seems a good idea, as does simplifying procedures and speeding up payments."
"However, above all there is one fundamental recommendation: national and regional transparency regarding the use of funds, which is lacking in some cases, in my opinion."
"Checks should be carried out promptly, just as payments should be made promptly."
"In Italy, in certain regions, such as Lazio, farmers' funds are paid out months or, in some cases, years after being transferred from the European Union, and I do not have time now to give other examples."
"Let us therefore ease the crisis by considering not only different kinds of intervention, but also the effective, timely and efficient use of funds."
"(SK) The Structural Funds are also helping us to come to terms with the new economic reality."
"They enable Member States to optimise EU investments as an effective remedy against the ongoing economic crisis."
"The European Parliament, through the Committee on Regional Development, is constantly calling for greater simplification of administrative rules."
"I am delighted that the Commission finally took note and that it has found common ground with the Council."
"Costly administration, delayed payments and complicated verification of the eligibility of payments are creating financial difficulties for final recipients."
"Many officials in my own country, Slovakia, frequently blame Brussels for placing enormous emphasis on bureaucracy and checking accounts to the nth degree."
"They forget that the important issue is to choose the correct activity, project content and quality, efficient implementation and project benefits."
"People in the project teams must concentrate on high quality projects which bring benefits in terms of creating a competitive environment, and not to sit for hours at a time in accounts offices wasting precious time and energy, not to mention the mountains of paperwork required for statements."
"Checking negligible items often costs much more than the items themselves are worth."
"I therefore agree with expanding the use of one-off sums and across-the-board rates in European Regional Development Fund regulations and introducing three new forms of eligible payments: indirect costs of up to 20% of the level of direct costs, one-off sums of up to EUR 50,000 and across-the-board standard scales for individual costs."
"For this reason I consider the package of decisions adopted by the European Commission with the aim of boosting flexibility in drawdowns from the Structural Funds by Member States to be a positive response to the ongoing economic crisis."
"I believe that simplification of the rules and flexible financing will help Member States to prepare good projects targeted on sectors that will bring a high return."
"We must direct investments towards energy efficiency and renewable energy in the area of housing, with the aim of creating new jobs and saving energy."
"By supporting clean technologies we can contribute to the recovery of both the automobile and construction industries."
"Madam President, I welcome the proposal for an amendment to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) Regulation to claim ERDF funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in housing."
"I would also like to welcome the amendment made to the original Commission proposal eliminating the restriction of eligibility to low-income households, instead restricting eligibility to interventions that support social cohesion, leaving it to the discretion of the Member State to determine the exact categories of eligible housing."
"However, I have a specific question, if I may, to the Commission."
"What do we mean by energy efficiency (and we are talking about it under the ERDF funding)?"
"Will there be a harmonised method of calculating energy efficiency across the EU-27, or will there be different calculations and different considerations in the different Member States?"
"When we are talking energy efficiency and investment in energy efficiency in private housing, for example, will that mean what it means under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, which is currently under discussion at the moment and where there is a debate around a need for harmonised - or a single basis of - calculation, running the numbers, in fact, on energy efficiency, to be sure that the investment is being spent on real energy efficiency or increasing energy efficiency or reducing CO2 emissions issues?"
"This is part of the debate that we had this morning at an Small and Medium-sized Entrepreneurs (SME) Union breakfast hosted by my colleague Mr RÃ¼big, when we were told very clearly that there are bottlenecks in getting spending on energy efficiency throughout buildings: bottlenecks in finance due to the credit crunch for loans."
"We need to look at subsidies and various tax incentives. We need simple administration, so we encourage ordinary householders to avail themselves of these funds, whether ERDF or Member State funds."
"Actually, as we speak, I must put on record that our Government has recently launched the Home Energy Saving Retrofit grant scheme."
"But we need simple administration."
"We need promotion so that the investment will not only reduce the import of fossil fuels and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but so that the household will realise the reduction in energy costs to them also."
"(SL) I fully support the proposed amendments to the regulation which will extend flat-rate financing and enable the use of a flat-rate payment system."
"This is an appropriate measure, which could mitigate the difficulties faced by the unemployed, given the right economic circumstances."
"However, before we adopt these amendments, I would like to point out that three out of four European Union citizens are of the view that Parliament plays an important role in the joint shaping of European policies."
"The same poll also found that Parliament inspired the most confidence in the respondents."
"Fifty-one per cent of the respondents said that they had confidence in the European Parliament, while only 47% expressed confidence in the Commission and 42% expressed confidence in the Council."
"In addition, this House inspired more confidence than the European Central Bank."
"Why am I enumerating this statistical data?"
"The European Parliament ascertained as early as 2005 that the need for greater simplification is crucial to the European Structural Funds, in general, and to the European Social Fund, in particular."
"However, the Commission has only just started implementing our recommendations for improving the conditions under which our citizens and companies do business, now that we are facing a crisis."
"Although I will be pleased if our findings and recommendations are at least partially realised, I am saddened to note that a fire-fighting approach is being taken to tackle these difficulties."
"I hope, however, that this experience will encourage the Commission to take more rapid action in the future and that Parliament's many substantial and legitimate comments and proposals will be put into practice sooner."
"Madam President, I welcome these new proposals."
"We are now living through times of crisis."
"We see huge job losses across the EU."
"Today the latest unemployment figures were announced in Ireland."
"The rate now stands at 11% - up from 5.4% only a year ago - more than a doubling of the rate in real terms."
"These figures are shocking and frightening."
"However, faced with this bleak vista, we must seek to find creative solutions to give those unemployed the skills, the prospects and the hope for a better future."
"The European Social Fund (ESF), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund can play a crucial role in this."
"By targeting this funding, we can retool our economies to drive out of recession. It behoves us all - as MEPs and as citizens - to bring this to the attention of the public, who are so fearful right now."
"It behoves us all to drive this message home to our national governments: that this funding be matched and deployed as quickly and efficiently as possible."
"I also welcome the reduction in the paperwork."
"It is a step in the right direction."
"(RO) 2010 is the year when we will carry out a mid-term review of the way in which the Structural Funds are being used, and I think that priority must be given to energy efficiency."
"I am sorry that amendments to these reports were not approved."
"As rapporteur for the Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings, I proposed an increase of up to 15% in the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) rate which can be used for improving energy efficiency in buildings."
"It is actually about providing greater flexibility and it is up to Member States to decide whether and how much they want to allocate to this area."
"I understand the urgency."
"The EU-15 states must be able to use the Structural Funds for energy efficiency."
"I think that this will allow an exchange of good practice and enable new Member States to be supported."
"I urge the Commission to come up with a new legislative proposal by 30 June 2010 so that the maximum ceiling can be increased to 15% or to set a minimum 10% threshold of the ERDF rate for energy efficiency in buildings."
"Madam President, time and time again discussion on energy efficiency has focused on the fact that much more could be achieved - and quickly - if only up-front funding was available."
"That is why it is so important to allow European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funding to be spent on energy efficiency, not only in the EU-12 but also in the EU-15."
"Despite considerable progress, the UK Housing Minister has admitted that only 1% of the current housing stock is energy-efficient enough to prevent fuel poverty."
"In my own region, north-east England, one in ten homes has been labelled a category one health hazard because they are so cold and draughty."
"So I welcome this change and urge all Member States and regions to take full advantage of the new flexibility."
"In the interests of tackling climate change, fuel poverty, unemployment and energy security, and like Mrs Å¢icÄu, I urge the Commission to raise the current percentage limits considerably higher in due course, as the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy called for in its vote on the recast on Tuesday."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs."
"Looking at ways we can use European Structural Funds more effectively to help those affected by the global economic crisis is one of the many actions Member States need to take to help those who lose their jobs get back into employment as quickly as possible."
"It is interesting that we are debating this subject on the eve of the G20."
"The G20 has the potential to start the process of creating global rules on finance, which we require to prevent such an economic calamity happening again."
"We need to make jobs and the social agenda key issues for the European elections."
"The 25 million people across the EU who will find themselves out of work by the end of the year should be the focus of our work in this House to get the economy moving again and help people back into work."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs GarcÃ­a PÃ©rez, Mrs JÃ¶ns and Mr Angelaka, who have submitted excellent reports, and all the Members who have spoken."
"The vast majority of these speeches have given their support to the measures proposed by the Commission, by emphasising their relevance to an effective fight against the effects of the crisis on the European economy."
"On behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank you for that."
"Your speeches have highlighted the European Parliament's desire to provide the European Union with the resources to counteract the effects of the crisis on the ground."
"You have insisted on the need to act quickly, and this is our objective."
"The Czech Presidency, which I would like to thank here for its support, is also committed to allowing the final adoption of the regulations as quickly as possible."
"If we make a reasonably optimistic assumption, the new regulations could enter into force in the coming weeks and therefore make a swift impression on the operational programmes."
"The advances, in particular, could be paid out in full at the start of May."
"Moreover, other speeches have insisted on the introduction of rigorous monitoring of the application of these measures and on the presentation of a report in 2010, showing the results obtained."
"The Commission has made this commitment and it is included in the statement that I have submitted to the Presidency."
"It will have therefore taken the European institutions barely four months to prepare and approve this legislative package."
"I would like to give some mention to the issue of energy efficiency, which has been raised in many speeches."
"I would like to point out to Parliament that a workshop on this subject will take place in June, in the course of a seminar with the management authorities of the Member States."
"We are asking the Member States to describe to us their intentions as regards turn around time in the strategic reports that they have to draw up for the end of 2009."
"Obviously, given the current state of affairs, it is up to the Member States to define the energy efficiency criteria and eligible measures."
"This is what subsidiarity is about."
"However, it is true that a directive on energy efficiency is under consideration and, once this directive has been adopted, it will of course have to be applied."
"Moreover, I will gladly add my voice to those Members who have emphasised how research into the energy efficiency of buildings has the twin advantage of creating jobs and subsequently allowing us to prepare for the future and of helping us to solve the problems of global warming."
"I would also like to say that, aside from this crisis, which has in a way created very close cooperation between the institutions, it is obviously increasingly important to be able to establish a partnership between the Commission and Parliament that is based on a high degree of confidence."
"The Commission has sought to rise effectively to the challenge posed by the economic and financial crisis and, at the same time, it wanted to take advantage of this interactive discussion with the Member States and the European Parliament to respond to the calls for simplification of these procedures and these policies."
"Of course, additional proposals could have been included in the framework of the recovery plan."
"They have not all been included, but they will contribute to the discussion the Commission is to initiate to strengthen the effects of the recovery plan and offer additional facilities to the national authorities managing the projects."
"The Commission therefore set up a working group on simplification in November."
"Its work has already led to a draft revision of the Commission's implementing regulation."
"Other proposals to amend the general regulation and regulations specific to each fund may follow."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, obviously, all the observations made in the course of this debate will be very useful and others will also be welcomed."
"I would particularly like to thank the European Parliament for its commitment to resolve the serious problems posed by the crisis more quickly."
"On the issue of the amendments to the draft European Regional Development Fund Regulation tabled by Mrs Schroedter, three relate to the recitals and one to the substance."
"As regards the recitals - Amendments 8 to 10 - their inclusion would not have changed the general tenor of the proposals presented by the Commission, but it would have prolonged the procedure for adopting the regulation."
"As regards the amendment to the substance, the Commission is not opposed to the principle."
"However, it aims to adopt a mechanism that was not included in the compromise text from the Council, as the text caused difficulties with implementation in the Member States."
"I had to make these clarifications, and I have done so at the end of my speech."
"Once again, I would like to thank Parliament for enabling us to act more quickly to limit the painful effects of the crisis, which some of you have pointed out and described so well."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your explanations about today's debate."
"I imagine you must be aware that the almost total unanimity in this House today with respect to the proposal just debated, is not merely a coincidence."
"In fact, as our colleague Mrs CreÅ£u commented, this has demonstrated political will, showing that we can do our bit in searching for solutions to the present crisis."
"This crisis is actually causing genuinely difficult situations and poverty for European citizens."
"It has also been an exercise in responsibility, however, as you yourself have pointed out; and I repeat, an exercise in responsibility, since we were aware that this proposal put to us today could perhaps have been better."
"We could have incorporated other elements into the proposal, to speed up or simplify procedures, but we were aware that in order for these measures to be implemented as quickly as possible, it was necessary for the reports to stay as they are at present."
"Therefore, I should simply like to make a request to the Commission: now that we have a revised plan to simplify the formalities, as has been announced, I hope that Parliament will have a greater role in the debate and planning of these new initiatives."
"I am making this demand on behalf of both this House, and of local administrations, which are involved in these projects at ground level, and understand their own particular needs as regards the implementation of the different initiatives."
"Madam President, Commissioner, thank you."
"I have a few comments to make on what we have just heard."
"I was delighted, Commissioner, with your statement that advances will probably start to be paid at the beginning of May and I therefore assume that these amendments will be published in the Official Journal within a reasonable period of time of two, three or four weeks from tomorrow, so that they can be applied as you said."
"That is my first comment."
"As a second comment, I wish to say that you must proceed apace in the new term with amending and simplifying other regulations, as other Members have already said, and that the European Parliament wishes to make an active contribution to the study, evaluation and drafting of these regulations."
"I have to say that we had a number of proposals and thoughts but, bearing in mind the urgency of the matter, most of us in committee and in Parliament felt that it would not be a good idea to proceed with such amendments."
"As we have heard that the take-up rate for renewable energy sources in dwellings will increase, I have to say that, according to the figures at our disposal, the new Member States are at present only using 1% to 1.5%, meaning that perhaps there are a number of difficulties."
"I consider that 4%, which represents the maximum amount earmarked by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), is satisfactory and I hope that things will improve."
"I also welcome your statement that you will table a report on the recovery plans in the second half of 2010, based on the programmes submitted to you by the Member States."
"Finally, I should like to close by emphasising, Commissioner, that the complexity of the procedures is the first problem faced by the Member States and regions in applying these procedures."
"They urgently need to be simplified. I believe that you too will help in this direction and the European Parliament will be standing by you."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (LT) The current financial crisis and economic recession are having a negative impact on public budgets."
"In most Member States economic growth has decreased significantly, and some are even experiencing economic stagnation."
"Unemployment indicators have begun to worsen."
"When such a situation as the economic recession occurs, it is very important that the European Social Fund is used comprehensively to solve problems of the unemployed, in particular of those worst affected."
"It is very important that the four main areas of the European Social Fund's activities remain the same:"
"an increase in the adaptability of workers and enterprises;"
"the creation of better conditions for employment, unemployment prevention, the lengthening of working activities and the promotion of more active participation in the labour market;"
"the improvement of social integration by promoting the integration of people receiving social support into work and the fight against discrimination;"
"the promotion of partnership in implementing reform of the areas of employment and integration."
"The expanded European Economic Recovery Plan, or the review of the Regulation on the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to be more precise, offers a number of opportunities for EU Member States, all the more so as the global economic crisis is leading to a slowdown in national economies."
"The new measure proposed in the report on the review of the ERDF Regulation, concerning investments in energy efficiency and in the use of renewable energy for housing for all Member States, is conducive to both creating new jobs and improving energy efficiency in housing."
"Meeting the objectives of the Community's energy and climate strategy is a very serious matter which should not take into account the economic crisis or other considerations."
"In this respect, the proposals from the ERDF review effectively combine the measures for combating the effects of the economic crisis (by creating new jobs, increasing investment, and so on) with measures for protecting the environment (through thermal insulation in residential buildings and investments in renewable energy)."
"For these reasons, I believe that the Report on 'Investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy for housing' is an important step that the EU is taking and I am confident that Member States will be able to make the most of this opportunity."
"The painful social consequences of the crisis are being increasingly felt in all Member States."
"Particularly where jobs are concerned, we are faced with a situation which is deteriorating fast in every Member State."
"The Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development highlights the fact that the estimated unemployment rate in the EU and US could reach 10% this year."
"This is a worrying increase at a time when, in January, the average rate in the EU was 8%."
"In Romania, although the official rate is below the European average, a 1% increase in the unemployment rate was recorded last year, reaching 5.3%."
"However, we are expecting this rate to grow faster as increasing numbers of companies will be forced to resort to redundancies and as our compatriots who are working abroad will be coming back home as a result of losing their jobs."
"This is why, as the situation threatens to degenerate into a surge in social inequalities, which we are at risk of no longer being able to control, I want to emphasise the need to focus greater attention on the problems of the unemployed who are the most affected and vulnerable among us in the current crisis."
"I welcome the Commission's proposal to amend the Regulation on the European Regional and Development Fund (ERDF) so that all Member States and regions in the European Union can invest in measures relating to energy efficiency and renewable energy for housing, with the help of the Structural Funds."
"On the basis of the current regulation, the ERDF already supports intervention in the housing sector, which also covers energy efficiency, but only for the new Member States (EU-12) and in certain conditions."
"It is important for Member States to be allowed to amend their priorities and reschedule their operational programmes in order to finance measures in this area, if they so wish."
"Bearing in mind that a ceiling has been imposed of 4% of the total ERDF funds allocated to each Member State for the costs relating to improving energy efficiency and using renewable energy for existing housing, this ceiling must be raised to 15% so that the investments in this area have the biggest possible impact on the European Union's citizens."
"I must conclude by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Angelakas, for his contribution to this report."
"Together we ended up in this crisis and together we must overcome it."
"This means that we must work together both in Europe and the rest of the world."
"However, we must finish our work here first, in the European Union, in the European Parliament to be more exact, where the interests of all European citizens are represented."
"The proposals from the European Commission which we are examining today are aimed at giving a new impetus to Europe's economies, as well as helping them to get out of the recession."
"The amendments to the Structural Funds Regulation to take account of cohesion policy will enable us to provide a new impetus for investment and help restore confidence in the economies."
"These amendments are particularly appropriate for countries where the rate of use of European resources is low."
"However, this will be possible to achieve only if the corresponding national administrations also apply the general standards of good governance and partnership."
"We must put an end to inefficient working methods and corrupt practices which are, unfortunately, still being used."
"We must respond now, together."
"As the PPE-DE rapporteur, I call on you to support the European Commission's proposal to amend the Regulation on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund concerning certain provisions relating to financial management."
"In relation to the debate on European funds I should like to draw attention to four proposals by the Commission aimed at accelerating use of financial resources and the Structural Funds by the beneficiaries."
"1."
"Increasing support from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF) for projects cofinanced from the Structural Funds."
"2."
"Simplifying procedures concerning eligibility of expenditure retroactively as far back as 1 August 2006, involving for instance inclusion of a beneficiary's contribution in-kind in eligible expenditure."
"3."
"Increasing payments in instalments from the Structural Funds by 2%, thus allowing for the payment of additional instalments amounting to EUR 6.25 billion in 2009."
"4."
"Accelerating expenditure on major projects amongst other measures by enabling beneficiaries to submit requests for payments prior to approval of projects by the European Commission."
"All the aforementioned changes involve increasing the liquidity of beneficiaries."
"They deserve wholehearted support and should be implemented as soon as possible."
"The same applies to the simplifying provisions."
"According to research, Romania has one of the highest consumptions of electricity in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Improving energy management could be a direct factor influencing economic growth, reducing pollution and saving resources, so that they are used in a more productive manner."
"To achieve this situation in Romania, the population needs to be informed about the economic benefits which can be gained through energy efficiency management practices, providing, with this purpose in mind, consultancy to all those who are interested in accessing ERDF funds for the latest energy-saving methods."
"This will help make life easier for domestic consumers, while at the same time reducing energy bills, boosting efficient energy use throughout the energy chain, as well as verifying compliance with current energy efficiency legislation."
"This is what will crucially determine the redirection of energy policy based on energy production towards an active energy policy based on saving energy, with the aim of saving resources through conserving energy."
"I am pleased that we are finally taking concrete steps to reduce the bureaucracy involved in accessing European funds."
"However, it is a pity that it is only when there is a crisis that proposals are tabled for simpler and more flexible regulations governing European funds."
"I would like to highlight one important aspect of these regulations: increasing the threshold for investments in energy efficiency in buildings."
"In countries which have gone through the experience of systematic urbanisation and forced industrialisation, the problem of energy efficiency in buildings is one which affects millions of citizens."
"Very little from these funds has been used so far, but I believe that only two years into the current financial programming period is too early for us to have a precise idea of the absorption rate."
"For this reason, raising this threshold was necessary, given the large number of beneficiaries and the opportunity to create jobs."
"However, this will remain a problem for Romania as long as, at the Commission's request, these actions are eligible only for those towns selected as growth poles."
"I hope that the Commission will also keep its pledge to renegotiate certain operational programme axes already approved so that the funds can be reallocated for those measures offering a greater potential for economic growth."
"The proposal for a regulation which is the subject of this report is an example of the way in which European money can be 'made to work' to bring greater benefits to European citizens."
"This is how significant results can be achieved, without increasing the allocated funds or without measures being taken which have implications for the Community budget, in other words, simply by improving the rules of the game."
"I would like to highlight that for the country which I represent, Romania, these amendments will help double the Community funds which can be invested in renovating the heating systems in residential blocks."
"These funds will supplement the highly ambitious programme launched by the Romanian Government for renovating the heating systems in residential blocks."
"What does all this mean?"
"Firstly, a reduction in wasted energy."
"Secondly, by implication, a reduction in energy imports."
"Lastly, again by implication, a reduction in the cost of residential heating to be paid by citizens."
"I hope that this is only the beginning and that the European Union will encourage even more investments in energy efficiency."
"I have supported this idea right from the very beginning of my mandate as an MEP."
"This is why I will vote tomorrow in favour of the Angelakas report and in favour of the proposal for the regulation initiated by the Commission."
"The Angelakas report offers a welcome simplification of the eligibility conditions for investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy for housing."
"Extending the use of fixed rates and flat-rate sums will have a positive impact on the day-to-day management of the Structural Funds."
"The amendment to Article 7 of the ERDF Regulation, which enables all EU Member States to invest in measures relating to energy efficiency and renewable energy for housing, with the help of the Structural Funds, is a welcome move not only in the context of the current economic crisis."
"Facilitating EU-27's access to the ERDF marks another step towards achieving the 20% target for Europe's energy coming from renewable sources by 2020."
"Since joining the EU, renewable energy and energy efficiency have become mandatory targets in Romania as well."
"As a result, the legislation for renovating residential heating systems will be amended so that 50% of the funds required will be covered by the state, the owners will pay only 20% of the costs and the local authorities 30%."
"To give you some figures, by the end of 2008, heating systems in 1 900 flats had been renovated."
"For 2009, the Romanian Ministry of Regional Development and Housing will allocate EUR 130 million for renovating heating systems, with nurseries, schools and retirement homes among the beneficiaries."
"I welcome the initiative from the European Commission to amend some of the financial conditions for the Structural and Cohesion Funds so that more cash can reach Member States more quickly."
"I believe that this effort by the European Commission must continue by also increasing the financial resources allocated to the JASPER, JEREMIE, JESSICA and JASMINE facilities, which are proving to be effective in speeding up new Member States' access to European funds."
"The revision of the three regulations governing the Structural Funds will give the European Union's regions more flexibility in the management and programming of the budgets provided to them under European economic and social cohesion policy."
"These provisions, without increasing the funding capacity offered to the regions, will allow them to redirect their priorities, in order to concentrate European contributions on projects that offer the greatest potential for growth and employment."
"The regions can henceforth take advantage of European Regional and Development Fund (ERDF) cofinancing to invest in energy efficiency for all categories of housing, in order to develop programmes to provide homes with insulation or solar panels."
"Faced with the slowdown in the European economy, I welcome the new possibility of speeding up the payment of regional aid funds, and of simplifying the rules on their use, with the aim of freeing up liquidity to allow the swift implementation of new projects in the real economy."
"It is imperative that the Ãtats gÃ©nÃ©raux de l'Outre-mer, which is responsible for exploring new indigenous development opportunities in the French overseas departments (DOM), encourages the local authorities in our outermost regions to seize these opportunities to maximise the impact of Community policies on their territories without delay."
"in writing. - (HU) As a result of the economic crisis, several hundred thousand people in the European Union, and more than twenty thousand in Hungary, have lost their jobs."
"In every country in Europe, unemployment has grown by leaps and bounds."
"The economic crisis is increasingly turning into an employment crisis, and according to surveys, the danger of losing one's job is now the greatest worry among European citizens."
"The most effective tool of the European Union to combat unemployment is the European Social Fund, the rules of which we are now considerably simplifying in order to speed up payments."
"The amendments being proposed by the European Commission reduce the bureaucracy involved in drawing on this source of funding and facilitate and speeding up of payments."
"The ceiling of EUR 50 000, the previously agreed flat-rate payments and strict ex-post verification reduce the chances of abuse to a minimum."
"With this measure, the European Commission has once again demonstrated that although it has limited financial resources, it is creative."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Madam President, infrastructural development is crucial to our economic recovery."
"Whereas in the past it was the construction of road and rail that helped stimulate economies in recession and lead the way to future prosperity, nowadays we must focus on our information and communications technology infrastructure as a driver of future growth."
"In this context, I wish to draw attention to the appalling situation in Ireland of the so-called 'digital divide'."
"Due to years of government neglect in boom times, we are now left with broad areas of rural Ireland with sub-standard, slow connections and, worst of all, in 28% of cases, without any access to broadband."
"How are we to bring prosperity and opportunity to our rural communities without bringing them the means of achieving these goals?"
"How can we tell our young farmers that they cannot benefit from ICT to develop their agri-business industries because we have not provided them with the connectivity?"
"I welcome recent statements by the Commission which detail the disbursement of EU funds to address this huge challenge."
"To conclude, we must not lose sight of eliminating the digital divide, even in the midst of economic crisis."
"(LT) The crisis must force each one of us to change our behaviour and thinking."
"Lithuanian, Latvian and Irish Members of Parliament have reduced their own salaries, which also means a trimming of the salaries of those countries' MEPs."
"The incomes of Presidents, Ministers and other state officials are being cut, and this is right, as we need solidarity; the burden of the crisis must not be shouldered by those who are weakest."
"After the compromise, which took more than a decade to reach, it would be difficult to reduce MEPs' salaries straight away; however, I would urge fellow Members of the European Parliament to donate part of their salaries to charity."
"During the crisis we should cut the allowances allocated to MEPs."
"I trust the majority of fellow Members would support a reduction in the number of translations into all 23 official languages, which would allow us to save hundreds of millions of Euro."
"Now journeys from Brussels to Strasbourg for plenary sessions, which cost EUR 200 million each year, seem particularly absurd."
"In order to economise and save the environment, we should stop wasting a thousand tonnes of paper and switch to using electronic documents in our meetings."
"(FR) Madam President, today we have devoted one minute, at the start of our work, and we thank the President for allowing us to do so, to paying tribute to the memory of the daily victims of a system that is now causing a tragedy at a level that has never been seen before, a continuous tragedy of the poor against the poor, seeking work and food."
"We also learned, a moment ago, that 94 women and 7 children had been found."
"The problem, Madam President, as we have been saying here for eight years, is as follows: is it possible for there to be no follow-up, for it to be impossible to know the reasons why, when we can see the flowers on our balconies from space?"
"The reasons are not known, the consequences are criminal..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Madam President, I was saddened to hear the news concerning the outcome of the vote of no confidence in Prime Minister TopolÃ¡nek in Prague last week."
"The Czech Republic has led the Union since 1 January, and I believe that its Presidency has proved very successful to date."
"I trust this success will be maintained during the remaining three months."
"I am keeping my fingers crossed for our Czech friends and for all the projects the Czech Presidency hopes to implement."
"The latter include the very important matter of the Eastern neighbourhood policy and measures relating to Europe's energy security."
"(EL) Madam President, the European Court of Justice recently published its ruling against Greece which sets the same retirement age for men and women in the public sector, with the result that the retirement age for women has increased by between 5 and 17 years."
"This development, which has been decisively condemned by the workers, has been systematically supported since the beginning of the 1990s and bears the stamp of the European Union and Greek governments."
"It is damaging to working women and is a step towards increasing the retirement age to 65 for both men and women, as already stipulated in the anti-insurance laws passed by New Democracy and PASOK for persons insured after 1993, in application of Community legislation."
"This unacceptable decision totally undermines the public, social character of social insurance in the public and private sectors."
"It views the national insurance and pension system as a system of occupational rather than social insurance."
"This means that there is no guarantee in terms of age limits, pension amounts and benefits in general."
"The only way forward for working men and women is disobedience and insubordination towards the decisions by the European Union and its institutions."
"(PL) Madam President, according to data on the portal eudebate2009, only 52% of Europeans trust the European Parliament as an institution."
"This is a 3% reduction compared to the figures for last year."
"The proportion of voters that still have not decided whether to vote in this year's elections to the European Parliament is as high as 50%."
"Only 30% of those surveyed stated that they intended to vote in the elections."
"The percentage of voters who will not turn out because they feel their vote will not make a difference is as high as 68%."
"I therefore wish to pose a question."
"Is the European Parliament planning some spectacular last-minute action to persuade people to vote?"
"Are we somehow going to extend the remit of information channels for Europe?"
"In my country, no debate whatsoever on Europe is taking place."
"The Prime Minister is doing nothing about it."
"Is everyone else simply to stand and watch?"
"(RO) The assessments made by experts about possible problems in the global food market and about providing the necessary amount for the entire global population is one reason for rethinking the way in which agricultural land is used in Europe, especially in the new Member States, which also includes Romania."
"In this respect, a realistic evaluation needs to be made of the opportunities which Romania offers to investors interested in investing in the agricultural sector, which seem, during the current crisis, to be most in demand."
"This is at least what is indicated by a study published in Bucharest, which mentions a significant growth in investment in Romania in the agricultural and forest land sector."
"The explanation given for this by those who carried out the study is that these property segments are the least affected by the difficult economic situation which is currently a main feature of the market."
"On the other hand, we must not forget that Romania was at one time the bread basket of Europe, but regaining this status requires policies which will support farmers, while also using, at the same time, the Community funds which Romania can benefit from as a Member State."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Gaddafi, the Libyan dictator, has defined the International Criminal Court as a 'new form of world terrorism'."
"I would like to remind the Presidency of this Parliament that this House was instrumental in advancing the fight - we did this in the non-violent Radical Party - for the creation of the International Criminal Court."
"I believe we cannot let the words of the Libyan dictator pass without harshly condemning them as Parliament and as European institutions."
"Our struggle must be to subjugate national sovereignty, the sovereignty of states, to the binding power of international law against genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity; international and supranational law against absolute sovereignties."
"Our friends in the Tibetan Government in exile asked us to do this same thing at our hearing in the Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday, as did the Congress of Nationalities for a Federal Iran at today's hearing: absolute sovereignty is the enemy of freedom and justice."
"(PL) Madam President, at the most recent meeting of the Committee on Agriculture, Commissioner Mrs Fischer-Boel referred to reform of the sugar sector as one of the greatest successes of the common agricultural policy."
"I should like to inform the House that following this reform, Poland has ceased to be a sugar exporting country and is instead now obliged to import around 20% of its sugar."
"A 60% increase in the price of sugar has taken place in just two years."
"The question arises as to whether the Commissioner and her fellow workers were seriously mistaken, or whether this was a planned strategy aimed at ensuring that certain countries became more profitable."
"I should like to state unequivocally that, as it has been experienced by Polish voters, the common agricultural policy is exceedingly unbalanced and favours the old EU Member States."
"(BG) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are living in a fast-moving, stressful time of changes and new challenges and, over the last few months, in a global economic crisis."
"Yesterday the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted a report on allocating additional resources to farmers and rural areas in Member States to help cope with the consequences of the crisis."
"EUR 1.02 billion will support the European Union's agricultural sector during this difficult time."
"I believe that the Community's farmers and rural inhabitants will understand this important message for a united Europe."
"Investments in Internet infrastructure, restructuring the dairy sector, renewable energy sources, protecting biodiversity and water resources are key to resolving a large percentage of the problems in these regions, providing alternative options to the people who live there."
"The possibility of part of the resources being targeted at credit and guarantee funds will facilitate in practical terms the projects' implementation."
"I am expecting the Council and Commission to back the European Parliament's efforts to ensure necessary support for the millions of agricultural producers in the Community."
"Madam President, in the current climate, with the economic crisis and job losses in European Union Member States, there is a serious risk of an increase in the exploitation of child labour."
"Unfortunately, in such a crisis situation women and children are the worst affected by it."
"Regardless of the sound legislative basis at European level and good solutions at national level, including in the country which I represent, Bulgaria, what goes on in practice does not, in many cases, comply with the law."
"The problem affects migrant groups particularly severely and the Roma community."
"Preventive measures are required at every level, along with the tightening of controls on complying with the legislation across the whole of the European Union."
"Many companies use child labour in spite of the relevant legal restrictions."
"There are thousands of breaches of labour legislation in Member States."
"The European Commission must organise targeted initiatives linked to the fight against the exploitation of child labour and call for the control mechanisms to be tightened up during this process."
"If we are looking to protect children's interests as part of our European policy, this is an absolute must."
"(PL) Madam President, issues such as genocide in Chechnya, the murder of Chechens so as to use their organs in transplants, and the rape of Chechen women have been raised in this House on many occasions."
"A premeditated attack on Chechnya's material culture is currently taking place, damaging Chechen culture, which is hundreds of years older than Russia's."
"I have in mind not only writings and objects in daily use that could be in museums, but also residential towers."
"These are special structures, the like of which is not found anywhere else in Europe."
"We have often emphasised how our culture is enriched by its diversity."
"One branch of our culture is now disappearing before our very eyes and we are witnessing the obliteration of one of its sources."
"(HU) After the January gas crisis, the common European energy policy has in recent days once again received a slap in the face."
"The Austrian OMV company sold its significant share in the Hungarian MOL company to a Russian oil company whose ownership is unknown and which according to news reports in no way satisfies EU expectations with regard to transparency."
"At the same time, it is hardly imaginable that this deal could have been concluded without the knowledge of the governments concerned."
"Therefore, we can say that the unexpected transaction is clear proof of ambivalence among Member States, and is at the same time a new warning."
"There is no point in the European Union talking about the need for a common energy policy if the Member States' actions contradict each other."
"If the EU is unable to strike a unified chord on the essential matters of energy policy, it will continue to be the victim of efforts to sow division."
"As a result, the vulnerability of European consumers will continue to grow."
"Madam President, I wanted to inform Parliament that on Saturday a special memorial will be laid in Zillhausen in Germany to commemorate the lives of seven British servicemen who lost their lives in the Second World War."
"Their plane was shot down between 15 and 16 March 1944."
"They were part of 97 Squadron based at RAF Bourn in Cambridgeshire."
"Their names were William Meyer, Bernard Starie, Reginald Pike, Thomas Shaw, James McLeish, Archibald Barrowman and Albert Roberts, who will all be honoured on Saturday."
"They made the ultimate sacrifice so that we can enjoy the freedoms that we often take for granted today, and their lives should never be forgotten."
"I wanted to put on record my thanks to the Mayor of Balingen, Dr Reitemann, and the local council for allowing the memorial to be laid in honour of the lives of these young men."
"I would also like to thank Brett and Luella Langevad, who are paying for the memorial to be laid, and RAF 9 Squadron for sending two crews to the ceremony on Saturday."
"On a personal note, James McLeish was my great-uncle, and representatives of my family will be present at the service."
"(RO) Elections are taking place in the Republic of Moldova on 5 April."
"This morning there was an explosion at the Ananiev-Tiraspol-Ismail gas pipeline in Transnistria."
"The cause of this accident is still unknown, but it has resulted in disruption to gas deliveries from Russia to the Balkans."
"I hope that this accident will not have any impact on the outcome of the elections."
"At the same time, I believe that it is linked to two particularly important factors."
"It is absolutely paramount that efforts are made to settle the unresolved conflicts in the region, especially in Transnistria."
"The European Union must also find specific, viable solutions for the development of alternative energy supply routes to the Black Sea."
"Unfortunately, the agreement signed at the end of last week between Gazprom and the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan may jeopardise the Nabucco project."
"This is why attention must be focused urgently on all aspects linked to consolidating the European Union's energy security. Thank you."
"(RO) The Danube plays a very important role in economic and social cohesion, as well as in Europe's cultural development."
"The European Danube Commission was founded on 30 March 1856 in the wake of the Paris Conference, with its headquarters in GalaÅ£i, in Romania."
"It was one of the first European institutions and its aim was to establish an international system for free navigation on the Danube."
"TEN-T priority axis 18 formed by the Danube and the Main-Rhein Canal provides the connection between the Black Sea and North Sea, cutting the distance between the sea ports of Rotterdam and ConstanÅ£a by 4 000 kilometres."
"The Danube must be given a higher priority within the Community's policies."
"I propose setting up at the start of the next term of the European Parliament an intergroup for promoting the Danube."
"In the years to come, we will need to join efforts and adopt a common approach for dealing with the development initiatives affecting the Danube region."
"We need an integrated European development strategy for the Danube River Basin to promote economic development, the development of the transport infrastructure and environmental protection."
"(PL) Madam President, in November of last year we debated the situation of the Polish shipbuilding industry at the request of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"Despite our differences, we were all agreed in calling on the Commission and on Commissioner Kroes to devise solutions aimed at improving the situation of shipyards rather than closing them down."
"Four months later, the situation is as follows: the Polish Government has given in far too easily to pressure from the Commission, accepting the latter's solution which involves selling off individual parts of the shipyards' assets according to the principle that the highest bidder will be able to obtain the desired assets."
"Currently, the production of ships has ceased and most of the workers have already lost their jobs, having received only token compensation."
"As for the competitiveness of the European shipbuilding industry, it is no better than it used to be."
"(RO) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of last week several hundred Romanian citizens were prevented from entering the territory of the Republic of Moldova."
"In most cases, no explanation was given; otherwise, the strangest excuses were used, such as they did not have documents to show that they were not infected by the HIV virus."
"This is an unprecedented abuse."
"No other European citizens have ever had their right of free movement so grossly violated."
"I strongly support the European journey being made by the Republic of Moldova and its citizens, but I protest against this gross abuse and ask the European Commission and Council to request explanations from the authorities in ChiÅinÄu, just as Romania has already requested through the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Thank you."
"(SK) In my speech I would like to applaud the Commission's initiative relating to the European Citizens Consultation 2009 project."
"This project brings together citizens from the 27 EU Member States ahead of the European Parliament elections in order to discuss responses to the question, 'what can the European Union do to influence our economic and social future in a globalised world?'"
"National consultations with Slovak citizens took place on 28-29 March."
"The European Citizens' Summit will take place on 10-11 May 2009 in Brussels, where 150 participants from the 27 national consultations will draft a final version of the European recommendations which MEPs will be able to use in the coming election period as a basis for creating European legislation."
"I firmly believe that only through discussions with citizens will we renew their faith in the uniqueness of the European project."
"At the same time I call on the media to be more objective and more active in presenting information on the European Parliament as this will be important in influencing voter turnout."
"(HU) A conference with a strange title was held at the European Parliament today on the defeat of the so-called Hungarian Soviet Republic."
"No such country name or event ever existed."
"I reject any political attitude that subordinates, for nationalist motives, to the nation state's interests the historical questions that are connected to the retrospective justification of a state's ambitions to gain territory."
"It is unacceptable for the invasion of Hungary, the Romanian military occupation and the plundering of the country from November 1918 to be interpreted as a factor in regional stabilisation at an event organised here in Brussels, at the heart of Europe, under the aegis of Members of European Parliament."
"On behalf of the Hungarian community in Romania as well, I firmly protest against the cynical behaviour of our Romanian socialist colleagues and against their misleading public relations manoeuvre and attempt to shape opinion guided by nationalist motives."
"(SK) On 18 and 19 March 2009 the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid Louis Michel visited Cuba."
"This was during the sixth anniversary of the imprisonment of 75 opposition representatives."
"During this visit Commissioner Michel did not meet with the Damas de Blanco or any other opposition representatives."
"According to information from European diplomats, Commission Michel did not take the opportunity to mention human rights or the anniversary."
"On Cuban opposition radio Mr Michel said that the date was an official error and that he did not know that the Damas de Blanco wanted to meet him."
"I have to say that Deputy President Martinez of the European Parliament, who was an official member of the delegation representing the European Parliament, also failed to meet with the opposition, although he did meet with the families of Cuban spies arrested in the US."
"Martinez thus allowed the Castro regime to exploit his visit and the meeting he attended in order to distract media attention away from the activities of Damas de Blanco relating to the anniversary, as media coverage concentrated on the visit of the Commissioner and this meeting."
"This item is now closed."
"Loss at sea of migrants' boats off the Libyan coast (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the loss at sea of migrants' boats off the Libyan coast."
"Madam President, the European Commission was dismayed to learn of the loss, on Sunday evening in the Mediterranean, off the coast of Libya, of a ship carrying migrants bound for Europe."
"According to some sources, this ship had 257 people on board, the vast majority of whom are missing."
"The Commission wishes to express its compassion for the victims of this human disaster and its anger in the face of this tragedy."
"It was doubtless caused by many factors, but the primary responsibility must lie with those criminal organisations that are directing this deadly illegal traffic from the coasts of Libya and who are growing rich at the cost of human misery."
"The Commission finds it intolerable that this phenomenon, which seems to be intensifying over the course of the years, continues to grow."
"It invites all the parties concerned to mobilise their efforts to bring it to an end."
"Libya has an essential role to play here."
"It must make a more determined and effective commitment to the fight against the traffickers operating on its territory, to the prevention of illegal departures from its coasts, to the search and rescue of ships in distress in the waters under its control, and to the offer of international protection to those migrants who require it, in accordance with its obligations under the 1969 OAU convention on the protection of refugees, to which it is a signatory."
"Over the last few years, the European Commission has asked the Libyan authorities several times to assume their responsibilities and to introduce effective measures, in cooperation with the European Union and its Member States."
"I have to say that we have offered increased financial assistance to Libya, and it is evident that the Libyan authorities need to use this assistance to improve the fight against the trafficking of migrants and others on their territory and to strengthen the controls at their southern border."
"The Libyan authorities must also develop a system for receiving migrants that complies with international law."
"It is true that the European Union is ready to cooperate and to contribute to the interception and, if necessary, to the rescue of ships in the Mediterranean."
"The launch, in the coming months, of Nautilus and Hermes, the two naval operations organised and financed by Frontex, the European external borders agency, will cost around EUR 24 million."
"The Commission invites all the Member States of the European Union to cooperate in the implementation of these two actions."
"The Member States must also show solidarity in practice with Italy and Malta, which are very exposed to the flow of migrants from Libya."
"Furthermore, Libya must assume its responsibilities as regards the readmission of illegal migrants who have crossed its territory."
"We have noted that the Italian authorities believe it will be possible, from 15 May, to begin joint patrols with the Libyan navy in Libyan territorial waters with the aim of intercepting or assisting illegal vessels."
"We welcome the support given by the Italian authorities to the development of Libyan naval capacities for this purpose."
"However, in addition to these emergency measures, the Commission believes that a priority action must be applied to the whole human dimension of these problems."
"Migrants who entrust their lives to unscrupulous traffickers are, in the vast majority of cases, people fleeing war or persecution."
"We hope that the events of recent days will create an awareness, in all of our Member States, of how serious this problem is, and that, together with the Member States and with the support of the European Parliament, we can thus prepare a Stockholm Programme that dedicates a large part of its priorities to this global approach to migration."
"The global approach is necessary for drawing up a long-term strategy for managing migratory flows that will take greater account of the circumstances and requirements of countries of origin."
"In addition, this strategy must allow us to go further in the dialogue with the African partners, especially in the framework of the Rabat Process, in the framework of the relationship between the European Union and the African Union."
"Together we must identify joint responses to this challenge and also seize the opportunities offered by legal migration, which could, in fact, be an opportunity both for Europe and for countries of origin."
"This strategy must also mobilise additional resources by increasing cooperation with countries of origin and of transit in order to strengthen their capacity for dismantling human trafficking organisations and for dealing with migrants in a dignified way in which their rights are respected."
"Finally this strategy must allow us to manage and organise the arrival of legitimate asylum seekers on Member States' territory more effectively by further integrating the development of refugee protection capacities in our cooperation with third countries."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago I went to Lampedusa and Malta."
"I must say that I was able to see and hear for myself the tragedies of those people who are encouraged in this way by unscrupulous smugglers to risk their lives by crossing maritime areas."
"I think I can say that we must, in the light of this latest incident, take these problems very seriously and awaken an essential awareness in each of our Member States of the gravity, and growth too, of these phenomena, which are putting people's lives at risk in appalling conditions."
"This is why I would like to thank the European Parliament for having requested this statement from the Commission."
"I have made it to the best of my knowledge and belief, and I repeat before Parliament my personal commitment in the coming months to avoiding a repeat of such tragedies."
"Madam President, today we feel collective grief and sorrow for the death of so many immigrants who were hopeful, desperate, and also perhaps deceived."
"They are innocent victims of a situation that they did not choose, of circumstances that were imposed upon them."
"I know the problem well."
"The Mediterranean and the Atlantic Canary seaboard have become pathways towards a non-existent 'El Dorado' for many people who have nothing, full of risks in transit, and frustrations and penalties upon arrival."
"The European Union and the Member States have to be more sensitive to avoid such tragedies."
"We do a lot but it achieves nothing."
"The results are extremely harsh, as we have seen on the coasts of Libya, and must make us consider the limited effectiveness of our policies."
"There are no magic recipes for finding absolutely effective solutions to such tragedies, but there are persistent and determined policies."
"We have to encourage solid policies of cooperation with countries of origin and of transit; cooperation and collaboration must be two sides of the same coin."
"We need to better organise and publicise the benefits of legal immigration in a concerted way, even in times of crisis."
"We must collaborate and cooperate with the countries of origin and transit regarding the control of their borders, on the basis of detailed agreements."
"We must also hunt out traffickers from their networks with intelligence and specialised forces, and at the same time toughen up criminal laws in the destination countries."
"We need to better equip the External Borders Fund;"
"EUR 1 820 million over seven years is clearly an insufficient amount by any stretch of the imagination."
"We must also successfully strengthen Frontex, and ensure that the catalogue of equipment, CRATE (Centralised Record of Available Technical Equipment), is not a statement of intention, but rather an efficient tool for the coordinated control and surveillance of the critical pressure points of clandestine activity."
"Commissioner, Nautilus, Hermes and EUR 24 million mean more commitment and more equipment."
"We should stop saying 'we must', and so take on this tough responsibility, with or without global agreement."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about a loss of more than 500 lives: the greatest tragedy at sea since the Second World War."
"The numbers are shocking, and yet Europe and its governments seem distracted."
"Some countries, including Italy, thought they had protected themselves by signing bilateral agreements such as the recent treaty with Libya; that is not so."
"The agreement in question brings together very diverse issues, such as the recognition of crimes perpetrated during the colonial era, with promises of investment, in exchange for commitments to control migration."
"Today, it seems the very mirage of Italian investments in Libya is attracting thousands of young people from West Africa."
"It is easy to predict that if the promised USD 5 billion does not arrive, then it is people who will arrive."
"What can we say then about French interests in Niger, linked to the stockpiling of uranium, which is stirring up a war among the Tuareg and thus favouring the people traffickers?"
"What is more, all this is taking place in broad daylight, documented by journalists."
"What this means is that certain European governments are playing with fire."
"If all this does not change, and fast, if Europe does not decide to act with positive policies in keeping with our values, it will not be enough to mute the news as we are doing at present."
"The Mediterranean is becoming a mass grave, far from the rhetorical images that describe it."
"Let us remember though that this sea is linked to the fate of Europe itself."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I would also like to pay my respects to these latest victims of poverty, criminal exploitation and state cynicism."
"However, compassion is not enough."
"We need to see things as they really are."
"The reality, Mr President, is that the real southern borders of the European Union are no longer truly in Europe, they are now on the African continent."
"Once the boats have left African shores, the unfortunate passengers no longer have a choice, dare I say it, between death, if the conditions are adverse, or having the status of illegal immigrants, with the poverty that comes with it, if by chance they do reach European shores, before, in the majority of cases, being deported."
"These repeated tragedies will not stop until the European Union has the power and the will to negotiate real partnership agreements with the countries of origin and transit that include at least three elements: reliable border controls, but also, and above all, a significant supply of legal immigration and a substantial co-development section."
"Without these agreements, Mr President, the cemeteries of the sea are going to keep filling up for a long time to come, despite our flimsy and powerless bursts of compassion."
"Mr President, who were they?"
"How many were there?"
"Where had they come from?"
"Were there children, women, refugees?"
"Did coastguards hamper the boats' journey?"
"Did fishermen cross their path?"
"So many unanswered questions."
"The human cost of the tragedy is not known, but hundreds perished, joining the thousands of migrants who have drowned in the Mediterranean."
"Let us have the decency, as we do tonight, not to blame the weather."
"Hundreds of migrants have taken the route to exile in inhuman and highly dangerous conditions."
"Why is that?"
"It is because they are fleeing devastated regions, because the less dangerous routes are closed to them and because they have not given up hope for life."
"Yes, it is indeed the anti-immigration mechanisms that encourage migrants to take increasingly risky routes to flee the desolation of their countries that are the cause."
"Was it not the forthcoming announcement of joint patrols in Italy and Libya that hastened the departure of boats to Europe in recent weeks?"
"Yes, Europe's obsession with shoring up its borders and its determination to focus the weight of its administration on third countries that destroy freedom, are lethal."
"The overemphasis on law and order, the patrols and the barbed wired fences will not overcome their desire to escape."
"So the question is this: is Europe ready to take responsibility for the consequences of such a choice?"
"No, it is not, and this is why I am asking the Commission and the Member States:"
"firstly, to do everything in their power to find and, if possible, rescue the people who have disappeared at sea, and to investigate the circumstances of this wreck;"
"secondly, to reaffirm international maritime law, which makes it mandatory to provide assistance to anyone in distress, while the seven Tunisian fishermen are still on trial;"
"thirdly, to halt all negotiations on migration issues with countries that do not provide any guarantees of respect for human rights;"
"fourthly, to respect the right of every human being to leave any country and ask for international protection in any country."
"You are right, the people who disappeared at sea are not illegal migrants;"
"fifthly, to put an end to the restrictive visa policy, which is often arbitrary and unfair;"
"and lastly, to closely examine, from the point of view of development in third countries, all the European Union's policies, including the predation of mining resources, agricultural dumping, free-trade agreements, trade in weapons and indulgent cooperation with autocrats."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what happened the other day is just the latest in a long line of shameful tragedies that have assumed mammoth dimensions."
"The death at sea of emigrants trying to reach our shores is without a shadow of a doubt the greatest violation of life wrought in civilised Europe."
"These tragedies demonstrate the terrible face of our fortress."
"Perhaps we ought to begin to think about our responsibility for the deaths of men and women whose sole ambition was to find a better life and escape hunger and war."
"Therefore, we should probably analyse the fact that those shipwrecked in the Mediterranean are not an anomaly of a mechanism that creates illegal immigration; rather they are a foreseeable consequence of the immigration policy of the European Union and its Member States."
"The slaughter in the Mediterranean is caused by the philosophy of repression, by the policies of turning people back at sea, by the virtual barbed wire along our coasts, by the prohibitionist practices implemented in the immigration policy of the European Union and its Member States, including Italy and Malta."
"There is no other way to enter Europe; there are no legal channels for accessing the European labour market or finding recognition of the sacrosanct right of asylum."
"Hope is consigned to the stormy waves of the Mediterranean Sea; rights are delivered into the hands of unscrupulous boatmen, who have become the only means, or at least the most accessible means, to enter the European Union."
"That is the real cause of the deaths off the coast of Libya a few days ago."
"That is the reason why, in the last 20 years, tens of thousands of migrants have died in an attempt to reach Europe; faceless, nameless men and women reduced to food for the fishes."
"I asked President PÃ¶ttering to open today's session with a minute's silence, as a sign of mourning in recognition of these victims."
"I thank him for granting my request."
"I think we had a duty to do this, but clearly it is not enough."
"It demonstrates our indignation, but we must try to produce a policy in this House, a concrete policy, that begins to say never again, never again must there be deaths in the Mediterranean."
"Mr President, I will be brief."
"What is important is to take action, and I echo what Mr Deprez said."
"We do need to move towards this global approach, towards partnership agreements, because we will not succeed in solving the problems unilaterally."
"I am quite happy to admit, as you pointed out, that as Europeans we have responsibilities."
"Also, on the issue of legal migration, we need to demonstrate a spirit of openness."
"We also need to fulfil our duty to receive people who are fleeing persecution and war."
"However, having said that, allow me to say, and to remind Parliament quite truthfully that the responsibility also lies with a number of third countries with which negotiation is very difficult. Does that mean that we should give up on negotiating?"
"No!"
"For example, we need to ensure that Libya finally has an asylum system."
"We need to ensure that Libya can help us to stop a number of the smugglers, who force these poor people to take unnecessary risks."
"I have personally heard the Maltese authorities saying that Libya allowed a number of boats to depart in awful conditions and that subsequently the Maltese navy was forced to go out and find and save the poor people who were being exploited by the smugglers."
"So we do need to take responsibility, but at the same time we need to demonstrate a degree of firmness in our negotiations with a number of states that are not fulfilling their international obligations."
"I think that is enough to get us all working together to prevent such tragic incidents from reoccurring."
"The debate is closed."
"Community Code on Visas (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Henrik Lax, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on Visas - C6-0254/2006 -."
"rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, the Community Code on Visas seeks to harmonise and clarify the visa procedure throughout the Schengen area."
"Everyone applying for a visa should be treated equally, irrespective of the Schengen consulate he or she turns to."
"Good administrative practice and a dignified reception should be guaranteed and the entry of genuine travellers should be facilitated."
"Rules concerning the introduction of the requirement for holders of visas to give their fingerprints and the option of relocating the reception and processing of visa applicants were already approved on a previous occasion in a separate report tabled by Baroness Ludford."
"These rules have been included in the Community Code as an integral part of this Code."
"Thank you, Sarah, for your close cooperation."
"(SV) This proposed regulation should be established by means of the codecision procedure between Parliament and the Council."
"After work that has taken nearly three years and that has required intensive negotiations with the Council, I am pleased, as rapporteur, to now be able to table a compromise proposal, which the Council has approved and which I hope will win the approval of Parliament."
"I would like to say a special thank you to the shadow rapporteurs Mrs Klamt, Mr Cashman, Mrs Å½danoka and Mrs Kaufmann for their very constructive cooperation and strong support in the negotiations."
"Without the support of a unanimous committee, Parliament would not have achieved such a good result in the negotiations."
"I would also like to extend my thanks to the Commission, which tabled a sound initial proposal that was gratifying to develop further. My thanks also go to the French and Czech Presidencies, both of which demonstrated the will to recognise the problems that Parliament wished to address and the ability to meet Parliament half way."
"With the Commission's proposal as a starting point, all of the compromises represented improvements on the current situation and it proved possible to resolve the most difficult issues with the French Presidency even before Christmas."
"Of course, the whole preparation and negotiation process would never have succeeded without the splendid work carried out by my own able staff and that of my colleagues, the committee secretariat and the officials from the political groups."
"I would like to extend a particularly warm thank you to them."
"The three most important results that we have achieved are: firstly, that a multiple-entry visa not only can, but must, be issued when certain agreed criteria are met; secondly, that the Member States have undertaken to enter into an agreement to represent each other, so that no one applying for a visa need make disproportionately difficult journeys in order to reach a competent Schengen consulate; and, thirdly, that a common website is to be set up to provide a unified picture of the Schengen area and to provide information regarding the rules applying to the granting of visas."
"The fact that the visa fee could not be reduced from EUR 60 to EUR 35 is disappointing."
"However, this disappointment is assuaged by the fact, for example, that children under the age of six and persons under the age of 25 representing organisations in seminars, sports activities or cultural events will receive their visa free of charge."
"I would like to finish by saying that this reform introduces two instruments that will be very important factors in the uniform application of the Schengen rules actually becoming a reality, namely the visa information system, which is a database covering all of the Schengen countries and which will provide the consulates with information in real time on who has applied for a visa, who has been granted a visa, who has had his or her application for a visa rejected and which visas have been withdrawn, and renewed local institutional cooperation between the Schengen consulates in different countries."
"Mr President, the Commission welcomes the considerable efforts made by Parliament and also, to some extent, by the Council."
"These efforts should enable us to reach an agreement at first reading."
"Given the consensus confirmed by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in mid-March and COREPER a few days before, I think that this agreement has now been definitively reached."
"Although the text is not perfect and does not meet with all of our initial ambitions, the Commission unreservedly supports the compromise."
"We need to acknowledge and commend the efforts made by the European Parliament to reach an agreement on this proposal at first reading and before the end of the current legislature."
"This regulation will make the rules on issuing visas clearer, not only for applicants but also for the Member States."
"These rules will also be applied in a more harmonised way."
"The Commission is pleased that the obligation to give reasons for decisions to refuse visas and grant the right of appeal to refused applicants has remained practically unchanged from the text of the initial proposal, thanks to the support of the European Parliament."
"These procedural guarantees will prevent decisions to refuse visas from being seen as arbitrary."
"If this agreement were called into question, we would have to continue to live with the deficiencies, such as the inconsistencies in the current rules, to the great dissatisfaction of everyone."
"I would like to express my satisfaction with the compromise that has been negotiated, which is going to remedy the deficiencies and inconsistencies of the current rules."
"I would of course like to thank Mr Henrik Lax and Parliament."
"I am convinced that this new code on visas will greatly benefit those who are travelling in good faith."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the Community Code on Visas will mean that, in future, Schengen visas - visas for stays of up to three months - will be issued according to established uniform criteria in the Schengen area."
"This step is urgently needed in a European Union with open borders."
"At the same time, Member States' responsibility for processing visa applications is clarified."
"As a rule, applicants must contact the Member State in which their main destination is located."
"My group welcomes the fact that the requirement and the procedure for issuing entry visas will speed up entry for large numbers of people."
"This way, business travellers entering the EU will be treated fairly and, moreover, holidaymakers from all round the world - by far the largest group of travellers to the EU - will benefit."
"Thus we have not only made it possible to process visa applications quickly but also ensured that security screening prevents abuses."
"With its balance between security and facilitating entry, the Visa Information System affords Member States instant, direct access to all the relevant data in connection with the issuing of visas."
"Thus the examination of applications is being simplified while, at the same time, the issuing of visas will provide greater security in future thanks to the use of biometric identifiers; that is, photograph and fingerprints."
"The compromise struck between rapporteur Mr Lax and the Council takes account of Parliament's original position and also has the support of the broad majority of my group."
"I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate my sincere thanks to Mr Lax for his commitment and his excellent cooperation over the last three years on this very complex dossier, which puts European visa policy on a new footing."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Lax for the exceptional work that he has undertaken."
"I am pleased to say that, on behalf of the Socialist Group, we will be supporting his report in its entirety."
"We are also pleased that we have achieved most of our objectives."
"I am also pleased that, working with you, Henrik, you have shown the imagination that is absolutely necessary for a brilliant legislator, which is to put yourself in the position of the person seeking to use the service."
"That is the way you have approached this in its entirety."
"It is why you looked at the one-stop shop, the Internet, the multi-entry visas and the reduction on visas for people under 25 - I only wish I could avail myself of that privilege - and approached it by asking how we can make this work for the citizen."
"This is a brilliant example for the rest of the House."
"We often approach things by putting forward amendments, which may improve the text and may have coherence, but does it serve the citizen?"
"That has always been your approach."
"I am pleased to say that we have the multiple-entry visas."
"We also have the whole issue of appeal."
"I worked with - to name a member of the DG - Jan on this very important principle, namely that, if you are refused a visa, or you are refused entry into the Schengen area, your appeal may not be suspensive, but the authority that refuses must make itself accountable."
"I wish to thank the rapporteur once again, and to thank the Commission for making sure that we have that principle enshrined here."
"I have nothing more to say other than to thank my staff and to thank your staff - and particularly Renaud, who is in the public gallery."
"Without our staff, we could never do the job that we do so well."
"It has been a brilliant three-year love affair and, like most short-term love affairs, I am pleased to see it coming to an end."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, my regulation on biometric visas is now being incorporated in this new visa code, so I feel I have a little bit of ownership of it."
"It will work with the Visa Information System, for which I was the rapporteur."
"The whole result not only improves the security of visas, but, as others have said, also convenience for visa applicants."
"That was Mr Cashman's aim for the Borders Code."
"So I feel that MEPs have delivered on those two aims."
"I hope that biometrics improving the reliability of the link between the applicant and the document will mean that fewer people get turned away unjustifiably."
"Mr Lax has worked strongly, as Mr Cashman said, on improving service for applicants, and thus the image of the EU."
"Ninety-nine point nine per cent of people who want to come to the EU want to do so for trade, travel and tourism, and we want them to, as it is good for business, but, if they get a poor service and are handled badly, then they will not feel warmly about the EU."
"Mr Lax has done a great job."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, we are grateful to Mr Lax for his best efforts to achieve a compromise in such an ambitious project."
"The Greens/EFA Group still believes that the amendment suggested by Parliament would be the best solution."
"For example, there could be - and there will be - practical problems while dealing with the main destination, instead of our proposal to provide free choice when applying for visas."
"The Council has agreed to the obligation of the Member States to cooperate only."
"Unfortunately, the visa fee will be EUR 60 instead of the EUR 35 suggested by Parliament."
"Hopefully there are a number of waivers and reductions for children, students and active youth."
"Although it was not possible to achieve a compromise on issuance of multiple-entry visas by default, at least we have now an obligation to issue such visas in certain cases."
"The right to appeal against a negative decision is also a big step forward."
"Now, in many Member States, such a right does not exist."
"As a human rights activist in my previous life I especially thank Mr Lax for this provision."
"Of course, for my group, incorporation in the report on visas of the report on biometrics looked like a fly in the ointment."
"We are against such a wide introduction of biometrics."
"Still, we see some improvements in the visa policy, and therefore we will support this report."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to start by offering my sincere thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Lax, for his work."
"From the outset, he worked very closely with all the shadow rapporteurs and, thanks to his commitment, undoubtedly obtained the best possible result from the Council."
"The Community Code on Visas is necessary to render more uniform the processing of short-stay Schengen visas and, above all, to improve visa-issuing service and thus the perception of the European Union in third countries."
"Following more than three years' work on the Community Code on Visas and complicated negotiations with the Council, it has finally proved possible to reach a compromise."
"Although, unfortunately, some of Parliament's demands could not be pushed through, the Community Code on Visas still contains numerous improvements, for example with regard to cooperation between Member States."
"Above all, it makes things easier for applicants, providing them with more legal certainty and creating transparency."
"It is particularly important that any rejection of a visa application must be justified in future, and that all applicants will have the right to appeal against the rejection of their application."
"Regrettably, however, the visa fee is unchanged at EUR 60."
"Even if, in future, a larger number of people are exempted from the visa fee, this EUR 60 fee is likely to be unaffordable for a significant number of third-country nationals and thus, unfortunately, to mean that people are unable to travel to the European Union."
"Finally, I should like to reiterate my thanks to the rapporteur and all my fellow Members for their excellent cooperation over the last few years and to congratulate Mr Lax on his report."
"(RO) The Community Code on Visas incorporates the procedures and conditions for issuing Schengen visas to Member States and harmonises the existing provisions concerning decisions to refuse, extend or annul these visas."
"It is important that Member States which do not have their own consulate in a third country are represented by another Member State which has diplomatic or consular representation in the relevant third country."
"The code must take into account bilateral agreements signed by the Community, especially with countries involved in the European Union's neighbourhood and partnership policy in order to facilitate the processing of visa applications and apply simplified procedures."
"I believe that the right of Member States to cooperate with commercial intermediaries will not be of any great help in simplifying the procedures for handling visa applications."
"The reason for this is that according to the code, visa applicants must present themselves in person when they submit their first application so that their biometric data can be registered."
"There is also the possibility that any visa applicant can be called for an interview when considering granting a Schengen visa."
"The purpose of the Schengen visa code is for the European Union to present a united external front, to treat visa applicants equally and set out clear exemption criteria and rules for a number of third countries."
"In this context, I think that it is appropriate for me to remind you that the European Union must do its utmost to ensure that its Member States are treated equally by third countries which apply visa exemptions only for certain Member States."
"We simply cannot have two classes of European citizens when they want to travel, for instance, to Australia or the United States."
"Mr President, I would like to respond to Mr Marinescu that I am of course working to secure reciprocity from third countries, and that my recent trip to Washington was partly related to this issue."
"As for the rest, I am very happy because I believe that Mr Lax has done a very good job and that he has been rewarded with very broad approval."
"I would like to add that obviously we also have a strategy aimed at facilitating the obtaining of visas with a number of countries, and I am placing a great deal of hope in the development of this strategy in order to facilitate the granting of visas as far as possible, in particular to young people from third countries, because I think that we have every interest in facilitating the entry of young people into Europe."
"Thank you for this good approach, which has enabled us to conclude this text and thus to bring a new quality to visa policy that will be very much appreciated."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 2 April 2009."
"Evaluation of the driving hours and rest periods (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission with regard to the evaluation of driving hours and rest periods."
"Mr President, I am going to read the Commission's statement on the evaluation of driving hours and rest periods."
"Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 entered into force on 11 April 2007, about two years ago, replacing the rules on driving hours and rest periods that had remained unchanged for more than twenty years."
"Since it was adopted, the Commission has been actively monitoring its application, including through several meetings with the Member States, industry and unions, in the committee and in various working groups created by the committee."
"Soon the Commission is going to publish the biannual report on the implementation of social rules."
"One of the preliminary conclusions is that the efforts and investment made by the Member States in terms of monitoring should be increased in order to reach the levels required by European legislation."
"The initiatives taken by the Commission include the guidelines, which will be published in agreement with the Member States and aim to ensure harmonised application of the rules on driving hours and rest periods, for example in cases in which a driver has to interrupt his rest period due to an emergency."
"The Commission is also working actively on improving the digital tachograph."
"In January, a package of measures to increase the safety of the system was adopted."
"The Member States must therefore develop specific equipment to monitor the tachograph."
"A second package of measures to adapt the technical specifications for the tachograph is currently being discussed in committee procedure."
"These measures will make it easier for drivers to use tachographs by simplifying the manual entries."
"The Commission concludes from this observation of the application of the Regulation that, over the last two years, the new legislation on driving hours and rest periods has been a success."
"Therefore, the Commission, in agreement with the Member States, has just convinced the countries that are signed up to the AETR (international road transport) Agreement to take on these new rules from 2010."
"However, the Member States do of course have to ensure that these social rules are applied in a harmonised way in Europe."
"This is what I had to say to Parliament on behalf of the Commission, and I am going to listen closely to the comments from the various MEPs."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, there was some confusion today about this Commission statement, but it is clear that the oral questions tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats formed the basis for today's statement."
"The oral questions stemmed from the great concern that exists, despite the Commission's efforts, about the practical implementation of this Regulation."
"If I drive for one more minute in a country because I need to move my car, I could be faced with sky-high fines in a different country weeks later."
"This is one example of the problems encountered by drivers and transport companies."
"It can cause enormous problems, for example, if you drive just a couple of kilometres further to reach a safe car park (as all car parks are overflowing in Europe) or to reach a good car park for the night."
"I am pleased that you have launched a number of actions and also that you are going to present your report."
"I would request that, in this report, you look not only at the introduction of the provisions but also at the Regulation itself, and that you proceed to a wide-ranging evaluation that gives the sector the opportunity to raise with you the concerns I have just discussed."
"A wide-ranging evaluation is what is required, therefore, so that we can look at where improvements can be made."
"Indeed, the disadvantage of these guidelines as I understand it is that, thus far, they have no legal force in the Member States."
"If drivers rely on these guidelines they could be left empty-handed, as these are not legally valid - and that is a problem."
"Commissioner Barrot, given your knowledge of the matter, I am pleased that you are replacing Commissioner Tajani today, and I sincerely hope that you are able to promise us this wide-ranging evaluation."
"The European regulations governing working time, driving time and rest periods for transport operators refer not only to social conditions in the road transport sector, but especially to road safety as well."
"Unfortunately, the European Union has not managed to do enough to reduce traffic accidents."
"Member States admittedly need to improve the controls which they apply to transport in transit."
"As rapporteur for social conditions, I have examined the first report compiled by the European Commission, which ought to have been produced twice yearly."
"It was unfortunately delayed, but I noticed from that report that some Member States have exceeded in practice the minimum rate of checks they had to carry out, while other Member States have not fulfilled these obligations."
"I am pleased that in Mr Grosch's report on market access we have managed, along with the Council of the European Union, to produce a compromise text, namely, we have requested for all traffic checks not to be discriminatory, based either on the nationality or country of residence of the transport operator."
"Commissioner, we certainly need safe parking areas."
"There was a draft report for the construction of safe parking areas at the border between the European Union and Russia but, unfortunately, these parking areas are not sufficient."
"Member States must invest more in safe parking areas as, regrettably, 40% of robberies carried out on transport operators take place in parking areas."
"We have also made an amendment to the budget so that we can allocate money for the construction of safe parking areas."
"I believe that the conditions governing driving time and rest periods can only be met if we create conditions for transport operators which allow these provisions to be fulfilled."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, my colleague from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats said that the sector is very concerned that, if someone drives for just one minute too long, he or she may have to pay up weeks later."
"Regrettably - from my point of view - I can put her mind at rest."
"Firstly, checks in the Member States are very permeable, with most Member States taking lightly or disregarding their monitoring obligation."
"Secondly, criminal prosecution in this field is still in its infancy even though the state of affairs is disastrous."
"When, for example, a driver who has been working for 38 hours without a break is stopped on the Inntal motorway, no one can tell me he has failed to find a car park; instead, there is often pressure from employers for drivers to keep going until they are ready to drop."
"This is dangerous for all the other road users."
"I need not go into detail about the gravity of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles."
"This is also a concern for local residents, of course, as some of these vehicles may also be carrying dangerous goods, which then cause damage."
"Therefore, I think it extremely necessary and important that there be proper monitoring in this area - it is essential!"
"Secondly, I think that particularly with the introduction of digital tachographs, there is now such a long history of implementation in the Member States that the time is coming, slowly but surely, to enable those wishing to perform monitoring - for the benefit of drivers, local residents, other road users and road safety in general - to do so more effectively at long last."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, the functioning of the Regulation on driving time and rest periods is on the plenary agenda at long last."
"Since the Regulation entered into force, complaints have been pouring in about the application of this Regulation - 'unclear' and 'unreasonable' are words often heard."
"Action must be taken on this score."
"The Regulation must be reviewed, and quickly."
"What needs to be improved?"
"The legislation must be predictable."
"I am not advocating the harmonisation of all the sanctions."
"This must remain a competence of the Member States."
"What I am advocating, however, is a clear, predictable, reasonable system."
"This is the only way to get away from fines that are absurdly high and unreasonable, and involve extremely lengthy settlement procedures."
"There is evidently scope under the current legislation for a discriminatory approach to foreign lorry drivers, in particular, on Europe's roads, which is unacceptable."
"This problem quite simply represents a serious distortion of the internal market."
"Finally, a brief example of the absurdity of the current Regulation on driving time and rest periods."
"A driver travelling through France was fined EUR 750 for falling 15 minutes short of his full rest period."
"What is more, it took six hours to settle the fine."
"This meant that the driver was unable to load and unload that day, with all the associated consequences."
"This brought the real loss suffered as a result of the fine for the 15-minute violation to approximately EUR 1 750."
"The Commission must take a much firmer line against Member States guilty of such distortions of the internal market."
"As a Dutchman, I am thinking primarily in a southerly direction."
"(RO) It is vital for car drivers to comply with regulations on driving hours and rest periods in order to maintain a high level of safety on Europe's roads and protect passengers."
"The European Commission adopted a package of measures in January 2009 to prevent tachograph misuse and reinforce Member States' options for verifying compliance with the regulations on driving time and rest periods."
"These measures are welcome given the numerous problems which have arisen over time with systems for registering working time, primarily to do with digital tachographs, as well as due to the fact that existing legislative provisions have been regarded as inflexible and difficult to enforce."
"I believe that one of the most important aspects which the Commission must bear in mind is the value of transposing Directive No 22/2006 into Member States' national legislations and the harmonisation of national provisions drafted as a result of Article 19 of Regulation No 561/2006."
"Romania has fulfilled its obligations on these counts, but there are still Member States which have not completed this process, thereby resulting in problems in enforcing sanctions properly, on a cross-border basis, and in collecting fines arising from law infringements."
"Bearing in mind the six-monthly reports from Member States during this last reference period and the numerous difficulties indicated by carriers, I call on the European Commission to examine the possibility of revising Regulation No 561/2006."
"(PL) Mr President, we are discussing rest periods and working hours for road transport drivers in the midst of an economic crisis."
"Thousands of vehicles are standing idle because there are no jobs for them."
"The same applies to drivers."
"In addition, a great many firms are on the point of becoming financially unviable."
"Mr Jarzembowski, Mrs Wortmann-Kool and the other Members responsible for this question were quite right to raise the following three issues, namely the complexity of the system, its reliability or otherwise, and the practice of imposing the restrictions that has applied to date."
"There is no scientific evidence to suggest that more flexible implementation, which in specific circumstances could even permit extending working time in a particular week, would impact negatively on road safety, especially when traffic is decreasing."
"By contrast, it is more than likely that the future of this sector will be threatened by strict implementation of the restrictions, and also by the imposition of the accompanying new burdens on road transport."
"I should like to refer in particular to the Eurovignette and to the internalisation of external costs."
"The subject is indeed worthy of debate and I would welcome the Commission's views on it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened carefully to what everyone has said."
"I would say that this regulation is in its 'running in' period - since we are talking about transport - and that it is obviously very important for road safety and for social reasons too."
"I would like to give a little reassurance to those who have expressed the concerns of the profession."
"The Commission is aware of the gradual implementation of the regulation adopted by the European Parliament and the Council."
"It is in contact with the social partners, the experts in the Member States, so that the regulation can gradually be harmonised in accordance with the need for interpretation."
"It is true that the Commission adopted, on 30 January 2009, a directive harmonising the definitions of infringement, and that, with regard to penalties, it intends to publish a report on this subject, as required by Article 10 of Directive 2006/22."
"This report will show that fines are different in different Member States, but also in relation to the way infringements are categorised."
"That, then, is the first point."
"In answer to Mrs Wortmann-Kool, who mentioned the need for drivers to find a safe place to park and fought for more such places, I would say that the regulation makes it possible to drive for a longer period in order to find a safe place to park."
"It is true that Mr Liberadzki has just said that we should not place too many constraints on the sector, but you know too that the purpose is to allow this sector to avoid safety risks, and this is a way of giving drivers some protection against certain risks that they take."
"Mrs Lichtenberger reminded us of the importance of these provisions for road safety."
"Mr Marinescu, I think we are constantly trying to evaluate implementation, but it is true that, for the time being, we cannot discuss legislative provisions again."
"We have to allow time for these regulations to create new habits, habits which, I am convinced, will be beneficial for the whole sector, insofar as they will harmonise working conditions a little better, by ensuring both respect for drivers' private lives and better safety."
"That is all I have to say."
"I shall, of course, pass on your comments to my friend, Mr Tajani, so that he can ensure that this evaluation continues at grass-roots level and in the light of all the observations that have been made and, in particular, Mr President, of the pertinent remarks made this evening by the different MEPs who have spoken."
"The debate is closed."
"Establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Community procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin, repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 and amending Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15079/2/2008 - C6-0005/0009 - (Rapporteur: Avril Doyle)."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, could I start by thanking all my shadow rapporteurs, and indeed the French Presidency for facilitating an early second-reading agreement?"
"This is a rather technical proposal as it aims to update the existing EU regime, the main purpose of which is to protect public health by limiting the exposure of consumers of food of animal origin to residues of pharmacologically active substances present in veterinary medicines and biocidal products."
"This is achieved by setting safety thresholds or maximum residue levels (MRLs) for approved substances and by banning substances which are either found to be unsafe or in respect of which a safety profile cannot be scientifically established."
"MRLs alone do not protect consumers."
"Consumers are directly protected by setting an appropriate withdrawal period before slaughter and by having controls in place to monitor it."
"In practice the withdrawal periods are set using a high safety factor which will reflect the amount of data available at the current stage of product development."
"We have reached an agreement on the key issues."
"First of all, extrapolation of MRLs set for one species to another; secondly, adopting within the EU MRLs set internationally within the Codex Alimentarius; and, thirdly, creating a framework setting MRLs for food imported from third countries."
"We managed to clarify the measures which need to be taken when unauthorised substances are found either in EU-produced food or in food imported from third countries, as well as clarifying the basis for reviewing these reference points for action (RPAs): that is, the maximum level established for control purposes for any unauthorised substance in the light of any new data."
"The question of setting MRLs for certain biocidal products such as disinfectants used in the animal environment was also agreed on, particularly in regard to the financing aspects of their authorisation and their dossiers."
"The establishing of an MRL for a pharmacologically active substance requires an expensive data package of toxicology and metabolism studies."
"This is too costly for certain less common food species, so-called 'minor species', as the market for veterinary medicines for these is small - so-called 'minor uses'."
"Setting an MRL is the first step that must be accomplished before an application can be submitted to the regulatory authorities for authorisation of a veterinary medicine for a food-producing species containing a pharmacologically active substance."
"So this Minor Use/Minor Species (MUMS) issue is a problem urgently in need of resolution as it creates potential animal welfare and food safety issues."
"Vets have a duty of care and will always try to treat a sick animal."
"Under present legislation they are often forced to resort to unlicensed medicines."
"The lack of an MRL also prevents authorities from being able to establish a proper withdrawal period for a medicine."
"The current MRL Regulation does not require MRLs to be set for individual species."
"The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP) sets MRLs for individual species, following an initial cautious approach."
"In 1997 and following five years' experience, the CVMP reviewed all the MRLs that had been set and concluded that it was not necessary to set MRLs for individual species as the MRLs for a particular substance are nearly always similar or identical."
"That same year, the CVMP issued a guideline on the establishment of MRLs for minor species."
"It defined minor food-producing species as all species except cattle, pigs and poultry, and they included salmonidae."
"It allowed the extrapolation from a major species to a minor species of the same family, ruminant to ruminant, fish to fish, chicken to other poultry."
"In 2008, after eight years' experience, the CVMP issued a new guideline. The Risk Analysis approach for residues of veterinary medicinal products in food of animal origin."
"This describes a risk-based approach of extrapolation of an MRL for a substance from one or more species to additional species."
"This guideline allows the extrapolation of MRLs from data on the three major species to all species, provided the MRLs set for the three major species are similar or identical."
"The text of this review before us simply provides a legal basis for the current practice of extrapolation in the interests of veterinary medicines availability and animal welfare."
"Two amendments specifically target the lack of availability of species-specific medicines for equidae (I must declare an interest) across a range of therapeutic and welfare needs, including the concept of 'clinical benefit' and not just the requirement that it is 'essential' to have a medicinal product added to the positive list of substance for equidae referred to in the Veterinary Medicines Directive."
"In clearly defined circumstances, certain products used for equidae will not have to have MRLs but will have to respect a six-month withdrawal period."
"Perhaps there is a declaration - may I ask through the Chair - that the Commissioner is going to put on the record: I recall a discussion in relation to this issue some months ago concerning a review of the Veterinary Medicines Directive."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, the revision of the legislation on residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin is an important initiative for the European Commission."
"Its aim is to protect consumers against residues of medicinal products in foodstuffs whilst also improving the availability of veterinary medicinal products in the Community."
"It is also an important component of the Commission's legislative simplification programme."
"On 21 October of last year, the Council and Parliament concluded an agreement that is reflected in the present common position."
"Therefore, we now have a common position of not only the Council and Parliament but also the Commission."
"I am delighted that the Commission was able to incorporate the amendments from both the European Parliament and the Council, as they retain both the spirit and the substance of the original Commission proposal."
"Thus, the Commission expressed its full support for the common position in its communication to the European Parliament of 8 January of this year."
"The adoption of the common position will now make it possible to bring this dossier to a successful conclusion before the end of this parliamentary term."
"Concluding it on the basis of the present common position will enable those involved with food controls and veterinary medicinal products on a daily basis to do a better job in the interests of animal health and consumer protection in the Community."
"These people have been waiting for the revision of the legislation on residue limits very impatiently for a very long time, and I think they really have waited long enough now, and can all be pleased that a solution has now been found."
"I am very much aware of the particular importance of the availability of veterinary medicinal products."
"Therefore, irrespective of the progress that the present Regulation on residue limits of pharmacologically active substances already represents in this regard, the Commission will present an assessment of the problems entailed in the application of the Directive on veterinary medicinal products in 2010 and, where appropriate, will also present new legislative proposals on this."
"I should like to take this opportunity to express my special thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Doyle, whose truly tireless efforts have enabled us to reach agreement on this important matter. Sincere thanks once again for your excellent work, Mrs Doyle."
"Doyle report"
"The Commission is aware of concerns expressed by citizens, veterinarians, Member States and the animal health industry as regards the directive laying down the rules for the authorisation of veterinary medicinal products, in particular the importance of addressing existing problems linked to the availability of veterinary medicines and the use of medicinal products in species for which they are not authorised and any disproportionate regulatory burden hampering innovation, whilst ensuring a high level of consumer safety with respect to food of animal origin."
"The Commission points out that positive steps are being taken in this direction such as the simplification of the rules on variations of veterinary medicinal products and this review of the legislation on maximum residue limits in food."
"In addition, in order to address the objectives of consumer safety and animal health protection, competitiveness of the veterinary industry including SMEs and reduction of administrative burden, the Commission will present in 2010 an assessment of the problems in the application of the veterinary medicinal products directive with a view to making, where appropriate, legal proposals."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing."
"(HU) We often hear the complaint that the EU tries to regulate everything while at the same time failing to address important questions."
"Many of us may think that this report is also of this nature. This would be a mistake, however."
"For in this case, we are talking about 'foodstuffs' consumed by human beings - this is what we would like to render more secure in the interests of our citizens."
"The existing regulations are out of date, and make it problematic for veterinarians to restock their store of medicines."
"For this reason, appropriate regulation for the distinctive features of this branch is needed."
"Nowadays more and more pharmaceutical companies have a division dealing with animal products, which generate considerable revenue."
"The demand is growing steadily, as animals also fall ill, and now, when food is increasingly valuable, it is worth preventing this."
"Yet in recent times, several pieces of information have come to our attention to the effect that certain companies are working on how to 'obtain' more from animals. Rapidly growing chickens, pigs that are fattened to enormous size in a matter of months."
"All this in done with (medicinal) products which are often harmful to human beings."
"This is why every single preparation that is given to animals must be tested, in collaboration with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), to determine whether or not residues of such products that remain in the animals and are later consumed by human beings present any danger."
"The testing is paid for by the company."
"We also need to emphasise the possibility of a fast-track procedure, which reduces the time needed for administration, and it is also important that veterinarians thus have much more rapid access to the medicinal products."
"Nothing is more important that human health, and therefore we need to erect a barrier to'animal doping' motivated by monetary gain."
"Educating the children of migrants (short presentation)"
"The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Takkula, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on educating the children of migrants."
"rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, it is the ethical obligation of the European Union to ensure that everyone, including the children of migrants, has the right to a good education."
"Each child must have the right to receive an education, which must be free and compulsory, at least at basic level."
"Children should be able to receive a general education that fosters equal opportunities to develop their abilities - their individual power of discernment and sense of moral and social responsibility - so that they might grow as well-balanced, responsible members of society."
"Those responsible for the education and supervision of children should regard what is best for the child as their guiding principle."
"This of course starts in the home and with the parents, but schools and society also need to be in a supporting role in children's upbringing, thereby allowing pupils to develop their personalities more wholly."
"I have been concerned about the studies that have been recently published on the children of migrants."
"They suggest that in some places it has been very difficult for them to go to school and that in some societies efforts have been made to establish schools that cater exclusively for the children of migrants."
"The result has been, of course, that families have moved their children from the local school so that they would not need to be in the same school as the children of migrants."
"This is a regrettable situation and has led to very poor educational standards and school results among the children of migrants."
"Another outcome has been the very fast turnover of teaching staff in those schools with a high concentration of migrant children."
"This is not the development we had hoped for, and we must establish conditions where the children of migrants can integrate into society in the best possible way."
"We should also ensure that schools have adequate resources, by which I mean quantitative resources in terms of teaching staff and also financial resources, and we need to take responsibility for the development of teacher training and, furthermore, in-service teacher training."
"To be able to take care of migrant children in an integrated, sustainable way we need a comprehensive approach."
"We also need special investment and additional resources for teacher training and the entire educational system."
"I know that this is an issue that falls within the competence of each Member State, but it is also through transparent coordination on the part of the European Parliament and the European Union that we should encourage the Member States to act, because I believe that we all want migrant children to have a good education and be able to integrate into society."
"This way we can avoid the regrettable trend in social exclusion that we are witnessing today in the case of many migrant children."
"The fact is that this often leads to unemployment and, moreover, crime, as well as a lot of other unwanted consequences."
"It is also a matter of concern from the point of view of the free movement of labour within the European Union that people residing in the Member States of the EU will not want to move to another country or work abroad because it is impossible to arrange good, proper schooling and good quality teaching for their children there."
"That is why we need to focus attention on this issue and ensure that there is an adequate system of high-level, good quality education for every child and young person in each of the Member States of the European Union."
"Children and young people are our future - the most valuable asset we have."
"Their name is 'Today', not 'Tomorrow', and so I hope that we in the European Union will be able to share the common principle whereby every child has the right to an integrated, secure tomorrow and a good education."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I welcome this own-initiative report and, above all, on my own behalf and that of my colleague Commissioner Figel', wish to thank Mr Takkula, the rapporteur, and the Committee on Culture and Education for the work they have put in."
"The European Commission shares the honourable Member's belief that the growing number of children with a migrant background presents the education systems of the majority of our Member States with considerable challenges."
"Education is the key issue in the integration process."
"The acquisition of qualifications is indispensable if we want to ensure the future of our citizens in a knowledge-based society, a society increasingly subject to competition."
"Yet it is equally important that schools, as a social experiment, provide the basis for mutual knowledge and mutual understanding, which is crucial to improving our coexistence."
"Currently, however, pupils with a migrant background in Europe face great problems."
"Migrant children are often confronted with a twofold challenge: on the one hand, insufficient knowledge of the language of the host country and, on the other, a low socio-economic status."
"Compared to native pupils, many migrant children perform poorly at school and have higher school drop-out rates and lower rates of enrolment in higher education."
"Therefore, the report rightly emphasises the importance of giving migrant children proper help in learning the language of the host country, whilst also promoting their native languages and cultures."
"Participation in pre-primary education is also important, in order to achieve successful integration into education systems at an early stage and eliminate socio-economic and linguistic disadvantages."
"Teachers should, at all events, have the necessary qualifications, which are so important for a multicultural environment."
"Mobility should also be a key component of teacher training and professional development."
"I am delighted that there is such a broad consensus on these issues."
"I believe that we are also agreed that we now need to put our good intentions into practice and really improve the educational opportunities of migrant children."
"Thus we should support the Member States so as to ensure a high quality of education for all and, at the same time, actively prevent the socio-economic segregation of pupils."
"We should assist Member States in enabling schools to master the diverse requirements so as to turn the original challenge of the multicultural society and multilingualism into an advantage for these schools."
"Of course, the substance and organisation of school systems are purely national competences, and the Commission does not intend to encroach on these competences in any way."
"I must say, though, that the successful integration of migrant children is something that concerns Europe as a whole."
"We have a great deal to learn from one another, and we can learn a great deal from one another."
"We are sure that your report represents an important step towards showing what specific action can be taken to help the Member States in this field."
"The item is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - The topics of education and migration are closely related because both migration within the European Union and immigration into the EU have considerably increased over recent years and there are a number of issues that we should observe more carefully in the future."
"I also support the idea that the Directive 77/486/EC is outdated."
"Let us remember that this Directive dates from 1977 and the European Union has been changing ever since."
"To give just an example, my country (Romania) joined the EU over 20 years later, and I feel that this Directive does not offer a solution to our problems."
"The migration related issues have dramatically increased over recent years, and I support Mr Takkula's idea to amend this Directive."
"I would even go one step further and suggest there be a new Directive dealing with the education of the children of migrants."
"The growing rate of migration in the EU, including internally, has a number of important repercussions from a cultural, economic and social perspective."
"In this respect, it is vitally important to guarantee migrants equal opportunities and to focus greater attention on combating discrimination against them."
"On this point, the situation of the Roma, whose issues represent a special case and a degree of difficulty in a league of their own, speaks for itself."
"I also want to draw attention to the repercussions on labour force mobility from the difficulties experienced by the children of those working abroad in integrating into a foreign educational environment."
"For this reason, supporting the children's quickest possible integration may play an important role in preventing migrants becoming ghettoised, especially as it has been observed that the education level and social and economic situation of migrants' children are worse than those of the other children, hence the need for some impetus in this area."
"The better the conditions provided for them to integrate as quickly as possible into the foreign education environment, the greater their chances of success in their education and in the labour market."
"At the same time, however, learning the language of the host country and becoming locally assimilated must not mean abandoning their own cultural heritage."
"One of the European Union's basic principles is the freedom of movement, which allows citizens to work, study and travel to another country."
"It is important for us to consider the social integration of internal migrants as a responsibility for the whole of society."
"The education of migrants' children is a step in this direction."
"The education of migrants' children must be looked at from the perspective of improving how European society operates on a day-to-day basis and as cultural enrichment."
"With this in mind, I think that cooperation must be established between the host country and country of origin, whereby the country of origin is actively involved in preserving its language and culture."
"We support the introduction of immigrants' native language as a second foreign language into the host country's school curriculum where there are large immigrant communities."
"The recruitment of teaching staff from the relevant communities is one way for us to ensure that these children have contact with the culture of their country of origin and that the experiences derived from immigration are shared."
"The Commission's Green Paper raises a number of questions about one of the major issues which Member States are faced with at the moment: the education of migrants' children."
"There are a huge number of Romanian children who live with their families in other Member States and it is important for them to preserve their identity and to be offered the chance to study both the language of the country they are living in and their mother tongue."
"We must support tolerance and understanding and jointly find solutions to ensure education is provided in migrants' mother tongues."
"These children must have the same rights as other children."
"It is well known that their precarious economic situation can lead to isolation, dropping out of school and violence."
"This is precisely why we need to support Member States in finding solutions."
"Children are the most precious resource we have."
"They represent the future of our society, no matter what background they come from."
"Application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States (short presentation)"
"The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs VÄlean, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, of all the fundamental rights granted to EU citizens, the one that helps unite all of us the most is the right of freedom of movement in the European Union."
"That right, provided for in the Treaties, is implemented by Directive 2004/38/EC, which lays down both the conditions and the restrictions for EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the EU."
"As of 1 January 2006, over 8 million EU citizens have exercised this right to reside in another Member State, and millions more have used it to travel through the EU."
"As the European Parliament rapporteur on the evaluation of this Directive, I must say that the concrete application of the right of free movement for our citizens is seriously undermined by Member States which erect dams in breach of the Treaties and of the Directive."
"First, talking about the transposition by Member States, we can say it has been poor at best."
"The Commission, along with two separate studies commissioned by Parliament, points to a series of problems, some of them being breaches of the core rights of EU citizens."
"These problems are highlighted in my report."
"There are many unjustified administrative burdens, particularly for third-country-national family members, which include: entry requirements and lengthy procedural delays; a lack of recognition of free movement rights for certain registered partners, including those in same-sex relationships; public policy exceptions to serve economic or security aims which ignore the principle of proportionality, resulting in abuses of expulsion orders; and discrimination against certain nationals and ethnic communities in relation to the rights they should be granted by the Directive."
"Second, to those who chose to focus solely on abuses and misuses of this right, I agree that these issues are important, but I say that Article 35 of the Directive already provides Member States with the possibility to fight against those abuses, such as marriages of convenience or fraud - one just has to implement it."
"I also want to mention that I have constructively cooperated with national parliaments, the Commission and the Committee on Legal Affairs rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, who all share my concern over the aforementioned transposition problems and the need for all parties to help to resolve them immediately."
"My report also calls for a number of measures aimed at providing solutions."
"One of the most important and immediate steps that must be taken is the creation by the Commission of comprehensive transposition guidelines."
"Those guidelines would serve to provide clarity in the interpretation of such notions as 'sufficient resources' and 'public security'."
"Once this has been done, it will be up to the Member States to implement those guidelines, preferably by the end of 2009."
"Discriminatory transitional agreements that restrict the movement of workers from Member States that joined the EU after 2004 must finally be repealed or revised."
"More funding must be allocated to help local integration measures for EU citizens residing in other Member States and, finally, the Commission must not hesitate to open infringement proceedings against Member States who are not complying with the Directive."
"We have to recognise that Member States need finally to correctly apply and transpose the Directive so that these and other problems are resolved expediently."
"They should not try to escape their duties in ensuring free movement by asking for a revision to water down the Directive."
"The European Parliament firmly opposes such revision and thanks the Commission for doing the same."
"It is time for the Member States and the Council to ensure that Europe is a place where not only capital, services and goods, but also our citizens, can circulate."
"Without free movement, there is no Europe."
"Let me conclude by saying that I shall move a revised oral amendment to a footnote in my report in order to take away any excuse for those who oppose free movement on a nationalistic, racist or xenophobic basis, but who do not dare to declare it openly, to vote against my report."
"With the roll-call vote tomorrow, we will see who supports Europe and European citizenship, free movement and citizens' rights without discrimination, and who does not."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I should like to offer the rapporteur my most sincere thanks for what is a remarkable report, and also thank her for her excellent, constructive cooperation in a very difficult and sensitive field."
"The free movement of persons is one of the most fundamental freedoms of the European internal market."
"This freedom lies behind the functioning of the internal market and thus also behind the competitiveness of the European economy."
"We must recognise quite clearly that shortcomings in the implementation of Community law in this field are indeed contrary to the fundamental principles constituting the foundation of Europe."
"This is an absolutely crucial issue, therefore."
"Thus I welcome this report, which supplements the Commission report adopted on 10 December 2008 on the application of Directive 2004/38/EC."
"I am pleased that virtually all the results of the EP report tally with those of the Commission report."
"I believe we now have a complete picture of the Member States' transposition and application of the Directive on the ground, and I think that the time has now come for real action."
"The report emphasises - quite rightly - that responsibility for the proper transposition and application of the Directive lies with the Member States."
"It does call on the Commission to take action in certain fields, however."
"Allow me to explain, therefore, where the Commission's immediate priorities lie in this connection."
"The Commission sets great store by the complete, correct application of the Directive."
"This is one of the priorities of the 25th annual report from the Commission on monitoring the application of Community law (2009)."
"The Commission will continue to make efforts to ensure that the Directive is properly transposed and applied throughout the European Union."
"In the coming months, we shall be holding bilateral meetings with Member States to discuss the extremely numerous cases of faulty transposition and application."
"If no satisfactory progress can be achieved, the Commission will not hesitate to open infringement proceedings against the Member States concerned immediately."
"The Commission intends to offer information and assistance to both Member States and the citizens themselves."
"One way in which this is to be done is by issuing guidelines on a series of issues that have proved problematic in relation to the transposition or application of the Directive, for example those of expulsion and tackling abuses."
"The guidelines will also deal with issues recognised as problematic in Parliament's report."
"The Commission will continue to work together with Member States at the technical level in the experts' groups to define difficulties and clarify interpretation issues in relation to the Directive."
"Nevertheless, I must say at this point, Mrs VÄlean, that the Commission cannot endorse proposal No 23."
"This proposal envisages on-the-spot visits by teams of experts and the introduction of a mutual evaluation system based on these visits."
"I must draw your attention to the fact that such peer reviews are usually carried out under the third pillar but not within Community law."
"Legal and administrative traditions and the solutions chosen by Member States for the transposition of the Directive mean that the anticipated added value of such reviews would be fairly limited."
"After all, as you know, Member States are free to choose the form and methods for the transposition of directives."
"However, the Commission will continue to pay particular attention to the dissemination of information on the Directive, will distribute updated, simplified guidance to EU citizens and will use the Internet to disseminate information."
"It will also call on and help Member States to inform citizens about their rights by means of awareness-raising campaigns."
"Let me say that the Commission is prepared to comply with the vast majority of the proposals contained in Parliament's report."
"I should like to thank the European Parliament for its support and suggestions as to how to ensure correct application of this important Directive, one that is about nothing less than the proper connection of one of the four fundamental freedoms in European integration."
"The item is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"I give my full support to Mrs VÄlean's report on the application of Directive 2004/38/EC, all the more so as the recent events which have occurred in some Member States have highlighted the blatant violation of one of the four fundamental freedoms, namely, the right of citizens to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States."
"Furthermore, the ineffective transposition or even no transposition at all of this directive into Member States' national legislations has resulted in a number of abuses involving administrative formalities and the restrictive interpretation of the legislative provisions on the idea of 'residing without authorisation', culminating in the unfair detention and expulsion of European citizens."
"However, the solution is not to close borders, but to look instead for concrete measures to facilitate citizens' integration into the diversity of European societies."
"I believe that the report being discussed will make a significant contribution to the monitoring of the transposition of the regulations stipulated by this directive if Member States and the Commission can successfully cooperate in this respect."
"At present, it is every European citizen's wish to live in a European Union where fundamental values, such as the free movement of persons, are respected."
"However, we must not forget that to attain this goal, we all need to make our own contribution."
"Health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields (short presentation)"
"The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Ries, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields."
"Mr President, before coming to the substance, I would like to say a word, if you would allow me, on the form."
"I am not the first and I shall certainly not be the last to speak out against Rule 45 of the Rules of Procedure, which prevents debate this evening on what is nonetheless a most important issue for the people of Europe."
"No debate, no speakers on behalf of the groups, nothing."
"I would therefore like to thank, in spite of everything, and even though, I am sorry to say, they are not here, Mrs Ayala, Mrs Lucas, Mr Adamou, Mrs Sinnott, Mrs Ferreira and even Mr van Nistelrooij, who are without a Chamber, a virtually empty Chamber, at almost 11 p.m."
"Not bad either is the 11 p.m. slot for an issue that is of great interest and concerns millions of citizens in Europe."
"I come now to the substance."
"For ten years our Parliament had not taken up this issue."
"It was time, therefore, because 10 years is an age, or almost an age, when it comes to new technology: a boom in wireless devices, mobile phones, wifi, bluetooth, base stations, high-voltage power lines."
"These waves are all around us, bringing undeniable benefits, which I do not for a moment question in this report, but also, it has to be said, giving rise to serious questions with regard to their impact on our health."
"Therefore, let us be clear, it is in a somewhat sensitive area that I have had to prepare this report, with ever increasing controversy about the health risks of these low frequency waves and the inability of the scientific community, also, to reach an agreement."
"Here are a few examples of the ambitious proposals which, I hope, will be supported tomorrow: protection for areas that are at risk and vulnerable people, that is, schools, crÃ¨ches, retirement homes, convalescent homes and health care establishments, of course."
"Ethical considerations also are essential with regard to this issue, and we must lay down procedures to ensure independence of scientific research and expertise."
"We must also call for a change in behaviour with regard to mobile phones by encouraging the use of ear pieces, limiting mobile phone use among children and young people, educating them in safer techniques, monitoring certain marketing campaigns, and having operators and electricity companies share base stations and masts."
"I do have one regret, however, and it is important because it concerns the initial paragraph of my report, calling for a review of the limits on emissions."
"Unfortunately, I was not supported by my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, even though - I must point this out - word for word, the same text received virtually unanimous support in our plenary session of 2 September last year, in the context of another report on the European environment and health action plan for 2004-2010."
"The Commission's current policy of burying its head in the sand - I apologise for using that turn of phrase, Commissioner - certainly does not help to provide the clarity European citizens are waiting for, and, on the contrary, the experts continue to disagree, and court actions are on the increase, with judgments being in favour sometimes of operators and sometimes of local residents' associations."
"In conclusion, it is a status quo approach that is being advocated by the World Health Organization and also by the Commission, with the rendez-vous clause for 2015 - virtually another decade - to review whether continual exposure to this cocktail of low frequency waves could cause cancerous tumours."
"This approach, therefore, is not the right one."
"It seems lightweight to me, and I hope with all my heart that, when faced with potential health issues in the future, we will not be told that it was responsible."
"The precautionary principle that underpins our proposal is not a principle of inaction, but a principle of action and expertise to reduce uncertainty."
"It is this dynamic and progressive definition that we are defending today in this sensitive area of electromagnetic waves."
"That is why the alternative resolution tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has my full support - I must make that clear."
"It comes back, I might add, to my original proposal of reducing the emission thresholds, as nine Member States and a whole series of regions, two of which are very close to me - Wallonia and the Brussels region - are already doing, that is, they are using three volts per metre instead of the 41 volts per metre authorised at present by the 1999 recommendation."
"Nevertheless, I am rapporteur for the European Parliament on this issue, and I want above all to retain the other advances in this report, as adopted in committee."
"It is the latter, of course, that I shall be asking you to vote for tomorrow."
"In conclusion, Mr President, Commissioner, I want to deliver two messages."
"The issue of electromagnetic waves and their impact remains open, and I am convinced that the next European Parliament will take up this matter again."
"Europe must reassure its citizens and take over this debate, which at present is being conducted only in the courts."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the European Parliament and particularly to Mrs Ries, the rapporteur for this own-initiative report on electromagnetic fields (EMFs)."
"This issue - EMFs - is indeed very controversial in the eyes of many European citizens, although many others, us included, also see it as being most important."
"The complexity of this issue and the strength of feeling surrounding it mean that it is particularly important to gather very precise facts and to evaluate them carefully, adequately and objectively."
"Therefore, the Commission is following this issue continuously and very attentively, as indeed it is required to do in accordance with Council Recommendation 1999/519."
"For this reason, the Commission regularly obtains information from the independent scientific committees in order to stay up to date on the possible risks of EMFs."
"The recent 'SCENIHR opinion' - the opinion of the competent scientific committee - on this subject was only adopted in January of this year."
"I should like to add here that the Commission is following the developments in the Member States and the latest court rulings against mobile phone companies in France with great attention and observing very closely the lowering of exposure limits for base stations in the Brussels Capital Region."
"I can assure Parliament that the Commission will attend to the demands made in the resolution with great care."
"Let me just examine a few points briefly."
"Firstly, there is already a framework at EU level laying down exposure limits and production standards and also a defined level of protection in terms of known effects."
"Secondly, the independent scientific studies to date do not justify amending the scientific basis for these exposure limits."
"The Commission will also continue to follow scientific progress in this field closely in order to establish whether the exposure limits need to be adjusted."
"Thirdly, the Commission is committed to stepping up the dialogue with stakeholders on the potential health effects of EMFs."
"In addition, the Commission wishes to cooperate with the main actors to make it possible to react adequately to public concerns."
"I should like to emphasise quite clearly our endeavours to also promote research in this field to clarify the remaining uncertainties."
"The item is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"We have to recognise that at present there are few reliable and accepted scientific data on the effects of magnetic fields on the human body."
"They are nonetheless part of our everyday lives (mobile phones, wireless technology), and 80 % of citizens consider that they do not have enough information about the possible effects, and 50 % of them say they are worried."
"Until now, the scientific community could only issue divided, and sometimes contradictory, opinions, and public authorities have not really given attention to this problem."
"I therefore give my full support to this report, which calls on States to regularly update the threshold values for these fields and recommends, in accordance with the precautionary principle, prohibiting the installation of antennas in vulnerable areas (schools, health care establishments)."
"I am also in favour of the European Commission launching a scientific study in order to better assess the effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields."
"Public authorities, manufacturers and consumers must obtain accurate information so as to measure these risks and, if necessary, take appropriate protection measures."
"It is also important to make recommendations, based on good practices, to better protect the health of citizens, whether they are users of appliances or residents living near to base stations or high-voltage power lines."
"Problems and prospects concerning European citizenship (short presentation)"
"The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Gacek, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on problems and prospects concerning European Citizenship."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, it is my pleasure to present the report on the problems and perspectives concerning European citizenship, which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) last month."
"European citizenship does not replace national citizenship."
"It is an added bonus, giving EU citizens unique rights, notably the right to the freedom of movement, the right to consular protection and the right to petition Parliament and the European Ombudsman."
"Parliament's report takes into consideration the Commission's fifth report on European citizenship, covering the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2007. This is a unique period."
"Five years ago, on 1 May 2004, 10 new Member States joined the European Union."
"The result of that accession, especially of states from Central and Eastern Europe, was a hitherto unseen scale of inter-Union migration."
"The new citizens of the European Union embraced the rights granted to them, especially the right to free movement."
"They benefited from the opportunity to be educated abroad and, in those countries which opened their labour markets, they undertook legal work."
"The scale of migration, however, poses many challenges for the host countries."
"These are challenges for both the central and local authorities."
"Local authorities, particularly, where they are responsible for the provision of services such as housing, health care and primary and secondary education, are often confronted with the day-to-day problems of the new immigrants."
"Much has been done to aid integration, as well as to help newcomers benefit from the same rights as citizens of their host countries."
"Nevertheless, instances of discrimination remain."
"Sometimes these are the result of legal loopholes and sometimes the result of a lack of knowledge of how to apply the law."
"The LIBE Committee took a very constructive and practical approach in its work."
"There was cross-party agreement that our priority was to highlight the problem areas and undertake steps to remedy them by providing central and local government in Member States with the necessary resources and support."
"Our primary concern was that the individual citizen should not be hindered in any way from benefiting from his or her rights."
"The second right I mentioned, that of consular protection, is still, unfortunately, poorly applied."
"This fact was brought starkly to our attention when our own colleagues found themselves in a dramatic situation during the terrorist attacks in Mumbai."
"If MEPs had problems exercising their right to consular protection in such an extreme situation, what chance does the average citizen have in more mundane circumstances?"
"Increasing citizens' awareness of their rights was a key issue raised throughout the report and a number of measures are suggested for greater awareness building."
"If only 31% of citizens consider themselves to be well-informed about their rights, we still have a lot to do."
"I trust the Commission will take into account Parliament's recommendations and will report back in its sixth report on the concrete progress made."
"Finally, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs, the staff of the political groups and the LIBE Committee secretariat for their hard work."
"A special word of thanks goes to all those who participated in the public hearing on the report, especially the representatives of the NGOs."
"It is fitting that, in a report on citizenship, the citizen's voice, via the NGOs, was heeded in drawing up the final report."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, Mrs Gacek, it seems that we are now quite alone in this House."
"On behalf of the Commission, I should like to thank you for this very important, impressive report and to extend our congratulations."
"The issue here is something very important: European citizenship."
"Many think 'European citizenship' is a hollow phrase and means nothing, but your report makes quite clear that that is not the case."
"European citizenship is made a reality by means of rights that are precisely defined in the Treaty, to wit free movement and right of residence, the right to vote and stand for election in local and European elections, the right to consular protection, the right to petition the European Parliament, the right to complain to the European Ombudsman and the right to write to the European institutions."
"The Commission takes the view that it is high time there was a specific policy programme on European citizenship."
"To this end, the Commission intends to carry out a comprehensive consultation process so that specific information can be gathered on the problems of European citizenship."
"This could lead to new proposals, which would then form the basis of the Sixth Commission Report on Citizenship of the Union, which is scheduled for 2010."
"Aside from this, however, the Commission is working and will continue to work day to day to ensure that citizens are indeed able to exercise their civil rights, and are able to do so every day."
"In a large number of areas where your report, Mrs Gacek, calls on the Commission to act, the Commission is already taking action to ensure that these rights are reinforced and extended."
"I should like to give the example of the Commission Action Plan on consular protection, and would add that I fully agree with you that this is an area in which something needs to be done."
"After all, just a few weeks ago, we held an extremely instructive debate on the subject in this House that showed the extent of the gulf between aspiration and reality in the very case of consular rights."
"The Commission has arranged for citizens to be informed about their rights by means of information campaigns, and is endeavouring to put in place guarantees that these rights can actually be exercised - particularly by adopting its report on the application by Member States of the Directive on free movement."
"The forthcoming European elections are one of the priorities of interinstitutional public relations."
"The Commission supports and supplements Parliament's campaign to put in place information measures to increase public awareness of these elections and to call on citizens to exercise their electoral rights."
"It is fortunate that we are doing so, and I should also like to emphasise that it is not just the Commission that is endeavouring to realise European citizenship in day-to-day life."
"Other actors, too - this Parliament, all 27 Member States, the regional authorities, the national Parliaments, the local authorities and every municipality in the European Union - play a very important role in the effective development of European citizenship."
"I am pleased that the report by Mrs Gacek, published in good time before the 2009 European elections, involves some of these very important actors, who should all take ownership of European citizenship in order to make Europe real for its millions of citizens."
"I believe we all see it as our shared responsibility to ensure that European citizenship is seen not as a mere symbol but as a specific right to which substance can and must be given in day-to-day life."
"The item is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (BG) Transparency and democratic relations between citizens and institutions are fundamental principles in Europe and basic rights of European citizens."
"These are precisely the principles on which the parliamentary elections must take place."
"However, the problem in Bulgaria of vote buying indicates the exact opposite."
"After the previous local elections were repeatedly compromised by the blatant buying of votes of GERB (Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria), DPS (Movement for Rights and Freedoms) and BSP (Bulgarian Socialist Party), ordinary citizens were left feeling that they had no right to choose."
"As a result, this makes them much less willing to vote again."
"In spite of the existing criminal code and the numerous signs of violations of the law, not a single person mentioned in the Commission's report has yet been convicted of these crimes because the relevant law enforcement authorities are clearly unwilling to stop vote buying."
"In Bulgaria the judiciary still shows a lack of determination and the well-known culprits are again preparing pre-election campaigns, while those who sold their votes are now looking for new buyers offering the best bid."
"I want to stress that as long as these violations of the law are allowed in Bulgaria and the state continues not to take any action on the issue, honest voters are in actual fact being deprived of their basic human right - the right to choose!"
"This is unacceptable for European citizens."
"I urge Parliament not to sit back and do nothing."
"The Treaty on the European Union states that every citizen of the Union is equal."
"Unfortunately, however, this principle is not always fulfilled in reality."
"The reason for differences is the spread of extreme poverty, social exclusion or deliberate exclusion, regions with multiple disadvantages that have been left out of the information society, and whose citizens cannot even be expected to have a common European awareness."
"I welcome the fact that the report specifically mentions the Roma."
"This minority of 10-12 million lives in segregation and experience their educational disadvantages and hopeless employment situation as a devaluation of their citizenship."
"There are indications that this breakdown of society will have an effect on the European Parliamentary elections as well."
"The willingness of the most disadvantaged to vote is falling, since they lack information and at the margins of society there is less awareness of the significance of the fact that of all the EU institutions, it is only the composition of the European Parliament that they can directly influence."
"It is unfortunate that indifference is particularly great in Central and Eastern European countries, the roots of which is once again to be sought in the inadequacy of information, but another contributing factor is that the pace of catching up after the great wave of enlargement has slowed down and caused disappointment."
"We hope that the free movement of citizens, workers and service providers will break down borders in people's minds and thinking as well."
"If it becomes natural that moving around within the boundaries of a larger home is the realisation of increased freedom, then the multi-layered and multicoloured European Union can embrace a large number of diverse, yet cohesive and tolerant European citizens."

"Community ecolabel scheme - Voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"the report by Salvatore Tatarella, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Community Ecolabel scheme - C6-0279/2008 -, and"
"the report by Linda McAvan, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme - C6-0278/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by thanking everyone who worked together so effectively in drafting this report: the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; the Czech Presidency; the European Commission officials and - last but not least - the admirable officials from all the political groups."
"I am grateful to them all for their excellent work."
"Their valuable contribution has made it possible to achieve agreement at first reading."
"When I took over responsibility on behalf of the European Parliament for reviewing the dossier on the eco quality labelling scheme, Ecolabel, I acted to speed up the system."
"Continually updating the environmental requirements for products that do not meet standards forces companies into an ongoing virtuous cycle that raises the overall eco quality standards of products placed on the market."
"By increasing the production and circulation of products and services with Ecolabel, we will obtain significant permanent and increasing environmental benefits in terms of energy saving, reducing atmospheric pollution and water saving."
"Ecolabel is a voluntary eco quality label that aims to promote the distribution of products and services with low environmental impact throughout their life cycles, offering consumers accurate, non-misleading and scientifically correct information."
"Our review of this regulation is part of a broader European action plan for sustainable production and consumption and it is closely linked to the review of EMAS and the Ecodesign directive."
"Community legislature already provides for this review of the regulation by stating that the system must be reviewed in the light of experience acquired and changed in order to increase its effectiveness, improve its planning and simplify its operation."
"The purpose of the label is to guide consumers towards products that are able to reduce environmental impact."
"To date, our experience with the Ecolabel has been patchy."
"On the plus side, an increasing number of companies are applying for quality certification in the most diverse sectors."
"They therefore recognise its selective and driving value - this certification is greatly appreciated by consumers who are more aware of the social responsibilities of companies."
"On the negative side, I can report some problems: the general public are barely aware of the label; the criteria soon become obsolete because the markets change so quickly; and the bureaucratic language deters operators from taking part."
"The new Ecolabel will take on a new guise in terms of its look and content."
"It will become more attractive and its scope will extend to new products: by 2015, we plan to increase the number of groups from the current 25 to twice that number, that is, 40-50 groups."
"Promotional campaigns are planned."
"We have earmarked a marketing budget of EUR 9.5 million, and EUR 15 000 have been allocated for a new internet site."
"The principle that most interested the shadow rapporteurs and found the other institutions in agreement was the fact that the Ecolabel must not simply certify an achieved result but instead must be a dynamic tool that is continually developing, a driving force that continually pushes manufacturers and products towards higher standards of environmental quality by continuously evaluating market benchmarks and establishing new criteria on their basis."
"Our aim is to guarantee control of the entire product life cycle, which will allow us fully to consider environmental impact at all stages of production and allow all operators in the sector, and also NGOs, to play an active part in the process of reviewing the compromise criteria."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Tatarella, would you mind listening?"
"You have five minutes now and two minutes at the end of the debate; if you use up the seven minutes now, you will not have any time at the end of the debate."
"However, it is up to you to choose whether you want to use up the seven minutes now or whether you want to use the five or six you have already had and leave yourself one minute to respond to your fellow Members' comments."
"rapporteur. - (IT) I accept your invitation."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, like Mr Tatarella, I would like to begin by thanking the people closely involved with helping us reach first-reading agreement today on the EMAS report."
"I would like to thank the shadows, who are here today, the Commission, who have been very helpful in getting agreement, and to the Czech Presidency, who are not here to hear my thanks."
"Thanks also go to the staff in Parliament and the groups, and to my own assistant, Elizabeth, who played a big role in making sure we were here today."
"It all went very fast, from the time we started discussing it to today, so we now have agreement before the election."
"EMAS is a voluntary scheme, which provides a framework to assist businesses and organisations to improve their environmental performance."
"It started 14 years ago and has had some modest success with about 4 000 participants - which, if you think about it, is not such a huge number in the overall European Union."
"The Commission set a target of increasing that to 35 000 participants."
"That is a very ambitious target."
"It is almost a 10-fold increase."
"I think it is right that we should try and improve the take-up of EMAS, because otherwise its impact is going to remain limited."
"But if we are to increase the impact, we also have to retain the environmental integrity of the programme."
"I think the agreement we reached today does achieve that balance between, hopefully, making it more attractive to people, while at the same time retaining the environmental integrity."
"We have made some changes which we have agreed with the Commission, and I think they are important."
"Firstly, corporate registration, so that a company or organisation with more than one site can actually register once in one country, which is very important."
"This Parliament had to register three times - in Luxembourg, France and Belgium - in order to get EMAS."
"From what I hear from the staff, it was not an easy thing to do."
"So that kind of change is important."
"Also, cluster registration for organisations involved in the same sector; reduced fees, and lighter reporting requirements for SMEs - I think EMAS is a bit too burdensome for small organisations, so it does need to change - and better alignment with ISO 14001."
"Particularly important to me is the introduction of sectoral support documents."
"I think the Commission is going to work very hard at this, and this will help organisations to benchmark themselves against similar organisations."
"Core indicators will also be introduced."
"These are very important to improve the programme and help people on the outside look at organisations and see how they are doing."
"I do hope these will encourage people to take part in EMAS, not because I want to play a numbers game and see EMAS competing with ISO, but because I think the scheme is a good one and could help us to meet our sustainability criteria."
"Today the eyes of the world are very much on London, where world leaders are gathered to talk about the financial downturn and the global banking crisis."
"There will be some, no doubt, who are wondering why we are sitting here talking about environmental auditing at a time when organisations and companies are feeling the financial strain."
"They will see this kind of initiative by the Commission as a distraction."
"But I think that is wrong."
"For me and my Socialist colleagues, the green agenda is very much part of the solution to emerging from the financial crisis that we are in."
"We need to invest in energy and renewables, and we need to be cutting our environmental footprint."
"Although EMAS is a very modest programme in the big scheme about climate change which the Commissioner has worked so hard on, I think it nevertheless plays a role in helping the European Union and the rest of the world to cut our environmental footprint."
"Îember of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking and congratulating the rapporteurs, Mrs McAvan and Mr Tatarella, on their excellent reports on the proposed review of the Community Ecolabel and eco-management and audit scheme."
"These are two important environmental policy measures which form an integral part of the action plan on sustainable consumption and production."
"It is positive that agreement can be reached at first reading."
"The members of the European Parliament have made a decisive contribution and we have managed to keep the environmental objective of the Commission proposal intact, while setting more ambitious targets on numerous important points."
"The fact that agreement has been reached at first reading confirms the will of the institutions to deal directly with the problems created by unsustainable consumption and production."
"The review of the eco-management and audit scheme (ÎÎÎS) gives organisations and companies throughout the world the ability to manage the environmental impact of their activities more effectively."
"The ÎÎÎS contributes towards constant improvements in the environmental performance of organisations and companies, including of course compliance with the relevant environmental legislation."
"It also offers organisations and companies additional benefits, not only by directly saving money, but also by limiting bureaucratic procedures when filing reports and allowing the competent authorities in the Member States to grant incentives."
"With the revised system, we shall be in a position to address consumers' increasing demand for objective, impartial and reliable information on the environmental impact of the products which they buy."
"The revised system will give us the potential to increase the variety of Ecolabel products on the market and to encourage companies to improve their environmental performance."
"Moreover, the Ecolabel logo will give them numerous competitive advantages, such as lower duties, stricter environmental standards, the exclusion of hazardous substances and simpler criteria linked to public procurement and other European Union policies."
"The scope of the revised Ecolabel regulation has also been extended."
"The regulation is more flexible and able to meet the new environmental challenges and priorities."
"Given that it is a framework legislative act, the Ecolabel regulation does not set specific criteria for products."
"Instead, it makes provision for environmental criteria to be set for selected categories of products, so that the logo can be awarded to the best products in each category."
"Today, there is extremely broad penetration on the market of environmental labels, images and texts which may be confusing to consumers, from pictures of forests on tins containing hazardous substances to claims for foods with a neutral carbon footprint and even ecological cars."
"Consumers therefore have no idea whom to trust."
"The compromise proposal for a regulation on the Ecolabel will help to remove these doubts."
"Before laying down criteria and categories of products for food and drink, a study will be carried out into the added value which the label may provide."
"Once this study has been carried out and the Commission has issued a decision through the codecision procedure, the Ecolabel logo can be awarded to products with the best environmental performance."
"I trust that Parliament will fully support this positive bundle of proposals."
"The Ecolabel is one of the few channels for real and direct communication between citizens and the European Union on environmental issues."
"Thanks to the Ecolabel, citizens will make better product choices and, by extension, will participate directly and actively in combating unsustainable consumption."
"The European Commission is in a position to accept the compromise bundles of proposals in their entirety, in order to reach agreement at first reading on both regulations."
"My thanks once again to the rapporteurs for their excellent work."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (EL) Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur and everyone who participated in negotiations with the Council."
"I consider the text agreed between Parliament and the Council to be a very balanced text, which reinforces our arsenal in the fight against climate change."
"I will not conceal from you that I was slightly disappointed with the initial text of the Commission proposal, not only because it was not ambitious enough, but because it was unable to correct even those weaknesses which had emerged during the application of the Ecolabel system so far."
"However, the text which we are being called to vote on allays my initial fears."
"To be precise, I am satisfied that a sensitive product sector such as food and fodder will not be included without first completing a study into the feasibility of establishing reliable criteria, criteria that will cover the environmental impact of the product over its entire life cycle."
"I was particularly pleased to note that the Commission is now obliged to introduce measures to define specific criteria for awarding the Ecolabel for each category of products within nine months of the start of consultations on the Ecolabel with the Council."
"This deadline is of vital importance, because we have seen severe delays at this stage in the past."
"I endorse the exclusion from the Ecolabel scheme of products which are carcinogenic, toxic or harmful to the environment and the reference to a reduction on animal testing."
"The fact that the compliance procedure has been made more flexible rather than being abandoned is also a positive development."
"I am also delighted with the frequent references to small and medium-sized enterprises which, as we all know, are the backbone of the European economy, especially today, when we face the biggest economic crisis in recent years."
"To close, I will not conceal from you the fact that, as far as public procurement is concerned, I was hoping for a more daring, a more courageous stand."
"I am afraid that the compromise achieved is not sufficient in the circumstances."
"Nonetheless, I would like to stress once again that we have achieved a satisfactory result."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, we have been waiting quite a long time for the Commission's plan on sustainable production and consumption."
"We received the proposal a few months ago."
"Although it is comprehensive, unfortunately I have to say that the overall content is rather limited and poor."
"Having read some of the early drafts of the Commission proposals, I know that, in the Environment DG in particular, there were much more ambitious plans to start with."
"So it is obvious that work on these issues has to continue and be more in-depth in the future."
"Today we are discussing the Ecolabel scheme."
"The revision offers a good opportunity for this label to move away from the margins of the market, to capture a much larger share of the market and to help push demand for eco-friendly products."
"The new rules represent a significant improvement."
"They are more dynamic, will apply a life-cycle approach and should be able to attract significantly more attention and interest among both companies and consumers."
"As Mr Dimas said, they will be able to help consolidate eco-labelling and do away with a number of voluntary schemes that are very often confusing to consumers."
"However, we still have a problem, namely how to inform consumers and the markets about the label."
"Marketing support for this label has been very limited in the past."
"The resources allocated have been minuscule compared to the resources behind a lot of branding in the market in general."
"I hope this will change, first of all by businesses seeing the Ecolabel as an important instrument in the future."
"I also hope, as Mr Vakalis said, that public procurement will in the future expand in green areas and use the Ecolabel as a platform."
"I also hope that the Commission will be more proactive in its support for the scheme."
"I thank all those who have been involved in the work."
"I think we have done quite a good job in a few weeks."
"We managed to clear up some of the confusion around food products, in particular fishery products, in the final hours."
"Finally, I would like to refer back to Ms McAvan, who made a reference to the financial crisis and the meeting in London today."
"I think that reference is very relevant."
"We are facing at least three parallel crises today - the financial crisis, the climate crisis and what I would call the ecosystem crisis, or overuse of natural resources."
"It is only by tackling the root causes together - that is to say, unsustainable use of resources - through investing in low-carbon and eco-friendly production and products, that we will be able to build a better future."
"I think this Ecolabel scheme is one of many instruments that can help us to do that."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, there are different tools to sanction environment-conscious behaviour in our societies."
"There are regulations, directives, resolutions."
"We can forbid certain materials and activities."
"We can have a ban on dangerous substances and subsidise green technology."
"But in a market economy there are other tools as well."
"We can target consumers through the products they buy, recommending those products which are environmentally friendly and fit the requirement of sustainable development."
"This directive takes an important step in the right direction by simplifying the passage toward getting the Ecolabel."
"The Socialist Group supports the report."
"My comrades and I have tabled many amendments to it, and those amendments are either favoured by the Committee on the Environment or their spirit is built into the compromise package."
"So our group will vote in favour of the report at the final vote today."
"We think that the environmental effect of products must be a very important issue in the EU, and the whole idea of an Ecolabel gives a very useful orientation for consumers."
"Of course the Ecolabel should be given to the most environmentally friendly products, and the information should be clear and correct."
"In these hard times of the economic crisis, we should respect the interests of producers as well, and I am sure that this report balances the interests of the consumers and industry."
"It is very important to involve small and medium-sized enterprises in the Ecolabel process and, therefore, the cost of the authorisation cannot be too high."
"I, as a shadow rapporteur of the Socialist Group, pushed the report in the direction of even lower costs, and I thank the rapporteur for accepting our arguments."
"For the SMEs I mentioned, it is obvious that we should have to abolish the bureaucratic difficulty of the authorisation."
"We have to simplify the procedure for getting the Ecolabel because, in its present form, the decision procedure is very slow and bureaucratic."
"Mostly the smaller enterprises do not have enough money, time and energy for the slow process of getting an Ecolabel."
"It is very important to analyse the whole life cycle of a product, from production to destruction."
"It is not enough to judge the environmental characteristics of the ready-made product; the substances of the product, the process of production, the transport of the goods and the method for its destruction or decomposition should also be studied before an Ecolabel is given."
"It is obvious, at least to us Socialists, that the products which have gained an Ecolabel must not contain dangerous substances."
"It was a very difficult question during our debates, but finally we were able to reach a very good compromise about dangerous substances."
"The main rule is that Ecolabelled products must not contain dangerous substances, but there can be some very few exceptions."
"Specific goods which do not have equivalent alternatives, and which have a higher overall environmental performance compared with other goods of the same category, may get exceptions."
"The best and most well-known example is the energy-saving light bulb, which has many environmental advantages but contains mercury."
"The issue of foodstuffs has also been widely debated."
"In this case the criteria should be further developed."
"The Ecolabel has a real added environmental value."
"It considers the whole life cycle of the product, and the use of the Ecolabel should not cause confusion in the minds of consumers when compared with other food labels."
"The Commission shall adopt measures to establish specific Ecolabel criteria for each product group, including foodstuffs."
"Not later than three months after the final report and the draft criteria, the Commission shall consult the European Union Ecolabel board on a draft proposal on this issue."
"As I have already said, the Ecolabel shall be based on environmental performance throughout the life cycle of the best products on the internal market."
"That is why the report allows for setting the ambition level of Ecolabel criteria on a case-by-case basis between 10% and 20% of the best performing products on the market, thus ensuring that the scheme rewards only the most environmentally friendly products but offers sufficient choice to consumers."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur for their constructive cooperation."
"I think we have achieved a very good result."
"Last autumn, the World Wide Fund for Nature published a report revealing that, if we continue to use the Earth's resources as we are doing right now, by the mid 2030s we will need two planets."
"The simple fact of the matter is that we use too much on our planet."
"We use resources quicker than they are able to replenish themselves."
"This has to change if we want to prevent an environmental crisis."
"The way that we use the resources has to change, and it is not only the politicians who have a responsibility here; producers and consumers do, too."
"The Ecolabel that is currently being revised is a tool intended to encourage the production and sale of goods produced in a sustainable manner."
"One of the weaknesses of the label is that consumers are not very aware of it - and in this regard I agree with Mr Wijkman - and therefore it is not particularly attractive to producers either."
"If producers cannot use the label to market a good product, why would they then attempt to produce the most sustainable product within a particular product group?"
"This is also one of the problems we have tried to rectify with our new ideas."
"There is now a clear requirement for Member States and the Commission to produce an action plan to promote awareness of the Ecolabel through various campaigns."
"We have had a long discussion about foodstuffs and I think that we have arrived at a sensible solution."
"The Commission's proposal to consider only processed foods and only transport, packaging and processing is not the end of the matter."
"Instead, we have asked for a detailed examination of how we can best include foodstuffs in the ecolabelling scheme so as to ensure that we have done everything correctly from the outset and do not cause confusion with other forms of ecological labelling."
"Finally, I would like to point out that the label now also benefits goods produced to last a long time and goods that can be re-used."
"In other words, we need to change the way we produce and consume goods if we want our economies to be sustainable."
"It requires us to look at the whole of a product's lifecycle, so that we can improve the way raw materials are treated during the production of a product and, in particular, the way we dispose of a product after use."
"I hope that the tool that we have improved here will be a good one for promoting a more sustainable planet."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur."
"Climate change is one of the top priorities for Europe, as well as for the rest of the world."
"We sometimes feel helpless as individuals against this massive global challenge but, at the end of the day, people need to be encouraged to do their bit, as little contributions such as the 'Power of One' do add up."
"And the Power of One is perhaps something we have not promoted enough."
"Today we are voting on a voluntary scheme which certifies companies to label their products as environmentally friendly."
"This enables people to help the environment directly and to reduce emissions in their everyday living and buying."
"Labelling is a clear and simple measure to promote energy efficiency, ethical production and development of greener technologies."
"Also, from a health perspective, this scheme would protect people from potentially carcinogenic, mutagenic, reprotoxic or biocumulative products which can sometimes be traced in textiles."
"The scheme categorises products and services that range from tissue paper to footwear to campsites."
"It also provides means to reduce animal testing and child labour."
"I emphasise child labour because I was recently involved in a report in that area and I am very conscious of that."
"Ireland and Europe can benefit by further promoting and using the scheme."
"There are currently 13 companies in Ireland, mostly from the accommodation sector, that are Ecolabelled but we need to encourage further participation."
"And we also need a very serious information campaign sponsored by the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to both rapporteurs for their excellent work."
"I am very pleased that we are to have a final decision regarding legislation on both of these issues before the elections."
"With regard to the Ecolabel, I consider two principles to be crucially important."
"Firstly, the label should be dynamic; in other words, its criteria should become stricter with developments in knowledge, skills and technology and as we see more environmetally-friendly products come onto the market."
"The other crucial factor is that the label should only be for environmentally superior products."
"The chemical industry, in particular, has been promoting a policy where the Ecolabel should be used for products that merely conform to present laws."
"For example, some time ago it tried to promote the Ecolabel for textiles in which there were fireproof chemicals which had already been banned in electrical equipment."
"Luckily this attempt was thwarted at the time and now we are to have legislation that is clear on this."
"We are to have legislation that will enable consumers to be confident that a product contains no carcinogenic chemicals or chemicals that could adversely affect their ability to have children."
"An exception may only be granted, applying strict criteria, if there is no alternative in a given product group and if a substance of the sort that is harmful to health is necessary for a product whose overall environmental impact is significantly less than other products in the same group."
"This is important for the credibility of the Ecolabel."
"It is also important that the label's criteria are dynamic, so that they will become stricter as and when we are able to produce more environmentally-friendly products."
"Another important issue in the debate was whether the Ecolabel might be extended to food."
"I am glad that the decision has now been made to conduct a usability and feasibility study before the Ecolabel is applied to food, so as to avoid any confusion among consumers between the Ecolabel and organic labelling for organically produced food."
"If and when the Ecolabel is extended to food sometime in the future, to fish for example, it will be important that the criteria do not just cover the way the food has been produced but also the other environmental effects associated with it, such as transport."
"Ladies and gentlemen, more or less the same sort of debate on the dynamic nature of the criteria that we have seen with the Ecolabel has also been going on in the area of energy labelling."
"In my view, it is very important that both the Ecolabel and the energy label adhere to the same principle, i.e. that the criteria become stricter as our knowledge, our skills and our technology improve."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to thank the rapporteurs."
"A label that is ecological but also sustainable: this is the challenge of the new framework regulation on the Ecolabel."
"The regulation is a first step."
"The European Parliament and the Council have carried out profitable and constructive negotiations, at least with regard to aspects concerning chemical substances."
"It is now the turn of the Commission to develop the criteria established, implement a working plan and define an initial list of products in operational terms within one year."
"Individual Member States must organise the competent national authorities, liaise with the European body and adopt the sustainability criteria as binding."
"What does environmental sustainability mean for the Ecolabel, though?"
"It means applying innovative production criteria throughout the production cycle: from reducing emissions in production methods to reducing the energy consumption of primary assets such as water and locating production centres near end consumers."
"All this amounts to nothing less than a revolution."
"This is the challenge demanded of a credible attempt to combat climate change but also a true revolution in manufacturing methods."
"In order to develop these criteria, the Commission and the new Community body are called upon to ensure the active involvement of leading operators and best practices, so that they can make use of innovations tried and tested by these operators during their manufacturing cycles and thus make them accessible and transparent."
"Respect for social working standards is an integral part of these criteria, even though the regulation still contains a legislatively unacceptable term due to incomprehensible pressure by the Council in the final negotiations."
"The term used is 'if appropriate': in sustainable development, social clauses and regular work cannot be an option applied only 'if appropriate'."
"The exclusions to be applied to the ecological quality label for products that still contain toxic chemical substances, that are harmful to the environment, that are carcinogenic or that are damaging for reproduction are, however, clear and effective."
"But on a note of caution: the European Parliament's control over this will be particularly unbending."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tatarella's report on the Community Ecolabel scheme is essential reading: I congratulate the rapporteur and the committee and I believe that product methods and origins must be stated clearly and unequivocally."
"This applies to consumer production, of course, but it is also a requirement if companies are to be treated fairly and if false and unfair competition, which is often perpetrated by those who do not respect social and ecological product production parameters, is to be prevented from continuing to damage and distort the market, as is the case at present."
"In other words, it is about respecting the rules of environmental protection and obviously social rights for workers: our institutions should be responsible for ensuring this is upheld."
"Congratulations again to the rapporteur for his excellent report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen and guests, I would first like to apologise for not arriving on time and to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak immediately after the first round of party speeches."
"I very much appreciate this discussion because the speeches that have been made so far value clearly the work of the rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council."
"It seems that there is a consensus in principle over the two proposals we are expecting in the first reading and I am delighted about that."
"These proposals form part of the Community's sixth action programme and the attached package as published by the Commission in July 2008."
"It emerges very clearly from this proposed action plan that there is a need to change behaviour patterns, consumption patterns and production patterns and that our methods of production and consumption are unsustainable."
"We are damaging the climate, we are damaging human health and we are using up natural resources in an unsustainable way."
"This matter is one of the priorities of the Czech Presidency and I firmly believe that through the approval and revision of the existing regulations on eco-labelling and on EMAS we will largely manage to deal with this priority."
"I would like to thank the European Commission and the Member States for their work on these regulations and I would also like to express my thanks for the major work carried out by the European Parliament, by rapporteur Linda McAvan on behalf of EMAS and the rapporteur Salvatore Tatarella on the Ecolabel and everyone else taking part in this work."
"As far as ecolabelling is concerned, a compromise text has been produced thanks to the combined work of the Council and Parliament together with the Commission, and this text improves the voluntary system for product labelling, particularly by simplifying the system for granting eco-labels."
"It is very important that the Ecolabel should now be more attractive to consumers."
"We are making it possible to extend the system to other products and we have also succeeded in solving a problem relating to the potential labelling of food products, thanks to which consumers will have the possibility to consider and take into account the impact of products or services on the environment when making purchasing choices and this is very important."
"As far as the compromise text applying to EMAS is concerned, it will enable even higher visibility for organisations joining the system voluntarily, thereby increasing its attractiveness."
"In my opinion it is very important to reduce the administrative burden for large, small and medium-sized companies."
"There was considerable debate about the costs of this system and I think we have found a sensible compromise at a minimal cost which will still cover the transaction costs for introducing these labels."
"In my opinion it is important to emphasise that the revised EMAS system is also open to organisations outside the European Union."
"This in turn should give the system greater authority by encouraging application on a broader, more global scale."
"I firmly believe that the approval of these regulations will be a real benefit for European countries and that it will create new opportunities that are relevant to the current crisis and to resolving the greatest global environmental problem, which is global climate change."
"I would like once again to thank the European Parliament, the rapporteurs and MEPs for their productive cooperation on the compromise and I look forward to continuing this debate."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this morning's discussion has highlighted up to now the fact that a great deal of work has been done and that there is broad agreement on this topic."
"The fact that, even after consultation with the Council, EMAS may be concluded with an agreement at first reading and only one trialogue means precisely this."
"So what can we say and add to what has already been said?"
"EMAS and Ecolabel are certainly instruments that can encourage informed choices by businesses, associations and institutions, on the one hand, and by consumers, on the other."
"We must, however, improve communication."
"Many other Members who spoke before me made this point, and I too would reiterate it, because I think this is an essential step."
"We have an international ISO system that everyone is aware of. This is borne out by the number of registrations."
"As the European Union we must make businesses understand why they should choose the European system over the international system."
"Increasing everyone's environmental awareness by involving just 4 000-5 000 businesses within the European Union, as we have done so far, is not a good outcome."
"We must improve on it, and improving on it means above all information, information, and more information."
"Town councils, for example, are unaware that they could be EMAS certified and set a great example."
"The notifications have probably been received by the offices but have not yet filtered through into the minds and consciousness of the administrators."
"EMAS therefore requires more participation."
"The employees of an EMAS-certified organisation all play a part in improving environmental performance: using less water, using less energy, sorting waste."
"This should become a goal to be achieved, first and foremost, by those who can set examples to others, and then secondly, by those who believe that they are able to derive benefits for themselves, companies, the community and our consumers, who feel they are offered a better guarantee through the use of this method."
"Mr President, can I support my colleague, Linda McAvan, and congratulate the members of the Committee on the Environment for bringing forward this report?"
"As Parliament's rapporteur on corporate social responsibility I wanted to make a contribution to this debate by putting the debate on Ecolabelling and EMAS, in terms of reporting by companies, into the wider context of what we are trying to do on corporate responsibility and accountability, and in particular to address the issue of whether voluntary schemes, as against statutory schemes, are the right way forward and whether we should have Europe-focused schemes or a global approach."
"The problem from a corporate responsibility point of view is that a proliferation of voluntary schemes can be more costly and less clear, and can actually lead to competition that is wasteful for businesses, consumers and, indeed, for all stakeholders."
"There is, of course, a temptation for some companies to use the least onerous and least costly - but also least effective - tool."
"The problem of voluntarism may also be that it is just not going to be enough in terms of climate change today."
"I was struck, when the Climate Change Bill went through the domestic Parliament in my own Member State, the United Kingdom, by how the British employers' federation, the CBI, actually said it wanted binding statutory reporting on climate change by business."
"Given what we are saying in the European Union about what needs to happen on climate change, the question is whether voluntarism will be enough, even with the changes we are agreeing in this report."
"Lastly, the issue of global versus European."
"There are 4 000 companies in EMAS and 35 000 in ISO 14001."
"Is this because ISO is less onerous, or is it because our companies work in global - and not just European - markets and want a global approach?"
"I invite the Commission not simply to promote and apply EMAS, which I want to be successful, but also to look outward to establishing and strengthening global initiatives on carbon emission reporting by companies and other aspects of corporate responsibility, so that we get strong global mechanisms and that we then can apply and promote them on our own continent."
"Let us try both tracks."
"Mr President, European legislation was set to encourage enterprises to improve their products and obtain higher standards of energy efficiency and environmental compliance."
"Ecolabelling as a part of the EU action plan on sustainable production, consumption and industrial policy is such a tool."
"And so is EMAS, the eco-management and audit scheme."
"It is about striking a balance between regulatory and market-based instruments, with the aim of developing voluntary standards for various products and services or helping to optimise production processes and make more effective use of resources."
"Now, the problem is how modern technologies can be used for environmental protection, and how industry or services should be helped in promoting the environmental value of the production."
"The goal of ecological certificates is to engage synergies with other legal acts that are tackling environmental aspects of the products."
"EMAS is saving resources: among them, water."
"From past experience we know that certificates at various levels were not sufficiently coordinated."
"Existing voluntary and regulatory instruments were not linked to each other in order to establish synergies."
"First revision of the EMAS scheme was not encouraging."
"It was initially expected that EMAS-registered companies would have performed better, since the EMAS environmental requirements are tougher as compared with older and better-known certificates such as ISO 14001."
"Yet EMAS-registered companies were not performing better, and the system of environmental excellence was weaker as compared with the ISO 14001."
"The Commission found reasons for the lack of success - the system is too tough, too expensive and too complex - and has proposed acceptable simplifications."
"The rapporteur, Mrs McAvan, added valuable additional modifications. Among them is a line in the definition of EMAS which I saw as particularly important."
"It would help organisations to proceed more easily from ISO to EMAS standards."
"I am confident that our amendments have made the Commission proposal for the regulation better and that we have brought it closer to users."
"An impartial system of certification will be, we suppose, appreciated also by consumers."
"I hope that this will help organisations to choose the most rational systemic approach in order to interconnect different fields of environmental protection."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent job he has done."
"I am certain one of thing: this will give additional impetus to the spread of Ecolabel products in Europe."
"At a time when the environment is the burning issue and the demand for green products is rising, even in non-European countries such as the United States and China, the Ecolabel will be one of the tools that makes European products increasingly competitive on the international market."
"In fact the Ecolabel is more than just a mark of environmental quality: through ongoing upward adjustment of product environmental excellence requirements, the Ecolabel will become an incentive for continuous improvement and innovation."
"This report will allow a greater spread of Ecolabel products, promoting awareness of them without in any way reducing consumer health protection guarantees."
"To conclude, my country, Italy, is ranked among the leading countries in Europe for the number of licences granted, and a large number of these were taken out by the tourism sector, which can derive benefit from this European environmental quality certification label that is both appreciated and guaranteed by the European public."
"(SV) Mr President, EMAS, the voluntary Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, means, in principle, that a company or an organisation carries out an environmental review, examines its own impact on the environment, draws up an environment policy, sets targets and comes up with an action plan."
"Unfortunately, EMAS has not been much of a success to date, in that only 4 200 organisations have registered with it since its establishment in 1993, which is a poor result compared with the 35 000 organisations within the EU which have achieved certification to ISO 14001."
"This is why a review of EMAS is justified, quite simply in order to make it more attractive and reduce the amount of red tape for companies and organisations."
"During the negotiations between the Council and Parliament, many aspects of EMAS were tightened up."
"For example, the Commission is now required to draw up a comprehensive reference document for as many sectors as possible, on the basis of a priority programme."
"The text also clearly states that the EMAS logo may not, under any circumstances, be confused with any other environmental product label."
"This is a real improvement."
"A while ago, my colleague, Jens Holm, asked the Commission whether or not all of the Commission's Directorates-General had registered with EMAS, as Parliament has."
"One would think that EU institutions would have an obligation to set a good example, but the response was that the Commission does not operate any internal emission targets and that only five of the Commission's Directorates-General have registered with EMAS."
"In my opinion, that is beyond contemptible and I would like to use this opportunity to put this question to the Commission again: when does the Commission intend to ensure that all of its Directorates-General join EMAS?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I perfectly understand the rapporteur's good intentions, but I believe that this Ecolabel goes against the major problems that are currently afflicting farming and production, particularly during this time of crisis."
"First of all, I believe it is essential to protect national production against unfair competition."
"I am thinking of countries like China, where some goods are actually produced under conditions of slavery;"
"I am thinking of the laogai, the concentration camps where agricultural and manufacturing production takes place; and I am also thinking of certain well-known beverages that are widely consumed around the world despite the fact that we do not know what they contain."
"In other words, protect production against unfair competition and then take steps to ensure that production meets national needs."
"We are aware that at present Europe's output of grain and other agricultural products is low, and, in general, particularly at this time of crisis."
"I am concerned that this may lead to increasing costs for our producers, yet have no impact on the great problem that lies at the heart of the crisis and indeed of the European national economy: unfair competition."
"Mr President, I would like at the outset to congratulate both rapporteurs, Ms McAvan and Mr Tatarella, on the EMAS and Ecolabel reports respectively."
"These deal with very important areas of eco-management and ecolabelling, the whole area of reduction of waste, reduction of water use and hopefully the reduction of food waste."
"If I can be allowed to make particular mention of something which irritates me greatly: in the EU 30% of all food is actually wasted."
"So-called 'best-before dates' are often far too conservative, resulting in wanton waste through the discarding of otherwise perfectly edible products."
"This is part of labelling; let us sort it out and see where we are going on that."
"I also have increased reservations that, in our rush to better inform consumers' choice, we may in fact have the opposite effect from that intended by the Health Claims Directive, GM labelling, food information to consumers - that issue is yet to be resolved."
"And then there is the whole story surrounding ecolabelling."
"With everyone rushing for front-of-pack status - but even for the back - how will all this information, all worthy in its own right, be put on a product label in legible font and end up actually helping to inform the choice of Joe and Mary Citizen?"
"I have my concerns."
"If I may put on my hat as Vice-Chair of the Committee on Fisheries for the moment, I should like to put on the record what appear to be two parallel processes for the ecolabelling of fishery products."
"In 2005 the Commission adopted a communication to launch the debate on a Community approach regarding the ecolabelling programmes for fishery products."
"Following this, in 2006 the European Parliament adopted my colleague Carmen Fraga EstÃ©vez's report, which urged the Commission to present a proposal for a Community ecolabelling system for fishing products."
"In 2008 the Maritime Affairs and Fisheries DG announced a proposal for a regulation for a Community ecolabel for fishery products, the adoption of which was foreseen for March 2009."
"This proposal is still in the pipeline though I now believe we are promised it before the end of the year."
"In the mean time, the Environment DG sent the European Parliament a horizontal proposal on the Community Ecolabel scheme covering all products including fishing and aquaculture products, as well as processed agricultural products."
"Despite the written protests of the chairs of both the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, these committees were not involved."
"But I am pleased to acknowledge on the record today that only recently the Council, Parliament and the Commission have agreed on a declaration on the way forward, which states that, independently of the adoption of the Ecolabel Regulation, the Commission confirms it intends to propose a regulation on ecolabelling of fishery products before the end of the year."
"It continues that the study foreseen in Article 6(5)(a) of the Ecolabel regulation, dealing with additional aspects such as processing, pre-packaging, packaging and transport, which will examine the feasibility of the extension of the scope of the Ecolabel Regulation to food, including products of fishing and aquaculture, will not influence or pre-judge the adoption of this regulation."
"This declaration also clarifies that the Ecolabel will be complementary to the Specific Fishery Products Regulation."
"(RO) Reducing energy consumption and efficient resources management are nowadays fundamental principles for a large number of socio-economic actors."
"In fact, since the introduction of the Community eco-management and audit scheme in 1993, roughly 4 200 organisations have been registered in this programme."
"I feel that it is necessary to consolidate this scheme by expanding the number of organisations which apply it and to recognise it as a benchmark eco-management scheme."
"Romania's Parliament Palace consumes as much power as a town with 20 000 inhabitants."
"I have already suggested to the institution's management to join this scheme as soon as possible."
"The particular attention focused on small organisations, such as SMEs and local authorities, is, in my view, an important step towards expanding environmental performance on the largest possible scale."
"I would encourage the Commission and Member States to make efforts to promote EMAS, especially by awarding incentives in return for participation."
"As regards the monitoring of progress made by EMAS, this will lead to acceptance of the scheme and the creation of conditions for positive development in this area."
"I think that the rapporteur's suggestion to introduce a user manual is welcome at a time when the language and requirements stipulated will become more accessible via this document."
"At the moment, an annual reporting cycle is used, which I find to be adequate and I do not see why there would be any need to introduce a new three-year cycle, which would end up being confusing."
"Although EMAS must still prove its viability and efficiency, I support the continuation of its use for as long as is necessary, with the main aim of preserving the integrity of the environment. Thank you."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I fundamentally welcome the European Ecolabel."
"It is right that we should make a new attempt to spread the Community Ecolabel further."
"I also think it is right that we will be retaining the voluntary nature of the scheme in future."
"In future, the label scheme will only be implemented where clear criteria and yardsticks apply, which must be met before the Ecolabel may be used."
"In this regard, I call on the Commission to draw up sensible, clear and comprehensible criteria."
"The idea of attracting people to the scheme must be at the heart of this."
"It would be a great shame if the establishment of the Ecolabel were to fail due to bureaucratic obstacles."
"It will be the consumer, at the end of the day, who decides whether the Ecolabel succeeds or fails, as it is with consumers that the scheme must find acceptance."
"Attached as I am to the Blue Angel ecolabel that we have in Germany, it must not be a question of personal preference, at the end of the day, but rather it comes down to conveying to consumers at a single glance what specific qualities a product has."
"There will only be added value for consumers if the Member States do not use their own symbols and there is ultimately a uniform symbol at the European level."
"A jumble of symbols alienates consumers rather than informing them."
"One symbol, one conclusion - that is what we should all be working towards together."
"(HU) The voluntary Ecolabel scheme is of crucial importance, since it is intended to foster the spread throughout Europe of environmentally friendly products both in terms of production and of consumption."
"I would like to draw attention to the importance of reforming the Ecolabel scheme and to the need to simplify the system by reducing the administrative burdens involved in using the label and extending the range of the product categories participating in the scheme."
"It is my view, however, that all this will not in itself guarantee the success of the reform."
"If as a result of these arrangements, products bearing the flower label fall within a higher price category, as is the case with organic products, then attempts to foster consumption of these products will fail."
"I believe that we must prevent the added value of using the Ecolabel at a European level leading to higher prices for these products."
"In the long term, ensuring and promoting wider distribution of these products will only be possible if accompanied by price-limiting measures and tax or other advantages."
"Beyond keeping prices stable, we must not forget about the need for wide-ranging information to consumers and producers, and therefore EU institutions and the Member State governments must provide information about the advantages guaranteed by the label and about the inventory of products participating in the scheme."
"In order for consumers to change their purchasing habits, wide-ranging, promotional and information campaigns are essential."
"I would also like to highlight the importance of drawing up a detailed work programme for attaining the new objectives, which should ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity to participate in its elaboration."
"As a result of the constantly changing environment of service provision, these objectives must be reviewed on an annual basis."
"We need to understand that regardless of our nationality or national commitments, we all share the task of protecting our environment, thereby creating opportunities for disseminating those objectives and values which the European Union claims as its own, and which I am convinced are the essential prerequisites of a full human life."
"This obligation on our part also means that we must have the opportunity to choose from among various products in the same price category those that have been produced by an environmentally friendly process."
"I thank the rapporteur for his cooperation with regard to my proposed amendments. I thank him for preparing the report, and I thank you for listening to me."
"(LT) I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs for their splendid work."
"I think that fellow Members Linda McAvan and Salvatore Tatarella have drafted reports which will help the European Union to remain one of the world's most environmentally-friendly regions."
"People sometimes joke, as well as say in all seriousness, that strict and clear standards are the EU's most important export."
"Having adapted to higher European requirements, companies from various continents often follow them in other world markets."
"At present national ecolabels are more widespread and better known than EU ecolabels."
"Therefore, I agree with the rapporteur that more effort is needed to make this label more recognisable to all consumers in Europe and beyond."
"Here more initiative should be shown by European Union institutions, national governments and individual companies."
"With the deeper integration of the markets of EU countries, the creation of a European label and harmonisation of requirements is an unavoidable process, beneficial to all market participants."
"The renewal of the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) is also welcome."
"For the time being its popularity lags behind the international ISO 14001 Standard."
"I agree with the opinion that once the EMAS and ISO requirements have been harmonised, it would be possible to attract more organisations and they would become standards, which complement each other rather than compete with each other."
"I am certain that in future more attention will be paid to the protection of the environment and the restriction of limitless consumption."
"In my opinion, both reports contribute to movement in this direction."
"(NL) Madam President, I am indebted to Mrs McAvan and Mr Tatarella for their excellent work in the field of ecolabels and the eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS)."
"The environmentally-aware consumer can choose between different ecolabels, many of which relate to organic products."
"The European Ecolabel relates to all products and is a very valuable addition."
"The European Ecolabel, however, has been languishing away for many years."
"I only recognise the little flower with the circle of stars around it from a brand of toilet paper."
"I therefore welcome the new rules to improve the Ecolabel and to make it better known."
"The Member States have to ensure that the Ecolabel gains recognition among the public at large."
"The European Ecolabel needs clear criteria and could put an end to the proliferation of all kinds of well-meaning hallmarks."
"A widely supported and instantly recognisable ecolabel could be an incentive for producers to improve their products, to cut back on material and energy and to recycle far more."
"This requires unambiguous criteria, of course."
"Producers will need to meet new and strict criteria, justly so, in order to qualify for the ecolabel."
"The criteria will be based on a scientific analysis of the entire life cycle of products, which is excellent."
"Eventually, only the top 10% to 20% of products per category can be awarded the Ecolabel."
"The rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs also propose investigating whether foodstuffs and beverages could fall within the Ecolabel's scope."
"It strikes me that time is of the essence, not only in the fishing industry, but also in a number of other sectors."
"After all, food and the food industry are a considerable burden on the environment, and the Ecolabel could in any event bring a solution on this score."
"I also agree with what Mrs McAvan and Mr Wijkman said at the beginning of this debate: it is important, particularly now, to build in incentives for environmentally-friendly production for energy-efficient use, and this legislation will play its part in that."
"(ES) Madam President, supporting sustainable production is advantageous in that it benefits both the competitiveness of businesses and consumer interests in terms of quality of life and individual commitment to the environment."
"In this respect, the Ecolabel is a good tool and we should therefore be pleased with the strengthening measures that we are debating here today."
"The Ecolabel still only applies to a very limited number of products; it is still little known to consumers and yet, despite this, it is often copied without any genuine authorisation."
"I therefore believe that the revision we are carrying out in the European institutions will help to keep these problems in check."
"We should be aware of another basic fact: the Ecolabel should not reflect standard practice within sustainable production; the Ecolabel should reflect excellence within sustainable production, which should become increasingly prevalent."
"The challenge we are facing is to make our economy a green economy; the Ecolabel, therefore, should be the highest expression of this rolling-out of good practices relating to respect for the environment."
"This week, at the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we had an initial exchange of views regarding the report concerning names of textile products and related labelling, for which I am the rapporteur."
"In my view, the textiles sector is a good example of the fact that we should not only make approval procedures for new products - in this case, new fibres - more flexible, but also endeavour to strengthen the Ecolabel, together with wider-reaching measures, so that the sector as a whole moves towards sustainability."
"Only in this way will we be able to compete with other markets that produce with less discrimination, and only in this way will we be able to satisfy consumer demands which, fortunately, are increasingly rigorous."
"(PL) Madam President, the current need of EU legislation is for it to be simplified so that the law is clear and comprehensible to every citizen."
"Ecolabelling means information for consumers about environmental issues, including information about the product, which facilitates the decision about whether to purchase it or not."
"Introducing the system will contribute to an improvement in the state of the environment and will counteract climate changes."
"It will also contribute to a reduction in water consumption."
"Environmental product labels should contain information about quantities and other matters and should be clear and legible."
"Greater consumption of organic and natural food and of regional products will contribute to an improvement in the state of health of our society."
"(DE) Madam President, as I have a group of visitors from Styria up in the visitors' gallery today, I will attempt to begin in the Austrian variety of the German language."
"If it is in it, it must say so, and what it says must be correct."
"That is something that is important for all of us, and not just in this debate."
"We should demonstrate that Europe exerts itself on specific concerns and delivers exceptionally well on them."
"We should also ensure that we do not have a myriad of labels on every product and it is time - and not only now, right before the European elections - to show the people at home and out and about that the European Union does work on worthwhile things that affect the citizens themselves and that very many of the nonsensical things that you can hear and read on a daily basis are not true."
"Thank you, Mr Rack."
"Your visitors will know that they are well represented."
"(RO) Information about product ecolabelling must be easy to understand, while the Ecolabel itself must be positioned so that it stands out clearly and defines the product in question."
"Ecolabelling information must refer to products' energy performance, must be easy to understand, and should be based on scientific proof."
"The Commission and Member States must ensure that the necessary funds are earmarked for Ecolabel awareness and promotion campaigns."
"I call on the European Commission to create an official European Union webpage, which includes all the information and practical aspects concerning ecolabelling in the European Union."
"However, there is a great deal of bureaucracy involved in the process for reviewing Ecolabel criteria for different products in 18 months."
"If we want this scheme to be effective it must not be accompanied by an increase in red tape."
"However, I believe that a Community working plan is needed for a minimum period of three years to set joint objectives and draw up a non-exhaustive list of product groups which will be considered as a priority."
"When establishing the Ecolabel criteria, we must avoid introducing measures the implementation of which may impose disproportionate administrative and economic provisions on SMEs. Thank you."
"I would like to thank you for an exceptionally positive and interesting debate on this topic."
"In my opinion consumption is the fundamental characteristic of the consumer society."
"I had the opportunity to experience a society that lived under totalitarianism for 40 years and that had a lack of goods and an enormous consumer potential."
"We have gone through a development process and I think that the experience is of interest in relation to the further expansion of Europe and the modernisation of developing countries."
"We have gone through a period of enormous desire for consumption."
"In spite of this, it seems that when choice suddenly appears in the form of a wide range of goods and products, then there is an increase in the proportion of people in society who care about food quality, product quality, water quality and air quality."
"It is very important for Europe to succeed in providing these consumers with information about what impact the consumption of a given product will have on the environment, health, the climate and sustainable development in other regions, including regions outside the EU."
"For this reason I firmly believe that if the European Parliament approves these two regulations it will greatly benefit EU citizens because they will have the possibility to exercise much greater choice."
"I also believe that people will soon manage to categorise the products and foods that attracted so much discussion in the debate and in my opinion this will enable EU citizens to contribute actively towards protecting the environment through their consumer choices."
"We are thereby giving citizens an opportunity to feel better and to have a greater sense that they themselves, every one of them, are actively participating in protecting the environment."
"Once again, it is my pleasure to thank everyone - the rapporteurs, the Council, Parliament and the Commission - for this proposal, for the excellent cooperation with the Czech Presidency and for the fact that we have managed, I believe, to bring this document to a successful conclusion at the first reading."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking all the speakers in today's debate for their very constructive and positive speeches."
"On the basis of the text agreed for the ÎÎÎS, organisations and companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises throughout the world, will have access to a simple and effective eco-management system."
"With this revised ÎÎÎS, participating companies will have a net benefit, given that they will be able to use their environmental reports to promote their environmental performance to consumers, to the public and to other companies and inspectors and auditors."
"Thanks to the amendments proposed by Parliament, the text of the regulation on the Ecolabel has been improved still further from an environmental point of view and is now more accessible to companies."
"Parliament's amendments also played an extremely important role in guaranteeing the credibility of the label among consumers and environmental organisations."
"The revised Ecolabel will be more flexible and will allow criteria for the inclusion of even more goods and services to be laid down at a later stage, especially in categories of goods with an important environmental impact and, therefore, huge room for improvement."
"Approval of this text at first reading will increase the number of Ecolabel products, giving consumers far greater choice when shopping."
"Our objective is, of course, for there to be broad recognition of and to safeguard the validity and reliability of the European label scheme at international level."
"In the meantime, however, this Ecolabel first needs to be recognised by consumers and companies throughout the European Union."
"That is why I want to emphasise that Mr Wijkman was quite right to remark that we need to strengthen commercial support, the marketing of the Ecolabel still further."
"That is precisely why the Commission has earmarked resources and means, more than at any other time, to strengthen the marketing of the Ecolabel."
"We also fully endorse the view expressed by Mr Howitt about the prospects of the ÎÎÎS at international level."
"To be specific, international ISO standards have already been included and incorporated into the ÎÎÎS."
"The ÎÎÎS will now be open to applications by international companies outside the European Union."
"We want to limit bureaucracy and ensure that the various texts which refer to the relevant criteria will be simple and convenient and that the Ecolabel will be as harmonised as possible with other international and national labels."
"The text of our proposal provides this facility, in that it contains a reference to the drafting of special explanatory documents and the adoption of special rules to promote harmonisation with national labels."
"I shall be filing three statements by the Commission with Parliament's secretariat for inclusion in the minutes of today's sitting:"
"the first concerns the way in which misleading claims for fish products are dealt with."
"The Commission intends to propose a regulation which will prohibit labelling with misleading claims which are incompatible with sustainable fisheries;"
"the second statement relates to the Commission's intention to ensure that the revised Ecolabel regulation does not infringe regulations relating to chemical products, such as the REACH regulation;"
"the third statement concerns the Commission's plan to re-examine the level of duty on Ecolabel products."
"To close, I would like to say that both the ÎÎÎS and the Ecolabel are exceptional initiatives."
"To date the potential of neither the one nor the other has been fully exploited and I agree with Mrs Svensson that it should be applied as it is being applied now, not only in the five Directorates General and committees, but also in the other Directorates General and that is what we are doing with the decision which we are preparing."
"The European Parliament has decided to apply the ÎÎÎS and we expect the same of the Council."
"Today's proposed review will allow the ÎÎÎS and the Ecolabel to develop into reference points for sound environmental management and best environmental performances by products."
"I should therefore like to stress once again the importance of reaching agreement at first reading."
"Numerous useful changes have been made to the texts and the results are very balanced."
"I therefore call on you to support this text in its entirety without further change."
"Before I close, I should like once again to thank the rapporteurs for their extremely useful contribution."
"I truly believe that, with their hard work and with the cooperation of the Czech Presidency, we are in a position to agree at first reading, which is very important."
"Commission's statements"
"1) In relation to the Ecolabel Regulation's relationship to upcoming fisheries legislation"
"Independently of the adoption of the Ecolabel Regulation, the Commission confirms that it intends to propose a Regulation on ecolabelling of fishery products before the end of this year to be mainly based on criteria for sustainable fishing."
"The study foreseen in article 6(5)a of the Ecolabel regulation dealing with additional aspects such as processing, pre-packaging, packaging and transport, which will examine the feasibility of the extension of the scope of the Ecolabel Regulation to food, including the products of fishing and aquaculture, will not influence or prejudge the adoption of this Regulation."
"2) In relation to coherence with chemicals legislation"
"The Commission will ensure that the implementation of the Ecolabel Regulation will be coherent with the other relevant Community legislation addressing substances, preparations and mixtures."
"3) In relation to fees review"
"The Commission confirms it intends to review the level of fees for the Ecolabel within 18 months of entry into force of the Regulation, taking into account the cost incurred by Member States in administering the scheme, and propose a revision of the fee levels as appropriate."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I also welcome the opportunity to thank all those who took part in the debate, which revealed broad agreement over the work carried out in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"The debate also offered more insights, additional stimuli and further suggestions that I hope will be valuable to the Commission and Member States as they fulfil their duties."
"By carrying out this debate and taking the vote today, Parliament has practically fulfilled its commitment on these two important matters."
"Now it is the turn of the Commission to have its say: I was delighted to hear the three statements made on the record by the Commissioner."
"We expect the Commission to perform its study on food very specifically so that any possibility of misunderstandings between this label and organic products can be ruled out."
"We look forward to the regulation on fish products - and the Committee on Fisheries awaits it with particular eagerness."
"I thank the Committee on Fisheries for helping us through this very difficult time."
"I call the Commission's attention to the exemptions for toxic products: proceed with great care and great caution."
"As far as the promotional campaign is concerned, we hope that the Commission's campaigns are effective and targeted in order to reach the general public and particularly young people."
"We hope that the firm deadlines we tried to establish will be respected and that the reduction in animal testing will also be respected."
"I am left with just one small concern and regret: perhaps we could have done more about contracts."
"That is a job for next time."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I just want to pick up on what Avril Doyle spoke about when she said we have a plethora of initiatives and labels which are ethical and sustainability labels, to say that I think the Commission needs to look at this to make sure that people are not being misled."
"The Commissioner just spoke about the fisheries labelling and making sure people know what they are buying."
"With a different hat I have been involved in fair trade and protecting the fair trade label, and what we have seen in recent years is alternative labels being developed."
"Some are OK, but some are attempting to look as if they are ethical labelling, look as if they are fair trade, but they are attempting to be fair trade on the cheap, without having the independent verification which you need to have a proper labelling system."
"So I hope that the Commission will make sure that all these systems of labelling and ethical labelling do continue to have some integrity and are not undermined to simply become marketing tools of organisations who want to make the public think they are being green and ethical when in fact they are nothing but fig leaves."
"So I hope that can be looked at by the Commission, and it does need a cross-departmental look from the Commission."
"Every time I talk about this I get told, 'Oh it's not us, it's the other department', and each one seems to offload the burden onto the other."
"Finally, just to thank everybody again for their contributions."
"I look forward to the vote, which I hope will be a very simple, straightforward one."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.00 today."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"I give my full support to Mrs VÄlean's report on the application of Directive 2004/38/EC, all the more so as the recent events which have occurred in some Member States have highlighted the blatant violation of one of the four fundamental freedoms, namely, the right of citizens to freely move around and settle on the territory of Member States."
"Furthermore, the ineffective transposition or even no transposition at all of this directive into Member States' national legislations has resulted in a number of abuses involving administrative formalities and the restrictive interpretation of the legislative provisions on the idea of 'residing without authorisation', culminating in the unfair detention and expulsion of European citizens."
"However, the solution is not to close borders, but to look instead for concrete measures to facilitate citizens' integration into the diversity of European societies."
"I believe that the report being discussed will make a significant contribution to the monitoring of the transposition of the regulations stipulated by this directive if Member States and the Commission can successfully cooperate in this respect."
"At present, it is every European citizen's wish to live in a European Union where fundamental values, such as the free movement of persons, are respected."
"However, we must not forget that to attain this goal, we all need to make our own contribution."
"Ecolabelling is a voluntary measure intended to promote at European level the distribution of products with a high level of efficiency and a low environmental impact throughout their entire life cycle."
"The experience which has been acquired as a result of this certification scheme's implementation for almost 10 years, covering 26 categories of products, 622 licences and more than 3 000 products and services (detergents, paper, clothing, footwear, textiles, tourism and camping products), suggests the need for more robust intervention to deal with certain key aspects of the scheme."
"Given that many economic agents are unhappy with the lengthy duration of the procedure for approving the criteria and the speed with which they become obsolete once they have been approved, amendments have been introduced to the way in which they are approved (a maximum period of 180 days between completing the evaluation and approval, with a simplified, abridged review procedure for non-essential changes to the criteria), along with a new system for awarding labels."
"Maintaining the Ecolabel certification scheme's credibility requires:"
"the application of the general principle of protecting the health of consumers and the environment, even in the case of labelled products"
"promotional activities: improving the way in which consumers are informed, initiating awareness campaigns in order to maintain confidence in ecolabelling, using European funds"
"special attention to be focused on SMEs."
"I support the report and congratulate the rapporteur."
"I would like to point out that the Community's Ecolabel will establish a common basis for its use, but it should not be allowed to prevent other kinds of labelling."
"I think it is important that we should be able to attach a label to a product showing it has been produced in the country in which it is being sold, and I disapprove of the Commission's position in banning that in Community-financed campaigns."
"Notification of the country of origin in local food production, for example, is the best sort of Ecolabel."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.35 and resumed at 11.00.)"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"(IT) Mr President, the Bureau of this Parliament officially informed us of the fact that MEPs' attendances in committee and plenary sessions were to be made public on the European Parliament website."
"This was, incidentally, a move in response to a specific vote taken by this Parliament during its January session, when we voted for this, that is, for this information to be made public."
"So, Mr President, I have a request for you: since the Bureau is likely to hold only one or two more meetings at most in due course, to ensure that the will of this Parliament is respected, I formally request that you undertake to confirm that both this will and the vote taken by this House will be respected."
"I would not like to think that entirely bureaucratic reasons have prevented this requirement for transparency from being observed, because we made a commitment to the European electorate and public too."
"Thank you very much."
"Parliament's will is always decisive."
"We will consider what you had to say in the next meeting of the Bureau."
"(FR) Mr President, a law on women's rights which, according to the Afghan senator Humeira Namati, is worse than that which was in force at the time of the Taliban, has been signed by President Hamid Karzai."
"This text makes it legal for a husband to rape his wife and forbids women from going out, working or visiting the doctor without the husband's permission."
"In addition, the law grants custody of children only to the father and grandfather."
"I call on you, Mr President, immediately to take all the measures necessary to express the total disapproval of our Parliament and to include this item under urgent business for our next session."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡."
"We will take care of this matter."
"Welcome"
"I welcome to the European Parliament a delegation from Rwanda headed by the Minister for External Affairs and Cooperation, Mrs Rosemary Museminali."

"(DE) Mr President, I would like to propose an oral amendment to the effect that, in points 5, 8 and 16, the word 'legal' should be deleted, as it gives the impression that children who are not registered, in other words involved in a current asylum procedure, could be excluded from the education programmes."
"We wish to protest against this."
"I move that the word 'legal' be deleted since every child has the right to education if he or she is registered in a country."
"If there are no objections to what Mrs Prets has proposed, we will, of course, check the text once more very carefully on this basis."
"Mr President, I am not sure if the interpretation missed it."

"rapporteur. - Mr President, in order to remove any misunderstanding and to comply with the requests made by Italian colleagues from the new Partito della LibertÃ  belonging to the PPE-DE and UEN Groups, I propose an oral amendment to footnote 1 to recital S, first indent, to delete the last two sentences and insert 'IT' (Italy) in the sequence at the beginning of the paragraph."
"You have this in your voting list."
"(IT) Mr President, I appreciate the rapporteur's suggestion, but this resolution contains too many references - not only in this point and in this footnote of the proposed oral amendment, but in many other parts of the resolution."
"For various reasons it refers to all the Member States and also to the very subject that you have asked to be deleted from the footnote, relating to the very subjects that appear in other parts of the resolution."
"I therefore believe, Mr President, and this is my proposal, that my fellow Member should ask for the resolution to be further amended and then referred back to committee for re-examination."
"(IT) Mr President, on the admissibility of Mrs VÄlean's amendment: Mrs VÄlean was quite right to go back and correct the text, removing the vague and misleading reference to third and fourth wives, which led to doubts over the legitimacy of polygamy."
"We should nevertheless clarify that, unfortunately, the questionnaire sent to the Member States contained this incorrect terminology."
"In other words, Member States were asked for their opinion on the right to free movement of second, third and fourth wives."

"Yesterday, during the group meetings, we received documents from the Commission and the Council in which the Commission and the Council are approaching our position."
"We did not have time to discuss these documents adequately, however."
"I would therefore be grateful for a postponement."
"However, I would again ask all Members from all groups to please refrain from using this interim agreement with Turkmenistan as a hostage by means of which to gain greater rights for Parliament in comparison with the Council and the Commission."

"Mr President, I would like to propose that it be mentioned that any plans to build a new nuclear power station on non-Western lines at the border with the EU should not be included in these talks - in positive talks on how to support Belarus, but not in this case."
"Mr President, this will be a very short oral amendment, which has been proposed at the request of Alexander Milinkevich and the Amnesty International representatives who took part in the conference on Belarus two days ago at Parliament."
"They asked to extend the demand to release political prisoners who have recently been arrested also to people who face other kinds of restrictions and harassment."
"That is why I propose - and I have consulted other political groups - to add to paragraph 4: 'as well as a review of the ""restricted freedomâ sentences imposed on 11 persons who participated in a demonstration which took place in January 2008;'."
"Mr President, when three young activists are mentioned as being subject to forcible army conscription, one of them at least is the son of the opposition leader, Mr ViaÄorka. So it is worth mentioning that it is tantamount to state-practised hostage-taking: 'Look, be calm in your position because your son is in our army and something may happen to him.'"
"That would be a little warning, maybe giving more security for those young men forcibly conscripted into the army."
"Mr President, when the suggestion is made that the European Humanities University should go back to Belarus, it is worth mentioning that it should be on the basis of genuine guarantees that it will be able to operate freely and not be taken back under the control of the regime."
"(DE) Mr President, we are happy to respond to individual oral motions, but I would ask Mr Landsbergis to inform us in advance so that such subjects can be discussed even when he is not there."
"You cannot always just make oral motions without information."
"I see that Mr Landsbergis is indicating that - should he find himself making oral motions again in future - he will do as you have just asked."

"Mr President, let me recall our significant resolution of 2005 about the end of the Second World War in Europe, which stated that 'there cannot be reconciliation without truth and remembrance'."
"I would not like to delete the truth now."
"Please agree that 'truth' be inserted: reconciliation with truth and remembrance."
"Please vote for truth."
"Mr President, the text refers to crimes against humanity that were still happening 'as late as July 1995'."
"It would be better to say 'were still taking place in July 1995', because nobody can be sure that there were no more such crimes in 1996."
"(Interjection from the floor)"
"Yes, indeed - that would be softer; 'took place as late as' should be replaced with 'were still taking place in'."
"Mr President, this is a minor correction."
"The text now reads 'whereas the Central European countries had the added experience of Communism'."
"I would like to change 'Central European countries' to 'Central and Eastern European countries', because everywhere else the text reads this way, and to replace 'had the added experience of Communism' with 'have experienced both Communism and Nazism', because, to Eastern European nations, nothing was 'added' by Communism: most of them had Communism first, then Nazism, and then Communism again."
"(PL) Mr President, I would just like to add that I also signed the resolution."

"- Before the vote:"
"Mr President, I rise to ask colleagues to consider the referral of this motion for a resolution back to committee."
"I do so on foot of what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said here last night in the debate."
"I do not do so lightly, because I share the concerns of all colleagues who have spoken in this debate and as expressed in this resolution."
"But I would like to say, to be fair to the Commissioner, that it is not our intent to cause her any problems at a critical stage in the negotiations she is having at the moment with the Arctic Council."
"She has specifically stated that 'such a proposal would at this stage' - and I am quoting from the transcript of what she said in plenary - 'not only be ineffective, but could prove to be detrimental to the EU's role and credibility in overall Arctic cooperation'."
"In her conclusion, she specifically referred to the timing of our motion."
"The Commission has submitted an application to the Norwegian Chair of the Arctic Council to extend the international Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"That has to be accepted by unanimity, and the vote is on 29 April - in three or four weeks' time."
"So she very clearly asked for a postponement, even though she fully shares our sentiments."
"On that basis, could I suggest we consider referring it back to committee?"
"Mr President, could I say on behalf of the ALDE Group that we would support Mrs Doyle's proposition?"
"I think it has much merit."
"The House had a resolution on this issue in October of last year."
"To a certain extent we are repeating what we said then, but we are also saying some things that are rather stronger and, as Mrs Doyle said, they come at a critical moment when most of us in this House would want to see the EU take up a seat on the Arctic Council, and we would not wish to compromise that."
"It would be much better to refer this back to committee and have a full and considered report in the new mandate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, just to make it clear what it is that we are now voting on, we cannot refer this back to committee as it did not come from a committee, but we can postpone the vote."
"This is what the Rules of Procedure dictate."
"(FR) Mr President, excuse me, but you have not given the floor to the opposing side."
"I find it extraordinary that we should have debated this resolution yesterday and that, on the contrary, the moment we table it and we call for a 50-year moratoriumon the exploitation of oil resources, the moment we call for a binding charter, and when we know that the countries have until the end of April to go to the UN to claim sovereignty over the seabed and therefore, in effect, this idea of sovereignty, accompanied by military deployment, everything should depend on what we do right now."
"If we fail to show the difference and make our voice heard, we will take a step backwards, and we will not be proactive, and I am absolutely opposed to that."

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(CS) Mr President, the presence of a very large number of migrant schoolchildren has enormous consequences for the education system."
"There is clear and unambiguous evidence that many children from migrant families are less educated than their peers."
"Schools must adapt to their presence and include them systematically in their traditional programmes aimed at providing high quality education."
"Education is the key to ensuring that these pupils become fully integrated, successful and productive citizens of the host countries, and therefore that migration becomes a benefit for migrants and for host countries."
"I welcome the report of Mrs Takkula and I have supported it."
"(FR) Mr President, multilingual teaching, polyglot teachers addressing each child in his or her mother tongue, foreign teachers recruited especially for them, respect for and even promotion of cultures of origin by schools, minimum knowledge of the language of the host country, without this even being considered as really obligatory: this type of recipe does not lead to the integration of migrants."
"It would lead meanwhile, and paradoxically, to the ghettoisation of our societies, to the blurring of identities, and to the acculturation of all, whether migrants or the original inhabitants of the host country."
"I advise the rapporteur to go and look at the ZEPs - the priority education areas - in France's suburbs and see where such worthy sentiments lead."
"In fact, they merely equate to abandonment, in our own countries, of the idea of imposing respect for our cultures, our customs and our mores on those who come asking for our hospitality."
"Our education systems should not have to be adapted to the cultures of other peoples."
"It is up to the migrant populations to adapt to our cultures if they intend to stay in our countries."
"(IT)Mr President, I wish merely to underscore the need to express strong support for the call that was supported this morning by an opportune decision."
"It is inconceivable that the possibility of acknowledging polygamous marriage was mentioned, even only in passing, in a European Union document, particularly a document voted on by the European Parliament."
"This has nothing to do with the culture of the European Union."
"There should be no room in the European Union legal area for stances of this kind - they are against our tradition, which is the tradition of Christian Europe, and they express, among other things, the principle of crushing women's rights."
"Therefore the decision taken this morning was very important, but the seriously irresponsible act of including a note such as this in a European Parliament document is very worrying."
"(PL) Mr President, I could not endorse Mrs VÄlean's report."
"It allows a situation where the law contradicts itself, violating the principle of subsidiarity, promoting the reunification of families from third countries which have a different culture, and also allowing polygamy."
"It creates legal chaos."
"As we all know, different definitions of 'family' and 'family member' are used in different EU countries."
"Rights are different, for example the right of inheritance, family law is different, and so is the right to receive social service benefits."
"Creation of a right to social benefit claims without the consent of the host country and without taking account of the economic situation may lead to serious social conflicts."
"I protest against the constant breaches of the principle of subsidiarity in this Chamber."
"Mr President, I am very privileged this morning to be sitting next to Mr Daniel Hannan, my very good colleague, whose speech a few weeks ago has revolutionised the transmission of information and political thought and will change it for the future."
"The power of the Internet is supremely important, but is even more important over the regular media."
"I voted against this report for one simple reason, which is that I am not in favour of promoting European citizenship."
"I am a British citizen and am proud to be so, and what we should be about is promoting the individual citizenship of our individual countries and saying, yes, we are members of the European Union as countries, but we are not European citizens."
"We are citizens of the countries which gave us our birth and infant nurture, which protect us and which have given many of us sanctuary over the years."
"That is the pride which I have and will continue to have in the years to come."
"(FR) Mr President, the ancient Greeks have already discussed the questions with which we are concerned."
"In their associations of city states, they discussed the respective merits of isopoliteia, or identical citizenship, which gave to each person the same rights in one city as in another, and sympoliteia, or common citizenship."
"It will not surprise you to learn that I am resolutely in favour of the first of these arrangements."
"In fact, European citizenship is highly artificial in nature."
"The rapporteur regrets above all that the citizens are unaware of the rights that it would give them."
"However I note that, whenever these citizens are asked for their opinion, for example on the European constitution or on its unfathomable avatar, the Treaty of Lisbon, and they answer no, at such times their opinion is deliberately ignored."
"This is why these supposedly generous constructions on common citizenship seem to me to be largely hypocritical and I would prefer to replace it with the mutual recognition of rights between allied, yet still sovereign nations."
"Mr President, citizenship defines who we are."
"It is the bedrock of our identity."
"I am a British citizen and I am proud of that, not least because of the vicious campaign of the IRA to try and coerce me and my constituents out of that citizenship - something which, thankfully, they have failed to do."
"Citizenship lies in Member States."
"It should not be diverted and it should not be shared."
"Thus I reject this contrivance of European citizenship, which of course is a complement to the ongoing efforts to be advanced by the Lisbon Treaty to build the statehood of the EU and thus this notion that we all have to be, whether we like it or not, want it or not, EU citizens first and foremost."
"I reject that philosophy as I reject the Lisbon Treaty."
"Mr President, this is becoming a bit of a familiar refrain, to agree with my colleagues."
"I voted against this report because, of course, I also completely reject the whole concept of European citizenship."
"I believe that citizenship is unique to nation states, and I believe that all of the efforts that are behind this attempt to construct a European citizenship are related to the same attempts to conduct a European superstate."
"Many of my constituents and myself are also unhappy about being forced to become, effectively, European citizens."
"They see citizenship as something to be affirmed or rejected, based on a common set of values and ideals built up over the centuries."
"None of us have been given any say, any referendum or any consultation whatsoever on whether we wish or do not wish to become European citizens."
"Of course there should be a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty."
"But we should also be asked whether we wish to be European citizens in addition to our nation citizenship."
"We have no right to renounce European citizenship, even if we completely reject - as I do - the whole concept of such a thing."
"Mr President, I am not, first and foremost, a European Union citizen."
"I am an Irish citizen and, as a complementary adjunct to that, I am a European citizen."
"I have learned a lot here today."
"I did not realise our British colleagues were citizens."
"I thought they were subjects."
"But I have no difficulty with the words 'subjects' and 'citizens'."
"You can be Scottish, Welsh or English, but you have to be Scottish, Welsh or English, or one of those people in Ireland who take on the British citizenship, to be British."
"There is no such thing as a British citizen if you are not Irish from Northern Ireland, Scottish, Welsh or English."
"I really do not understand the point that has been made here today."
"These are complementary adjuncts to our national citizenships and I certainly have no difficulty whatsoever with that."
"People are making a mountain out of a molehill because we are in the run-up to the elections, and are using this constant anti-European rhetoric to put forward their own interests rather than the interests of the countries they are supposed to serve."
"Mr President, may I concur with the last speaker."
"Some of our colleagues seem to have a very narrow, unidimensional, view of citizenship and, indeed, of identity."
"Yet we are all multifaceted: I support England in football, because I am English and that is part of my identity;"
"I support Britain at the Olympic Games in athletics, because that is a wider dimension to my identity; and I support the European golf team in the Ryder Cup against the United States - and I suspect that even the honorable Member who made the remarks just now does too."
"These are different dimensions to our identity and our citizenship."
"They are not contradictory but complementary."
"Of course, no citizenship of that kind has been attributed by referendum."
"There was never a referendum for me to be English or to have British citizenship - which has been changed from being a subject - nor has there been a referendum on the treaties which, nearly two decades ago, created the notion of European citizenship, linking it specifically to certain rights that we have and that we enjoy throughout Europe, nothing more and nothing less."
"Mr President, I supported this report because I believe it continues the crucial work done by this House in linking our commitment to the environment to our need to deliver Member States out of the current financial crisis. But also, because every aspect of our economy and society is affected, we need to take a holistic approach to economic and environmental recovery."
"I worked in housing for 18 years and I am concerned that sufficient attention has not been paid to housing and energy, especially at construction time, as housing contributes significantly to carbon emissions."
"Focusing on cohesion policy is a sensible way for us to fulfil our obligation to communities and economies."
"Change, as much else, begins at home."
"Using the European Development Fund monies to complement regional and local authorities' schemes for double glazing, insulation and solar panels or for replacing old boilers for more energy-efficient ones is an excellent example of how the European Union can help Member States to meet targets which will be of benefit to all European citizens."
"Mr President, when I saw the title of the report, 'Investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy for housing', I was impressed."
"No one could disagree with that in these times of concern over climate change, whatever one thinks about that."
"We all agree that there should be better energy efficiency and better energy conservation."
"But surely the European Parliament should be setting an example."
"How can we talk about energy efficiency, how can we talk about conservation, when we continue to have three European Parliament buildings?"
"We have a building in Strasbourg that is only used for 12 weeks in the year and continues to emit CO2 and waste energy when we are not there, an office building in Luxembourg that Members never visit (and we are now building another building in Luxembourg) and we have this Chamber here in Brussels."
"It is time to stop the hypocrisy on energy efficiency, to lead by example and to only have one Parliament building."
"(PL) Mr President, in view of the difficulties concerning visa procedures, it is essential that they be simplified, including by reducing the costs borne by the applicant."
"This will help better cultural exchange and cooperation between the EU and third countries."
"I think it is essential to simplify visa procedures for people who have family in Member States."
"I will give Poland as an example."
"For hundreds of years the history of Poland has been intertwined with the history of countries like Ukraine and Belarus, where a significant Polish minority lives."
"These people do not hold Polish citizenship, but they often cross the border to visit their relatives."
"The greatest possible simplification of visa procedures is, therefore, necessary for people who have gained the trust of the visa office by not breaking any of the visa regulations."
"I think it is significant that the introduction of biometric identifiers will facilitate exchange of data and help the future integration of the visa system, facilitating the visa process itself and also improving security throughout the EU."
"The report is important for development of contacts between the EU and third countries."
"Mr President, once again, I voted in favour of this report because I believe, if we are to make strides in fighting climate change, we need to make choosing green products easier for the consumer."
"Although my region - the West Midlands - is one of the only landlocked areas of the UK, we are, of course, consumers of fish and fish products, which this report refers to."
"By introducing a voluntary scheme such as ecolabels, we can encourage a market in more energy-efficient and ecologically kinder goods."
"This will fit in with other market-based solutions to climate change, such as tax reductions on eco-friendly goods."
"My constituents tell me that they are happy to make different choices if buying them and buying green products makes it easier for them."
"We will need to publicise the scheme better if it is to have the desired effect, and it will require better marketing but also standardisation and harmonisation of the information it displays if it is to be of real use to consumers."
"A good model is the report on energy efficiency of tyres, which I have been working on and which presents similar details in a clear, concise manner."
"(DE) Mr President, we, the German conservative group (CDU/CSU), voted against Mrs Buitenweg's report."
"We oppose discrimination of all kinds, but we do not believe that a comprehensive framework directive at European level is really the right way to protect those affected."
"Ten Member States have still not transposed the existing anti-discrimination directive at all."
"Despite that, a simple majority of this House - not a qualified majority - did vote in favour of this extension today."
"It would give rise to considerable additional bureaucracy and unnecessary costs - something that the public has little understanding for."
"Improvements can be made in relation to insurance and in the structural adaptation measures relating to disabled entrances, and the requirement for a law on class actions could be eliminated, but we foresee serious problems for the Member States if, for example, we were forced to include the concept 'belief' in the prohibited grounds for discrimination."
"The consequence of this would be that extremists and sects, such as Scientology, for example, would be able to invoke the protection of the directive."
"We are also opposed to granting complete equivalence of status to traditional and same-sex marriages."
"In the Commission's view, the transposal of the directive requires that same-sex partners, insofar as they may be legally recognised in a given Member State, should also receive the same rights as married couples. We are opposed to that idea."
"We therefore voted against the report and in favour of referring the proposal back to the Commission."
"Mr President, I abstained on this matter for two reasons."
"First of all, we all accept some discrimination."
"In all our countries we have religious schools - Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Jewish - and there is an element of discrimination in those schools because the people who are primarily accepted there are of that faith."
"I support that."
"I support faith schools."
"But the principal reason why I abstained was because this turns the whole principle of jurisprudence upside down."
"We are innocent until we are proved guilty."
"That is a cardinal principle, certainly of English law, and I dare say of law in many other European Union countries."
"This turns the burden of proof the other way round, and that, frankly, is unacceptable."
"Of course we are all against discrimination."
"We are all in favour of equal treatment, but we have to recognise that the principles of law which have guided us throughout the ages remain in place."
"That is why I abstained."
"(FR) Mr President, I am one of those members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats who voted for the report."
"I did so because I think that Parliament must send out a strong signal, with this vote, in favour of non-discrimination, and there are certainly other much more important factors than those that have just been mentioned."
"In fact, in the Member States there are situations where children are denied education in their mother tongue, where use of the latter is prohibited."
"We are a world away from the real situation."
"It is therefore right to send out a signal, as Parliament has done with my support."
"There certainly remains much to do in this task of gaining greater awareness of others, and we are far from the dialogue of cultures on which we vowed to make progress in 2008."
"I regret all of the controversy that has surrounded this report."
"Mr President, in the 27 countries of the European Union we have a proud tradition, developed over the last decades, of fighting together against discrimination, and of making discrimination illegal and something to be discouraged."
"What this report does is to correct an anomaly."
"We have legislation on our statute book which rightly prohibits discrimination on grounds of race and gender in the workplace and elsewhere, but discrimination on grounds of disability or age or sexual orientation is prohibited only in the workplace but not elsewhere - not in consumer protection and not in other situations which citizens can find themselves in and being discriminated against."
"It is right that we correct that anomaly."
"The large majority today sends a powerful signal to the Council, and I look forward to adoption in the near future."
"(NL) Mr President, I enumerated a number of arguments in yesterday's debate as to why the amendments and proposals in the Buitenweg report are unacceptable to me, possibly more so than the original Commission proposal for an anti-discrimination directive itself."
"Even with the amendments we voted on today, it still is an unacceptable violation of the principle of subsidiarity."
"It generates an enormous amount of red tape which is very costly and creates huge obstacles for the Member States."
"Above all, it bears witness to exceptional levels of distrust in respect of the Member States themselves."
"The problem with texts of this kind that incorporate all manner of things is that they also contain a few good points, of course."
"I would like to use this explanation of vote, insofar as is necessary, to confirm that it goes without saying that I am all in favour of major efforts being made by the whole Community for the benefit of the disabled, for example."
"Here too, though, I am convinced that things are best left to the Member States to organise."
"Mr President, this report rests on a conceptual misunderstanding."
"Outside this Chamber, equality means the right of people to be treated the same."
"Here in this Chamber, we are using it to mean the right of people to be treated differently."
"That is a critical point."
"Anti-discrimination legislation of this kind is not a refinement of the principle of equality under the law."
"It is an opposing principle."
"When we pass such reports as this, we take power away from people that one can vote for - and vote against - and give it arbitrarily to jurists."
"If this report were applied literally, it would prohibit an opera company from declining to hire men in soprano roles, it would prohibit a Labour politician from declining to have a Conservative as their press spokesman, and it would prohibit a Catholic school or hospital from preferring to employ its own co-religionists."
"When I made these points, the answer from the report's supporters was that it would not be used that way, and that everyone knows what it really means."
"I have to say that it strikes me as very bad jurisprudence to criminalise everything in theory and then rely on the courts arbitrarily to disapply the law."
"(FR) Mr President, the great Catholic philosopher Chesterton said that the modern world was full of Christian ideas gone mad."
"I believe that this report by Mrs Buitenweg is a perfect illustration of this."
"It is a text that starts off with worthy sentiments to avoid acts of discrimination that disabled people, for example, might suffer, only to become truly totalitarian by making a fundamental conceptual error, in other words by not differentiating between legitimate differences and unfair acts of discrimination."
"It is, for example, natural for a child to have the right to a father and a mother, even where he or she is adopted."
"This right must take precedence over the right of persons of the same sex to adopt a child."
"It is natural for distinctions to be made on the basis of nationality."
"It is natural for the French, the British, the Czechs and the Lithuanians to have priority over foreigners in their own countries, in the same way that it is natural for these foreigners to have priority in their countries over European citizens."
"These are perfectly legitimate distinctions ignored by this text which, moreover, does away with the presumption of innocence."
"This is a real step towards the soft totalitarianism that is this new doctrine of political correctness."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while 10 of the 27 Member States are embroiled in an on-going court case due to their failure to transpose the first directive, we have today still seen a simple majority in this House vote to lay a second directive on top of the first."
"I, personally - along with the majority of my group - voted 'no'."
"Why was that?"
"I will mention two examples."
"From experience in my Franconian home, I know of the efforts of political extremists, neo-Nazis and left-wing radicals attempting to acquire property and thereby generate widespread publicity in their favour."
"If this is implemented, the equal treatment directive will mean that owners and our landlords will now, in some cases, have to make deals that they had hitherto been able to refuse."
"For that reason I voted against Mrs Buitenweg's report today."
"Another reason is that, in the amendment today, we reversed the reversal of the burden of proof and with it a fundamental element of our state under the rule of law."
"I regard that as completely illegitimate."
"The third point relates to newspapers and publishers, whose freedom to refuse to publish items by extremists would be curtailed by this directive."
"That, in my view, is a clear intrusion on the freedom of the press and something that I therefore reject."
"Mr President, I was delighted to support this report because I have always fought against all types of discrimination."
"I think it is vital that we have a framework to prevent exploitation of people because of their religion, age, disability, education or marital status."
"Without protection against discrimination on these grounds, our ambitions for a social Europe will be meaningless."
"This will particularly be the case during the current economic situation."
"There is always a temptation during these difficult times to exploit those who are less able to defend themselves, to cut corners when it comes to regulation designed precisely to protect against such exploitation."
"In my constituency, the West Midlands, we are threatened with the rise of far-right politics."
"I believe Europe has a key role to play in ensuring people know they are protected in the face of aggression and exploitation."
"Mr President, I voted against this report for the fundamental reason that I believe these subjects have nothing at all to do with the European Union."
"I do not believe there is any need for European legislation in these matters."
"I think very sensitive, traditional matters such as this are much better handled at Member State level, where individual national parliaments can take account of the fundamental culture, traditions and legal systems that are in their own particular countries."
"A number of other Members have raised issues about the particular problems that will be caused by this - the problems for religious groups being forced to employ somebody from a different religious base, the problem in faith schools, and the problem of different political parties wanting to employ people of their own beliefs and values."
"Essentially, the fundamental problem with this is that it takes power away from us, as elected politicians or national politicians, and puts it in the hands of unelected judges to interpret and re-interpret the legislation in ways that were never envisaged at all by the very well-meaning sentiments of some of the authors of this report."
"But I believe that, fundamentally, we are opening a huge can of worms."
"(PL) Mr President, I voted against the report on equal treatment of persons, despite, and perhaps precisely because, I am opposed to discrimination."
"Adoption of that document would in particular mean consenting to the legally guaranteed, equal access of paedophiles to jobs where they would have direct contact with children, which would constitute a threat to children."
"It would mean consenting to the publications and public appearances of fascist groups and religious cults, a ban on educational and charitable centres run by churches in their communities, which would seriously hamper social action, and it would open up broader possibilities for discrimination against Christians."
"The document breaches the principle of subsidiarity, which is becoming an increasingly common practice in the European Parliament."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to convey the huge surprise and disappointment of people with disabilities and people with special needs, who were expecting to be offered a framework directive in the present parliamentary term, so that the Member States would adapt their legislation and there would be no discriminatory treatment of this group of people, who may be represented by huge European trades union but who cannot personally express their intention to obtain protection."
"Mr President, I had concerns relating to the wording of the Commission proposal - but no legislation is perfect."
"I voted for both parts of recital 17, Amendment 28."
"It was my intention to vote for the original text, but I did not wish to vote against the amendment wording which, though not as strong as the original text in relation to rights of Member States, did address my concerns sufficiently, and it was clear it would be overwhelmingly carried."
"I therefore would not have had the opportunity to vote for the original text, which would have fallen in those circumstances, I could, therefore, have appeared to vote against a principle, and that I did not wish to do."
"Having examined the text in depth, I am satisfied that the proposal will serve to improve the access to goods and services for people with disabilities without making any unnecessary references to text that can be inferred as abortion."
"I firmly believe that it is vital to put in place mechanisms that allow the disabled to travel within the European Union on an equal footing as every other citizen."
"Europe has over 50 million disabled citizens, and it is therefore imperative that we make every measure to improve their well-being."
"It is for that reason that I voted for the report."
"Mr President, I supported the resolution on the evaluation of the EU-Belarus dialogue."
"I voted 'yes' because I welcome the increased high level EU-Belarus dialogue, including bilateral contacts, and the intensified technical cooperation initiated by the Commission."
"At the same time, I would like to point out that the political dialogue between the EU and Belarus must be conditional on, and directly connected to, the lifting of restrictions on freedoms and cessation of the repression of participants in peaceful demonstrations and human rights activists."
"I insist that the democratic opposition in Belarus and civil society be included in the dialogue between the EU and Belarus."
"Last but not least, I hope that the Government of Belarus will use the next nine months to achieve substantial progress in a number of areas, including freedom of association and the granting of political rights and freedoms."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution as it provides a balanced and realistic overview of the relations between the European Union and Belarus."
"President Lukashenko seems to be seeking better relations with both the European Union and the Russian Federation."
"The release of political prisoners a year ago was the first sign of the Lukashenko regime's willingness to meet the demands of the EU and engage in serious dialogue."
"Although the palliation of the regime's oppression can be considered an improvement, a true regime transition has not started yet."
"I believe that the involvement of the democratic opposition in Belarus, as well as civil society, is vital for a meaningful dialogue between the European Union and Belarus and eventually the key to the successful process of democratisation."
"(NL) Mr President, the joint motion for a resolution which we adopted today contains many points that are worthy of promotion."
"For example, I agree with the fact that the sacrifices that very many people have made in the fight against totalitarian regimes of the 21st century in Europe should not be forgotten."
"I should nevertheless like to make a few comments."
"It is regrettable that there is no mention of the allies of these totalitarian regimes who, until very recently, held nearly the whole of Eastern Europe in their grip."
"It is true that so-called right-wing politicians have made precious few efforts to demand democratisation in Eastern Europe, but it is even truer that very many left-wing politicians actively supported these Communist regimes, even though they play the holy innocent today, even in this Parliament."
"Secondly, we should really have the courage, with this report, to take a stand against the muzzling laws."
"Historical research, however difficult, should be carried out in a delicate way, with due respect for the victims, but in complete freedom."
"It is unfortunate that we have let both these opportunities slip."
"(ET) I support the passing of the said resolution, which was born out of co-operation between four political groups."
"The document is balanced, and one could say this about it: better late than never."
"Actually, it is the most we can do in this House together in the name of justice."
"We owe our parents and grandparents a firm parliamentary message, and that is what we have produced today."
"It is also, however, our obligation to prevent the recurrence of what we have discussed, using the funds at our disposal."
"Truth and memory have an important role in connection with this."
"Our duty is to ensure respect for the principles of the rule of law."
"Mr President, this resolution recalls the horrors of Fascism and of Soviet Communism."
"No European, no child of Western civilisation, no civilised human being could disagree."
"But it then goes on to posit the European Union as an alternative or antidote to such totalitarianism."
"It reads: 'the European Union has a particular responsibility to promote and safeguard democracy, both inside and outside the European Union'."
"It is here, my friends, that you make your bloomer."
"The European Union is not safeguarding democracy, either internally or externally."
"Abroad it is doing business with Castro's Cuba, with the Ayatollahs in Tehran; it is demanding the right to sell arms to Communist China."
"At home it is striking down referendum results when they go against closer integration."
"Now of course, one has to be careful making such parallels."
"No one is arguing that the European Union is a Soviet system that takes away people's passports or runs Gulags or operates show trials."
"But it should deeply worry us when any system claims that the ruling ideology is too important to be subjected to the ballot box."
"(FR) Mr President, it is pleasing to see national socialism put on the same footing as communism and included in a general condemnation of the totalitarian regimes that bathed the 20th century in blood but, nonetheless, found great favour with many intellectuals, who have never been held to account and many of whom remain amongst the ranks of our most prominent figures."
"It is pleasing to see that a number of amendments that tended to contaminate this text have been withdrawn."
"However, I do not believe that it is possible, for example, to make the official history of this dark period in our past sacrosanct, or to condemn dissenting voices."
"It is absolutely astonishing that, in France, the communist-inspired Guessot law should further control historical debate with the threat of severe criminal sanctions."
"Our fellow Member, Jacques Toubon, called it Stalinist when it was adopted."
"Well, his friend, Mr Barrot, the Justice Commissioner, is proposing to extend it to all the countries of the Union that do not have it and even to triple the accompanying sanctions and prison sentences."
"It is not with totalitarian methods that one can fight totalitarianism."
"(ET) I feel that I should explain why I supported this resolution, in contrast to many others from my political faction, and in particular why I supported the version my faction did not support."
"I cannot agree with the rhetoric that this is an attempt to rewrite history."
"A large part of the history of Eastern Europe is unwritten, or at least few are aware of it, and precisely the part that concerns crimes connected with communism."
"Nor can I support the approach that we should let historians decide what happened."
"I believe that it is our moral obligation, and I am glad that this resolution has been passed today."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me this opportunity to explain how I voted on this issue."
"There were two interesting sentences in the report that merit further attention."
"The first recognised that Communism and Nazism have a common legacy and called for an honest and thorough debate to be conducted on all the totalitarian crimes of the past century."
"The other sentence which stuck out was 'calls for a pan-European public academic debate on the nature, history and legacy of totalitarian regimes on the basis of an international legal framework'."
"I really wonder whether there is need for such a debate."
"It is quite clear what the common thread is between Soviet socialism and National Socialism."
"The clue is in the phrase, and the answer is 'socialism'."
"When Socialist MPs try to ban an MEP from chairing the first session of the next Parliament, no matter how vile his views are, that is an attack on free speech."
"When the British socialist Government refuses to honour its manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, that is an act of intolerance."
"We should be careful it is not the first step towards totalitarianism."
"(IT) Mr President, Soviet totalitarianism did not only imprisoned people."
"Unfortunately it also imprisoned history and its documents."
"Millions of pages of history have been kept hidden in the secret archives that still exist in Moscow."
"Entire trains transferred millions of historical documents, some stolen from the Germans but most looted directly or, as in Italy, obtained through communist partisans."
"We would like our history to be accessible."
"Europe must demand this, it must achieve it."
"We would like access to documents that cannot be consulted: for example, on the holocaust of Italian military prisoners, who underwent attempts at brainwashing and were held without food, many under worse conditions than in the Nazi prison camps, who died amidst a thousand forms of suffering and under torture, including psychological torture, by the Soviet communist agitprop machinery but sadly also inflicted by Italian communists."
"(EL) Mr President, the New Democracy group of MEPs, which belongs to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, roundly condemns any form of totalitarianism and, at the same time, underlines the importance of remembering the past."
"This is an important element in our history."
"However, we believe that majority decisions by Parliament are not competent to interpret historic facts."
"The evaluation of historic facts is the job of historians and historians alone."
"That is why we decided to abstain from the vote on the joint motion for a resolution by the four political groups, including the PPE-DE Group, on European conscience and totalitarianism."
"Mr President has this House no sense of self-awareness?"
"We pass a resolution condemning totalitarianism and then, seconds later, we pass a resolution calling on Brussels to fund cultural policy in the regions."
"My friends, culture cannot be created by bureaucratic fiat."
"It grows organically; it develops naturally within a people and, in its way, this report precisely demonstrates the structural flaw at the heart of the European project."
"The Brussels institutions are not rooted in any nation, in any demos, in any cultural unit."
"But rather than accepting that and trying to suit our institutions to public opinion, we attempt to suit public opinion to our pre-existing institutions."
"If we really want to win our publics over, we cannot do it by subsidising folk dancing."
"The way of doing it is by treating their opinions with respect and that means - as you see I have not yet said it today - putting the Lisbon Treaty to a vote."
"Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!"
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution, and there are at least two important issues in the document I would like to clarify my position on."
"At the beginning of his term in office, President Medvedev made a public commitment to strengthen the rule of law in Russia and raised concerns over the independence of Russia's judiciary and legal system."
"This is pointed out in our resolution, and I support the position."
"It is time for action."
"It is time to prove the President's words were not just pure rhetoric the international community wanted to hear."
"In our resolution we also raised concerns with the Russian Government regarding its decision to recognise Abkhazia and South Ossetia as sovereign states, to sign military assistance and cooperation agreements with the de facto authorities of those two provinces and to establish military bases there."
"Those steps undermine the territorial integrity of Georgia as insisted upon in the relevant United Nations resolutions."
"So we should call on Russia once again to reverse its decision and to maintain that Russia cannot be regarded as an impartial moderator in the peace process."
"Mr President, thank you very much indeed for calling me, and I apologise for being missing when you called me earlier."
"It is kind of you to bring me on now."
"I just want to use the opportunity of this vote, in which I voted in favour, to express a warning about the rising power of the Soviet Union and the atmosphere in that country."
"We all had high hopes when Communism fell, but in parts of the former Soviet Union, and particularly in Russia, there is now an atmosphere of fear, an atmosphere of nationalism - an atmosphere that is, I am afraid, unacceptable."
"Although the European Union has to have relations with the Russian Government, we must remind that Government at all times that we demand that the democratic state and the democratic ethos should always prevail, and that attempts to censor views that are not acceptable to the Government, or to put politicians under unfair pressure, will not be acceptable to the European Union."
"That is something we should make clear at all times."
"(FR) Mr President, I voted in favour of Mrs Ries's report on health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields."
"It is true that electromagnetic fields occur naturally, but the demand for electricity and especially the development of wireless technologies has led to a rapid increase in the amount of electromagnetic waves to which people are exposed."
"We must therefore be vigilant, and the European Parliament has fully appreciated this."
"As a Member for France's North-West constituency, I can confirm the threat presented by some very high-voltage power lines installed in my constituency, close to schools and health institutions, especially those located in the dÃ©partement of La Manche, where local workers and residents are highly exposed to the emitted waves."
"As scientists do not agree on the consequences of electromagnetic fields for the health of our fellow citizens, we ought to be responsible and apply the precautionary principle."
"The limit values should therefore be regularly updated to guarantee the public a suitable level of protection."
"The European Parliament wished here to draw the European Commission's attention to this subject, which justifiably concerns the public."
"The European Union has a duty to do more on the issue of establishing a clear-cut policy in the area of electromagnetic waves, by giving more information to the public on this issue and by adopting binding Community legislation."
"(CS) One of the objectives we outlined in Lisbon in 2000 was a knowledge-based society."
"Although we now know that we will have to scale back our objectives, or rather that we will achieve them later, we must not slacken in our efforts to achieve them."
"I too have therefore backed the report of Mr Schmitt, which attempts to identify potential problems in the area of education that must be tackled."
"Education is indeed most often the foundation for achieving our objectives."
"Levels of educational attainment have a direct influence on the employment opportunities of young people and therefore also on their social inclusion and despite the current economic crisis we must not allow this potential to be wasted."
"(ET) I also voted in favour of this report, because the issue is very important."
"There are many problems in this area."
"We cannot stand idly by and watch while at least six million students drop out of European schools each year."
"What does that mean to them?"
"It means the failure of their future prospects in life."
"This is where the 21st century school can be of assistance - such a school would be characterised by a favourable social climate, the use of different pedagogical methods, openness and flexibility, as well as the encouragement of the practice of life-long learning."
"Europe is ageing."
"We are not rich enough to be able to postpone dealing with this topic."
"All children must obtain an education that gives them fair opportunities in the world we live in today."
"Our young people must be able to compete, and not only able to compete, but educational policy must contribute to the development of an individual's identity."
"(NL) Mr President, I should like to thank the interpreters for working overtime."
"All I wanted to add is that I have voted emphatically against the Schmitt report, not least because education, to my mind, is a competence that should remain in Member State hands, as it is not really Europe's concern."
"This is a fundamental issue."
"I also have other objections to the Schmitt report, though. For example, the fact that this report is based on the idea that the education systems in the various European countries should simply adjust to the presence of non-European immigrants, rather than the other way round."
"It is beyond me how this position can be squared with integration, let alone the promotion of assimilation, as the exact opposite of this will be the result."
"This report, as ever, also contains the obligatory Roma paragraph, of course, again without asking who is, in fact, responsible for what."
"It also states that the Member States should ensure that immigrant children should be taught in their own mother tongues and that the teaching staff should specifically reflect the multicultural society."
"Forgive me for saying this, but this is a politically correct report that creates more problems than it solves."
"I have voted in favour of Mr Parish's report on the proposal for a Council decision correcting Directive 2008/73/EC simplifying procedures of listing and publishing information in the veterinary and zootechnical fields."
"I voted in favour of the report on Community statistics on the information society as information and communication technologies make an important contribution to productivity in the European Union and to the growth of GDP."
"The purpose of this regulation is to guarantee the continuation of the existing common framework in order to produce systematically Community statistics on the information society which are reliable, harmonised, supplied on time and of high quality, as well as to supply annual statistics on the use of ITC in companies and households."
"I support those provisions aimed at simplifying the administrative procedures incumbent upon the public authorities (Community or national) as well as on private individuals."
"I believe that there is a permanent need at European level to supply consistent statistics on the information society every year."
"I support the implementation of the i2010 strategy."
"This promotes an open, competitive digital economy and underlines the key role played by ICT in terms of inclusion and quality of life."
"This strategy is regarded as a fundamental element in the revitalised Lisbon partnership for growth and jobs."
"I have voted in favour of Mrs Niebler's report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 808/2004 concerning Community statistics on the information society."
"I believe that the amendments tabled are essential because they are useful for compiling harmonised, reliable, timely and high-quality Community statistics on the information society."
"I voted for adoption of the report on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation amending Annex 11 to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products."
"I agree with the remarks of the rapporteur concerning further integration of both markets."
"The Agreement would contribute to an improvement in productivity of both partners' agricultural sectors and help to bring food prices to a fair and relatively stable level for citizens."
"Nonetheless, I agree with the view that both parties should negotiate with caution towards full liberalisation of trade exchange."
"The volume of bilateral trade is significant and removal of the trade barrier would have a strong impact, especially on the agricultural economy of EU countries neighbouring Switzerland and on Swiss farmers."
"in writing. - (IT) I have voted in favour of the report by Mr Glattfelder, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation amending Annex 11 to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products;"
"I have voted in favour of Mr Varvitsiotis's report on the mutual recognition to decisions on supervision measures."
"I believe, in fact, that supervision measures should be considered an exceptional measure that should be weighed carefully with regard to the right to freedom and to the presumption of innocence."
"Sadly, I have to agree with the rapporteur when he states that so far it has not been possible to recognise measures other than supervision measures across borders, because no specific instrument of mutual recognition exists."
"This is an obstacle to the legal protection of individual rights, and an aspect that we must discuss again."
"I voted in favour of Mrs JÃ¶ns's report as I support extension of the types of costs eligible for a contribution from the European Social Fund."
"I think that the amendments proposed in the report will enable faster implementation of the Fund and simplify the management, administration and control of operations benefiting from ESF cofinancing."
"I would like to stress the need to simplify the procedures concerning the allocation of financing from the Structural Funds."
"It has been noted that delays recorded in the implementation of the regional development policy are due in part to overly restrictive procedures imposed by European legislation."
"Finally, it is vital that these are simplified."
"in writing. - I support this regulation which will allow faster and more efficient access to European funds in order to prevent unemployment and fight social exclusion during the crisis."
"The aim of the proposal is to add a further, simpler, method of spending the European Social Fund, so that its contribution to addressing the economic and social challenges facing Europe during the crisis can be faster and more effective."
"The proposal is limited to introducing a simplification into the operations of the European Social Fund to encourage the effective, efficient and fast uptake of available resources, without compromising the principles of sound financial management."
"I voted in favour of Mrs JÃ¶ns's report on extending the types of costs eligible for a contribution from the ESF."
"I agree with the Commission's proposal aiming to introduce an additional, simpler method of using European Social Fund reserves to ensure that it can react more quickly and effectively to the economic and social difficulties that Europe is facing."
"I am also pleased that the ESF will continue to support actions to extend and improve investments in human capital, particularly by strengthening education and training systems, and those aimed at developing institutional capacities and at making public administrations more efficient at national, regional and local level."
"in writing. -The European Parliament welcomes the Commission's swift action in proposing the amendments to this legislation, which will undoubtedly help to overcome the negative impact of the unexpected financial crisis, but regrets that other important amendments are not planned."
"The amendment package was perceived as an answer to a temporary, but extremely critical situation; nevertheless it completely satisfies the demand for greater simplification of procedures and for more flexible application of existing rules in accordance with the Structural Funds Regulations, which were offered repeatedly by the European Parliament in recent years."
"If the Community and national funding shares can be distributed more flexibly throughout the whole programming period, a flood of money will immediately be directed at national economies, which is essential if we are to react to their current budget restrictions."
"After a careful reading of Mrs GarcÃ­a PÃ©rez's recommendation on the ERDF, ESF and Cohesion Fund, I do not feel that the European economy can receive a serious boost from the publication by the European Commission of a communication entitled 'A European economic recovery plan', containing a set of specific measures intended to stimulate investments and to allocate additional public funds to the national economies, which are faced with severe budgetary constraints."
"Mrs Takkula's report raises a significant social problem."
"I think we should make it easier for children from third countries to be educated in the language of the country in which they are staying, in order to ensure that they have equal opportunity to gain tertiary qualifications."
"This is the first and a fundamental step towards full integration into society."
"As we strive to make migrants integrate, it is especially important to give more support to language courses; integration is a dual process, in which migrants and the host country participate."
"Migrants' willingness to learn the language of the host country and take control of their lives does not mean that they are giving up the language or culture of their country of origin."
"Learning languages (languages of both the country of birth and residence) must be promoted very early on, even before the primary education stage, with the aim, above all, of encouraging migrants and national minorities like Roma for example, to become involved in European society."
"Lifelong learning is important for migrants, ethnic minorities and socio-economically disadvantaged groups, as this is a process of integration, and participation in study programmes and lifelong learning offer opportunities to newly arrived immigrants."
"Particular attention must be paid to the normally poor results of the activities of migrants, ethnic minorities and socio-economically disadvantaged groups, and the sooner and better they are integrated into schools, the more successful they will be in school, as well as in further education and the labour market."
"Every child has a right to education."
"The integration of migrants, whether residing legally or illegally, is a priority for us socialists."
"We do not accept the hierarchy that the parliamentary right wishes to create amongst migrants."
"This is why I abstained from the vote on Mr Takkula's excellent report on educating the children of migrants."
"I did so because, as it is an own-initiative report, it was not possible for us to take separate votes to call for the removal of paragraphs 5, 8 and 16, which I find absolutely unsatisfactory."
"It is by educating the children of migrants that we will make an important contribution to the integration of all, irrespective of their status."
"It is by introducing favourable socioeconomic conditions that we will be able to give greater assistance to migrants, whether they reside legally in Europe, or whether they are destined to be granted legal residence or ultimately sent back to their own country."
"We should not create a status for these children whereby they are not educated and are ghettoised merely because their parents are residing illegally."
"That is simply contrary to the international conventions."
"'The content and organisation of education and training are national competences.'"
"This is laid down in one of the first paragraphs of Mr Takkula's own-initiative report on educating the children of migrants."
"However, before long we will be discussing what to include in the curriculum, what kind of teacher training we should have and what Member States need to do, in order to 'involve young migrants in a wide range of extracurricular activities'."
"Although it is important to ensure that all children, including those of migrants, receive as good an education as possible, I do wonder whether this issue should actually be dealt with at EU level."
"I think the answer lies in the paragraph quoted above."
"I vote in favour of a slimmer but more focused EU."
"That is why I voted against this own-initiative report, even though I think that it deals with a very important issue that we need to look into in greater depth at national level."
"in writing. - I abstained on this report as a response to our Christian Democrat and Conservative colleagues blocking the oral amendment that would have made it clear that a right to education extends to all migrant children whether or not their parents are in the Union legally or not."
"The notion that we punish children for the sins of the parents is one we rightly oppose around the world, but apparently it is now OK within Europe."
"I can only admire the opportunistic hypocrisy of my Tory colleagues."
"We would once again point out that, in today's EU, the Member States have exclusive responsibility for the organisation of teaching."
"The draft statement contains a number of worthwhile ideas but, with due deference to the issue at hand here, we are of the opinion that this report goes beyond the scope of the European Union's competence."
"The principle of subsidiarity requires that this issue be dealt with by the Member States themselves."
"Under this principle, it follows that Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education should be abolished, because it addresses issues which are outside the EU's competence."
"For these reasons, we voted against this report."
"in writing. - I and my British Conservative colleagues are supportive of a number of the suggestions in this report, including training of teachers and pupils learning the languages of the host country."
"However, we believe that education policy is and should remain a Member State competence, and that any improvements and measures with regard to the education of children of migrants should be developed by Member States themselves."
"For these reasons, we have abstained on this report."
"in writing. - We fully support the notions of anti-discrimination and equality in access, and strongly believe in creating inclusive school systems and inclusive schools."
"We believe that actions should be taken to assist all vulnerable pupils."
"However, we believe that Member States are best suited for ensuring accessible and inclusive schooling for its citizens and residents alike."
"We believe that democratic control of the school system by the people it serves can only be ensured if the Member States formulate and implement education policy."
"in writing. - (DA) We voted in favour of the report on educating the children of immigrants, as the report addressed a current and relevant problem."
"However, we both believe that it should be the Member States that decide the extent of mother tongue teaching."
"In Denmark, the decision is left to the municipalities and we believe that should be respected."
"We believe that it is vital for children first and foremost to master the language of the host country so that they are not prevented later on from undertaking further education and gaining a foothold on the labour market."
"in writing. - (DE) For years now, the nationalistic and patriotic forces in the EU have been warning of the consequences of unchecked mass immigration."
"Concentrations of foreigners of 20, 50 or even 90% show that the multicultural vision has failed."
"School experiments with classes made up purely of foreigners have proven fruitless and even intensive language courses have their limits if the parents do not support their children."
"In Austria, language courses have been offered to parents for years, but here too the level of success leaves a lot to be desired."
"The disposition towards education is something that is passed on from one generation to the next, and when parents see education as pointless, then we are coming up against a brick wall, as has been demonstrated in France."
"The only solution is zero immigration or negative immigration, bringing an end to family members joining immigrants already in situ, and the willingness to integrate must at long last be something that is demanded."
"The EU's proposed solution - getting more teachers from immigrant backgrounds into schools - is divorced from the reality, and it is for this reason that I voted against this report."
"This report will make a highly valuable contribution to resolving the serious issue concerning the children of European citizens who live and work in Member States other than their country of origin."
"Many children of Romanian immigrants, for instance, face difficulties in this respect."
"It is just as important for them to have access to education in the language of the host country to facilitate integration, as well as to ensure that they also receive education in their mother tongue, especially based on the assumption that they might return to their country of origin."
"At this very moment, Romania, for example, is going through an experience which reflects this."
"Many Romanian pupils, children of emigrants who went to Spain or Italy, are returning home and being re-registered in Romanian schools by relatives."
"It is in the interest of these children and their future that they are reintegrated without any problems related to changing their school environment."
"Romania is by no means a unique case."
"Other Member States in Eastern Europe have faced and are still facing the same phenomenon, which makes it necessary to implement the proposals contained in this report as soon as possible."
"The Greek Communist Party voted against the report."
"The EU of imperialist interventions, of neo-colonial exploitation, of manhunts on immigrants, of attacks on the labour, social and democratic rights of its workers, cannot apply equal social integration of immigrants, part of which involves the equal provision of education to their children."
"Educating the children of migrants is not segregated from the EU's overall immigration policy, a policy characterised by harsh measures against those who are not required by big business and which qualifies as illegal immigration the selective legalisation and integration into work, of course on much less favourable terms, of immigrants who meet the needs of the monopolies."
"It is typical and unacceptable that the report refers solely to the children of legal immigrants."
"Just as migrant parents are the first victims of class exploitation, their children too are the first victims of class discrimination in education."
"The statistics on the drop-out rates of immigrants at the higher levels of education are illustrative."
"In the 2004-2005 academic year, the percentage of immigrants in compulsory education was 10.3% of all children, while in sixth-form colleges it was just 4%."
"Immigrants must fight against exploitation and the class barriers to education together with local workers through the class labour movement."
"I abstained from voting on Mr Takkula's report on educating the children of migrants."
"I do not feel in fact that I have any premises for voting for or against Mr Takkula's report."
"Every child has a right to education."
"The integration of migrants, whether residing legally or illegally, is a priority for us socialists."
"We do not accept the hierarchy that the parliamentary right wishes to create amongst migrants."
"This is why I abstained from the vote on Mr Takkula's excellent report on educating the children of migrants."
"I did so because, as it is an own-initiative report, it was not possible for us to take separate votes to call for the removal of paragraphs 5, 8 and 16, which I find absolutely unsatisfactory."
"It is by educating the children of migrants that we will make an important contribution to the integration of all, irrespective of their status."
"It is by introducing favourable socioeconomic conditions that we will be able to give greater assistance to migrants, whether they reside legally in Europe, or whether they are destined to be granted legal residence or ultimately sent back to their own country."
"We should not create a status for these children whereby they are not educated and are ghettoised merely because their parents are residing illegally."
"That is simply contrary to the international conventions."
"Even though I consider this resolution to be on the whole positive, I have a few serious comments to make:"
"First and foremost I would like to deplore the fact that the resolution does not mention the framework of the UN-declared international human rights year."
"I can also see in this resolution a further dangerous political tendency within the framework of European politics, which involves taking children out of their natural environment, in other words away from their natural families."
"The family is the most natural place for the development of a child and it will always be that way."
"Mother and father are the most important people for a child."
"This also applies in the poorest families and in immigrant families."
"Instead of tearing children away from their families, we should think about how to support parents and families in their mutual responsibilities."
"I would like to conclude by deploring the fact that the report is completely silent on the role of fathers."
"Even in immigrant families mothers and fathers are different but complementary."
"We should not support mothers without doing the same thing for fathers as well."
"I simply want to assert the Universal General Declaration of Human Rights."
"This explicitly assumes the right of the child to live in a family and the right of parents to choose the education they feel will be right for their child."
"Immigrant families have this right as well."
"Despite some compromises reached between the various political groups within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on many key points in Mrs VÄlean's report, and notwithstanding the political conviction and position that I express on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in my capacity as shadow rapporteur on the report, namely that the free movement of Community citizens is a fundamental EU right, the final version of the report nevertheless contains a series of inappropriate references, in some of the footnotes to recital S, which compel us, as the Italian delegation of the PPE-DE, to vote against this report in the Chamber due to the single block vote stipulated for this type of report."
"The Italian delegation of the PPE-DE considers the references in the report to be inappropriate and absolutely out of context: they refer to aspects outside the scope of the directive, being matters falling within the competence of the Member States, such as public security, legality and family law."
"in writing. - (NL) I have voted against this report, because directives of this kind undermine the Member States' capacity to be in control of their own territories and to take the appropriate measures to maintain law and order."
"Italy springs to mind, for example, which came under heavy criticism on the basis of this directive because it was believed that it wanted to take strong measures to maintain law and order."
"The Metock ruling of the Court of Justice also springs to mind, undermining, as it does, the Member States' immigration policies on the strength of this directive."
"I am also mindful of Belgium, though, as that country continues to naturalise immigrants on the basis of the world's most lax nationalisation legislation, with the result that those immigrants are then completely free to cross European borders."
"The June List supports the free internal market, which has not only brought us economic prosperity, but has also extended our citizens' freedom, by making it possible for them to move freely between the countries within Europe's borders."
"We share the rapporteur's view that the poor transposition of this directive in some Member States should generally be viewed as disappointing and we urge the Member States to implement Directive 2004/38/EC in its entirety, so that the right to free movement can become a reality."
"However, we strongly oppose any increase in funds, or allocations to a specific budget line, to support national and local projects intended to integrate citizens and members of their families during their stay in another Member State."
"Such issues are the individual responsibility of each Member State."
"Nevertheless, this report's clear position on the realisation of the free internal market has outweighed the negatives, which is why we have decided to vote in favour of it."
"in writing. - I supported the VÄlean report on EU citizens' rights."
"The right of EU citizens and their families to move and reside across the Unions relates to the fundamental freedoms and it is essential that all Member States apply the law without discrimination."
"Speaking as a representative of Scotland I know that the EU has offered countless opportunities for Scots abroad, whilst Scotland has welcomed many newcomers who have played a valuable role in our economic and cultural lives."
"At this time of economic crisis it is essential that the benefits of free movement are recognised and that economic hardship is not used as an excuse for discrimination."
"in writing. - (DA) We have voted against the report on the application of the Residence Directive."
"Even though the report is about the application and implementation of the Residence Directive, it also refers to the Metock ruling, which permits foreigners who have no legal right to stay in the EU to obtain a residence permit through marriage and hence to travel around the European Union with their spouses."
"Although we essentially support the principle of the free movement of the Union's citizens, we do not believe that people who have entered Europe illegally should be able to enhance their rights through marriage."
"in writing. - (DA) The Danish Liberal Party's MEPs have voted against this report."
"We are in favour of the free movement of workers and of ensuring that the Member States comply with the directive."
"However, we are opposed to the possibility of legalising unlawful residence through marriage to a migrant worker, as reflected in the Metock ruling."
"Member States must, through their administration, have a real possibility of ensuring that rules concerning free movement are not abused for the purpose of circumventing the legislation governing aliens."
"I voted against Mrs VÄlean's report on the application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States."
"I do not agree with the point where the Member States are requested to adopt the same format of personal identity documents for their own nationals and for European Union citizens from other Member States, notwithstanding the noticeable differences within the documents."
"I find this solution to be pointless and superficial."
"In the light of Article 18 of the EC Treaty, every citizen has the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States."
"Directive 2004/38/EC defines in detail the legal possibilities for movement within the EU's borders by citizens, their close family or a legally-documented partner."
"Free movement should, however, be considered together with regulations concerning free movement of workers and freedom to provide services."
"As we all know, four EU Member States still have not opened their labour markets to workers from the countries which acceded in 2004."
"As many as 11 EU Member States continue to apply restrictions on their labour markets to citizens of Rumania and Bulgaria."
"I think that this situation has a negative influence, and not only on the process of integration."
"We should strive to remove existing barriers as soon as possible."
"In accordance with Article 20 of the Treaty, every citizen shall, within the territory of a third country in which the Member State of which he is a national is not represented, be entitled to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of any Member State, on the same conditions as the nationals of that State."
"The measures which have been announced concerning the strengthening of consular protection in third countries should be implemented as soon as possible, and negotiations with third countries on the lifting of visa requirements should be continued."
"Mrs Gacek's report brings to the fore one important aspect: when the European Union was expanded, a considerable increase was noted in the number of European citizens resident outside their state of origin in a context where European citizenship complements the citizenship of Member States, each of which is responsible for regulating this aspect."
"In spite of the active involvement of citizens in initiating legislative proposals and in attempting to make the Community's legislative system more transparent, Europeans are still faced with a number of problems linked to the breach of and non-compliance with people's right to move to and reside where they want on the territory of Member States."
"The discrepancies noted between Member States on regulating a compulsory visa requirement or on exercising the right to vote in both their country of origin and country of adoption raise a question mark over the equality of rights among all European citizens."
"For this reason, I consider that Member States must take all necessary measures to transpose effectively the norms intended to harmonise European citizens' rights."
"In this specific case, we must bear in mind that the starting point is partnership, whether between Member States and the EU or between regional, local and civil institutions."
"Last but not least, Member States must guarantee the right to vote to all EU citizens residing in a Member State other than their original state at the time of legislative elections."
"The delegation of Swedish Conservatives in the European Parliament has today voted in favour of Urszula Gacek's (PPE-DE, PL) report on the problems and prospects of European citizenship."
"We share the report's overarching idea of improved European citizenship and improved freedom of movement."
"However, we are of the opinion that the solution to the problems raised is to conduct further information campaigns."
"We would also like to underscore the fact that the question of the right to vote in municipal elections is an internal matter for the Member States to decide upon."
"Concrete steps have been taken to make European citizenship a reality."
"This will particularly benefit Portuguese migrants in other Community countries who will in the future enjoy a wide range of rights and obligations, including equal treatment with regard to nationals of the host State."
"The most significant development has undoubtedly been the adoption of the Citizenship Directive, which laid down an unconditional right of permanent residence for EU citizens and their families who have lived in the host State for a period of five years."
"However, there is still much to do as there are still obstacles, resulting in most cases from incorrect implementation of this Directive by the Member States."
"I welcome the Commission's initiative to publish a Guide on this Directive so that information on the rights that can be enjoyed by citizens can be made accessible not only to them, but also to local and regional authorities in the Member States."
"It is vital that social and political ties between EU citizens continue to be strengthened."
"The Treaty of Lisbon must significantly contribute to this, particularly through the 'citizenship initiative', which will enable citizens, under certain conditions, to have a right of initiative."
"We need to strengthen European citizenship because it is the central plank of freedom of movement."
"This report flags up a number of areas where people's opportunities to access the advantages of EU freedom of movement could be improved."
"Since dismantling borders and greater mobility form the central idea of the EU, I decided to vote in favour of this report, despite some rather unfortunate references to the promotion of 'the European identity' and the establishment of a 'European dimension' in our schools."
"Despite containing a series of points which naturally merit our agreement, as well as others about which the least that can be said is that they are 'politically correct', this European Parliament resolution, entitled 'Problems and prospects concerning European Citizenship', would be a laughing matter if it were not so serious."
"For example, the EP:"
"'welcomes the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon makes it possible for one million Union citizens from different Member States collectively to invite the Commission to submit legislative proposals, and believes that such a legal right will significantly raise awareness of Union citizenship among Europeans';"
"'recalls that transparency and democratic participation must be achieved by a variety of forms of partnership among the EU and Member States, regional and local institutions, social partners and civil society'."
"Finally, there is a rigmarole that makes us think that this 'European Citizenship' thing is very good, provided that the citizens are prevented from deciding what is really important, in particular by stopping them from voting in a referendum on the 'Treaty of Lisbon' or, if that is not possible, forcing them to hold as many referenda as necessary until they say 'yes' ..."
"This is hypocrisy at its best ..."
"The report by Mrs Gacek on Union citizenship is a real fraud."
"Under the guise of strengthening freedom of movement and residence in the European Union for Community nationals, it introduces real equality of treatment between the latter and citizens of third countries."
"The report deliberately uses the general term of citizenship to lump together in a totally illegitimate manner the concepts of nationality of a Member State and citizenship of the Union."
"The objective, beyond the desire to confuse, is very clear: to extend the possibility of acquiring the nationality of a Member State to all persons legally residing in that State in accordance with the right deriving from citizenship of the Union."
"This is why the rapporteur is introducing a new concept of intra-Community migrant, a species that is proliferating."
"It is true that the European Parliament is now composed of representatives of the citizens of the Union rather than of the peoples of the States."
"This is a serious attack on national identity and cohesion."
"Beware, ladies and gentlemen: as representatives of the undifferentiated citizens of the European Union, you are soon to become stateless Members."
"Deep down, though, that may be just what you want."
"The report is an exercise in propaganda by the political forces of the 'European one-way street' to persuade the people of the alleged benefits of the EU."
"By promoting an artificial, basically non-existing European citizenship, to which no practical rights attach, they are trying to cultivate the idea of the 'European citizen' and a 'European conscience'."
"Their objective is to lead the workers, especially young people, up an ideological garden path."
"For this purpose, they are investing in 'European political parties' and calling on the EU to give them greater political and, more importantly, economic support, so that they can play their role in embellishing and supporting the EU and disorientating and misleading more effectively."
"In an effort to deal with the constantly increasing tide of opposition to the anti-grassroots policy of the EU, of the euro-unifying construct itself, they are calling on the EU to step up its false propaganda and to promote the non-existent advantages of European citizenship."
"The workers experience the painful consequences of the Treaty of Maastricht and the anti-grassroots policy of the EU on a daily basis."
"They can judge from experience that the EU was not set up to serve grassroots interests, but to defend and serve the needs, interests and profits of the European monopolies."
"Disobedience, opposition and rupture with the EU are the way forward which is in the people's interest."
"The workers can and will send this message through the ballot box during the European elections in June."
"I decided to vote against Mrs Gacek's report on problems and prospects concerning European citizenship."
"I do not actually believe that we need to express too much concern over the low rate of implementation of the directives in force, with particular reference to the directive on free movement, which gives rise to numerous problems relating to freedom of movement and other rights of European Union citizens, because I do not believe the picture described by Mrs Gacek reflects the actual situation in which we find ourselves."
"I voted in favour of Mr Markov's report on Community statistics on external trade."
"In order to achieve the desired results, I believe it is necessary to reduce the 'Rotterdam' effect, which, according to the Commission and the Council, will lead to an over-representation in external trade statistics of Member States that record a high volume of exports or customs clearances but that actually only act as transit countries, to the detriment of the Member States that actually receive or dispatch the goods."
"The aim of the proposal is to limit the exposure of consumers to pharmacologically active substances intended for use in veterinary medicinal products for food producing animals as well as residues thereof in foodstuffs of animal origin."
"This includes foodstuffs imported from third countries."
"Following a long process, the text of the common position was produced, which reflects the compromise achieved through negotiation between the three institutions."
"The key points addressed in the new text include the following:"
"reference points for action: this is now defined as the level of a residue of a pharmacologically active substance, established for control reasons in the case of certain substances for which a maximum residue limit has not been laid down in accordance with this Regulation;"
"import: Member States shall prohibit the import and placing on the market of food of animal origin containing residues resulting from the illegal administration of pharmacologically active substances which are not subject to a classification in accordance with the text."
"I voted against Mrs Doyle's report on the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin."
"I agree with the aim, but not with the methods."
"I do not believe that limiting the exposure of consumers to pharmacologically active substances in veterinary medicinal products for animals used for the production of foodstuffs and the residues of those substances present in foodstuffs of animal origin is a good solution for achieving the desired ends."
"I would tackle the root of the problem, which actually lies in other matters."
"I endorsed the Angelakas report because it emphasises the use of specific sums of money to cofinance regional and local programmes related to renewable energy and housing."
"In addition, it is very much to be welcomed that Member States will establish criteria and decide which housing qualifies for grants in accordance with national legislation."
"This is a sign that in each Member State the money will be used for the buildings which most need it."
"in writing. - I support this Report which modifies the European Regional Development Fund in order to permit and facilitate energy efficiency and renewable energies interventions in the housing sector in all Member States."
"Interventions should target low-income households, as defined by the national legislation in force."
"Indeed, I have proposed in Ireland that vat on labour for such work should be reduced from 13.5% to 5% to encourage retention of jobs and demand for these renovations."
"The ""European economic Recovery Plan"" put as priority areas the Lisbon strategy and energy (with a special attention of energy efficiency in buildings)."
"Therefore Member states are encouraged to reprogramme their Structural Funds Operational Programmes in order to devote a better balance to energy efficiency investments, including where they fund social housing."
"Under the current regulatory framework, European Regional Development Fund supported interventions in the housing sector, including energy efficiency, but it was reserved only for Member States acceded to the European Union on or after 1 May 2004."
"The modification to the regulation seeks to permit and extend this possibility targeting low income households in all Member States."
"There appear to be no lengths to which the rapporteur will not go in his paean to the EU's cohesion policy, despite the fact that this policy is an alarming example of what increased centralisation can lead to."
"Poor control and inadequate follow-up of the resources granted every year as part of the EU funds' projects have resulted in significant amounts of money going into the wrong pockets."
"This is now common knowledge."
"As recently as November 2008, the European Court of Auditors noted that 11% of the EUR 42 billion which was approved in 2007 in the framework of the EU's cohesion policy should never have been paid out.."
"However, there is no mention of this in the report."
"That is regrettable, but hardly surprising."
"It goes without saying that we voted against the report."
"The economic and financial crisis that Europe is experiencing must be viewed as an opportunity to adopt measures that will not only help the Member States to recover, but will also increase people's awareness of more sustainable behaviour."
"The possibility of improving the energy efficiency of housing by allocating funding of up to 4% of the European Regional Development Fund to each Member State in itself offers a dual benefit: on the one hand it reduces the fixed energy costs of families, and on the other it reduces national consumption, thereby contributing to energy security and to a reduction in imports of fossil fuels and the emission of greenhouse gases."
"I welcome this report, in the hope that the Member States will be able to integrate this funding into their National Action Plans for Energy Efficiency, and use it responsibly and pragmatically."
"I hope that the small island regions will particularly benefit from this funding, given that these regions possess fewer ways of generating energy, thus requiring responsible energy use by everyone."
"Investment in energy efficiency is one of the most important tools in this respect, and must be a priority objective of the Member State governments."
"I voted in favour of Mr Angelakas's report on the ERDF as regards the eligibility of energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in housing."
"I do in fact share the rapporteur's belief that the finance tools available to the European Union should be modified as promptly and effectively as possible in order to face emerging challenges linked to the current economic crisis."
"As a fundamental international player, the European Union cannot allow itself to stay one step behind in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energies in housing efficiency."
"It is therefore necessary for all the Member States and all the regions of the Union, not only those of the new Member States, to be placed in a position where they are able to make investments and carry out projects in these sectors."
"This will also bring clear advantages in terms of the job creation that is so crucial in the extremely severe economic situation we are experiencing."
"I agree with a common visa policy that facilitates legitimate travel and implements measures aimed at facilitating the process of lodging and processing visa applications (reduced costs, simplified issue procedure, use of visas for multiple entries, longer periods of validity)."
"It is also a matter of urgency that illegal immigration be tackled through further harmonisation of national legislation and handling practices at local consular missions."
"I acknowledge the urgent need to reinforce the coherence of the common visa policy, particularly by incorporating into one code on visas all provisions governing the issuance of visas and decisions in relation to refusal, extension, annulment, revocation and shortening of visas issued."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lax, on the excellent compromise that he has managed to achieve, but regret that the weak compromise achieved in the report on Common Consular Instructions (which must be inserted in this proposal) will end up being to the detriment of this proposal."
"An example of this is the exemption from and reduction in cost of visas for children, which was agreed in this House, but which will end up not producing the expected effects due to the additional charges to be levied where the service is provided by external companies."
"For all these reasons, which led me to vote against that report, I cannot fully support this report, which is why I have abstained."
"in writing. - (DE) It is telling when the object of greater harmonisation of national provisions and procedures relating to visas is illegal immigration."
"Past visa scandals, of course, show how relaxed an approach some states take to the issuing of visas."
"There has been too little investigation into the cases I refer to, and not enough change has resulted."
"The mass legalisations of recent decades also cast doubt on whether it is sensible to proceed with harmonisation."
"Unless all Member States are in favour of strict visa provisions and a rigorous immigration policy aimed at zero immigration, the result can only be the lowest common denominator."
"In order to prevent the possible opening up of the immigration floodgates via the back door, I voted against Mr Lax's report."
"The Commission proposal for a regulation on a Community Code on Visas is one of the EU measures to step up the repression of immigrants and to create 'Fortress Europe' against third country nationals and the people of the EU itself."
"With the Visa Code, the EU has adopted harsher rules for granting EU entry visas to third country nationals which apply uniformly to all the Member States."
"It is imposing the incorporation in visas of biometric data (prints of all ten fingers) even for children as young as 12 years old."
"These data, together with a series of other personal data, will be recorded in the VIS information system which has already been introduced by the EU and which aspires to being the biggest personal database - for which read police records - of all third country nationals."
"Any individual improvements made by the European Parliament report do not change the essence, the direction or the rationale of the Visa Code, which is yet another tool for the control and harsher repression of immigrants within the framework of the overall anti-immigration policy of the EU, as expressed in the Pact on Immigration."
"Once again the EU has proven that it is the enemy of the people, of immigrants and of refugees, by handing the hostages over to the savage exploitation of capital."
"I voted against Mr Lax's report on the Community Code on Visas."
"I believe that the objectives the Commission is proposing in the context of the Hague Programme, that is, to set up a system to facilitate legitimate travel and combat illegal immigration cannot be achieved by harmonising national legislation and handling practices at local consular missions."
"Much still remains to be done in terms of dialogue and cooperation between Member States, and we should continue along this road rather than incorporate into one Code on Visas all provisions governing the issuance of visas and decisions in relation to the refusal, extension, annulment, revocation and shortening of visas issued, provisions that this European Union is absolutely unready and unable to manage."
"I therefore do not believe that the proposed system should be approved and carried forward."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has prepared another proposal in the context of the Hague Programme."
"Its objective is to simplify visa policy by creating a Community Code on Visas, in order to facilitate the process of visa application, as well as the extension, annulment, revocation and shortening of visas issued."
"The Code will unify and specify the principles for issuance of visas, as well as their type and period of validity."
"In addition, the documents necessary in order to obtain an appropriate visa will be specified."
"As a result of the harmonisation of European Union visa law, legislation which has often hindered the process of obtaining a visa will be repealed."
"The Community Code on Visas will facilitate the movement not only of EU citizens, but above all of citizens of countries from outside the EU."
"This will facilitate movement of citizens and also of workers between countries both within and without the Community."
"In connection with the above change, special attention should be given to the ongoing training of Customs Officers, and especially those who work on the borders of the European Union."
"EU visa policy should reflect the fundamental priorities of its foreign policy."
"I think that the creation of a Community Code on Visas is a good idea, and that it will serve to harmonise the legislation of Member States."
"I voted in favour of the regulation on a Community Ecolabel scheme, as I believe it is vitally important to encourage the sustainable production and consumption of products."
"The Ecolabel is useful for guiding consumers towards those products on the market which are ecologically recommended and for encouraging the production and consumption of products which have good environmental performance."
"As stated in the report, the Ecolabel is a voluntary mark whose purpose is to promote, at European level, the dissemination of high-efficiency products which have a low ecological impact throughout their life-cycle."
"To this end, certain eco-quality standards have been fixed (we shall here call them 'criteria') for each of a number of specific product categories."
"There are at present 26 product categories, 622 licences and over 3 000 products and services - detergents, paper, clothing (including shoes and textiles), tourism, camping products, etc. - for which Ecolabels have been awarded."
"This mark and the flower that symbolises it are dynamising elements which, thanks to the constant updating of the environmental criteria for the products for which they are awarded, encourages enterprises to operate a virtuous cycle of effort with a view to the overall raising of the eco-quality of products on the market."
"However, there seem to be several shortcomings in the current system, bearing in mind the experience obtained over the almost 10 years of existence of this certification, which points to the need for more decisive intervention with a view to dealing with certain shortcomings in the system."
"It is in this context that the Commission has presented a proposal for a new regulation, which the Members are trying to improve."
"The Ecolabel is yet another misleading method of advertising products of dubious quality and ecological impact."
"These products will acquire 'added' value by registering for the label, the cost of which will be passed on to the end user, thereby increasing the profits of the monopolies still further."
"This label is also a way of concentrating capital and the monopoly of the market between a few multinational companies which will have the means, organisation and, more importantly, the money needed to register with the label for their products."
"Whatever the safety valves in the procedure for awarding the label in a transparent, reliable and impartial manner, everyone knows that capital and big business always find ways round them in order to increase their profits, as proven by a string of food scandals and by the 'toxic' products of the capitalist crisis itself."
"The ÎU is unable to guarantee ecological protection, because it courts and serves capital which, with its unaccountable exploitation of natural and human resources and the use it makes of modern technology in the same direction, is destroying the environment."
"The people responsible for destroying the environment cannot at the same time be appointed to protect it."
"I voted in favour of Mr Tatarella's report on a Community Ecolabel scheme."
"I believe that this proposal fits in perfectly with the European Action Plan for Sustainable Production and Consumption and, consequently, with the general aim of developing a voluntary, integrated system that will encourage companies to improve their products with a view to improving product quality in terms not only of diet and consumer protection, but also of the environment, by achieving higher standards of energy efficiency and environment-friendliness."
"I therefore congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent job he has done in a context that is so important and crucial for our producers, including the very smallest, because emphasising quality and respect for dietary and ecological principles will help them to stand out and stay afloat in an increasingly global and competitive scenario."
"in writing. - The European Parliament practises what it preaches in terms of eco-friendly behaviour!"
"Voluntarily, we have taken it upon ourselves to improve our environmental performance on a day-to-day basis."
"In February 2007, I personally asked the President to initiate EMAS in the Parliament."
"Today, we have voted in favour of the EMAS scheme, which requests other companies across the EU to do likewise."
"By reducing our environmental footprint in ways such as turning the lights off, smart metering, sensor lights, and less paper use, the European Parliament works to be environmentally sound."
"As a result of an audit in Parliament, we have received an EMAS logo."
"A yes vote today for the extension of EMAS means a yes for more environmental awareness in the Member States."
"This plan looks to recognise and reward proactive organisations that go beyond what environmental laws expect of them and that are constantly improving the way they interact with the environment."
"Now it is important to set a harmonised system throughout the European Union with a single set of rules; ensuring the usefulness and exposure of this plan not only for buildings, but for the Member States as well."
"For these reasons, it is essential to vote yes on this legislation."
"I voted in favour of the report on the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), as it helps organisations to identify, monitor and measure their impact on the environment and to provide information on this."
"EMAS was first introduced in 1995 and was extended in 2001 to both public and private sector organisations."
"This new revision is an opportunity to make the scheme more attractive and simpler for small and medium-sized enterprises and is also an attempt to ensure that EMAS has the same level of participation as ISO 14001 currently has (which is the leading Environmental Management System in Europe)."
"It is also important to note that the recognition of EMAS as a reference mark in Environmental Management Systems is in line with the EU objective on combating climate change."
"I congratulate Mrs McAvan on her excellent work and declare my support for her report on the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) by voting in favour of it."
"The aim of improving the long-term environmental performance of organisations is certainly laudable, as are all the small- and large-scale resources that are designed to achieve it."
"I also join the rapporteur in welcoming the changes proposed by the Commission, particularly that relating to the planned reduction in fees and less frequent reporting for SMEs, for which participation in this system would be more onerous but no less important."
"I believe that we should also support the alignment of EMAS definitions with existing ISO 14001 definitions, which would make the transition from one system to the other easier, and endorse a simplification of the language, which could be very useful, particularly for small organisations."
"in writing. - (DE) The legal basis used, Article 13(1) of the EC Treaty, is not appropriate considering that, in the opinion of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), the principle of subsidiarity is not being observed."
"It is not within the remit of the EU legislator to lay down the regulations in question, thereby seriously encroaching on the self-determination of the Member States."
"Combating discrimination of all kinds and bringing about participation in public life by the disabled are important jobs."
"Proposing to extend the anti-discrimination regulations to practically all areas of life is out of touch with reality, however."
"The reversal of the burden of proof laid down in the directive will mean that it is possible to open legal proceedings on the basis of accusations not backed up by sufficient evidence."
"Those affected would then have to pay compensation even if they have not actually committed any acts of discrimination but are unable to prove their innocence."
"Defined in this sweeping way, this reversal of the burden of proof is therefore questionable from the point of view of its compatibility with acting as a state under the rule of law."
"It will create uncertainty and facilitate abuse."
"That cannot be the raison d'Ãªtre of a progressive anti-discrimination policy."
"A further consideration must be that the Commission is currently pursuing infringement proceedings against numerous Member States in relation to inadequate transposal of the existing European directives on anti-discrimination policy."
"There is as yet, however, no overview of those regulations that have been transposed so as to make it possible to determine the need for new regulations that has been claimed."
"Germany, in particular, has already gone far beyond previous stipulations from Brussels."
"We therefore voted against this report."
"in writing. - I and my British Conservative colleagues can agree with much of this report and abhor discrimination in all its forms and are wholeheartedly supportive of providing equal opportunities for people regardless of their disability, race, religion, or sexuality."
"However, we do have serious misgivings on the issue of the reversal of the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the accused."
"UK Conservatives believe that in prima facie cases of discrimination and under the British legal system it must remain up to the plaintiff to supply conclusive evidence of such cases of discrimination."
"That is why we have decided to abstain on this report."
"in writing. - (NL) I emphatically voted against this report."
"Needless to say, we are all opposed to people being discriminated against on the basis of their disability, sexual orientation and such like."
"The question is only whether Europe should be involved in this."
"I do not think so."
"Measures to tackle discrimination should remain the exclusive competence of the Member States."
"Consequently, I voted in favour of Amendment 81 which observes that the relevant proposal for a directive seriously erodes the principle of subsidiarity."
"Quite apart from that, this report also contains many recommendations that run counter to the elementary democratic principle and the principle of the rule of law."
"To give but one example, while this report encourages people not to discriminate on account of belief, it allows explicit discrimination on the basis of political belief."
"in writing. - (NL) I have voted against this report which is one of many that are steeped in political correctness, if only because this proposal violates the EU's principle of subsidiarity and involves a huge amount of red tape."
"Needless to say, I, too, am opposed to all forms of discrimination on the basis of disability, age or sexual orientation."
"This report, though, contains many recommendations that run counter to the most elementary principles of the rule of law."
"Indeed, discrimination is all of a sudden allowed when it concerns discrimination on the basis of political orientation."
"Then the principle of equality may as well be done away with completely."
"That is ridiculous."
"in writing. - This report aims to protect those who are unjustly marginalised and ensure that they have proper and adequate means to address their situation."
"I was pleased to support it."
"It has broad support from social platforms and civil society."
"I am satisfied that it does not interfere with Member States competences in the following domains:"
"education"
"access to religious institutions"
"matters of marital or family status"
"the relationship between church and state"
"the secular nature of the state and its institutions"
"the status of religious organisations and"
"the wearing of religious symbols at school."
"Ireland had, until recently, a very active National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism (NCCRI) and a well funded Equality Authority."
"Despite the importance of the work that these bodies were charged with, including, among other issues, equality proofing legislation, these bodies have ceased to be, given the drastic cuts in funding available to them."
"It is important that we continue to support these groups and their work."
"Ms Buitenweg's report clearly demarks certain areas to remain part of the competency of each Member State, but progress on a European scale is important to achieve a social and more just Europe."
"I voted in favour of the report on 'equal treatment of persons', which includes several amendments to the Commission proposal, reinforcing the protection of citizens, including people with disabilities who are victims of discrimination."
"According to Eurobarometer data from 2008, 15% of European citizens claimed that they had been subjected to discrimination in the past year."
"This is unacceptable, which is why I welcome the adoption of this text by the European Parliament, despite the incomprehensible vote against by the right."
"I regard it as vital for legislation to prohibit direct and indirect discrimination, multiple discrimination and discrimination by association based on gender, race or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation or gender in a range of areas such as social protection, education and access to and supply of goods and services, such as housing, transport, telecommunications and health."
"in writing. - This Parliament has played a key role in promoting equal treatment of people across the Union on grounds of sex, race, religion, belief, disability, age and sexual orientation."
"I therefore welcome this report, which urges a further strengthening of provisions to enforce such equality."
"My only reservation is with regard to Amendment 39, part of which argues that freedom of speech should not be compromised, even in cases of harassment."
"We rightly have restrictions on freedom of speech covered by the laws of libel and slander."
"Equally you cannot with impunity shout 'fire' in a cinema."
"On that basis I have to vote against this particular amendment with the threat it would pose to minorities."
"in writing. - (FR) The defence of the rights and the protection of people who are victims of discrimination must be a priority for the EU, but this can only be effective and useful if it guarantees legal certainty for the persons involved whilst avoiding a disproportionate burden for the economic players targeted."
"In this sensitive area, it was essential to remain vigilant as regards respect for the division of competences between the European Union and the Member States and to ensure that Parliament adheres strictly to what the legal basis allows."
"The text as adopted today, whilst satisfactory in certain respects - especially in relation to the fight against discrimination against disabled people - the vague concepts it contains, the legal uncertainties that it maintains and the superfluous requirements that it introduces make it legally impractical and therefore ineffective in its application."
"Believing as I do that excessive regulation cannot be a solution, I defended the amendment to reject the Commission's proposal, as existing texts on this issue have not been applied in a number of Member States that are subject to infringement procedures."
"In these circumstances, since I support the objective of this directive but am partially dissatisfied, I preferred to abstain from the final vote."
"in writing. - I will be voting in favour of this report especially since it promotes in a very forceful and concrete way the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, age or sexual orientation."
"Having said that however my delegation feels that national realities and national concerns in the various Member States have to be taken into consideration (Amendment 28) before implementing the amendment."
"Furthermore we have to ensure that legislation enacted would not lead to a perverse situation where, instead of ensuring freedom of expression, freedom of expression is curbed."
"I have always taken a positive approach to the determined, effective fight against all forms of discrimination and against homophobia, in accordance with the fundamental values of the European Union."
"The defence of the rights and the protection of people who are victims of discrimination must be a priority for the EU, but this can only be effective and useful if it guarantees legal certainty for the persons involved whilst avoiding a disproportionate burden for the economic players targeted."
"In this sensitive area, it is essential to remain vigilant as regards respect for the division of competences between the European Union and the Member States and to ensure that Parliament adheres strictly to what the legal basis at European level allows."
"The text as adopted today, whilst satisfactory in certain respects - especially in relation to the fight against discrimination against disabled people - the vague concepts it contains, the legal uncertainties that it maintains and the superfluous requirements that it introduces make it legally impractical and therefore ineffective in its application."
"In these circumstances, and although I support the objective of the directive, I have decided to abstain on this text in the final vote."
"in writing. - I congratulate my colleague Ms Buitenweg in gaining majority support for her report in this House."
"Discrimination on the basis of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation has no place in European society."
"It is right that legal protection is extended beyond the labour market and this proposed Directive will be a valuable tool in the fight against intolerance."
"Since 2000, the European Union has continually promoted equality, and this increasingly in the broadest possible sense of the word: equality between men and women, between nationals and foreigners, between the sick and the healthy, between Catholics, Muslims, Buddhists and other religions, equality of access to education, to health, equality for one's sexual orientation, and so on."
"Here then is a new directive that, under the guise of the legitimate fight against discrimination towards disabled people, is intended to regulate, or rather shackle, almost every area in which the freedom of choice, be it contractual or otherwise, still exists."
"The pitfalls in such a coercive regulation are legion."
"In effect, these new European measures will not only increase European bureaucracy and burdens, but will also be a real threat to other fundamental freedoms and rights including, in particular, freedom of worship, of association and of expression, and freedom of the press."
"In the name of equality, the censors and the dictators are here present."
"in writing. - (FR) It is with great regret that I have decided to abstain on Mrs Buitenweg's report on equal treatment."
"The principle of equal treatment of persons irrespective of political or religious beliefs, age, gender, sexual orientation or disability, is one of the founding principles of the European Union."
"The reality of daily life shows that much progress remains to be made in the Member States."
"The offensive remarks about the elderly that continue unabated are an eloquent illustration of this."
"However, I am unable to subscribe to the pathways and options described in this report."
"I greatly fear that the good intentions will result in unending litigation and bureaucratic excess running counter to the desired objective."
"The June List believes the EU to be a union of values, and that is why I am very much in favour of a broad directive against discrimination."
"I consider that to be a given in a functioning internal market with respect for inviolable human rights."
"For me, it is very important that no one should be discriminated against on the grounds of disability."
"I am in favour of amendment 87 because I think that taxpayers in every country should ensure that the disabled are provided with such finances as allow them to be considered fully credible borrowers by the credit market."
"As a matter of fact, I voted in favour of the report in its entirety."
"in writing. - (NL) As the Dutch Christian Democrats (CDA) have always strongly argued for rules to ensure the equal treatment of people irrespective of their religion, belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, we are in favour of the spirit of this directive."
"However, legislation in this area must be well thought-out."
"The CDA considers many legal definitions in the text extremely ambiguous and expects - like many others - that the text will result in all kinds of legal proceedings."
"The CDA is opposed to the proposal to reverse the burden of proof."
"To us, someone is innocent until proven guilty."
"The CDA cannot identify with the proposal that it is to be up to people against whom charges are brought to prove their innocence."
"Moreover, we regret that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, apparently feeling the pressure of the elections, have brought even more imbalance to this text by introducing numerous new elements and through split votes."
"For this reason, the CDA did not feel able to endorse this report."
"in writing. - This is a major report with important consequences for EU citizens."
"It is difficult to argue against the principle of equal treatment, yet this report has proven hugely contentious in this House, not just between groups, but indeed within political groups too."
"I voted against Amendment 81 to totally reject this report."
"I have met with and been lobbied by many disability interest groups who asked for consideration of their position."
"The European Disability Forum, in particular strongly argues that we need EU legislation to protect people with disabilities against discrimination."
"At Council many Member States have also voiced concerns about the proposal."
"Those concerns range from the legal base to be used, the scope of the proposal and fears that it may impinge on areas of national competence, such as education, social security and healthcare."
"We must also make clear that adoption and reproductive rights (including assisted human reproduction) are not within the scope of the directive."
"I voted against Amendment 28 in order to secure the reference to national law on family or family status, including reproductive rights."
"This amendment was rejected by the House and therefore I abstained in the final vote."
"in writing. - (NL) Today, I, along with the eurosceptic part of my group, voted in favour of the Buitenweg report on equal treatment."
"We very much agree with the content of her proposals and therefore regret the many 'no' votes from Members who actually want to see more Europe."
"It is unfortunate that other parties were suggesting before the vote that our decision to vote 'yes' was perhaps somewhat out of character."
"In the national parliaments and national governments of the EU Member States, a question that is often raised is whether the EU should reel in further competences."
"This increase in competences is often at the expense of decision-making at a lower level, where those affected are guaranteed maximum influence."
"In such cases my party, the Dutch Socialist Party, objects."
"In the European Parliament, however, the emphasis is more on how the EU implements its competences, or on content, in other words."
"Then, we always vote in favour of what we consider to be an improvement and against what we consider to be a change for the worse."
"Choosing to act in this way does not mean that we would not prefer to leave areas of this kind to the Council, which has noted a European average that is worse than what we have since reached in the Netherlands and in a number of other Member States."
"Equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation is a principle that goes well beyond Community law: it is a human being's inalienable right."
"I was therefore forced to vote against Mrs Buitenweg's report on the proposal for a Council directive."
"I believe that the sole aim of this directive is to control aspects in respect of which the European Union should already be very active and involved."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg's report on equal treatment of people irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"I find it absolutely outrageous that in the 21st century in the European Parliament there are still disagreements about something as natural as equal treatment of people."
"The fact that 226 MEPs voted against the report was a negative surprise and a clear sign of danger, which cannot be ignored."
"Tolerance is one of the cornerstones of the European Union and combating discrimination of any kind must be our top priority."
"The European Union's motto ""united in diversity"" does not only stand for different nationalities of the EU, but first and foremost involves the citizens of the European Union with their individual differences."
"All EU citizens are equal and must be treated that way, only then can the European Union live up to its motto."
"The defence of the rights and the protection of people who are victims of discrimination must be a priority for the EU, but this can only be effective and useful if it guarantees legal certainty for the persons involved, whilst avoiding a disproportionate burden for the economic players targeted."
"In this area, it is essential to remain vigilant as regards respect for the division of competences between the European Union and the Member States and to ensure that Parliament adheres strictly to what the legal basis allows."
"The text adopted today is satisfactory in certain respects, especially in relation to the fight against discrimination against disabled people, but the vague concepts it contains, the legal uncertainties that it maintains and the superfluous requirements that it introduces make it legally impractical and therefore ineffective in its application."
"Since excessive regulation cannot be a solution, the delegation has defended the amendment rejecting the Commission's proposal, as existing texts on this issue have not yet been applied in some Member States that are subject to infringement procedures."
"In effect, the French delegation, which supports the objective of this directive but is partially dissatisfied, preferred to abstain from the final vote."
"Discrimination is a problem which, in these days of European unification, is a subject which is extremely relevant and which we must not ignore under any circumstances."
"Despite the fact that we have already discussed this subject many times, the effects remain unsatisfactory."
"The different forms of discrimination are a significant problem."
"Discrimination on the basis of ethnic or racial origin is forbidden both in the labour market and outside it."
"Unequal treatment because of religion, worldview, disability, age or sexual orientation is currently forbidden only in the workplace."
"I think attention should be paid to fighting discrimination not only in the professional area, but also outside it."
"Discrimination should be defined in the same way regardless of what kind it is."
"Prevention of unequal treatment is a highly significant question, but we must not forget about people who suffer discrimination."
"We must make sure that it is possible for them to exercise their rights, and we must strive for the consistent punishment of people who discriminate."
"Discrimination is a very important subject, both in connection with the private lives of citizens and with the process of European integration."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, and I thank her for a very good and comprehensive report."
"in writing. - (NL) As a lawyer, I cannot possibly accept the imposition of a reversal of the burden of proof at European level, as proposed in the new anti-discrimination directive."
"After all, it is nigh on impossible to prove that something is not the case and far easier to prove that something is the case."
"It is necessary, however, for the EU to ensure that its fine guiding principles and values, as set out in the EU Treaty, are also experienced by its citizens in practice."
"Horizontal legislation in this area is therefore to be welcomed."
"That is why I have voted in favour of the Buitenweg report as a whole."
"I voted with the PPE-DE against the non-discrimination directive because it would have a negative impact on EU citizens."
"The left wing majority has shown today that European institutions do not want to reduce the bureaucracy funded by taxpayers' money."
"This resolution provides proof that the EU wants to extend rules into all areas of people's lives in the Member States."
"It is a bad signal."
"However, this resolution has no impact on the legislative process."
"It is up to the Council to reach a unanimous decision."
"I am opposed to any form of discrimination."
"Originally the directive was expected to deal with discrimination against physically disabled and older people."
"I have also always been involved in protecting these people."
"However, this directive lacks clarity and in my opinion it will therefore not help people."
"The lobby made a hostage of genuine discrimination when it added sexual orientation and religion or belief."
"These forms of discrimination have never been defined in any EU documents."
"The consequences may be dramatic."
"Nobody can precisely define sexual orientation or discrimination based on sexual orientation."
"This represents a potential danger for the interpretation of this directive."
"Non-discrimination based on ""beliefâ is also problematic."
"Sects or political extremists may exploit this directive and the mass media will not be able to refuse them."
"Church schools will not be able to select teachers on the basis of their religion."
"Insurance companies will not be able to take account of information in order to determine insurance risks."
"Insurance premiums will become more expensive."
"Besides, there are some directives and international documents protecting older and physically disabled people and these have not been applied by the Member States."
"in writing. - (NL) This resolution is rather unfavourable, and we should applaud the fact that it makes political dialogue expressly dependent on progress in terms of human rights and internal freedom."
"In this area, the regime still leaves a great deal to be desired, particularly in terms of freedom of speech and opinion, the freedom of the press and the freedom of the democratic opposition and the media."
"There is, however, too much evidence that the regime's recent concessions are merely part of a cosmetic operation orchestrated by President-Dictator Lukashenko for the benefit of the outside world."
"It is far too early to be entering into any kind of normal dialogue with Belarus."
"This is yet another resolution deeply rooted in a vision of interference and stigmatisation with regard to Belarus, which clearly aims to meddle in the domestic affairs of that country."
"When you delve behind the mystifying and Manichean language, the aim is clear: the EU does not accept the affirmation of sovereignty of Belarus and its definition of an independent policy, which is not in thrall to to the interests of the EU/NATO/US, and is trying to get round it."
"The EU is therefore resorting to blackmail and to the imposition of sanctions, which it says can be lifted if this country adopts the measures that are required of it, for example: 'the democratic opposition of Belarus and civil society must be included in the dialogue between the EU and Belarus'; 'make full and effective use of the possibilities to support civil society and democratic developments in Belarus via the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, EIDHR'; or the 'financial support to the independent Belarussian television channel Belsat'."
"Would any of the EU countries agree to such conditions?"
"The hypocrisy of this approach is clear, particularly when the 'European family' of so-called 'democratic nations' does not have a single word of condemnation for the genuine massacre perpetrated by the Israeli army against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip or for the CIA's criminal flights, in which it was, for that matter, complicit."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I voted for adoption of the resolution on evaluation of the EU-Belarus dialogue."
"I am glad that as well as a general evaluation of the political scene, the resolution speaks about specific expectations with respect to the Belarusian authorities."
"Dialogue is not, of course, conducted just for the sake of dialogue."
"It should lead to an improvement of the situation in those situations which, for various reasons, require improvement."
"No-one is under any illusion that the situation in Belarus is ideal."
"We expect, therefore, a review of the decisions made in the case of the conscription of the young activists Franak ViaÄorka, Ivan Å yla and Zmiter Fedaruk."
"They must not be held as 'hostages' by the authorities."
"Franak ViaÄorka is the son of a well-known opposition activist."
"Conscription should not be used as an instrument to conduct politics."
"We also call for recognition of the authorities of the Union of Poles in Belarus and its Chairwoman, Angelika Borys, who were elected on 15 March 2009."
"We would like the Belarusian authorities to order a review of the sentences passed on 11 participants in a demonstration which took place in January 2008."
"These are very specific examples which would allow the Belarusian authorities to show goodwill and a desire to conduct real dialogue."
"I hope that Belarus will take this opportunity."
"It will be beneficial for Belarus itself, for Belarusians, for the European Union and for relations between Belarus and Europe. Thank you."
"If we are committed to building the future of Europe, we must not allow historical facts to be ignored, or the memory of the tragic moments in our history to be neglected."
"Remembering the victims of crimes against humanity should be one of the fundamental elements of the teaching of history and of shaping the consciousness of young people in Europe."
"Ignorance of history leads not only to its distortion, but also to the creation of various dangerous forms of nationalism."
"I would also like European society to know more about Polish heroes, such as Cavalry Captain Witold Pilecki."
"We must remember that understanding the past of the whole of Europe, and not only its western part, is the key to building a common future."
"in writing. - (NL) I have voted in favour of this even-handed resolution, which condemns totalitarianism in every shape or form."
"The 20th century was the century that saw the most shocking massacres in history."
"Nazi-Germany, Soviet Russia, Cambodia, China and Rwanda are reminders of the absolute madness and cruelty which people are capable of inflicting on their fellow man when tyranny prevails over freedom."
"I have one reservation, though."
"I refuse to create a hierarchy of suffering."
"Every case of suffering is unique and deserves our respect, whether the people involved are Jews, Tutsis, Kulaks, Russian prisoners of war or Polish priests."
"This is why I abstained in the case of Amendment 19."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on totalitarian regimes."
"I believe that Europe will not be united unless it is able to reach a common view of its history and conduct an honest and thorough debate on the crimes committed by Nazism, Stalinism and fascist and Communist regimes in the past century."
"I feel that the process of European integration has been successful and has now led to a European Union that encompasses the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which lived under Communist regimes from the end of the Second World War until the early 1990s, and has helped to secure democracy in the south of Europe, in countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal, which endured fascist regimes over a long period."
"in writing. - While I am in favour of the maximum objectivity in analysing Europe's history, and while I recognise the horrific nature of the crimes of Stalinist Russia, I am afraid that this resolution has elements of a historical revisionism that flies in the face of a demand for objective analysis."
"I am not willing to equate the crimes of the Nazis, the Holocaust and the genocide that saw six million Jews, along with Communists, Trade Unionists and disabled die, with those of Stalinist Russia."
"This political relativism threatens to dilute the unique nature of the Nazi crimes, and in doing so provides an intellectual underpinning to the ideologies of today's neo-Nazis and fascists, some of whom are with us here today."
"The motion for a resolution submitted by the five largest groups in Parliament contains many important perspectives on European history over the last 100 years."
"The amendments, especially those by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, are also praiseworthy, but, for editorial reasons, not everything that has been proposed can be included in the text of the resolution."
"There are many tragedies and individual acts of heroism which could be recounted in a resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism."
"Unfortunately, we do not have space for everything and that is why we were forced to vote against some of the amendments to the resolution."
"We did vote in favour of the resolution as a whole, however."
"This shameful resolution approved by Parliament is part of the operation to distort historical truth that is being undertaken by reactionaries and those seeking revenge: the losers of the Second World War."
"They are the same people who are rehabilitating in their own countries those who collaborated with the barbarism of the Nazis, for example."
"The goal is to put neo-fascism in a good light and condemn communism. In other words, to put the tyrant and the oppressor in a good light, while condemning their victims and the ones they oppressed."
"Its goal is to erase the decisive contribution of the communists and the Soviet Union in defeating Nazism-fascism, their role in improving the living conditions of the workers, their contribution to the liberation of peoples from the colonial yoke and the role they played against exploitation and war following the Second World War."
"In Portugal the Portuguese Communist Party fought more than anyone else for liberty, for democracy, for peace, for human rights, for decent living conditions for the Portuguese people, for the liberty of the peoples colonised by fascism, and for the achievements enshrined in the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, which is 33 years old today."
"At bottom, its intention is the criminalisation of communists, their activities and their ideals."
"Such a resolution is even more serious when we are experiencing a time of acute crisis for capitalism, which is making the struggle for peace, democracy and social progress the great requirement of our time."
"in writing. - We of course regret the victims of all aggressive and authoritarian regimes, regardless of the atrocities that have been carried out in Europe or for example in the former European colonies."
"We are however deeply concerned about all direct or indirect efforts by politicians or parliaments trying to influence the general perception of historical facts."
"This task should be left to independent academic research and public debate."
"Otherwise there is a risk that every new majority in Parliament will try to change history by describing the worst enemies of society, and that the discussion on European history will be used for short-term campaign purposes."
"We therefore chose to abstain in the final vote."
"The PASOK parliamentary group voted against the motion for a resolution because it compares Nazism to communism in an unacceptable manner."
"We condemn the atrocities of both Nazism and Stalinism."
"We consider that this comparison does not contribute to an understanding of the peculiarities of these two totalitarian regimes."
"in writing. - (NL) I voted in favour of the resolution on totalitarianism, contrary to my party's recommendation, which deemed this resolution superfluous."
"I opt for a clean break from all attempts to achieve political goals by means of violence, incarceration, intimidation and other forms of oppression."
"The 20th century was the century of major popular movements that were blinded by the idea that they were on the verge of history."
"Any crime was justified to bring about what they saw as the ideal world and to protect it from change forever."
"To some, this ideal world consisted of equality for all, strong provision of services by the State, the means of production in the hands of the people and the abolition of all the old privileges enjoyed by advantaged groups."
"To others, it was about maintaining traditions, inequality, positions of power and privileges."
"I can identify with the first group, but not with the second."
"As a result of their violence, both groups will be forever reviled."
"Nobody remembers their causes, but everyone remembers their means."
"That era must absolutely remain in the past."
"Even though I do not agree with the wording in places, I think this resolution is essential."
"No parliament, no parliamentary majority comprising the representatives and servants of the barbaric capitalist system can use slander, lies and forgery to wipe out the history of social revolution, written and signed by the people with their blood."
"No black anti-communist front can wipe out the huge contribution made by socialism, its unprecedented achievements and its abolition of the exploitation of man by man."
"The joint motion for a resolution by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, which was also supported by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in an indescribably vulgar manner, equates fascism with communism, Nazi fascist regimes with socialist regimes."
"With a pitiful quid pro quo they are proposing a joint European Day of Remembrance for perpetrators and the victims."
"Thus they are acquitting fascism, slandering socialism and exonerating imperialism of the crimes which it committed and is committing today."
"Ideologically they are promoting capitalism as the only 'democratic system'."
"Any political forces which sit on the fence, thereby giving this obscurantist policy an alibi, also bear serious responsibility for this anti-communist hysteria."
"The Greek Communist Party calls on the working class and every progressive person to condemn anti-communism and its agents."
"The 20th century was marked by the crimes of totalitarian communist and Nazi regimes, which were brutally inflicted on millions of innocent people."
"European integration was a direct response to the war and the terror caused by totalitarian regimes on the continent of Europe."
"I firmly believe that Europe will never be united if it does not manage to achieve a united view on its own history and I have therefore voted for the resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism."
"We must acknowledge communism and Nazism as a common inheritance and hold a specialist debate on all of the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes in the last century."
"We owe this to our younger generations who no longer grow up under such regimes and whose awareness of totalitarianism in all its forms has become alarmingly superficial and inadequate, even in the five years since the expansion of 2004."
"Even today many people do not know about the regimes that terrorised their fellow citizens in Central and Eastern Europe for 40 years and divided them from democratic Europe with the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall."
"In 2009 we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the fall of communist dictatorships in Central and Eastern Europe and the fall of the Berlin Wall and I therefore believe that all EU governments should take this opportunity to declare August 23 European Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Stalinism and Nazism."
"This would mark a resolution for all victims of totalitarian regimes and a strong and unequivocal guarantee that these events shall never be repeated in Europe."
"I intend to vote in favour of the motion for a resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism."
"I firmly believe that Europe must be made more aware of crimes committed by totalitarian and non-democratic regimes, because I believe that we cannot consolidate European integration without promoting the preservation of our historical memory, provided that all aspects of Europe's past are acknowledged."
"I also approve the motion to declare a 'European day of remembrance' for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes."
"in writing. - For many across the EU and indeed wider Europe, the consequences of totalitarianism, with its millions of deaths, is a crucial historical point."
"It has helped to form many minds of later generations, but for those who lived during this period of time it represents a terrible scar in European development."
"Extremism is still a current threat and these extremists have an unwitting friend in the ballot box - lethargy."
"As politicians, awareness of the danger to our freedoms and our very lives is something we must all strive to remind current and future generations."
"This is why I can support this motion for a resolution."
"We roundly condemn any form of totalitarianism and, at the same time, underline the importance of remembering the past."
"This is an important element in our history."
"However, we believe that majority decisions by Parliament are not competent to interpret historic facts."
"The evaluation of historic facts is the job of historians and historians alone."
"That is why we decided to abstain from today's vote on the joint motion for a resolution by the four political groups, including the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on European conscience and totalitarianism."
"On several occasions, we have been able to express our views on repeated statements on the theme of 'all totalitarian regimes'."
"Our group unreservedly condemns all totalitarianism."
"It unreservedly condemns Stalinism."
"At the same time, it strongly objects to any attempt to trivialise Nazism by burying it in a condemnation of totalitarian regimes, as is the case, once again, in the joint resolution submitted to us."
"This is why our group is refusing to participate in the vote on this resolution."
"Condemnation of totalitarian regimes that adopted the ideologies of Nazism or communism should be only the first step towards complete condemnation of all forms of intolerance, fanaticism and ignorance that have suppressed and continue to suppress fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and nations."
"Every ideology which does not respect human dignity and human life deserves condemnation and is fundamentally unacceptable."
"Nazism and communism are ideologies that were actually inspired by older ideologies."
"These were formulated in the 19th century and became established as constitutional principles among European states of the time."
"Ideologies such as militarism, chauvinistic nationalism, imperialism, radicalism and later fascism were in their essence inhumane and destructive and they therefore deserve explicit condemnation just as much as the ideologies which appeared later in the form of communism and Nazism."
"We must particularly emphasise this at the current time, which is an uncertain and exceptionally difficult period."
"We must therefore not permit the emergence of new political currents inspired by ideas as anti-human as those that lay behind Nazism and communism."
"Intolerance can be combated only by refusing to compromise or to make exceptions and we would therefore like to ask that the words ""fight against totalitarianismâ are amended to ""fight against all state regimes which have brought about the suppression of human dignity, freedom and the uniqueness of every individualâ."
"I voted in favour of the joint resolution on the role of culture in the development of European regions because I believe that the EU must give stronger backing to cultural projects."
"I feel that the strategies for regional and local development which incorporate culture, creativity and the arts make a major contribution to improving the quality of life in Europe's regions and cities through promoting cultural diversity, democracy, participation and intercultural dialogue."
"The resolution invites the Commission to present the Green Paper containing a number of measures in the area of contemporary cultural activities, aimed at consolidating development in Europe's regions."
"I believe that Europe's cultural spirit is an important way of bringing Europeans closer together in a manner which fully respects their different cultural and linguistic identities."
"Europe's cultures represent strategic factors in Europe's development at local, regional and national level, as well as at EU institution level."
"Culture is a political area which falls under the political responsibility of individual Member States."
"This resolution discusses issues which lie outside the European Union's competence."
"As we take the principle of subsidiarity seriously, we are of the opinion that Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education should be abolished."
"Consequently, we voted against this report."
"Culture is an important element in the sustainable development of European regions and therefore the development plans for all regions must include a cultural dimension."
"A strategy which includes culture, creativity and art will contribute enormously to improving quality of life for inhabitants of cities and rural areas."
"In the relatively small area of Slovakia, my own country, we have diverse cultural regions with their own internal variations."
"The cultural traditions that have developed here over the centuries comprise an unusual variety of forms, types and variants of folklore."
"For example in my own region of StarÃ¡ Ä½ubovÅa in the north east of Slovakia you will find Slovak, German, Ruthene, Goral and Roma cultures."
"All villages organise annual cultural festivals, attracting large numbers of visitors to our region."
"Partnership between the European regions is strengthened through the variety of costumes, songs and dances."
"Cultural projects stem from initiatives by voluntary organisations and they deserve the attention and particularly the support of the European Commission."
"It is a pity that funding for cultural projects is being cut back every year, making it very difficult for local authorities to sustain these remarkable and unique cultural traditions."
"I firmly believe that the Commission should submit the Green Paper with a range of potential measures for supporting cultural activities aimed at strengthening the cultural development of European regions and I have therefore voted in favour of the resolution on the role of culture in the development of European regions."
"I voted against this motion for a resolution on the role of culture in the development of European regions."
"Although I accept that the proposed initiatives are prompted by the admirable aim of promoting regional and local development within the EU, I do not believe they are enough to guarantee the achievement of such aims."
"In particular I doubt that these initiatives will be effective in promoting linguistic and cultural identities, considering that they are not backed by additional wider-ranging initiatives and policies."
"in writing. - Russia remains an important strategic partner for the EU."
"We have common interests like fighting nuclear proliferation and building peace in the Middle East."
"Russia also has an important diplomatic role, not only as a permanent member of the UN Security Council but as a major influence on Iran."
"We therefore need Russia's help to persuade Iran not to build nuclear bomb."
"There are, however, areas of concern about our relationship with Russia: and if we share common interests, I am not convinced that we share common values."
"The state of democracy and the rule of law in Russia remains of concern."
"The freedom of the press is also not of the standard that we would expect."
"Our partnership with Russia must therefore be strong and durable, but it cannot be unconditional."
"In particular Russia needs to know that we will not tolerate the annexation and recognition of the sovereign Georgian territories seized in last summer's war."
"There is definitely only one nation that never finds favour in the eyes of this Parliament, which is usually so quick to approve any economic, commercial or cooperation agreement with Cuba, the Chinese communist dictatorship or even the Turkey of Prime Minister Erdogan."
"The majority in this Parliament, who gave an enthusiastic welcome to Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence, despite its being the historic cradle of the Serbian nation, is now harvesting the bitter fruits of its policy, with the Russian-backed independence of Abkhazia and Ossetia."
"Furthermore, how can only Russia be blamed for the misunderstanding over security issues, when the expansion of NATO up to her borders is naturally seen by the Russians as a provocation and a threat?"
"Of course, difficulties remain."
"Russia though, unlike Turkey, belongs culturally, spiritually and geographically to Europe."
"It is first and foremost with her that we should have privileged links."
"The resolution that has just been adopted makes the purposes and objectives intended by the majority of this House for EU-Russian relations clear."
"It wants them to 'be based on the principles of liberalised and open markets and reciprocity of investment rights between the partners, and therefore demand that, in exchange for close and beneficial economic ties, the Russian Government guarantee the property rights of foreign investors'."
"In other words, the intention is to pressure Russia into handing over its immense natural wealth, for example, specifically natural gas and oil, and into conditioning its productive capacity and making its labour available for exploitation in the interests of the great powers and big business in the EU, which want to have access to resources that should belong to the Russian people."
"The resolution puts all the pressure on Russia, but there is not one single reference to the expansion of NATO to the east and the United States' new missile system in Europe."
"For our part, we reject this type of relationship out of hand."
"We call for the establishment of equitable relations and mutual respect between the two parties, based on the interests of their people and respect for the principles of non-intervention, disarmament and dÃ©tente."
"Unlike Turkey, Russia forms part of the geographical, cultural and spiritual sphere and therefore civilisation of Europe."
"It should therefore be an ideal strategic partner in many areas, especially energy."
"However, it is also a sister nation that we should support and not criticise unendingly, as many right-thinking ultra-Europeans do, especially in this report, which calls the rescue of the Russian-speaking minorities in Georgia a 'disproportionate counter-attack' that 'puts a question mark on Russia's readiness to build, together with the EU, a common space of security in Europe'."
"The ultra-Europeans who are always ready to align themselves with the United States and their war in Iraq have nothing to teach the Russians."
"Ten years ago, these same ultra-European human rights types did not hesitate to support NATO in its unspeakable act of aggression against Serbia."
"We are calling for a new Europe to be built, a free Europe of sovereign nations that will establish privileged relations with Russia."
"I voted against Mr Onyszkiewicz's report with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the new EU-Russia agreement."
"I do not actually agree with the rapporteur on the recommendations made to the Council and the Commission with a view to continuing negotiations with Russia, because I do not believe they are enough to guarantee a fair agreement that respects the rights and prerogatives of the European Union and that can promote the development of good relationships between the relevant actors."
"I therefore believe that both parties must make more effort to achieve this aim."
"in writing. - Russia has to make up its mind: does it aspire to the EU's common values or not?"
"There are many areas of agreement with Russia, which all said and done is our strategic partner."
"We acknowledge the common threat of nuclear proliferation, particularly from Iran."
"We need Russia's help as part of the Quartet to work towards a peaceful resolution of the Middle East conflict with a new PM of Israel and US President in place."
"However we cannot allow Russia to bully its neighbours and use its hydrocarbon resources as a diplomatic weapon."
"Similarly, we cannot allow Russia simply to behave as if last summer's war in Georgia did not happen."
"The annexation of sovereign Georgian territory cannot be brushed under the carpet, either by Russia or the EU."
"Lastly Russia must observe its binding OSCE/Council of Europe commitments to upholding human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"in writing. - I am taking this opportunity to fully support this report which is being proposed so as to further health protection of EU citizens but I'd also like to take this opportunity to say that in Malta and Gozo certain areas of the basic health system are in shambles."
"The waiting lists of Maltese and Gozitans in need of medical tests and surgical interventions are unbelievable."
"2 per cent of the population is waiting for cataract operations."
"The waiting list saga is one of many examples supporting my statement."
"Others include lack of beds in what is supposed to be a state of art hospital costing nearly a billion euro."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report specifically because it urges the Commission to utilise current scientific evidence to protect EU citizens from the potential hazards of electromagnetic fields (EMFs)."
"The 1999 recommendation requires an update within five years of it being published that takes into account ongoing research."
"No update has taken place."
"I requested in my 2008 letter to Commissioner Kyprianou that the original recommendation be revised, as it was then four years overdue for revisions, but there have still been no updates."
"Since the recommendation, we have seen scientific research and conclusions change and evolve as well as significant technological developments using EMFs such as WiFi and Bluetooth."
"Due to the ever-changing nature of this field, we need to re-evaluate the regulations protecting our citizens."
"A 2007 European survey indicates that the majority of EU citizens feel that public authorities have not done an adequate job of informing them on ways to protect themselves from EMFs."
"The EU must take a stronger lead in gathering essential research on any possible harm from EMFs and to recommend guidelines for its citizens."
"I support further research into the effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields on public health and hope that the 1999 recommendation will be reviewed and updated."
"in writing. - I support this report which urges the Commission to remain vigilant and undertake a review of the scientific basis and adequacy of EMF limits through the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR)."
"In this way consumers can continue to have a high level of protection without hampering the functioning and development of wireless technologies."
"Electromagnetic fields (EMF) are a matter of direct concern to EU citizens."
"A special Euro barometer on EMF indicated that Europeans are divided in their concerns about the potential health risks of EMF: 14 % not at all concerned, 35% not very concerned, 35% fairly concerned and 13% very concerned."
"Several scientific studies on the matter have been published in recent years, however, none of them have provided clear evidence on possible effects of electromagnetic fields emitted by wireless technology on human health."
"I voted for the resolution on health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields, as this is an issue that directly affects the entire European public, which is exposed to electromagnetic fields both at home and in the workplace."
"Exposure to sources of man-made electromagnetic fields has been increasing substantially in recent years, largely driven by the growing demand for electricity and ever more specialised wireless technologies."
"For this reason, I believe that it is extremely important to guarantee a high level of protection for all consumers without, however, hampering the operation of mobile telephony networks and the development of new wireless technologies."
"I voted against the own-initiative report by Mrs Ries."
"It is the type of utterly useless report that some Members go crazy about, those same Members who take delight in applying the 'precautionary principle' willy-nilly and who make a big fuss about the slightest 'concern' amongst the public."
"Whilst life expectancy for Europeans is increasing year on year, any new study of the possible effects of electromagnetic fields that raises unanswered questions is blown up out of all proportion."
"On the other hand, dozens of studies by scientific academies and other genuinely competent bodies that have found that there is no real risk are systematically ignored."
"Everything that is exaggerated is insignificant."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Ries's report on health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields."
"It is essential to guarantee a high level of protection for consumers, especially children, without hampering the operation of mobile telephone networks."
"Whilst no scientific proof has shown that the use of mobile telephones presents a health risk, this hypothesis cannot be definitively ruled out, so this matter must be included within the framework of the precautionary principle."
"It is important regularly to update the limit values for public exposure to electromagnetic fields."
"There is an urgent need, finally, to have more information available on the effects of electromagnetic waves and to set up a single system for authorising the installation of aerials and relays, as the report stresses."
"in writing. - I support this report which calls for further research to be carried out on electromagnetic fields emitted from devices such as radios, TVs, microwaves, mobile phones and high-voltage power lines."
"The report recommends that schools, crÃ¨ches, retirement homes and hospitals should be kept away from mobile phone antennas or high-voltage power lines by a specific distance to be determined by scientific criteria."
"The motion for a resolution on health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields is an attempt to manage the repercussions and hide those responsible, so as not to affect the action and profitability of the monopolies, not to prevent and protect."
"The increased awareness and concerns at the grassroots level about electricity and telecommunications companies and about the manufacturers of the electric and electronic devices which are the main source of danger requires research with unequivocal results, given that responsibility for these devices basically lies with the companies themselves, which are interested in selling their goods and services, and hence not in proving the harmful consequences of electromagnetic fields."
"In order to address this very serious problem, which may be a danger to public health, detailed government studies are required into neoplastic degenerative brain diseases, the effects of electromagnetic radiation as a whole on the homeostasis of the human organism and so forth."
"A coordinated fight by the workers is needed so that, on the basis of the principle of prevention, exposure limits and actual exposure to electromagnetic fields can be reduced."
"There can be no fundamental and effective protection of the health and safety of workers within the framework of the EU, which supports the profitability and the competitiveness of capital by undermining public health."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Ries's report on health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields."
"I agree with the rapporteur on the need to give a good airing to the problem of the impact of electromagnetic devices on public health by promoting relevant studies and research that are able more precisely and accurately to shed light on this subject, which is giving rise to a growing debate."
"I therefore agree with her in calling on the Commission to adopt a clear policy on electromagnetic waves, although I am aware of the Member States' exclusive powers in certain areas including, for example, waves associated with mobile phones."
"in writing. - (SV) We have today voted in favour of Mr Schmitt's own-initiative report on Better Schools: an agenda for European cooperation."
"The report points to many major challenges facing European schools and contains a number of good recommendations. For example, the recommendation that students in schools and universities should be better prepared for an increasingly flexible labour market in which employers' needs are subject to rapid change."
"However, we object to a single paragraph in the report which attributes increased violence in schools to factors such as growing class differences and increasing cultural diversity in the Member States of the EU."
"The increase in school violence is a serious social problem, with many complicated causes, which should not be belittled by simplistic causal explanations."
"I voted in favour of the report on 'Better Schools: an agenda for European cooperation'."
"I believe that the EU must support the modernisation and improvement of school curricula so that they reflect the requirements of the current labour market, as well as current social, economic, cultural and technical realities."
"I welcome the fact that schools must strive to improve young people's employability, but at the same time, offer them the chance to develop their personal skills."
"We must also bear in mind the need for young people to be able to acquire basic democratic skills."
"Schooling is a fundamental issue that we should today reaffirm."
"The report entitled 'Better schools: an agenda for European cooperation', to which I have lent my full support, forms part of this objective."
"It insists in particular on the need to guarantee equal access for all young European citizens to high-quality education that enables them to acquire skills and sound knowledge."
"It calls, moreover, for increased financial support for establishments in difficulty."
"Besides basic knowledge, the resolution also rightly highlights the importance of foreign language learning from the earliest years, and similarly the possibility of receiving the artistic, cultural and physical education that is essential to personal development."
"It recommends, moreover, increased mobility and exchanges in the school environment and mentions in this respect the excellent European Comenius programme, whilst noting the need to make it more visible and more accessible."
"Finally, adhering strictly to the principle of subsidiarity, the resolution encourages the introduction of modernised school programmes that take into account changing technologies and the possibilities that they open up."
"'Member States are responsible for the organisation, content and reform of school education'."
"This is laid down in the first paragraph of Mr Schmitt's own-initiative report on better schools."
"That much I agree with."
"The EU's role is to facilitate various school exchanges and expedite student mobility And it should not involve itself in any other school-related matters."
"Unfortunately, Mr Schmitt's resolution fails to keep its introductory promise."
"It almost immediately launches into how schools should be financed and assessed, what kind of curricula they should have and so on. Exactly the kind of things with which the EU should not be concerning itself and exactly the kind of things which should be in the hands of the Member States themselves."
"I vote in favour of a slimmer but more focused EU."
"I therefore voted against both the own-initiative report and the alternative resolution."
"The draft statement contains a number of worthwhile ideas, but schools are a political area which should fall under the political responsibility of individual Member States."
"Therefore, this resolution deals with issues which are outside the European Union's sphere of competence."
"As we take the principle of subsidiarity seriously, we are of the opinion that Parliament should vote against this report and that Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education should be abolished."
"It goes without saying that we voted against the report."
"in writing. - In principle we are in favour of this report, however certain clauses (e.g. introducing into school curricula classes taught to migrants in their native language) do not reflect the realities of certain Member States, especially in respect of influx of immigrants, financial and administrative capabilities, size of country population and many other factors."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Schmitt report on better schools."
"The report rightly notes that the provision of school education is a Member State competence and I believe it is correct that individual nations' education systems are given autonomy and respect."
"Nonetheless, the educational experience of children across the EU can only be enhanced by greater European cooperation and education systems across the continent must adapt to keep up with modern challenges."
"I wish to congratulate my fellow member, PÃ¡l Schmitt, for his report on better schools: an agenda for European cooperation, which rightly points out that inclusive educational models promote the integration of disadvantaged groups of pupils and of students with special educational needs."
"Furthermore, the report calls upon Member States to enhance the access of such pupils to training according to the highest standards."
"Throughout Europe, Roma children suffer from the greatest educational disadvantages: almost a quarter of Roma primary school pupils are in segregated classes, while the majority of pupils who are unnecessarily forced into special schools are of Roma origin."
"82% of Roma have only a primary school or lower level of education, and only 3.1% have access to a level of education that corresponds to the average level of the majority population."
"Yet raising the educational level of Roma children is a profitable investment from the point of view of the national economy, since the spending that is needed in order for a Roma child to finish secondary school is repaid in full through his or her later contributions to the state budget."
"Increased opportunities on the labour market made possible by better education means that they will be able to contribute increasingly to society instead of depending on social security."
"The increase in taxes paid and the decrease in benefits received will, together, mean a net gain for the budget."
"The PASOK group voted in favour of the alternative motion for a resolution to the Schmitt report on better schools in the EU, which succeeded in deleting the reference to the education of children of 'legal' immigrants only and contained other improvements."
"At the same time it would clarify that it disagrees with paragraph 15 of the text and the link which it makes between all levels of education and the 'flexibility' of the labour market on the basis of employers' requirements."
"Mr Schmitt's own-initiative report on an agenda for European cooperation for European schools attempts to point out common challenges and threats faced by the schools systems of Member States."
"In many places it is right."
"This common diagnosis is necessary, if only because of the huge migration taking place within the Community."
"The report deserves to be endorsed, but one cannot help feeling that the common values which the rapporteur sees as the foundation of educational reform do not exhaust all the factors which have shaped Europe over the centuries."
"Subparagraph 17 refers to the full and multi-faceted development of the individual, cultivating respect for human rights and social justice, lifelong learning for the purposes of personal development and professional advancement, the protection of the environment and personal and collective wellbeing."
"These values are desirable, but there are some details missing - I am thinking about the fact that those common values have a source, and that source is the Christian roots of Europe."
"Briefly, it is my conviction that unity in the spirit of Christianity is probably the only lasting and fruitful bond."
"It is a solid foundation."
"Of course, the lack of a reference to this is a flaw not only of this report, but of the entire legislation of the Community."
"This leaves doubts as to the direction of the changes."
"Today we are saying 'yes' to good values, but we are also asking what those values will be tomorrow."
"I voted against Mr Schmitt's report on Better schools: an agenda for European cooperation."
"Although I agree in principle with the general purposes of the report and with the fact that European education systems must be reviewed to improve their quality, I do not consider that this report identifies solutions that are effective in promoting a real improvement in the quality of teaching and the prerogatives of school as a place of communication and socialisation."
"Education is definitely an extremely important subject and we should devote more attention to it."
"Particular attention should be paid to the first stage of education, to pre-primary education."
"Care should be taken to create a good social climate and conditions in which children and young people can develop."
"The education of young people is our future, the future of the entire European Union."
"We should continually work towards improving conditions for learning and creating equal opportunities among children and young people."
"We should also not forget people who are disadvantaged, national minorities and foreigners."
"The continuous training of teaching staff and the introduction of modern teaching methods are extremely important factors."
"We should improve the remuneration of teachers and enhance the importance of the teaching profession."
"I think attention should also be paid to young people who want to study in other Member States of the European Union."
"The place and much less the level of education of young people should not be determined by their financial situation."
"I endorse the Schmitt report and agree entirely that the education of young people at all stages of the process is of enormous significance."

"The final version of the draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 16 April pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"Tuesday:"
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has asked for the report by Mr HÃ¶kmark on a Community framework for nuclear safety to be taken off the agenda."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should postpone the HÃ¶kmark report on a Community framework for nuclear safety for two reasons: the first is that the Committee on Legal Affairs has endorsed the suggestion that there is an essential procedural problem in the Commission's proposal because the Euratom rules stipulate that the Commission must obtain the opinion of a technical committee prior to working on the proposal, and that is something that it has failed to do on two occasions."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has held that this is an essential defect: in other words, it is a defect which requires withdrawal of the proposal and its resubmission by the Commission in line with the rules in force."
"The second reason is that there are no grounds for rushing because these provisions will apply only to power stations that may be constructed after 2015."
"There is therefore no reason to rush, and we have no need to adopt a text affected by such a significant procedural defect as this."
"(SV) Mr President, I definitely think that we should take a decision on this matter during this part-session."
"There are many reasons for this."
"Firstly, this is a proposal that Parliament has debated before and that has now come up again, and the Council has been discussing it since 2003."
"It is finally time to take a decision."
"As regards the legal situation, the group of experts to which Mrs Frassoni refers submitted its opinion on this proposal, whereupon adjustments were made."
"What separates the very large majority in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the representatives of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is the matter of whether this is a new proposal or a proposal that we have been working on since 2003."
"I think that everyone else agrees that this is a proposal that we have been working on for a long time."
"At some point we must be able to take a decision, particularly as many countries are actually now planning to build nuclear power plants."
"I therefore believe that it is extremely important for us to have strong and stable legislation in place for the European Union and so I suggest that, today, we vote in favour of having a vote on the Nuclear Safety Directive this week."
"(Parliament rejected the motion)"
"Wednesday:"
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested that the vote on the motion for a resolution on the opening of international negotiations in view of adopting an international Treaty for the protection of the Arctic be postponed."
"Mr President, we did have a brief discussion about this when we voted during the last plenary session."
"The problem is this: when we had the debate with the Commission and Council, it became clear to many of us in the House that it was not appropriate for us to vote on the resolution, and we therefore asked for it, at that stage, to be postponed."
"I think our view now is that there is no need for a resolution."
"Parliament expressed itself on this subject a couple of months ago; that is absolutely sufficient; there is no need to do it again at this stage."
"The debate that we had with the other institutions was valuable, but there is no need for a resolution."
"(FR) Mr President, I admit that I am a little surprised, since no one thought that this resolution was pointless when we debated it."
"Absolutely no one, and least of all Mrs Wallis."
"Moving on, it is true that the Commission referred to the fact that the European Union wished to join the Arctic Council, and so on. For my part, I believe that, in accordance with the wish expressed by the Commission, this new resolution, which states very clearly our desire for a moratorium on drilling and for a demilitarised zone in the Arctic, is indeed a particularly important one, coming as it does at a time when the border countries are flexing their muscles - including their military muscles - in this zone, in order to claim their property and their drilling opportunities."
"Thus, from a political point of view, it is absolutely crucial that we vote for this text, and this about-turn by Mrs Wallis - and by part of the Chamber, too - is completely unjustifiable, given the debates that we have had."
"(Parliament approved the motion)"
"Wednesday:"
"The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has requested that a Commission statement on the earthquake in the Italian region of Abruzzo be inserted into the agenda."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having consulted the political groups and the heads of the Italian delegations, on behalf of my group, I am asking you to agree to add a debate on the earthquake in Abruzzo to tomorrow's agenda."
"I believe that the people who have been affected appreciate the solidarity shown by the European institutions and by you in person, with the condolences expressed and the minute of silence, and they will also appreciate any financial and legislative support for reconstruction."
"For these reasons, a debate in the presence of the European Commission could provide national and local institutions with a lot of useful information about how much the European Union will be able to do."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament agrees with the proposal made by Mrs Angelilli."
"I would like to thank Mr PÃ¶ttering for his words and the House as a whole for having shown the people affected its emotional solidarity."
"I also believe that tomorrow afternoon's debate could produce not only renewed declarations of solidarity, but also, and above all, specific proposals, because Europe can make a significant contribution to reconstruction, as well as to alleviating the situation of crisis that the citizens of Abruzzo are living through."
"(FR) Mr President, it was with sadness and bitterness that I discovered that the oral question with debate on rosÃ© wines and permitted oenological practices that I and my fellow Members from a large number of political groups submitted within the deadline was not on this week's agenda."
"On behalf of all the signatories, I call for this situation to be remedied."
"I have in fact spoken to some of the political group chairmen, and it seems to me that either they have been misinformed regarding this request, or it has been passed over in silence."
"I would therefore kindly ask you to add the oral question, which was submitted within the deadline, to this week's agenda."
"Mrs Lulling, I have just been informed that rosÃ© wine is scheduled to be discussed in May."
"There will be sufficient speaking time then, something which would not be the case today."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like, if I may be so bold, to express my dissatisfaction and curiosity, because I tabled an oral question with debate which was supported by 48 MEPs, whose support - for your information - was mustered in zero time and even now there are members who have stated that they wish to support it, and yet, much to my surprise, no one has replied to me on this issue as to why, when and on the basis of what criteria it was decided not to accept the oral question with debate."
"Have I now suddenly come up against another sort of earthquake?"
"Is it a new earthquake, does it have a different cause?"
"I repeat once again, taking as my starting point the last fatal earthquake and the victims you referred to and - I would add - the consequential cultural damage and destruction, that we should highlight the European dimension of this phenomenon."
"Given that I was also the rapporteur for the only report by a European institution on the subject of earthquakes, I know full well that a great deal can and must be done at European level."
"I thank you and I await a reply."
"Mr Vakalis, that sort of request needs to be made an hour before the start of the sitting."
"I have been told that this was not the case."
"It relates to Rule 132."
"I would recommend that we deal with this in May, otherwise we will not be able to proceed on the basis of the Rules of Procedure."
"(DE) Mr President, I would request that you ask the House whether that should be placed on the agenda."
"You cannot simply decide that yourself."
"At least ask whether the Members agree with that decision."
"You can surely find a couple of minutes to discuss this important topic, which greatly affects many regions in our Union, and to discuss it in good time, as in May it will be too late."
"Mrs Lulling, the President does not make this decision alone, I follow the Rules of Procedure."
"The decisive factor is Rule 132, by which we are bound."
"The request should have been made an hour before the sitting."
"I will recommend to the Conference of Presidents that we consider this matter in May."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that a Commission statement on genetically modified maize - MON 810 be inserted into the agenda."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation is really a surreal one, in the sense that we are truly among those who are left hanging: most of the Member States do not want to surrender the ability to declare moratoriums on GMOs, and the Commission, clearly, must take account of this negative outcome, although it may act, if it wishes."
"This is the point that we have reached!"
"I believe that on an issue as important as this it would be useful to understand what the Commission wants to do: to continue, to stop, to withdraw or to present a legislative proposal."
"The only thing we want is for the Commission to tell us what it wants to do, and to say so publicly, in a debate at Parliament."
"(DE) Mr President, MON 810 was approved in the European Union in 1998."
"This approval is not mandatory for Member States and each Member State is free to decide whether to accept this approval, to apply it or to issue a ban on the cultivation of this maize."
"I assume that this is the basis for the latest ruling in the Federal Republic of Germany on this issue."
"In this regard, may I say that MON 810 was approved in Germany in 2005, then in 2007 sowing of the seeds was stopped and in December 2007 Monsanto submitted a plan for the general monitoring of its cultivation."
"It was subsequently approved again in 2008 and then, a few days ago, it was prohibited."
"Mrs Frassoni has stated that many Member States have rejected the cultivation of this maize."
"There are precisely four States - France, Austria, Hungary and Luxembourg - and now Germany has joined them, so there are five out of the 27 Member States."
"This is purely a national decision on the basis of subsidiarity and therefore we should not burden Parliament with it."
"(DE) Thank you Mr President."
"We are not in favour of proceeding in the way in which Mrs Frassoni has requested, but for a different reason to that given by Mr Goepel, and therefore I am grateful to you for the opportunity to present it briefly."
"We need to have a detailed debate, not only about this point, but also about the issue of how we want to deal with genetically modified food."
"However, we cannot manage this in the short time we have until the day after tomorrow."
"I therefore believe that we should ask the new Parliament after the elections to conduct a detailed debate on the use of genetically modified food. Thank you very much."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(EL) Mr President, as you know, we are witnessing a worrying decline in international trade."
"Consequently, an immediate reversal in this situation is a fundamental parameter in the economic recovery which we are seeking."
"It is estimated that the increased cost of borrowing and the reduction in the flow of credit are responsible for approximately 10-15% of the slowdown in trade."
"The multilateral trade finance package adopted in London by G20 is without doubt a positive move."
"In my opinion, the Union is also being called upon to continue to play a leading role in the practical application of the London package in three directions:"
"firstly, targeted intervention by multilateral and regional financial institutions;"
"secondly, coordinated public intervention at national level; and"
"thirdly, adjustment of the relevant multilateral rules."
"This message is directed to the European Commission so that it can take the necessary initiatives."
"(FR) Mr President, we have whiffs of Islamophobia in the speeches of a populist extreme-right leader in the Netherlands; we have an increase in attacks against the Roma in the Czech Republic; and we have unspeakable, intolerable remarks by the Iranian President concerning the creation of a racist government in Palestine, alluding to the creation of the State of Israel in a UN conference on racism, intended primarily to promote tolerance and diversity."
"How could our Parliament, aside from showing indignation, not send a strong and symbolic message to promote that diversity, and the tolerance required in a globalised world, by forcefully condemning such remarks?"
"How could it not call on the European Council and the Commission to send a solemn warning to states that subscribe to this aggressive logic, and even voice it, since history has taught us all too often that actions are unfortunately never far behind such remarks?"
"How, during this sitting, Mr President, could our Parliament remain silent in the face of such racist, xenophobic attitudes, in a context of economic crisis in which the withdrawal of nations into themselves, protectionism, is sadly sprouting like seeds in spring?"
"(RO) I am extremely concerned by the events which have occurred recently in the Republic of Moldova."
"The most serious of these include human rights violations, arrests, kidnappings, torture, intimidation and the expulsion of journalists."
"The will of Moldovan citizens has been undermined by the authorities through the numerous irregularities which can provide arguments to support the assumption that the elections have been rigged."
"This includes the supplementary lists, the extra vote papers printed, harassment of the opposition, the ban on access to public television stations and the campaign which the state institutions have run for the Communist Party."
"Although there have been many voices during these weeks which have protested at a European and global level, unfortunately, the situation in the Republic of Moldova has not improved."
"I hope that during the discussions this week and when the ad-hoc mission goes to the Republic of Moldova, but especially through the resolution which we are expecting at the final session in May, the European Parliament will send out a very clear message that the European Union does not tolerate human rights violations and will openly call for the elections in the Republic of Moldova to be rerun."
"(PL) Mr President, on the morning of Good Friday, 13 April, before dawn, a huge tragedy occurred in the Polish town of KamieÅ Pomorski near Szczecin."
"Over 20 people, including children, were burned alive in a building."
"This caused and is still causing great anguish throughout Poland."
"Today, I would like to appeal from this Chamber to the governments of all the Member States and to local and regional authorities to take urgent steps to check fire safety provisions in all residential buildings, and especially in buildings used by welfare services."
"I am thinking both about the use of suitable materials in the construction of these buildings and about a rigorous inspection of compliance with fire safety regulations."
"The drama in Poland is one of many such incidents which, unfortunately, have occurred in Europe."
"May this fire and its victims be a great cry of warning for the future."
"(HU) In the speech I made on 23 March, I asked the European Parliament and the European Commission to intervene to protect the Romanian town of Verespatak (RoÅia MontanÄ) whose vulnerable population, architectural heritage and natural environment are under threat as a result of plans by a Canadian-Romanian joint venture to develop a mine."
"The fears we had then have been realised as, after a two-year reprieve, the new Romanian Government finally wants to clear the way for the investment, which will result in the use of production methods based on cyanide technology, in breach of European norms, thereby threatening not only the immediate environment, but also the entire area along the Romanian-Hungarian border with an ecological disaster."
"I would like to use this opportunity to join other fellow Members in submitting a request to Commissioner Dimas for cyanide technology to be banned."
"I call on the European Commission, in keeping with the spirit of Europe's environmental protection policy, to send an inspection body to Romania to ensure in the long term that appropriate EU-level regulations are applied to mining operations."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about what has happened at Fiat in Brussels."
"With the sole aim of undermining the trade union, Fiat has falsely accused its workers of having taken its managers hostage - an event that in fact never took place."
"There was no kidnapping, either on 9 April or ever."
"The rumour has been deliberately spread by Fiat in an attempt to discredit the workers, who are trying to protect their future in the face of 24 lay-offs."
"Fiat is refusing to have any meetings, discussions or negotiations with the trade unions representatives."
"The sole aim is to lay off 24 workers, 12 of whom are trade unions representatives."
"I think it would be a good idea for Parliament to discuss not only this fact, but also the anti-union conduct by Fiat and a very large number of major European multinationals, which is devoid of respect for workers' rights."
"While these multinationals benefit from national and European Union rules and, in several cases, also subsidies, they do not respect workers' rights."
"(EL) Mr President, a few days ago, a large group of MEPs visited the southeast borders of Europe."
"What we saw and experienced in the area we visited gave us no cause for pride whatsoever."
"I have to tell you that there are European citizens there living on small islands with a population of between 120 and 130, on each of which 150, 200 or 250 illegal immigrants land every day and where they are all living together in miserable conditions because there is no infrastructure."
"I keep hearing talk in this House of Darfur, of Southern Sudan, of Myanmar, and rightly so, but be that as it may, at some point we need to look at these European citizens living there, who are just as European as those living in Paris, Madrid or Berlin."
"I felt it my duty to mention this to you, Mr President, and I trust that you will act."
"(BG) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the moment there is a danger hanging over Bulgarian society."
"Namely, the police force is changing from an organisation intended to protect the public into an agency involved in political racketeering and carrying out gangsters' orders."
"On the evening before Easter Sunday a councillor from Burgas municipal council, 64-year-old Petko Petkov, was knocked to the ground and beaten by two uniformed policemen before the very eyes of a large number of witnesses in front of a church."
"In the official police report filed the next day there was no mention at all of the incident."
"This is another example of police violence against members of the Attack party, in the wake of the beating suffered by the MEP, Dimitar Stoyanov, and a municipal councillor from Sofia."
"Not one of these attacks has come under investigation."
"Another example of the deliberate inaction of the police in cases where they are 'under orders' is the fact that not a single case of abduction has been reported in Bulgaria, even though 15 cases have already occurred, the last two again this month."
"Our society has become gripped by a sense of fear and helplessness."
"As a result, policemen in Bulgaria have become synonymous with 'money-grabbing' businessmen."
"When the officers of law and order are criminals, who can we protect ourselves from and who will defend the people?"
"This question remains unanswered."
"Mr President, I draw the attention of this House to the impact of the unlawful blockade of the cross-Channel ports of Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk by members of the French fishing industry last week."
"This industrial action brought very serious disruptions to flows of freight through this vital trans-European route."
"It adds enormous cost and delay to industry and severely disrupts and inconveniences the lives of people living in the South East of England."
"This has been a frequently recurring problem, and I ask of the Commission that they use their powers to intervene to ensure that this interruption to the free movement of goods and people within the European Union is brought under control."
"Furthermore, I ask of the Commission: is, in their view, the award of EUR 4 million to the fishermen by the French Government state aid, and would it therefore be anti-competitive and unlawful within the rules of the common fisheries policy?"
"Mr President, the recent negative developments in Moldova illustrate a number of issues worth mentioning."
"The first is our response to the violations of EU core values by the Moldovan authorities during the reprisals against young people and journalists, following the protests against the results of the elections."
"Any lenience on our part would cast a shadow over EU credibility in this respect."
"The second is the EU response to the procedural breach by the Moldovan authorities in implementing their agreements with us and by discriminating against European citizens on nationality grounds."
"Again, EU credibility and authority are at stake."
"The third is EU solidarity in the face of the false accusations against one of its members, a possible pretext for freezing the military situation in the area in breach of important undertakings in the field."
"Fourthly, the EU reaction will emphasise once again the difference in status between countries sharing a similar destiny in 1940 and indicate the future direction of EU-Russia relations."
"Mr President, if one of our constituents fraudulently claims welfare benefits, they will be prosecuted and could go to prison."
"Sometimes things seem different here."
"Newspapers reported publicly last November that one of our Members, Den Dover, had paid expenses worth GBP 750 000 intended for the employment of staff to a company owned by his wife and daughter and had used some of this money for the purchase of expensive cars and for other matters of personal gain."
"Most people regard Dover as no better than a thief, a crook who should be in jail, and I invite you, Mr President, to tell us how much of that money has now been repaid."
"This Parliament should be a shining example of openness, honesty and transparency, and instead there sometimes seems to be a code of secrecy here to keep hidden the true extent of abuse of allowances by some Members."
"Our refusal to introduce the same sort of principles of financial transparency that we would expect of any other European institution brings shame upon us all."
"Mr Davies, you can be sure that in this case, too, the matter will be dealt with in accordance with the law."
"(PL) Mr President, the month of April brings another opportunity for reflection on the effects of both totalitarian systems."
"It recalls the KatyÅ Massacre, the murder of thousands of Polish officers - held as prisoners of war in camps at OstaszkÃ³w, Starobielsko and Kozielsko - sentenced to death in March 1940 on the orders of Lavrenty Beria."
"It recalls, too, the beginning of the Warsaw Ghetto Rising in 1943, in protest against the mass transportation of Jews to extermination camps by occupying German forces."
"The tragedy in the ghetto is being overcome in today's March of the Living, which guarantees to commemorate such events and to prevent their repetition."
"Unfortunately, the KatyÅ Massacre and its perpetrators have still not been judged and sentenced."
"Adoption by our Parliament of the written declaration on the proclamation of 23 August as European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism nevertheless inspires hope."
"Mr President, I understand that Mr Davies may have made a speech about a situation concerning myself, and, therefore, I would like the right of reply on that matter."
"I only heard the last 10 words."
"He at least sent me an email in the last 20 minutes saying that he intended to speak on it."
"All I would like to say is that the big fuss and bother about my parliamentary assistance expenses, covered by the media over the last nine or twelve months, has been a harrowing experience."
"I have lodged my papers with the Court of First Instance, so I intend to fight a very robust case."
"I understand I have a very good case and, along with that, I have gone for interim measures, which means that no money will be payable until the Court has heard all the evidence and made the appropriate decision."
"I beg leave to delay the House and thank you for this opportunity."
"Mr President, after 36 years of membership, what has the European Union meant for Britain?"
"It means that we no longer govern ourselves."
"Between 75% and 85% of our laws now come from the EU and not from our own parliament."
"The EU costs Britain at least GBP 56 billion per annum - or the equivalent of GBP 900 per annum for every man, woman and child."
"We no longer control our own borders and suffer unlimited and uncontrolled immigration."
"EU human rights legislation means that we can no longer effectively protect ourselves from foreign criminals, illegal immigrants and bogus asylum seekers."
"The European arrest warrant and trials in absentia mean that we have lost our most basic protections from unjust arrest and imprisonment."
"EU membership is a disaster for Britain."
"It is a grievous and unnecessary self-inflicted wound."
"The only solution to the problem is Britain's unconditional withdrawal from the European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, a few weeks ago, an unholy alliance of pro-European Czech Social Democrats, President Klaus, who opposes the EU, and the Communists brought about the fall of the TopolÃ¡nek government."
"Work is now under way to establish the interim government, which is to undertake the governmental work from May until after the new elections in October."
"I hope that this new cabinet will lead the Czech Presidency, which has so far performed its role very well, to its conclusion and help to enable the necessary ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon in the Czech Republic."
"This would be an important, positive sign for Europe."
"(HU) During recent months, a climate of fear has reigned again in Vojvodina in northern Serbia among the several nationalities which live there, mainly Hungarians."
"Although our Parliament adopted in both 2004 and 2005 a resolution in response to the physical and psychological attacks carried out against non-Serb inhabitants of this area and also took the exemplary action of sending a fact-finding delegation to the area in 2005, incidences of violence, intimidation and humiliation against the minorities living there, primarily Hungarians, are not only continuing, but seem to be getting worse."
"Since the start of the year, a total of fifteen psychological and five physical attacks have been carried out, two of them serious."
"Unfortunately, there is little confidence in the police."
"This is supported by the fact that in the case of ethnic attacks, so far none of the sentences passed have actually been enforced, which indicates the inadequate operation, and, unfortunately, based on many years' experience, the lenient attitude of the judiciary."
"This is also supported by the fact that the Serbian majority cannot acknowledge even now that we must also remember many tens of thousands of people executed without any verdict and individual guilt."
"For how much longer can the European Union put up with indigenous inhabitants speaking a European language being terrorised physically and psychologically by a prospective Member State at the start of the 21st century?"
"Do we not even have the least concern for our reputation?"
"(DE) Mr President, yesterday the United Nations' anti-racism conference opened in Geneva."
"Twenty-two EU countries are participating and five countries have decided not to participate."
"This shows the unity of the European Union in relation to such an important event in a poor light."
"However, I now read that a few countries are still considering travelling to Geneva during the course of the week, and therefore I would ask you to bring your influence to bear on the Czech Presidency so that we, as the EU, can take a united stance on this anti-racism conference."
"A dreadful speech by the Iranian President must not be allowed to divide the EU and weaken the UN."
"That must not be the outcome of this speech, and therefore I believe that we must strive once again - as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has also requested - to ensure that all 27 EU Member States and the EU as a unit actually support the final document arrived at there to help the millions of people in the world who are affected by racism and discrimination. Thank you very much."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the last part-session I asked you to respect Parliament's obligations and to publish data on attendance by MEPs at parliamentary activities."
"Mr President, you gave me your word that at the next meeting of the Bureau - which is the one to be held in exactly 40 minutes' time - this point would be discussed."
"However, I now find that this item is not on the agenda for the Bureau meeting to be held at 6.30 p.m."
"Since there is now only a little more than a month until the elections and since Parliament has made an undertaking to publish data and information on attendance by MEPs at parliamentary activities, and now there will be very few opportunities, I do not know whether a meeting of the Bureau may be held to formally deal with this issue."
"The Secretary-General had made a commitment to provide a report on the basis of which the Presidency would have been able to take a decision;"
"I therefore ask you, Mr President: will the citizens, the European electorate, be able to have this information, as requested, stipulated and decided by this Parliament, before the European elections in June, or will we have to break our own promise and go against our own decisions?"
"(HU) The new Hungarian socialist government was formed yesterday."
"I do not actually want to talk about the political aspects of this event, but about the fact that the new government does not have a single female member."
"It certainly is strange that in Europe in 2009 a new government can be formed which does not have a single woman among the 14 ministers making up the administration."
"In the Scandinavian countries more than half the members of their governments are women."
"France is also approaching this proportion."
"More than a third of the members of the German Government are women."
"This is the generally accepted practice in Europe."
"In this House we have adopted 11 reports on the subject of gender equality over the last five years."
"This is an important objective, based on Europe's values, but is meaningless if it is not put into practice."
"I therefore call on my fellow Members, in this case from the Socialist group, to exert their influence so that these important and noble aspirations are also put into practice in their countries where this has not yet happened."
"Mr President, the other day I was in Birmingham."
"I was knocking on doors - a particularly British way of campaigning - and, unsurprisingly, not a single person whose doorstep I was on had the slightest clue that there was to be a European election in less than six weeks' time."
"I am sure that you know that statistics in the UK show that only 16% of the public know about the elections, but what should be of concern to you is that these statistics are no better across the other Member States."
"In fact, 30% have no intention of participating in the forthcoming elections."
"This lack of interest and awareness is as much the responsibility of this Parliament as of anybody else."
"The millions that have been spent on communications with the citizens have been to no avail."
"What is particularly frustrating for me is that the promised election awareness advertisement has spectacularly backfired."
"A work-life balance advertisement has upset working women and groups trying to encourage breastfeeding."
"It is yet another own goal."
"Mr President, you need to deal with this situation urgently, have the offending advertisement withdrawn and make sure that we have a simple message as to why people should participate in the forthcoming elections."
"This needs to be visible and easily understood."
"(EL) Mr President, I too should like to speak on the same issue, namely the turnout for the forthcoming European elections, which does not promise to be particularly high."
"The reasons include the pre-election campaign organised by Parliament, which is not spectacular enough, and, more importantly, the attacks on the achievements of the European Union, the social market economy, the model which we have fought so hard to develop and which is bearing fruit for workers in the European Union."
"Citizens are looking with a negative eye on developments, which do not promise to be pleasing and satisfactory."
"It is therefore a pity that we are in confrontation here on issues which should unite us in the interests of the citizens of Europe."
"(FR) Mr President, on 14 and 15 March I, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, travelled with Mr Botopoulos to the Peloponnese regions worst hit by the floods of summer 2007."
"We discovered, to our great surprise, that the EUR 89.7 million pledged and due to come from the European Union's Solidarity Fund have still not arrived in those areas."
"We therefore formally draw the Commission's attention to this matter and we should like to know where the implementation of the decisions taken by the budgetary authority is being held up."
"How is it that this aid, which was voted on several months ago, has still not had any significant impact on these regions, where the need for European solidarity is becoming more obvious by the day?"
"Aside from the retrospective monitoring carried out by the Commission, we should like to receive some explanations from the Greek Government regarding the use of this European aid."
"This really is a matter of urgency - human and economic urgency."
"Two years is really far too long to wait."
"(RO) I would like to draw attention to the fact that the increasingly frequent undesirable events which started last year with Armenia and have continued this year with Georgia and Moldova give us food for thought, given that there are two things which they have in common: all three countries are members of the Eastern Partnership and the scenario is identical for each of them."
"I think we should take this fact into consideration."
"Last week President Voronin of Moldova even declared that he wants to withdraw from this Eastern Partnership so that he can push ahead with the unwelcome actions which he is taking against human rights in Moldova."
"I believe that the European Union should work closely with the Council of Europe and the OSCE."
"Mr President, glorification of terrorism takes many forms, but when a Member of this House eulogises vile murderers, whose killing careers came to an end when they met their just desserts at the hands of lawful security forces, then that Member has put herself at variance with everything that this House has ever said in condemning terrorism and those who sanitise and justify it."
"Yet this is exactly what Sinn Fein Member de BrÃºn did on Easter Sunday, when she described IRA terrorists as decent, selfless and honourable."
"There is nothing decent or honourable about terrorism, past or present."
"Shame on any Member who proclaims such obscene adulation of men of blood!"
"(SL) With his populist and hard-line nationalist rhetoric, President Ahmadinejad is causing great damage to Iran's image and reputation."
"He is also threatening moderate Islam in the West and spreading negative stereotypes about it."
"We have to take decisive action against such provocation."
"In sentencing Roxana Saberi, the Iranian regime has demonstrated that it is essentially weak and cowardly."
"In its verbal confrontation with the United States, it chooses to take hostages, in this case a woman and a journalist, in order to mobilise its people ideologically."
"It is making a mockery of all democratic standards."
"Fundamental human rights form the bedrock of the European Union, as does the fight for the right to information."
"The fourth estate, that is the media and the press, are an important tool in restoring democratic standards."
"Any power which is afraid of the press will first strike against them."
"Non-democratic regimes remain in perpetual fear, which is why they persecute journalists, imprison and torture them, and even kill them."
"(HU) On 1 May it will be five years since we became members of the European Union, together with numerous other Central and Eastern European countries."
"It seemed then that each of the new Member States would observe the EU's basic principles and the ban on discrimination, as well as protect and value linguistic diversity and the rights of national minorities."
"Even after five years of EU membership, there may still be instances where the majority language is protected in an open, discriminatory manner to the detriment of the use of the indigenous national minorities' languages."
"This is currently the case in Slovakia, where the language law passed in 1995 and subjected at the time to harsh international criticism has now been revived."
"This draft language law jeopardises the use of minority languages in every aspect of life, which also affects, for instance, the half a million-strong indigenous Hungarian minority who live there."
"Instead of promoting linguistic diversity and protecting the minority's identity, it allows language monitors and inspectors to go into minority communities and impose heavy fines if they fail to comply with these regulations, which can only be described as madness from a Brussels perspective."
"This is why I call on the EU's commissioner for linguistic diversity to intervene and put linguistic diversity into practice in Slovakia too."
"(HU) The 10 new Member States have been in the European Union for five years."
"It is time for us to take stock of the situation."
"Our term is also coming to an end."
"To begin with, there was distrust among the old Member States, but this gradually disappeared."
"In fact, after a while it transpired that on many issues, such as the Services Directive or freedom of employment, the new Member States championed EU reform."
"This is why I believe that we can say that these five years have been a very sharp learning curve."
"At the same time, we must highlight that new Member States still face discriminatory measures."
"I only need to mention the fact that farmers from new Member States are receiving yet again this year only 60% of what farmers in the old Member States receive."
"I should also add that joining the EU was a win-win situation and I would therefore like to thank the European Parliament for welcoming us new Member States."
"We feel that we have been treated here as full equals during the last five years."
"This item is closed."
"Common rules for the internal market in electricity - Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators - Access to the network: cross-border exchanges in electricity - Internal market in natural gas - Conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks - Fuel efficiency: labelling of tyres - The energy performance of buildings (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following items:"
"the recommendation for second reading by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC (14539/2/2008 - C6-0024/2009 -;"
"the recommendation for second reading by Mr Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (14541/1/2008 - C6-0020/2009 -;"
"the recommendation for second reading by Mr Vidal-Quadras, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 (14546/2/2008 - C6-0022/2009 -;"
"the recommendation for second reading by Mr Mussa, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing Directive 2003/55/EC (14540/2/2008 - C6-0021/2009 -;"
"the recommendation for second reading by Mr Paparizov, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1775/2005 (14548/2/2008 - C6-0023/2009 -;"
"the report by Mr Belet, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other essential parameters - C6-0411/2008 -;"
"the report by Mrs Å¢icÄu, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the energy performance of buildings (recast) - C6-0413/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, this energy package is the culmination of years of hard work in which Parliament can be very proud of the changes that will now be put in place."
"We should, in particular, be proud of the fact that the EU's energy consumers have now been put right at the centre of the energy debate for the first time and the issue of energy poverty has now been recognised at European level."
"The inherit conflict of interests that arises when a company owns both transmission and generation of electricity has been addressed, and the regulatory regime governing the energy markets has been strengthened."
"The Electricity Directive, for which I was rapporteur, is part of a package of five measures which seeks improvements in the way the electricity and gas markets work across the continent, to ensure that the markets are better integrated and operate in a fairer and less discriminatory way."
"Let me say how grateful I have been for the enormous cooperation from the other rapporteurs on this package, as well as from the shadows, the Commission and the Czech Presidency, for helping us to come to a conclusion on what was sometimes a very challenging debate."
"The legislation has seen a raft of new consumer protection measures set out, including ensuring that customers are able to switch suppliers within three weeks, the provision in each Member State of an independent and robust complaints system, and the right to compensation if service levels are not met."
"This legislation will also ensure that every household in the EU will be fitted with so-called 'smart meters' by 2022."
"These smart meters will enable customers to better control their energy use and increase energy efficiency, helping to cut energy costs and reduce carbon emissions."
"On the European Parliament's initiative, the new legislation also includes special protection measures for vulnerable energy consumers, and the issue of energy poverty will now have to be taken seriously for the first time."
"I would like to ask Commissioner Piebalgs if he will now make a commitment that, in future, the energy framework of the EU, in addition to addressing security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness, will also now add a fourth leg - that of affordability - to all future energy policy proposals."
"An EU-backed report has recently concluded that up to 125 million citizens are affected by energy poverty."
"Member States now must take appropriate measures which could lead to the prevention of hundreds - if not thousands - of deaths in the poorest households across the continent."
"We will also see the end to discriminatory pricing on prepayment meters."
"The most controversial part of the package centred on whether there was a need for full ownership unbundling in the energy markets - in other words, a total separation of transmission systems from generation."
"The market structure in some Member States means that the monopoly enjoyed by transmission system operators, who also own the means of generating electricity, offers no incentive to encourage other players onto the market, thereby undermining competition."
"Parliament has now accepted a compromise that will allow ownership of both transmission and generation on condition that we see increased checks and balances to ensure the removal of the inherent conflict of interest that arises."
"Many of us reluctantly accepted the compromise because we believe that the wind is blowing in the direction of wholesale separations, and these integrated companies are likely to separate regardless of this directive."
"The Commission's efforts in exposing the abuses of some companies is starting to pay off, with examples of companies like E.ON and RWE agreeing to sell their transmission networks following anti-trust investigations."
"We are also going to see a strengthening of national regulatory authorities."
"I would like to thank everybody for their cooperation, and I think we should be proud of what we have done for the consumers of the EU."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, this package is, I hope, more a case of 'third time lucky' than 'work in progress'."
"I view the future role of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators as crucial in achieving the long-desired internal market in gas and electricity."
"During the trialogue negotiations, it became clear to me that the improvements put forward by me on behalf of Parliament are essential for fair and effective energy markets."
"My objective has been to create an agency with greater independence and decision-making powers."
"In particular, if it is to contribute effectively to the development of a single, competitive, energy market, the Agency needs more powers to tackle cross-border issues and encourage effective cooperation between transmission system operators (TSOs) and national regulatory authorities (NRAs)."
"However, with greater power there should be greater accountability and transparency."
"I have in mind the general principle that we should reinforce the independence of the Agency so as to make it both more effective and more credible by increasing the ways in which the Agency is accountable, in particular to this Parliament."
"I believe this will happen."
"I should say that a number of the roles we have given to the Agency sound more consultative than concrete, but we have tried to create opportunities for innovative regulation by drawing attention to areas where action is needed but the Agency does not have the appropriate powers to act."
"Let me first emphasise the increased forms of accountability that we have negotiated."
"The director will appear before the relevant committee of this House, both prior to appointment and during his or her term of office, to make a statement and answer questions."
"Likewise, the chairman of the board of regulators can attend the relevant committee and give an account of their work."
"Parliament has gained the right to nominate two of the members of the administrative board."
"All of this gives the Agency a forum in the public domain to make its voice heard on issues of its choice."
"Turning to the roles I mentioned, I believe that monitoring internal markets in gas and electricity, participating in the development of network codes, contributing to the implementation of the guidelines on trans-European energy networks, monitoring progress on implementation of projects to create new interconnector capacity, having the power to decide on exemptions from requirements for investments in infrastructure, monitoring implementation of the 10-year network investment plans and having powers to issue opinions and recommendations to TSOs - along with other aspects that I do not have the time to enumerate - will all give the Agency ample opportunities to bring about change."
"Finally, we have introduced requirements for streamlined decision-taking."
"I hope that the Agency will rise to the challenges we have posed."
"We have also created the opportunity for the Commission to come forward with its report on the working of the Agency and to make suggestions as to further tasks and roles that the Agency might fulfil, in the light of experience."
"I would like to thank our fellow rapporteurs, the other two institutions and the Commissioner in particular for their hard and constructive work in achieving the final compromise package."
"I hope the fact that I have been invited to speak second, not fifth, is clear recognition of the true significance and importance of this proposal."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I would like to start by sincerely thanking the rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs, Commissioner Piebalgs and Ambassador ReiniÅ¡ovÃ¡ for the excellent cooperation during the first three months of this year."
"That cooperation has been the main engine of the successful outcome we will be voting on this week."
"Negotiations have been long, complex and sometimes tough, but I think we have managed to get an agreement that is satisfactory to all parties."
"Regarding the overall package, as it has been negotiated, Parliament can be proud of the final text."
"Indeed, our very strong first-reading agreement on ownership unbundling gave the negotiating team a lot of leverage during the talks."
"This has allowed us to obtain a much tighter regulatory framework, in particular in countries with the ITO model in place, where the competencies of national regulators will be increased, with independence from both governments and industry."
"This new role will reduce the risk of uncompetitive behaviour, especially in circumstances where vertically integrated companies abuse their position to stop investments in new capacity."
"Furthermore, agreement has been reached on the review clause that will allow us to check, in a few years, whether all models satisfy our goals of achieving a fully competitive and legalised market."
"Moreover, we have substantially increased the provisions on consumer protection with regard to, among other things, billing information and improved conditions for switching suppliers."
"Finally, another big success has been the introduction of a new provision in the third-country clause, whereby the certification of a transmission system operator (TSO) from a third country could now also be denied if the security of supply of the Union as a whole, or that of an individual Member State, other than the one where the certification is requested, is threatened."
"Concerning the electricity regulation, I would like to make clear that this regulation plays a crucial role, since it gives Member States the tools needed to significantly increase interconnection capacity within the Union by the development and establishment of binding network codes to be applied by all transmission system operators to exchanges, thus removing one of the main physical barriers to the completion of the internal electricity market."
"The agreed text also enhances the role of the Agency for the Cooperation of European Regulators in this process, in line with the first reading in the European Parliament."
"I must admit that Parliament hoped for a much more ambitious agency."
"However, we understand that this is only the first step in a long process of integration of regulatory frameworks."
"We have managed to include a new provision whereby the Agency will be able to propose the basic criteria to be included in the granting of exemptions for new interconnections."
"This is particularly relevant since it is one of the main obstacles investors in new capacity face when dealing with different Member States."
"Having to follow several different regulatory procedures can sometimes lead to confusing results and put off investors - take, for example, Nabucco."
"This regulation also establishes, and gives a defined role to, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO), which will be in charge of drafting the network codes to be submitted to the Agency, as well as developing coordinated mechanisms for emergency situations such as the European Union-wide blackouts we have suffered in the recent past."
"I would like to finish by thanking all the technical staff, whose work has enabled us to obtain an agreement which, at the very beginning of the negotiations, we at times lost faith in reaching."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Czech Presidency, the Commission, Mrs Niebler, as the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, my fellow rapporteurs on this energy package, the shadow rapporteurs and the committee's secretariat, including all its officials, for their cooperation and for the skill they have displayed in working on this issue."
"We all can and should be proud of the result we have achieved;"
"I certainly am, thinking about the work I did when I inherited the directive on the internal market in gas, with problems that had no easy solutions."
"I am happy that this, my second term of office as an MEP, has coincided with the concluding stage of this package, which I believe to be one of the most important matters dealt with in this term of office, and one which will benefit our electorate, the citizens of Europe."
"The Gas Directive that will enter into force from 2011 brings in significant innovations in the sector: one important result that should be emphasised is that the ITO option has been achieved."
"This will open up the markets and ensure that real progress is made towards a system that will genuinely allow the European Union to speak with one voice on energy issues."
"The ITO system is the true innovation in this package and it is the area where the European Parliament can be said to have achieved the best outcome."
"The new Gas Directive attributes much importance to the gas authorities and to the agency."
"The directive gives legitimacy to the authorities in their role, particularly in those countries where they are to start their activities from scratch."
"It is therefore a matter of fundamental importance that we have designated the role and responsibilities of these bodies, and have given them broad powers, since the authorities have the difficult task of controlling the common energy market."
"Another detail, which was added in at the trialogue stage, is the exemption from the common rules for so-called 'closed' systems, such as airports, hospitals, stations, industrial sites, and so on, which because of their specific individual features are subject to a more favourable system."
"This is an example of the attention paid by the new directive to the needs of European citizens."
"In my view, it is, in fact, European citizens that will really benefit from this directive, since with the use of smart meters they will have access to all the information relating to their bills and will be able to assess the best offer on the market and to choose their supplier on the basis of the best price, because while it is true that it will take some years to see the effects of this liberalisation, nonetheless it cannot be denied that the entry of new operators onto the market will lead to a fall in prices and to more favourable market conditions for EU citizens."
"Another important element is the recognition of European transmission network systems that will provide gas supply security to European citizens."
"All this also hinges on the strengthening and creation of new infrastructure such as regasification facilities and storage facilities, which will be the driving force behind the third package."
"What is required, therefore, is the opening up of a competitive market, ensuring long-term investment and contracts from firms in the sector, particularly in the new Member States, where the creation of new infrastructure would also make it possible to resolve long-standing problems relating to energy dependence."
"The protection of more vulnerable consumers has been taken into account, by giving the national and regional authorities the option to guarantee their gas supplies at the most critical times."
"The successful outcome on this Gas Directive and the energy package as a whole once more highlights the role of Europe and its institutions in acting for European citizens."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to express how pleased I am that agreement was reached between the European Parliament and the Council on the Third Energy Package, including the regulation on conditions for access to the gas transmission networks, for which I am the rapporteur."
"I would like to mention the contribution made by the Czech Presidency and the active support from the European Commission in finding common solutions."
"In terms of access to the gas transmission networks, the Third Energy Package's objectives have been achieved."
"The foundation has been laid for creating a common European energy market, based on rules set out in detail in the binding network codes."
"The opportunities have been increased for developing regional cooperation where, alongside the European Network of Transmission System Operators and the national regulators, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators will also play a considerable motivating role."
"This will significantly boost the security of deliveries and encourage a new infrastructure to be set up through the European operators' network drawing up a 10-year network investment plan whose implementation is controlled by the national regulators and monitored by the Agency."
"This offers all market participants the opportunity to get involved, on the basis of clearly defined procedures, in drawing up the network codes and proposing changes to them if their practical application shows that this is necessary."
"The conditions governing competition between suppliers are being tightened through the use of more stringent rules on information and the transparency of transmission operators' actions."
"I would especially like to thank those who participated in the negotiations for supporting the proposals which I drew up on the 10-year investment plan and the development of regional cooperation initiatives."
"In addition, I am pleased that, as a result of the negotiations conducted, a better balance was achieved between the powers of the European Network of Transmission System Operators, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators and the European Commission, with a view to creating a smooth-operating, efficient, competitive market."
"I would particularly like to emphasise that there was close cooperation while working on the five pieces of legislation from the Third Energy Package."
"A general framework was also created where individual elements can complement and reinforce each other."
"I would like to mention the significant result of the active cooperation with my fellow rapporteurs: Mrs Morgan, Mr Mussa, Mr Vidal-Quadras and Mr Chichester."
"I also extend my thanks to the shadow rapporteurs who contributed to every stage of the negotiations with constructive and very useful suggestions."
"I must give a special thanks as well to the chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and his secretariat."
"Madam President, 2009 started with disruption to gas supplies for Bulgaria and Slovenia, along with a sharp reduction in volumes for other countries in Central and Eastern Europe."
"I believe that, based on the Third Energy Package, the unexpected proposals from the European Commission on providing new content for the gas supply security directive and the projects for connecting gas transmission networks supported by the Economic Recovery Plan, by the end of 2009, the European Union will be ready to counter any possible disruptions to supplies, thanks to more material resources and greater solidarity."
"I feel justified, based on the results achieved, in calling on all my fellow Members to support at second reading the common text reached with the Council, which has been presented to you."
"Even though the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency has today been awkwardly scheduled between electricity and gas, we are discussing important and very tangible measures that are of direct importance to every consumer, every driver, in fact to most of us in Europe."
"It is a concrete measure that will cost little or nothing and that will make a considerable contribution to attaining our ambitious climate objectives."
"The tyre of a car - I am not sure if you are aware of this - accounts for 20% to 30% of a car's total fuel consumption."
"It is therefore logical that that is where enormous potential for energy efficiency and for savings lies."
"What are the specific steps we intend to take?"
"We will try to encourage all car drivers, which is just about everybody, therefore, to monitor the energy efficiency and noise emission of tyres from now on."
"We will not obligate anyone; we will only inform people, as we are doing today with refrigerators, for example, by means of a clear label or a sticker."
"Who wants to drive around with B- or C-class tyres if they can also use an environmentally friendly A-class version?"
"Moreover, an A-class tyre is more cost-effective in the long run."
"This is what is known as pure profit, profit for the consumer and, above all, profit for the environment."
"I should like to quote to you one figure: an impact assessment has shown a potential saving of up to one and a half million tonnes of CO2."
"This corresponds to removing the CO2 emission from near enough one million passenger cars on European roads."
"Once this measure has reached cruising speed, the CO2 emission of one million passenger cars will have been eliminated, which is quite impressive!"
"Tyre manufacturers also stand to benefit, of course."
"Needless to say - and this is only logical - we consulted the sector when we came up with this measure."
"Surely, it makes no sense to impose new legislation on a sector that is particularly badly affected by the crisis in the car sector if this would involve extra outlay and red tape."
"These are arguments that hold water and that cannot simply be ignored."
"This Labelling Directive also benefits the manufacturers of quality car tyres, which is why we attach so much importance to monitoring its implementation, which is essential for creating an equal playing field, except that it is at a high level."
"It goes without saying that environmental friendliness should never be at the expense of safety, and this is why we have tabled amendments to this effect."
"Safety remains our top priority, of course, where car tyres are concerned."
"I should like to add a brief comment about the noise emission criterion."
"This is also included because, as you know, noise pollution is one of the banes of our time."
"As such, I very much welcome in this connection the fact that we have built in a cautious and viable criterion in order to further reduce noise pollution but, as I already mentioned, never at the expense of the safety of the car and the tyre."
"I should like to conclude with a word about the time frame."
"In my view, we have reached an ambitious, yet reasonable, compromise."
"We are, of course, counting on car tyre manufacturers, as was the case with the CO2 emissions of the cars themselves, to introduce products onto the market that will meet the most environmentally friendly standards a lot sooner."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, buildings are responsible for consuming 40% of primary energy and for creating 40% of greenhouse gas emissions."
"This is why the urgent implementation of measures to improve the energy performance of buildings is the most reliable, quickest and least costly way to cut greenhouse gas emissions."
"However, boosting the energy performance of buildings also offers huge potential for the EU's economic recovery through the creation of more than 250 000 new jobs, through the investments required to promote renewable energy resources and energy-efficient buildings and, last but not least, through improving the quality of life of Europe's citizens by reducing the cost of their utility bills."
"The new Commission proposal for amending the existing directive stipulates removing the 1 000 m2 limit, setting certain minimum energy performance requirements for buildings and introducing a process for converging the minimum requirements established at national level, promoting buildings which produce locally a quantity of renewable energy equivalent to the primary energy consumed, and only financing from public funds the construction of buildings which comply with the minimum energy performance requirements."
"Parliament has introduced the following important amendments: extending the directive's scope to include centralised heating and cooling systems, increasing the role of and standardising the format for energy performance certificates for buildings, devising a common methodology for defining minimum energy performance requirements, implementing in the case of public institutions recommendations contained in the energy performance certificate during its period of validity, new provisions on providing information to consumers and training to auditors and experts, as well as granting from 2019 construction permits for buildings which produce renewable energy locally in a quantity at least equivalent to the energy produced from conventional sources, along with introducing new provisions for inspecting heating or cooling systems."
"I invite my fellow Members to visit the exhibition devoted to buildings of this sort - net zero buildings - which is being held in the European Parliament, organised jointly with the WWF."
"Although the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive has been in force since 2002, its implementation in the various Member States has not been satisfactory."
"Member States have identified the lack of funding as being the main barrier to preventing the proper implementation of this directive."
"This is why the European Parliament proposed the funding of measures for the energy performance of buildings from the European Regional Development Fund, the creation of a European Fund for Energy Performance of buildings and the promotion of renewable energy sources through the contribution of the EIB, the European Commission and Member States, the possibility of using a low VAT rate for services and products relating to the energy performance of buildings, the development of national programmes which help boost the energy efficiency of buildings by adopting financial instruments and certain specific fiscal measures."
"Last but not least, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the technical staff from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the CFSP staff from the latter committee with whom I have worked outstandingly well. I await my fellow Members' comments with interest."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, it is not easy in five minutes to give the Commission response to seven excellent reports, but I should not miss this opportunity to thank all the rapporteurs - Mrs Morgan, Mrs Å¢icÄu, Mr Chichester, Mr Vidal-Quadras, Mr Mussa, Mr Paparizov and Mr Belet - and all the shadows."
"I also would like to thank Mrs Niebler who worked really hard to let us come to this report in a very limited amount of time."
"I will start with the internal energy market because two years ago we started with an ambitious goal: to create a truly competitive and truly European energy market for the benefit of the citizens of the European Union."
"The tool to achieve this goal is the third internal energy market package for gas and electricity."
"Today we are close to the adoption of this package and thus to achieving this goal."
"The trialogue has now succeeded in agreeing to the compromise."
"The Commission fully supports this compromise."
"If adopted tomorrow by plenary, it will give the European Union the clear regulatory framework needed to ensure a properly functioning internal market and to promote much-needed investment."
"First, it will facilitate cross-border energy trade with the establishment of an agency for the cooperation of national energy regulators, with binding decision powers, to complement national regulators."
"This ensures the proper handling of cross-border cases and enables the European Union to develop a real European network."
"Secondly, the new legislation will promote cross-border and regional collaboration and investment with a new European network for transmission system operators."
"EU grid operators will cooperate and develop network codes and security standards, as well as plan and coordinate the investments needed at EU level."
"Thirdly, it will provide for more effective regulatory oversight from national regulators that will be much more independent and have all the necessary means."
"Fourthly, it will ensure effective unbundling of the generation and transmission of energy so as to eliminate any conflict of interests, promote network investment and prevent discriminatory behaviour."
"This legislation will also ensure greater transparency, thereby guaranteeing equal access to information, making pricing more transparent, increasing trust in the market, and helping to avoid any possible manipulation or any sort of manipulation of the market."
"This is not just about a properly functioning internal market but more generally about ensuring that the EU can rise to the challenges we are facing in the field of energy: climate change, increased import dependency, security of supply, global competitiveness."
"In particular, a functioning internal market is a key element of the EU's effort to tackle climate change."
"Without a competitive electricity market, an emissions trading scheme will never work properly, and our aims regarding renewable energy will not succeed."
"The compromise reached also strikes a good balance between the positions of Parliament and the Council."
"The rapporteurs have already presented to you the key elements on which the political compromise reached strengthens the common position adopted by the Council in January 2009."
"I would like to highlight a few key issues."
"Parliament's call for stronger consumer protection and the fight against energy poverty is now enshrined in the legislative texts."
"Smart meters, allowing for consumers to be precisely informed of their consumption and promoting energy efficiency, are provided with a target of 80% of consumers to be reached by 2020."
"The powers and independence of national regulators have been strengthened, as well as the powers of the agency, and the rules on effective unbundling have been made more efficient."
"Most importantly, we have also seen developments on the ground."
"A lot of companies have restructured their business and how they deal with networks and consumers."
"Today at the Hannover Messe, I saw that smart metering is making good progress and companies are taking these decisions on board."
"Energy efficiency is definitely one of the key policies of the European energy policy."
"The building sector still has considerable potential to further improve its energy efficiency, at the same time creating new jobs and stimulating growth."
"I warmly thank Parliament for its support for the Commission's proposal on the recast of the Energy Efficiency of Buildings Directive."
"The discussions and proposals demonstrate that Parliament shares the policy objectives and wishes to vigorously improve current performance."
"It is not an easy area, as there is a lot of subsidiarity, so we need to strike a good balance."
"The Directive provides a framework to upgrade the energy performance of the EU's buildings."
"There is a lot of clarification, and this reinforces the effect of the directive, like the principles on the 'cost-optimal' method, requirements on control mechanisms and many definitions."
"There is the issue of financing instruments that are very important for stimulating energy efficiency measures, but these need to be tackled in the appropriate legislation and initiatives."
"Consequently, the Buildings Directive is constrained in what it can do with respect to financial and fiscal issues."
"Very efficient buildings, whether they are called low- or zero-energy buildings, or next-generation buildings, are a new feature introduced into the Directive by the Commission."
"It is essential to make this provision ambitious but realistic, and with some flexibility given the EU's varied climate and economic conditions."
"Unified requirements like net zero-energy buildings would not exactly fulfil this requirement and would therefore be excessive."
"Harmonisation is crucial for the internal market."
"I fully support Parliament's wish to have a single methodology for calculating cost-optimal levels of requirements."
"However, prescribing a common methodology for the energy performance calculation itself could be counter-productive, causing delays in the implementation of the Directive by several years due to the complexity of Member States' building codes."
"This is therefore very complex and difficult legislation, but I very much rely on Parliament strengthening this legal instrument."
"The rapporteur also spoke about tyres that can play a significant part in reducing road transport energy intensity and emissions."
"The combined impact of this proposal together with the type-approval legislation on tyres should bring around 5% fuel savings on the total EU fleet by 2020."
"This proposal will provide consumers with standardised information on fuel efficiency."
"It will also give information on wet grip, which is another essential parameter for tyres, and external rolling noise."
"By doing so, the label will pull the market towards better-performing tyres while avoiding improvements on one aspect being achieved at the costs of others."
"The report which will be put to the vote this week will add some significant improvements to the initial proposal, such as the change from a Directive into a Regulation, which will reduce transposal costs and ensure that the same application date for the label applies to all."
"The inclusion of snow tyres within the scope of the label, with the adoption of a specific grading as soon as possible, will also benefit those driving in ice or snow conditions."
"It is important that we find the best way of displaying the label."
"There is some discussion on this."
"We would very much like you to support our proposal to integrate the label on the stickers which are currently delivered with each tyre to indicate their dimension, load index etc."
"I believe we have really made remarkable progress on the energy dossier during this legislation and, most importantly, it is supported by our citizens and by industry."
"Having been at the Hannover Messe, we have seen a huge drive from industry for energy efficiency, not only in the areas we have now legislated on, but also in other branches of industry such as different appliances used for end consumption and to produce tools for different types of industry."
"Energy efficiency, energy and Europe: these are the key words for what we have achieved during this legislation."
"I would like to thank all those involved and particularly all Members of the European Parliament that supported this."
"As a final word of apology, I could have another five minutes but I will use only one minute when I am given the floor for the second time. Thank you for letting me finish this speech."
"Madam President, thank you Mr Piebalgs for your focussed speech."
"I believe that we can best measure the progress we have made by what we set as the goal at the beginning of the debate."
"I remember the situation at the start as being one in which Mrs Kroes presented an analysis showing that, despite several liberalisation packages at European level, the market power is held by fewer and fewer players - large energy companies - in ever more EU Member States, in other words the concentration is increasing in the energy sector in relation to electricity just as it is in relation to gas."
"I was therefore pleased at the start of the debate that both the Commission and then later the European Parliament said that the most effective instrument to combat this concentration - particularly in the electricity sector - is the separation of generation and grid."
"I would make a bet with you today that without this separation - as you initially advocated - we will not manage to provide any real protection for consumers from arbitrary prices on the energy market."
"I am also willing to bet that this Parliament will discuss this instrument again in the foreseeable future, because what we are deciding on now will not be enough to break down this power and the dominant position of some large energy companies."
"It will not be enough to prevent electricity and gas prices rising ever higher, despite ever increasing profits in the energy sector."
"It will not be enough actually to provide the transparency and consumer protection promised here by many well-meaning Members of this House."
"I have to acknowledge that these Members have fought very hard in this respect."
"However, I also have to say that it is the large companies and some of the Member States that have succeeded here, and not the far-sighted European politicians."
"I hope that you will accept the bet and then in four years' time we will discuss the next liberalisation step and we will actually talk about unbundling."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Morgan for her report on the electricity markets."
"As a shadow rapporteur it has been a pleasure to work together with her, and I think it is fair to say that we have been able to achieve a liberalisation of the energy markets."
"At least, we have made some important steps, and thereby we have opened up the market."
"I think it is fair to say that the report on electricity also played the lead in the process that we are discussing here today."
"I think it is important to state that this is also in contrast to those in different countries who would like to have more protected borders regarding energy markets."
"We have a debate in Sweden in which there are those who would like to have some sort of protectionism regarding the export of electricity."
"But that would hinder and damage all the things that we can achieve by an open electricity market."
"It is by opening up the markets that we can do something about climate change and can make the best use of renewables and nuclear power."
"We can also ensure that we have a good supply of energy all over the Union, binding countries and markets together."
"I think the steps we are taking with this energy market package should be seen as important ones."
"Although there are more steps to be taken, we have contributed to the energy security of Europe and to the fight against climate change."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, the third energy package is about harnessing the sector with the aim of providing more security and transparency, as well as sustainable and affordable energy for all European citizens and enterprises."
"It is about facing the energy challenges in front of us."
"It is about reducing Member States' dependency on single outsource countries."
"It is about more customer and consumer satisfaction."
"It is about avoiding market distortions, especially between those countries which produce cheaply and those countries which wish to buy cheaply, which are not necessarily the same."
"It is about attracting investors in the field of energy."
"The European Agency will have a key role to play and, as my colleague the rapporteur, Mr Chichester, has said, we have achieved a strong and independent agency and we have been able to increase the role of the European Parliament to satisfy those targets which I mentioned above."
"I think it was wonderful working together."
"Somehow it is a pity that we are ending this energy package."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in September 2007 the European Commission presented its third energy package in relation to the operation of the internal market."
"Very quickly, the debates began to focus on the important, though not exclusive, issue of separating the activities of producing and transporting energy."
"The issue of network ownership, which in my view was insufficiently dealt with at first reading, seems to have been taken more seriously."
"The coexistence of different options, including the infamous third way, now enhanced and clarified, strikes me as being a good thing - which is an obvious statement given that I was co-author of this amendment."
"Fortunately, however, summing this third package up as ownership unbundling would be a mistake."
"The progress made is real: more rights for consumers, more powers for regulators, more cooperation among regulators, 10-year investment plans, more transparency to facilitate the development of renewables, more technical cooperation among network operators, and also tools for better consumption, such as smart meters."
"This is a further step towards European solidarity."
"The 'third-country' clause, despite appearing less sensational than that initially drafted by the Commission, does explicitly state that a Member State has the right to refuse to certify an operator if certifying it would jeopardise the security of its energy supply or that of another Member State."
"I do perhaps have one regret concerning the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators: our wish would have been to create a strong, independent agency that is capable of taking decisions without the support of our body."
"We came up against the infamous Meroni judgment."
"Let us not delude ourselves: the construction of a true European energy policy will require yet more advances, and institutional ones in particular."
"The security of supply, the fight against climate change, the regulation of markets: all of these objectives should be pursued with a pragmatic, not dogmatic, approach."
"What European citizens expect is not the application of economic theories, but concrete evidence that the opening up of markets will benefit them, by giving them the freedom to choose their suppliers, and reasonable, stable and predictable prices."
"I am grateful to my fellow Members, to our commissioner and to the Council for this constructive effort."
"Madam President, Commissioner, speaking in this debate on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would like to draw attention to four points."
"Firstly, we should assess positively the solutions which aim to separate production and sale of electricity and gas from their transmission."
"This should allow competition between producers of energy sources and so a reduction in the price of services."
"Secondly, it is important that particular Member States which are obliged to introduce separation of energy production from its transmission can adopt one of three models for this: the greatest possible division of ownership, handing over network management to an independent operator, and the option of retaining integration of production and transmission of energy, but only if conditions are met which ensure that these two parts of the business will in practice operate independently."
"Thirdly, the solutions regarding strengthening the position of the consumer in the electricity and gas market deserve emphasis, and especially the option to change energy supplier within a maximum of three weeks without incurring any additional charges."
"Fourthly and finally, also worthy of special notice are the solutions which have a social dimension, requiring Member States to give assistance to electricity and gas consumers who cannot afford to pay their bills."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, first, on the Å¢icÄu report, the Greens will vote for it: it has a green mark, and I thank all the team who negotiated."
"I want to spend the few seconds I have here on internal markets."
"It is already clear this evening that we need a fourth package on liberalisation, with five items: firstly, ownership unbundling for pipelines and grids; secondly, access to storage of electricity and of gas; thirdly, more power for the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators; fourthly, public ownership of the power exchanges, because otherwise it will never function; and fifthly, we need a specific cartel law for infrastructure-based economies."
"Although Eluned Morgan has fought hard for the consumers, consumers can only gain when the wholesale market is functioning."
"Enel is taking over Endesa, RWE is taking over Nuon and Vattenfall is taking over Essent."
"We will end up with 10 mega-players who do not have any interest in either an environmental agenda or a consumer agenda."
"This will be a cartel, and to face this cartel we need stricter laws."
"In this sense we have a defeat this evening, orchestrated by Mr Reul, Ms Niebler and others of their like."
"It is a big victory for the energy oligopolies and it is a defeat for consumers in Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is not possible to cover the entire energy package in a short space of time."
"Despite that I would like firstly to thank everyone involved in producing the documents we have on the table."
"However, let us be realistic."
"The result is still far from perfect."
"Nevertheless, I believe it was impossible to achieve more at this point in time."
"The fact that the current Parliament is approaching the end of its mandate has undoubtedly played a part."
"Personally, I would like to speak mainly about the document presented by Mr Chichester on establishing an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators."
"As the shadow rapporteur I have been advocating, among other things, that the agency should contribute to the setting up of regional markets."
"In the meantime it has not been possible to fulfil more beneficial plans such as the creation of a supra-national pan-European regulator."
"I have also been urging confirmation of the original Commission proposal to retain the principle of 'one member, one vote' for decision-making in the Council of European Energy Regulators."
"This is very important for small EU Member States."
"The attempt mainly of the big States such as France and Germany to push through a so-called weighted ratio of votes would disadvantage small countries."
"For example, the principle of 'one member, one vote' makes the Czech Republic and other countries better able to oppose efforts made by some large grid operators to dominate the market."
"In this context I am pleased that my efforts have not been in vain and I consider this a success for the Czech Presidency."
"Not everything concerning the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators was brought to a conclusion."
"For example, the issue of its headquarters remains open."
"Personally, I would be delighted if the agency could be located in Slovakia, which is interested in it."
"However, the least acceptable solution would be the so-called provisional option under which the agency would remain in Brussels, which already has plenty of agencies - including some that were originally supposed to be there only on a temporary basis."
"Madam President, from time to time I have heard the single electricity market on the island of Ireland held up as an example of such concepts in action."
"Judged by what matters most to consumers - namely price - I have to say it is not a success."
"When Minister Dodds launched it, he promised efficiency savings and enhanced competition to help minimise the wholesale costs of electricity, with the vast bulk of the benefits going to the consumer."
"This rings rather hollow now, not least to the consumers from Northern Ireland who are in the public gallery listening to this debate."
"In my view, part of the problem is an ineffective regulatory process that is too aligned to the industry and too excusing of continuing high prices, even when the price of oil has radically fallen."
"Forward buying at the top of the market, giving sky-high prices today, barely raises a whimper from the regulator, leaving hard-pressed consumers without the relief that he should be providing."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we agreed that we wanted to ensure that citizens got greater security of supply with regard to energy, that they had sufficient energy and that they were able to buy energy at reasonable prices."
"We did not agree as to the instruments with which we can best achieve this."
"However, today we have a result that we can be proud of and that is constructive and discriminating, because the matter is complicated and there is no simple answer to it."
"The solution is that we must ensure that more money is invested in the energy sector, in grids, in interconnectors and in new power stations."
"This is a very important consideration and the necessary capital must be made available for it."
"On the other hand, we must ensure that those companies providing the energy are monitored and that true competition is created."
"I believe that it was the right solution to approve different models for the organisation of the enterprises, while at the same time ensuring that we have effective monitoring, a strong agency and solid cooperation between regulatory authorities and making sure that companies cannot simply do whatever they want to."
"The fact that completely different provisions can be made - including tailored to particular national circumstances -is a clever solution."
"If used correctly, it may also be a future-proof solution and one that will take us a significant step forward."
"Moreover - and this is true - during our process and the discussions we had in the Member States, we could already see changes taking place."
"The situation is no longer the same as it was at the start of the survey carried out by the Commission."
"The data and facts are now already much more diverse and we have already made significant progress, but what we are about to adopt now will take us another step further."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have already said in a smaller round that this debate on the energy package is not necessarily an issue of black or red, left or right."
"It is, however, full of ideology."
"We have seen this again today."
"I would like to bet my fellow Member from Germany, Mrs Harms, that in four years' time we will not be tabling a fourth package, but will be managing with the instruments that we have: regulating the market, making the grids more accessible - things that have already been successful in the Federal Republic of Germany."
"It is possible to see positive examples."
"I am in favour of us simply keeping things as they are and using the instruments that have been given to us, ensuring that they are implemented."
"Secondly, I would like to argue in favour of the newly founded Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators receiving and utilising definitive powers and applying best practice from the Member States."
"If that happens then I have no doubt that we will achieve a good result."
"(PL) Madam President, a debate on the energy package for the internal electricity and gas market is very much needed."
"In order to function well, the regulations should provide answers to several questions, including the following."
"In the future will there be one common energy market in the EU, or will we have to coordinate national markets?"
"What form of energy will provide, over the next 30 years, stable and sufficient supplies of energy at relatively low prices, because this is important for the EU economy and its citizens?"
"Which sources of energy will best limit the greenhouse effect and reduce the costs of its control?"
"Unfortunately, action taken to date in this area has not been transparent and convincing, which may produce unfavourable results for citizens and the economy over the next 15 years."
"(PL) Madam President, the third energy package was intended first and foremost to serve customers in our continent, and this has been achieved - the customer is the most important."
"However, it was also necessary to take account of the fundamental interests of energy producers."
"We were faced with two important problems."
"Firstly, security of supply - and this has been achieved."
"In my opinion, compared with the first and second packages a significant advance has been made."
"Creation of a common market for energy is becoming a fact, and the principle of solidarity is today in evidence."
"We can also, when this is required by our security needs, invest outside the borders of the EU."
"Secondly, the principle of open competition in the European energy market."
"This has not been fully achieved, and it may be necessary to think of further, more specific solutions."
"However, from now on we must ensure that conditions in the European market for investors from third countries are the same, and not better, as for investors from Member States, and that our energy concerns can compete on a mutual basis and invest freely outside the European Union."
"I would like to stress that the third package is a major political event, not only a technical and economic one, and we really should recognise it as a great success of the European Union."
"(DE) Madam President, I believe that in this case - I was shadow rapporteur for my Group for the gas sector - a compromise has been found that we can agree to for the other sectors too, because we did not look to the market in an ideological way, but thought in practical terms."
"A common European market means, above all, that we give the national regulators more opportunity, more power, and that we establish common European criteria, so that no one regulator makes completely different decisions to the others and we do not have a situation where one is dependent on the government and the others are not and we have a European agency, which, in cooperation with the Commission, can really work towards forming a European market."
"The second very important aspect is the fact that the role of the consumer is strengthened, something that in principle is reflected in several provisions, although I would have liked to have seen it in more."
"It is about consumers having opportunities and rights and finding transparency in this important supply sector."
"Both of these conditions are met and I am therefore voting in favour of this package."
"(LV) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, last winter strikingly demonstrated the extent to which we are dependent on gas imports and how this dependency is used as a foreign policy instrument."
"I would therefore like to emphasise, in particular, the need to develop, as quickly as possible, a united, open and effective internal market in natural gas in the European Union, producing a code of regulations for the network in order to ensure transparent cross-border access to supply networks, to enable long-term planning and development."
"The long-term plan should include both gas supply networks and regional interconnections."
"Improvements need to be made to the regulations in order to guarantee non-discriminatory access to infrastructure."
"At the same time, I would like to lay particular stress on the need for the diversification of energy sources, through the development of genuine incentives for the more widespread introduction of renewable energy."
"Since buildings account for 40% of the European Union's total energy consumption, an emphasis on the use of renewable energy in buildings is of prime importance for their energy efficiency, economy and insulation."
"European Union, national and local government measures, as well as financial incentives, must be linked together in a single system. Thank you."
"(SK) Before proceeding to a number of aspects of this report I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Å¢icÄu, and the other shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation in compiling the report."
"My interest and the interest of my political group was for this report to provide good preconditions for a speedy final agreement between the Commission, the Council and Parliament on practical measures for improving the energy performance of buildings in the various Member States."
"In this connection, I must say that I was critical of some of the proposals, which amount to pointless bureaucratic measures and excessively ambitious binding targets for individual Member States and which in the final analysis would seriously hinder the practical implementation of much-needed projects."
"One significant aspect of this report is the agreement on a single harmonised methodology for calculating the most cost effective energy performance, which forms the basis for Member States to specify their minimum standards and which also respects regional variations in climate."
"Finally I would also like to mention the aspect of financial support, which is essential for implementing measures to improve energy performance in the various Member States."
"I agree with the proposal to establish a European fund in cooperation with the European Investment Bank which would create conditions for generating financial resources to create national or regional funds through the so-called leverage effect."
"I also applaud the proposal to encourage better use of the Structural Funds for the purpose of improving energy performance in the various Member States."
"In conclusion I would like to emphasise a very important fact, which relates to the speedy and careful examination of energy performance improvement measures in the various Member States."
"The revival of the energy performance of buildings sector, except for a striking reduction...."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FI) Madam President, I would particularly like to thank the rapporteurs, who are talking over there."
"This is an important stage that we have reached."
"We are on the right path, although, as has been said, today nothing is enough."
"We have a lot of work ahead of us."
"Smart meters, the need to have a viable and open energy system, the need for genuine competition: these are the words and phrases we think are important, and that is also true of the rights of the consumer."
"Energy poverty has become a serious issue."
"The price of energy is rising; it is an expensive commodity, and that is why people's rights have to be guaranteed."
"For that reason we are making energy a public service with this legislative package."
"As far as my group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, is concerned, it shows that we are defending the interests of consumers and therefore making the market as transparent as possible."
"Let us make further headway along this route. Thank you."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, from the beginning of our negotiations on the Belet report we found that all the stakeholders - from the tyre manufacturers to the environmental lobbyists - were broadly in agreement on the need for this legislation."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the way he has dealt with this particular report and the way he has worked with the shadows."
"I believe this legislation is needed right now."
"It will give a boost to the car industry at what is a very difficult time."
"I recently visited Michelin in Stoke and Jaguar Land Rover factories in my constituency, where I saw how research and development into green technology is already very much in place."
"Any support the industry receives during the downturn must focus on the requirements to adapt to the environmental challenge."
"Legislation such as this will ensure our manufacturers become world leaders in the technology we so urgently need."
"It is a win-win proposal, because it will also help the consumer by providing much-needed clarity."
"Tyres are not cheap, yet most individual buyers are forced into uniform purchases."
"This information will help make the move towards goods that reduce emissions as well as noise pollution."
"Through this proposal we can promote a truly competitive market in greener goods."
"(RO) Commissioner, the first benefit which citizens will enjoy in the new free market set-up is rooted in the very essence of the concept of democracy."
"I am talking about freedom."
"Efficiently operating markets which offer newcomers the opportunity to provide energy services to citizens will be a beneficial alternative for consumers."
"In fact, their role will change from being passive beneficiaries of a service to becoming active players in the market."
"For instance, they will be able to change supplier if the services are of poor quality, if the electricity supply is disrupted or if prices are too high."
"The freedom of choice will enable consumers to become actively involved in the battle against climate change, as they will be able to choose suppliers which offer renewable energy with low carbon emissions."
"The new package of measures will entail lower prices, innovative products and an increase in the quality of services."
"Another way in which citizens will benefit after deregulation of the energy sector is through energy supply security."
"I welcome the inclusion in the new legislation of special measures for protecting vulnerable consumers."
"(SL) The European Parliament has rightly put the consumer at the heart of its negotiations, because what the internal market needs is a consumer with more rights and one with access to clear information."
"The consumer must have the option of choosing his or her service provider, which is why he or she also needs a smart meter."
"I am pleased that we have reached agreement on this extensive and professionally demanding dossier."
"However, I think that the negotiated compromise on ownership unbundling still permits major organisational differences between electricity and gas markets in the various Member States."
"I also hope that, with the mechanisms and provisions contained in this package, such as greater independence for national regulators, we will manage to overcome these differences and re-establish a single market for electricity and gas."
"(PL) Madam President, for the success of an undertaking like the creation of a uniform energy space, common and coordinated investments in the energy infrastructure are essential."
"A key task is to increase the generating capacity of European power stations and develop the cross-border network."
"At the same time the good of the environment and the guidelines of the climate and energy package should be kept in mind."
"Another challenge which appears when harmonising the EU energy market is the matter of ensuring security of supplies of energy sources from outside the EU."
"For economic reasons as well as for reasons of security it is necessary to strive for diversification of supplies and increase efforts to develop the European energy system."
"Finally, there is a fear that opening the energy market fully to competition may be a danger to the poorest people of the EU, who often are not able to pay their bills regularly."
"It is worth considering at this point possible instruments which would guarantee that such people will not have their electricity cut off."
"(BG) Madam President, I was the shadow rapporteur for the gas market on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"I believe you will all agree that the biggest achievement of the Third Energy Package is the protection afforded to Europe's consumers and citizens."
"This is the first time that such texts have been drafted clearly."
"I would like to focus particular attention on the definition of fuel poverty and on making it impossible to cut off supplies, as well as on the possibility of switching suppliers free of charge and on easy-to-understand, transparent agreements."
"However, the future of this legislation lies in providing even stronger guarantees to consumers, protection measures for vulnerable people, as well as in greater transparency and comparability in terms of contractual relations."
"The next basic question facing us MEPs will be about prices and measures for regulating them at a time when they are steadily rising."
"I believe that this legislation will continue in this direction in the future."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate you on this package in particular."
"It represents a major step forward for our citizens in Europe."
"You will all feel the effects in your own purses and your own accounts."
"It is also a major step forward for small and medium-sized enterprises, because they need to become more competitive, particularly now during the economic and financial crisis, and this type of energy package is the right approach to dealing with this."
"The fact that we will have a European regulator to help each Member State's enterprises to be treated on an equal basis in the other 26 Member States and that the energy suppliers on the other 26 markets will have new opportunities is an important aspect of this regulation, resulting in the creation of completely new opportunities."
"With regard to the legislation on passive and active houses I would also like to say that our careful attention to the efficiency of buildings will hopefully result in the creation of new jobs in this area in the future."
"Mr Stolojan, since you have been such a presence in this debate, even though I told you that the number has been exceeded, I think that your responsible approach and your presence should be rewarded, and so, as an exception, I am giving you the floor for one minute."
"(RO) Madam President, I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs for the excellent job they have done."
"I am sure that we are all wondering why we still do not have a single market for electricity or a single market for natural gas."
"This is where I think that every Member State which has not yet fulfilled the provisions of the European directive should do so."
"Secondly, I welcome the decision to set up the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators and I would like to advise the European Parliament that Romania has applied to provide a venue for hosting this agency."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I promise that this will be very short."
"I am satisfied with the package that is to be adopted."
"There is no ideal legislation."
"This is legislation that is being adopted by debate and through compromises."
"We started very much divided, but at the end of the day the Council adopted the proposal practically with unanimity."
"In Parliament's Committee on Industry, Energy and Research there was a huge majority in favour of this compromise."
"That means that we have got it right."
"I know that now there is a lot of work to do in terms of implementation, follow-up and the Agency's needs, but we really have provided the basic instruments for our citizens."
"Thank you very much for the work done."
"We can be really proud of it."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I would like to thank colleagues once again for their cooperation."
"I would also like to thank Bethan Roberts and RenÃ© Tammist who have been a great help in preparing this report."
"This is my swan song after 15 years in the European Parliament, and I am delighted that we have made such a significant improvement in the energy markets on behalf of the European public."
"It is far from perfect but it is definitely a step forward."
"I think that the energy crisis will become more acute in future years, so getting the right market framework in place, and creating the right kind of incentives for the right kind of investment, is crucial."
"We need an estimated EUR 1 trillion worth of investment in the markets to stop the lights from going out in future."
"But there is a huge amount more to do."
"You know that there are 12 countries in the European Union where one company dominates 70% of the electricity market."
"What we have at the moment is the worst of both worlds."
"We think we have competition, but what we have is the massive power of very large companies dominating certain markets."
"It will require action on the part of national regulatory authorities and competition authorities to make sure that we do not continue in this way."
"The real challenge in future will be implementation."
"Let us not forget that there are many EU laws that already exist in the energy markets, and it is precisely because these laws were not being respected that the revision of this law needed to take place."
"Whether we need a fourth package or not will depend on the Commission ensuring implementation and good policing of these new laws by national regulatory authorities and competition authorities."
"So let us see a bit of action from the Commission, and also from the national regulatory authorities."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, can I first of all say that my colleague Mr Vidal-Quadras sends his apologies?"
"He is not able to take up his slot."
"He has urgent business elsewhere, but he asked me to say - which was very nice of him - that the two of us agree that I will speak on behalf of our group."
"I would like to pick up one or two points that have come up in the debate."
"The first is the colleague who expressed concern that we will end up with a concentration of power in very few utilities."
"Should that happen, the Commission possesses powers under the competition rules to address that, and we have precedent in other parts of the world, including the United States, where they have tackled entrenched monopoly or dominant market power."
"So that is the ultimate resort, should this legislation fail."
"Should we come back for a fourth package?"
"I have to remind the Commissioner that I urged upon him caution in embarking upon the third package: that it would be better to wait and see what the second package achieved once it was implemented."
"I think now we must allow time for this package to be transposed: to implement it and see how it works before deciding whether anything is needed."
"I have to say that my disappointment about our lack of success in tackling ownership unbundling is offset by my optimism about the possibility of the Agency imaginatively using the powers that we have given it to deal with the situation, and I would like to thank my other colleague who demands more power for the energy regulators."
"Market forces are already moving in this direction."
"Two German utilities are divesting themselves of their transmission systems because they have realised there is better value in doing that."
"Finally, could I restate the case for competition?"
"It means better value and service for consumers, and it means a more efficient use of resources."
"That is why it is a good thing to do."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a very strong feeling has emerged from this joint debate: great satisfaction at having created, in the shape of this third package from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, a package that is important for European citizens."
"It will naturally not be the last package, because - as you know - there is a huge impetus towards the use of alternative sources of energy, such as renewables and nuclear energy."
"Over the next 10, 15 or 20 years, however, it will certainly provide for the demand and need for energy and will provide for, and of course protect, consumers, particularly the most vulnerable ones."
"I believe that Mrs Morgan, myself and all the other Members involved have played a significant role in the protection of vulnerable consumers, giving considerable powers to both the national and regional authorities, which can, at times of crisis, make changes - I am not saying that they can give energy for free - but they will certainly be able to make changes and permit a continuous supply of energy."
"The other fundamental point is this: that Europe's population is unaware of all that we have done at the Commission, the Council and in Parliament on this package, which is of crucial importance for energy consumers - you saw what happened last winter."
"I think there is nothing worse than not letting those who benefit from a major project know about it."
"I think that the task that should fall to the Commission, the Council and Parliament, even before we concern ourselves with the application of this package, is to let consumers know that the package exists, let them know what has been done for them, on their behalf and, once again, for them."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, like my colleagues I would like to say that, although it is not perfect, the third energy package is a very good basis for developing our common market, especially in gas, and for enhancing gas security."
"For countries like mine, which is a small country in the European Union, to reach a compromise on ownership unbundling is very important, because it gives us an assurance that we can still ensure our energy security within the context of the whole package of the enhanced rules, transparency, the third-country clause, and all the other components of the package that will give us the opportunity to put the issue of energy security at the forefront."
"The package also gives an assurance to consumers that they can pursue their rights, and it creates a better competitive framework for the development of the energy markets and for their efficient functioning."
"This package depends on implementation, as my colleague Eluned Morgan has just said, and I do not believe that the fourth package is the solution."
"Rather, the solution is exact implementation and solidarity among Member States in creating the market, especially by developing new initiatives for regional cooperation, especially for countries most vulnerable to energy supplies and to countries that, for the moment, are part of energy islands."
"With regard to the labelling of energy-efficient car tyres, a measure that ended up in this package, I should like to add a word about the costs."
"This is a measure that is of hardly any cost to the tyre industry, and therefore also to the consumer."
"The cost to the manufacturer has been estimated at less than EUR 0.01 per tyre, which is negligible, in case anyone were to feel inclined to voice any criticism."
"Any added cost resulting from the purchase of energy-efficient car tyres will, according to calculations, be recovered within eight months."
"This is when both the car driver and the environment will start feeling the true benefits."
"Having said that, I should like to stress the fact that it is essential that this measure be applied equally across all Member States and also to all manufacturers in the EU and beyond."
"That is why we would prefer to see a regulation instead of a directive."
"In conclusion, we realise that, whilst there are still differences of opinion among some groups in this Parliament on a number of aspects, we hope that this measure will be endorsed by a large majority tomorrow."
"At cruising speed, we will, with this simple measure, be able to save a volume of CO2 emissions equivalent to removing one million passenger cars."
"It goes without saying, therefore, that we should introduce this measure sooner rather than later."
"I should like to finish off with a word of thanks to the shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Chambris from the European Commission and Mr Sousa de Jesus from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for our excellent working relationship."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal amending the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is one of the most important measures which Parliament has adopted, in terms of both increasing European citizens' quality of life and promoting the EU's economic recovery."
"Europe's citizens are expecting action and concrete solutions to the problems and very specific needs which they have."
"I personally believe that an increase of up to 15% in the European Regional Development Fund rate, which can be used by Member States to fund energy performance in residential buildings, is a necessity."
"This would offer Member States greater flexibility and the opportunity to use the mid-term review next year on the way the Structural Funds are used so that they can redefine the operational programmes accordingly, with the aim of achieving better absorption of the Structural Funds."
"I would like to emphasise that this directive has very great potential for creating new jobs: roughly 500 000 jobs could be created at European level, with major implications for the regional or national labour market."
"Commissioner, I hope that you will continue to support this, including the introduction of a minimum rate from the European Regional Development Fund for energy efficiency in buildings, in the future at least."
"I would like to thank once again the shadow rapporteurs and staff from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and also fellow rapporteurs who have supported us and with whom I have enjoyed excellent cooperation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009."
"The vote on the report by Mrs Å¢icÄu will take place on Thursday 23 April 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"Not very long ago, moving into a home made of prefabricated concrete was seen by many millions of people as a move up the social ladder and an improvement in standard of living."
"Cheap energy meant that no one worried about heating costs."
"Today nearly 100 million people live in prefabricated buildings."
"I would like to ask the European Commission to give extensive aid from European Union funds to the modernisation of these buildings and entire housing estates, especially in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Money should be found for this purpose as part of the mid-term review of the 2007-2013 Financial Framework."
"The existing limit on housing expenditure of 3% of the European Regional Development Fund allocation is decidedly too low."
"The large-scale modernisation and revitalisation of prefabricated buildings and housing estates in the EU will reduce expenditure on heating, raise the standard of living, create tens of thousands of jobs and reduce energy consumption."
"This will translate directly into the kind of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions which will bring us closer to one of the 3x20 objectives."
"Support for the modernisation of existing prefabricated buildings should be an assignment for the European Parliament in the new term."
"Demand for this type of service can play a large part in overcoming the current economic crisis and unemployment, as well as in the fight against poverty."
"in writing. - Energy costs are growing at an alarming rate, contributing to a substantial increase in energy-related poverty across the EU."
"However, the market price of energy is only one side of the problem."
"There is a significant, additional financial burden on consumers due to energy market inefficiencies and distortions."
"For example, in Malta consumers and businesses saw an exorbitant increase in their energy bills when the price of oil was at its high, but there was no decrease even when the price of oil dropped more than half."
"What we need is an EU-wide policy to protect consumers and SMEs from pricing malpractices carried out by public utility companies."
"One solution may be a national independent regulator which would create the necessary checks and balances against any abusive or non transparent conduct by private traders and/or government owned entities in respect of any price increases on public utilities like gas, electricity, water, airport charges and others."
"This should be implemented through improving the existing E.U. legislation and directives involving consumer protection especially to ensure:"
"Better standard of transparency and rationality governing price increases as well as better access and information regarding consumer rights."
"Less costs and less bureaucracy for the consumer who has a genuine case in order to seek redress."
"In our view, it is of major significance that the European Parliament can already approve the Third Energy Package at second reading."
"The new regulation may boost competition in the EU electricity and gas market."
"However, we cannot proceed with adopting the proposal without mentioning that the final regulation has lost a great deal in terms of its ambition, compared to the Commission's original proposal."
"During the package's negotiation, the subject of separating production and system operations generated the most heated debates."
"The final outcome of this will have a fundamental impact on the EU's energy market structure."
"In my view, the compromise agreed by the Member States will not result in transparent regulation in this area, given that Member States can also apply three different separation models."
"This will also result in major differences breaking up the EU energy market."
"At the same time, I welcome that the Council's compromise reflects Parliament's numerous consumer protection proposals."
"Measures such as the option to switch supplier within three weeks, more detailed billing information and the simplification of compensation procedures will make the benefits of market deregulation feel tangible to a larger number of citizens."
"Another important development is that the new regulation will make it more difficult for third countries to attempt to purchase energy."
"Thanks to this fact too, the pending adoption of the energy package will mark an important step along the path towards creating a common EU energy policy."
"The cost and reliability of energy supplies are key factors not only for the competitiveness of the EU but particularly for the well-being of its citizens."
"For this reason the European Parliament has placed the consumer at the centre of its third energy package."
"In order for consumers to benefit from this important legislation, Parliament has revised and improved the directive on the energy performance of buildings, which accounts for around 40% of EU energy consumption."
"Planners and building inspectors will receive appropriate guidance from this directive."
"I attach great importance to the method for calculating optimal cost and specifying minimum economic efficiency requirements for the structural components of a building's thermal insulation and services, as well as the application of these calculations both to new and existing buildings."
"The targets for buildings with zero net energy consumption constitute a significant part of the reworked directive."
"I welcome the creation of a European fund for energy efficiency and renewable energy to support the implementation of this directive."
"Up until now, limited use of the Structural Funds has been authorised for the energy performance of buildings only in the new EU-12."
"That option is now extended to all Member States."
"At the same time the maximum share of ERDF resources in these projects is increased from 3% to 15%."
"In order to ensure successful implementation of the directive it is essential for Member States to consult with representatives of local and regional authorities on all aspects arising from the directive and also with consumer protection groups."
"I would like to thank the rapporteurs who worked on the drafts of the energy package, especially Mrs Morgan, who did a great deal of important work in the area of consumer protection."
"I am particularly glad that the new package also devotes attention to the question of energy poverty."
"Member States that have not yet done so, including my home country, Estonia, should prepare a state action plan to fight energy poverty, in order to reduce the number of people suffering from energy poverty."
"This is especially important in the present economic conditions."
"There is a serious need to deal with this question in Estonia, because heating bills have increased considerably in recent years."
"Direct support to less well-off consumers, as is provided in the United Kingdom, is one important measure, although the energy efficiency of buildings could also be improved, and that would be particularly effective in Estonia."
"There are many challenges facing Europe connected with short-, medium- and long-term supply and demand for energy."
"We, the European Community, have set ourselves a very ambitious task."
"By the year 2020 we are going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% and energy consumption by 20%."
"In connection with this I think we should pay particular attention to the matter of the energy performance of buildings, since they account for as much as 40% of our total energy consumption."
"In saying this, I would like to express my support for the rapporteur."
"I think that we should organise an information campaign with the objective of making citizens aware of the possibility of saving money by insulating buildings, and we should also appeal to the governments of all the countries of the Community to make subsidies available for this initiative."
"We should draw up a list of uniform minimum building insulation standards for the whole EU."
"I also support extending use of the Structural Funds to include work connected with the energy efficiency of buildings in all countries of the Community, and increasing the amount which can be allocated from the European Regional Development Fund for projects in this area from 3% to 15%."
"Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 717/2007 (mobile telephone networks) and Directive 2002/21/EC (electronic communications) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs VÄlean, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 717/2007 on roaming on public mobile telephone networks within the Community and Directive 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services - C6-0333/2008 -."
"Madam President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, it is rare for a liberal to promote intervention in the market through regulating prices, even if it only involves setting a maximum limit."
"However, in the case of mobile phone roaming tariffs, this action is necessary, and can only be carried out collectively, at European Union level."
"It is necessary because excessively high tariffs are raising obstacles preventing the freedom of movement and communication between Europe's citizens."
"Removing these obstacles is one of the European Union's fundamental objectives and one of my personal objectives as an MEP."
"This is why I have assumed the responsibility of being the rapporteur for this regulation, as well as for the European Parliament report adopted at the beginning of the month concerning the administrative and legal barriers raised by Member States preventing the freedom of movement of European citizens."
"The current regulation is necessary, for instance, for small businessmen on a business trip who need to speak to colleagues at home to resolve a problem."
"It is important for journalists sending a news report via email directly from the scene of the event."
"It is also important for young people sending text messages to their boyfriends and girlfriends."
"Finally, it is important for workers abroad wanting to hear their children's voice on the phone."
"All these European citizens have paid and are still frequently paying three or four times more to use a mobile phone, simply because they are a couple of miles away from their own country, even though they are within the Community's borders."
"Thanks to the regulation which we are going to adopt tomorrow, excessive prices will be eliminated."
"The maximum limits set by the regulation still allow operators to achieve a considerable profit margin and to compete while offering lower prices."
"We are faced with a complex problem linked to the fragmentation and operation of the mobile phone market in Europe."
"When consumers come to choose a mobile phone operator, they look first and foremost at national charges or the price offered for a new mobile phone make, but scrutinise less the roaming charges."
"When they cross the border into another EU Member State, they are subject to these roaming charges, even when they are only receiving calls."
"The only option for consumers is to choose not to communicate by mobile phone."
"Competition among operators does not work from this perspective."
"The actual operator from the country of origin must pay the operator from the network being visited for carrying the signal."
"Some countries, such as tourist destinations, receive large numbers of visitors during a short period of time, while others have more citizens travelling abroad."
"This means that there is an imbalance between supply and demand, hence the reason for the high gross tariffs even among operators."
"Furthermore, in some countries the cost of installing and operating mobile phone networks is higher."
"In addition, smaller operators or new operators who have joined the market have shown that they are often subject to discriminatory prices from large pan-European operators."
"Ultimately, it is always the consumer who pays."
"The regulation which we are going to adopt tomorrow is a short-term solution."
"We cannot regulate prices indefinitely, as this affects innovation and may even affect competitiveness."
"This is why the regulation stipulates that the European Commission must analyse different means of regulating the market."
"Some of these means are even suggested by the regulation."
"In two or three years we will be able to debate more options when we have more information available to us."
"I hope that we will then be able to implement a legislative framework for having competitive roaming tariffs in the long term."
"Apart from this aspect, Parliament has improved the regulation, in my view, from many perspectives."
"We have reduced the maximum gross roaming tariffs for transferring data to 50 cents per megabyte in order to encourage the use of this service and proper competition in the sector."
"We have made guidelines more transparent on advising customers about roaming mobile Internet access."
"We have also made the provisions intended to limit monthly bills for roaming data transfer to EUR 50 significantly more flexible for anyone wanting this feature."
"Text messages charged on a roaming tariff, which are sent once the consumer enters a foreign network, will also include a reference to the unique emergency number 112."
"We have reduced the maximum tariffs for calls received and made, while maintaining a profit margin for operators."
"We have also banned operators who continue the practice of charging customers abroad for someone simply leaving a voice mail for them."
"I would like to end by thanking for all their efforts during such a short period of time my fellow Members from the other political groups, Commissioner Reding and her staff, Ambassador ReiniÅ¡ovÃ¡ and representatives of the Czech and French presidencies, the Council, and not forgetting our own staff in the European Parliament, all working together so that millions of citizens can enjoy acceptable roaming tariffs this summer."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I could not agree more with the rapporteur, whom I would like to congratulate on the swift and efficient work done."
"We are facing here an obstacle to freedom of movement because, if you punish citizens on their phone bill when they cross a border, that is frankly not the internal market we strive for and that we wish to construct."
"So in order to give this freedom of movement to our citizens we have to get rid of those obstacles."
"Those obstacles concern a lot of people."
"There are roughly 150 million citizens in the European Union who use their mobile phone at least once per year for roaming while they are abroad, and they have to pay the price."
"It is the students, the travellers and the holidaymakers, but it is also the cross-border workers, the journalists and the businesspeople who are handicapped because of very high charges for communication."
"That is why I thank the European Parliament for having so swiftly responded to the Commission's proposal."
"I think we have managed to get a proposal put into practice in the shortest ever time in the European Union - only seven months from proposal to implementation."
"That is a first of its kind, and it is a first of its kind in the interests of the European consumers."
"I would just like to say a few words about what the first roaming package has achieved."
"On voice roaming it has achieved a 60% lower price for the citizen and 30% more traffic for the industry."
"The industry has also - and this is interesting - seen a steady rise in the penetration rate of the mobile phones used by citizens."
"We now have an average penetration rate in Europe of 119%."
"That is an absolute world record and, with the prices for roaming going down, that allows freedom to those citizens who utilise their mobile phone."
"It also gives good money to the industry because their traffic is rising continuously."
"At the same time, national prices are going down."
"Since the Barroso Commission took things in hand, domestic prices for mobile communication have decreased by roughly 35%."
"That is as an answer to those who say that, if we bring down the cost of roaming, national prices go up."
"That is not the case."
"The statistics show just the contrary."
"Now we are going a step further: firstly, of course, on voice roaming."
"I think it is very good that we are continuing to bring down the caps so that the competition of the offers can take place under the caps."
"It is very important that we add to this SMS roaming, because every year in the European Union 2.5 billion text messages are sent."
"The value of the revenue from this for the industry is roughly EUR 800 million."
"Now, who is sending the SMSs?"
"Mainly our young people: 77% of young people up to the age of 24 use text messages when they are abroad because it is easier and cheaper for them."
"So they are punished when they have to pay an extraordinarily high price with regard to the cost to the operator when they are roaming."
"Good: we are bringing those prices down so that text messaging will become a normal thing if you are at home or if you are in a neighbouring country."
"So consumers will greatly benefit from this."
"The reduction - which will be voted by Parliament tomorrow - means 60% for text messaging."
"Concerning the per-second billing for roaming calls: simply said, do not make the people pay for what they have not utilised, only make them pay for what they have really utilised."
"We will also bring today's hidden charge of 24% down, so that you pay only for what you have really consumed."
"And for data roaming, where we believe that this is a future development."
"But, whilst we want to have a future development so that you can download, wherever you are, a film, a newspaper article or a photograph to send to your friends, today you have shocking bills."
"I have received copies of bills where people have been in another country for three or four days and have to pay several thousands of euros just because they have downloaded their favourite television show or newspaper articles, which they are used to utilising."
"This will stop now, also because in the new regulation there will be a cut-off limit facility which, on 1 July 2010, will become a default limit to apply automatically in order to protect our consumers."
"So it is a great day for Europe and a great day for European consumers."
"Thank you to Parliament, which has acted very swiftly."
"I think the people outside will understand that this Parliament works for the citizen."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Mr President, can I start off by first of all thanking the Committee on the Internal Market's shadow rapporteurs from all the groups, their staff and advisers?"
"I think that in the Internal Market Committee we can all be proud that we have reached a consensus on increased transparency and ways to finally eliminate the problem of bill shock."
"Bill shock was not good for the reputation of the mobile operators but more importantly, bill shock was not good for consumers."
"However, when it comes to price capping, I still have some concerns."
"We need to ask which consumers will benefit from the Soviet economics of price caps."
"Given that at most only 35% of consumers actually roam and that the figure for regular roamers is much lower and, as the Commissioner herself admitted, given that this legislation will mostly benefit a narrow group of privileged consumers such as Commission officials, MEPs, lobbyists and businessmen, let us hope that we are not robbing the poor to pay for cheaper phone calls for the rich."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating both the rapporteur, Mrs VÄlean, and the rapporteur for the first regulation on roaming, Mr RÃ¼big, on the excellent cooperation which we had in the Committee on Culture and Education, for which I acted as draftsman, on a matter which is naturally of interest to 150 million consumers and to the telecommunications industry."
"Following the successful application of the first regulation two years ago, the European Parliament is being called upon to adopt a revised regulation covering the prices of text messages and data."
"I personally should like to comment on the benefits of the new regulation, especially for business travellers."
"Media professionals, for example, make a great deal of use of the function for downloading files to their mobile telephone."
"The revised regulation will act as a safety valve against the excessive and uncontrolled charges imposed to date by mobile telephone companies, as the commissioner said."
"That is why I consider that a vote in favour of the report will be yet another victory for Parliament in the fight to protect consumers and yet another big step which will breathe new life into the internal market."
"Finally, with consent between the institutions, I trust and hope that this regulation will enter into force in the summer, so that travellers will be protected from any obscure charges and overcharging by mobile telephone companies."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs VÄlean, in particular, but also Commissioner Reding, who showed great commitment in the negotiations for the Roaming II Regulation."
"I believe that these negotiations and, of course, also the objective of bringing the national prices and the prices that we pay in the other European countries onto the same level, are an important step forward."
"It is also good that the national regulatory authorities are now also responsible for roaming and will therefore take over the control and monitoring roles, which will quite simply provide us with more transparency."
"Transparency is vital to the functioning of a market."
"Up to now there has been a lack of transparency in several areas, but there has also been blatant market abuse."
"It is not right for up to a thousand times the amount to be demanded for data roaming, as is often the case."
"The per second-based billing for inbound calls will in future also bring definite progress and result in cost benefits for European citizens."
"Mr President, it is necessary to intervene when the market is not functioning."
"We have broken a taboo once again: the free market is not sacred and is even less so in times of crisis, when the pockets of European consumers are emptier than ever."
"This agreement, intended to set limits on the excessive costs of calls and text messages when roaming, benefits the consumer, benefits communication between European countries and benefits a useful and positive Europe."
"Millions of European citizens' telephone bills could go down, or, on the other hand, just the opposite may happen: given that a text message would only cost 11 cents, people could be texting all day long and end up spending the same amount."
"The transfer measures that achieve a charge per second after the first thirty seconds are particularly positive."
"The maximum costs for text messages and for sending data could have been somewhat lower but we have made this compromise for the sake of reaching an agreement."
"I would like to say thank you to Commissioner Reding, to Mrs VÄlean, and to the rapporteurs of all the groups, because we have provided a fine example of European Union action in times of crisis."
"So we can end on a happy note, which is very important, especially before the elections."
"Now I call Mrs Å¢icÄu to speak under the catch-the-eye procedure."
"(RO) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate my fellow Members on the work they have done and the report they have compiled."
"The European Parliament is definitely working in the interest of Europe's citizens."
"I also recall that during the previous debate two years ago on reducing mobile phone roaming tariffs we had a very wide-ranging discussion."
"I am pleased that we did not have any differing points of view on this occasion."
"In fact, we have all quickly adopted this tariff reduction."
"I would like to say that I feel it is very important to continue reducing existing mobile phone charges and by larger amounts, for both outgoing and incoming calls."
"However, reducing text message charges is especially important."
"In fact, we are not doing this only for the younger generation, but for anyone who travels in the European Union."
"This measure is actually, on the one hand, a means of protection for consumers, but at the same time, it is a good example of the way in which the market can be regulated for the benefit of Europe's citizens."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the mobile telephone and the Internet have become symbols of mobility and innovation."
"Citizens should, therefore, have extensive and easy access to telecommunications services."
"Despite the many appeals from the commissioner, prices of SMS roaming services are still on average significantly higher and significantly exceed domestic prices for those services."
"We must strive to change this situation."
"In this regard I value highly the work of the Commission and the commissioner."
"The situation with the Internet is similar."
"Why does using the Internet from a mobile phone have to be a luxury?"
"We are all in favour of ensuring the widest possible access to the Internet."
"A reduction in the price of data roaming services would certainly help in this regard."
"This is important, because this matter in large measure concerns the youngest group in our society."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased with the direction in which we are moving."
"I am referring to the radical price reductions in voice roaming calls and Internet access."
"This is the first step, and I think that others will follow."
"These are factors which may accelerate realisation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"This is important for the education process and for the young generation."
"It is important that Internet facilities be accessible to people who are relatively poor and those with low incomes."
"We are moving in the right direction."
"This news will certainly be received gladly."
"I would like to thank the Commission."
"(SL) I should like to extend my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur and the commissioner."
"Commissioner, a few years ago I told you that I did not like being punished for making calls abroad."
"I did not expect to see improvements to my status as a consumer so soon and from this directive, in particular."
"This directive is evidence that the European Union is able to use its common policies to forge a closer relationship with its citizens by benefiting them in the place where they feel it the most - in their pockets."
"This directive means more Europe, greater competitiveness and a single economy and, for me, it is one of the key achievements of the Commission's and Parliament's current mandates."
"The only thing I want now is for us to act in the same spirit and pay as much attention to the consumer in the next mandate, too."
"My congratulations once again and thank you very much."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like principally to thank the Members who have done a wonderful job."
"First, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs VÄlean, but also the rapporteurs of the other committees, the shadow rapporteurs and the spokespersons of the groups."
"They have made it possible, in just seven months, for a very important proposal for the free movement of citizens and the bringing down of excessive charges to become a reality."
"I think it is a great moment for the internal market."
"It is a great moment which shows to citizens that MEPs are taking them seriously."
"If you would just permit, I would like nevertheless to say - with all due respect to Mr Kamall, for example - that when the market does not function, it is for the political leadership to intervene."
"I would like somebody here in this House to explain to me how the market can be said to be functioning when the cost to operators for transferring a text message from one country to another is less than 11 cents, while the average consumer has to pay more than 28 cents."
"Then something is not going well."
"So if we now fix a cap of 11 cents I think there is ample room for manoeuvre; there is ample room for competition to develop."
"Like most of you in this Chamber I would have wished the market to have functioned, so that we did not need to do this."
"Well let us hope that we will not need to do so again in the future, and let us hope that after this decision the market really will function in the interests of the industry, in the interests of the citizen, in the interests of free movement, and in the interests of the internal market where every citizen can travel without being punished by a telephone bill."
"Reducing roaming charges is an absolute necessity."
"We would all agree that the market is not working."
"How we should regulate it is a matter which we can still discuss."
"The Commission's proposal to set some maximum tariffs is the matter we are discussing now."
"Is this the best instrument available?"
"We do not know, but it is the only option available to us at the moment."
"I hope that we can find alternative methods in the future."
"I would like to say a final word to this industry as a whole."
"We must not allow the perception to be conveyed that the mobile phone sector ruthlessly exploits consumers."
"This kind of idea could be dangerous because this industry is successful, which is reflected in the creation of jobs, significant contributions to budgets and technological innovation."
"This is why I believe it is important for those of us regulating the market not to feel completely satisfied with the job we have done and to aim at making further improvements in order to achieve a long-term beneficial impact."
"I would like to thank all those involved in this report and I hope that we will discuss the same topic on another occasion."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009."
"Budget discharges 2007, (Vote will be held on Thursday) (debate)"

"by Mr Fjellner, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Community Fisheries Control Agency for the financial year 2007 (C6-0447/2008 -, and"
"by Mr Fjellner, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on financial management and control of EU agencies."
"Mr President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will be to thank you, Mr Kallas, and your colleagues at the Commission, for the attention you have paid to the parliamentary work linked to the discharge procedure for implementation of the budget of the European Commission and of the executive agencies for 2007."
"I extend these thanks to the administrative services."
"I should also like to pay tribute to the huge effort made by the European Court of Auditors under the leadership of its president, VÃ­tor Caldeira."
"It had limited resources with which to tackle the scale of the task to be accomplished."
"I would like to say a few words about the context of this discharge."
"2007 was the first year of the new 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework in which a number of new rules were implemented."
"2007 was also the year of the last discharge procedure of the current Commission, which, at the start of its mandate, had promised - you will recall, Commissioner, it was through your president - to obtain a positive statement of assurance from the European Court of Auditors."
"However, for 14 years the Court has issued a negative statement on the legality and regularity of underlying transactions for the vast majority of spending areas, regarding them, to varying degrees, as being significantly affected by errors, even though - and we should be pleased about this - administrative expenditure and the consolidated accounts are the subject of a positive statement of assurance."
"Lastly, 2007 was the year of the last discharge vote before the European Parliament elections."
"In this particular context, and aside from the numerous reservations that appear in the draft resolution concerning the management of Community funds, my aim, in my report, was to try to analyse the discharge procedure and to make a contribution on this difficult path that must lead us to a positive statement of assurance, whilst being fully aware of the limits of the exercise."
"That is why I am eager to find out what stance the Commission, the political groups and my fellow Members who are due to speak take on this issue."
"With the work on this matter now completed, I have mixed feelings: on the one hand, I firmly believe that things are improving, but not enough and too slowly, and, on the other, there is the fact that, at the same time, it is untenable to remain in a situation where the European Court of Auditors has not issued a positive statement of assurance for 14 years and where the European Parliament votes on discharge regardless."
"Europeans are going to end up thinking that Parliament is not performing its monitoring role correctly."
"That is why I propose that, given the seriousness of the situation, an interinstitutional conference be organised without delay."
"The latter would involve all those who play a part in the management and monitoring of Community funds, and would be used to start off a comprehensive discussion enabling us to envisage the reforms needed to obtain a positive statement of assurance as soon as possible."
"I am keen to hear the reasons that are prompting certain political groups to oppose this discussion."
"Special attention must also be paid to the role of Member States that manage approximately 80% of the Union's budget."
"The fact is, it is in this context of shared management that we have the largest number of problems."
"While I am on this subject, I regret that the Council's bench is empty; the Czech Republic's current political difficulties are not enough to explain the Council's inconsistent political presence, unless we are to interpret this absence and this silence as indifference or, worse still, disinterest."
"In relation to the report on shared management by the Member States, I would emphasise the role not only of national management declarations, but also of annual summaries, which are so many elements enabling us to progress towards a positive DAS."
"Furthermore, and pursuant to Article 248 of the Treaty, I propose that cooperation between national audit bodies and the European Court of Auditors be stepped up as regards shared-management controls."
"I suggest that we examine the possibility of national audit bodies, in their capacity as independent external auditors, and with due regard for international audit standards, issuing national audit certificates for the management of Community funds."
"These certificates would be submitted to Member States' governments with a view to being produced during the discharge process in accordance with an appropriate interinstitutional procedure to be introduced."
"Lastly, Mr President, I should like to point out my astonishment that the consolidated annual accounts were presented with net assets in the region of EUR 58 billion, and I propose that consideration be given to establishing a pension fund in order to externalise the EUR 33.5 billion in commitments to staff."
"To conclude, I feel that it is time to reform our system, and I sincerely believe that this reform should hinge on an in-depth and sincere dialogue among all those involved with the budget."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are talking about the European Development Fund, which concerns African, Caribbean and Pacific States."
"From our point of view these countries are not standard regions, they are not conventional states and they do not present typical problems."
"In terms of implementation of the fund, in 2007 we saw an increase in payments and in commitments, which also means an increase in efficiency."
"This is undoubtedly a positive point, and I would like to start with this."
"The fund consisted of two parts: the part managed by the European Commission and the part which was under the control of the European Investment Bank."
"The part managed by the European Commission is the part which is the subject of this debate on discharge, whereas the part managed by the EIB is for the time being excluded from the discharge, and I would like to come back to this matter later."
"Our debate is based on the position of the European Court of Auditors."
"The Tribunal stated clearly that the transactions underlying the revenue and commitments for the year 2007 are, taken as a whole, legal and regular, but drew attention to the high fiduciary risk with regard to budget support resulting from the Commission's 'dynamic interpretation' of the eligibility criteria."
"The audit revealed, however, a material level of errors and found - and here we are in agreement - that a rapid improvement in the area of supervision and control is essential."
"Such possibilities exist, and we share this point of view."
"The sample taken for the audit included six states and 250 transactions."
"A very important finding was made, namely that the Commission is still not able to give full accounting information."
"We welcome the declaration that a new system will be functioning as of February 2009."
"I hope that the commissioner will confirm this fact."
"Another very important matter is the difference between words and deeds when preparing agreements."
"Drawing up and signing cause a great deal of ambiguity."
"The Commission must clarify this, especially because the ACP countries also have different approaches to this."
"A very important matter from our point of view as the European Parliament is that the assessment of regularity should not only be carried out after the fact, but that it should take the form of supervision and control to prevent irregularities."
"Preventing irregularities also helps in assessing the benefits we achieve from allocating funds."
"This is not only a matter of showing regularity in the accounts, but is also about showing the degree to which the objective is achieved, and in this respect we would like to draw attention to the need for cooperation from national parliaments, because they should to a large extent understand this matter."
"This is a matter of cooperation with authorities and governments, and also with civil society."
"One aspect which would appear to be of particular importance is the question of supervision of funds managed by the EIB."
"The EIB continues to be, from our perspective, an institution which it is not possible to supervise."
"We confirm very clearly in the report that the EIB had a sum of EUR 2.2 billion at its disposal."
"This was public money - it did not come from the financial markets."
"The EIB would, therefore, appear to be a most undemocratic institution which nevertheless has public money at its disposal."
"Finally, I would like to thank the commissioner for his cooperation during this term of office."
"I would like Mr Åuckiewicz to accept our thanks on behalf of the Court of Auditors."
"I would also like to thank my colleagues from the Committee on Development, and also from the Committee on Budgetary Control, which was efficiently led by Mr BÃ¶sch."
"Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr BÃ¶sch, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to complete the most in-depth reform ever of the European Parliament."
"This reform includes the creation of statutes for both MEPs and assistants, an end to the unacceptable salary discrimination between MEPs, an end to the opaque system for paying our travel allowances and an end to the discriminatory pension system."
"As rapporteur for the discharge of Parliament's accounts, as a member for 10 years of the Committee on Budgetary Control and as spokesman for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I am very proud of what we have achieved and I feel that it would not be asking too much for the public to register these changes, which they themselves have insistently demanded."
"Having said this, I am today, as always, absolutely in favour of total transparency in the use of public funds."
"I fully agree with the opinions of the European Ombudsman in this respect."
"I am today, as always, opposed to using public funds to deal with the results of private risk-taking."
"I am today, as always, against voluntary pension funds that ignore salary differences, leading to unfair treatment."
"I find it unacceptable when generalisations are made that are completely wrong, such as maintaining that all MEPs are entitled to two pensions."
"As the author of this report, I should like to emphasise that, after 10 years as an MEP, and having spent shorter periods in the Portuguese parliament and the regional parliament of the Azores, I am now leaving parliamentary office without strictly being entitled to any pension, whether national, regional or European."
"In this respect, I must say that those who believe that denying the rights of their representatives, which are the same throughout our societies, helps to improve Europe are absolutely mistaken."
"On the contrary, I am convinced that the only way to overcome anyone's lack of trust in their representatives is to minimise the laying down of specific rules for parliamentarians, seeing as they are responsible for the adoption of these rules."
"I even believe that the only issue on which Parliament should have decided was the relative position of MEPs in the European administration framework."
"While regretting the lack of clarity that existed in the past between public duty and private interest in the pension system, I should appreciate some recognition of the work done by all those who, particularly on our Committee on Budgetary Control, have fought tirelessly for rigour and transparency in the European accounts."
"Here in this House I want to pay a heartfelt tribute to everyone and express my wish that the work carried out by our committee to date should be continued in the next parliamentary term, with the same vigour and commitment that has been shown so far in order to bring about a stricter and fairer Europe that offers greater solidarity."
"The Parliament to be elected in June will operate under much more transparent and fairer rules, and that is something that everyone here today has cause to celebrate."
"The next speaker will be Mr Fjellner."
"The rapporteur, Mr SÃ¸ndergaard, will be with us later due to a flight delay, so I will call on him to speak later."
"Mr President, I am impressed that you at least attempted to list all of these decentralised agencies."
"There are, of course, a very large number of them."
"I would maintain that discharge has become even more important for the EU agencies precisely because they have increased in number."
"The budget and the number of staff have also increased."
"The number of agencies has increased from 11 in 1995 to a total of 27 today."
"In 2007, the budget for all the agencies was EUR 1 243 500 000."
"In 1995, the average budget for one agency was EUR 7 million, whereas now it is over EUR 22 million."
"Staff numbers have increased just as dramatically."
"In 1995, 38 people, on average, worked in each agency."
"Today, that figure is 155."
"In my opinion, this increase is remarkable in itself and something we need to reflect on, namely the question of whether this is an appropriate instrument and whether this type of increase is reasonable."
"It also places higher demands on us when discussing discharge, requiring us to spend more time and energy on it."
"We have therefore chosen to deal with 21 of these agencies that we are responsible for in separate reports and also to draw up a horizontal report dealing with the problems that are common to most of the agencies."
"I am pleased to be able to say that the majority of the agencies have received clear statements of assurance from the Court of Auditors."
"They have therefore been properly managed."
"At the same time, many of them - almost all of them, in fact - still have major surplus problems and problems complying with the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations year after year."
"This is something we need to think about, namely the fact that we repeat the same criticism of certain points year after year and yet nothing ever changes."
"This means that we must think more about how we enforce responsibility on the part of these agencies and how we actually govern them."
"In the horizontal report, I therefore propose, among other things, that we make fixed reductions when the agencies do not use a sufficient proportion of a budget or when they are unable to fill all positions."
"It is also proposed that we should have a common support service to help the small agencies with burdensome administrative tasks."
"I believe this to be extremely important."
"This year, we chose to look specifically at four agencies which received poor statements of assurance from the Court of Auditors and which have particularly major issues."
"These were the European Police College, the European GNSS Supervisory Authority - GNSS being what we usually refer to as Galileo - the European Railway Agency and Frontex."
"I am pleased to be able to state that it has been possible to grant discharge to three of these, Galileo, the European Railway Agency and Frontex, after examining all of the information they provided us with."
"Unfortunately, Cepol, that is, the European Police Academy, has submitted a lot of information, but nowhere near all of it."
"Therefore we are not yet able to grant it discharge."
"The remaining problem is the issue of the private use of EU taxpayers' money, such as private use to pay for furniture, private mobile telephone calls and private travel."
"We have requested information on this, but have not received all of it."
"The committee and I therefore propose that we postpone the granting of discharge until Cepol has provided a full declaration in this regard."
"There is, of course, also an ongoing fraud investigation in Olaf regarding this agency."
"This is serious and we need to demonstrate that we take it seriously and we must get to the bottom of it."
"This is why we are postponing the granting of discharge."
"This is not something I do gladly, but I would maintain that it is the only responsible thing to do."
"We need to have all the information on the table before we can grant discharge."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, this is the fifth time I have stood before you as you prepare to vote on a Commission discharge resolution."
"And, for the fifth time, I must admit that - despite unquestionable progress in budget execution - we still do not have a positive DAS."
"In the draft resolution before you (paragraph 58), the rapporteur..."
"(FR) 'calls on the Commission without delay [sans dÃ©lai] to submit its proposals for achieving the objective of a positive DAS'."
"So I will do this, 'sans dÃ©lai'."
"I will give the three main reasons why, in my view, we did not achieve a positive DAS, although this was the objective set at the beginning of the current Commission mandate."
"We probably relied too much at the beginning on Member States sharing our concern about the negative public and political impact of the negative DAS when, in fact, our call for action only really became effective when backed up by the policy of 'warn, solve or suspend payments'."
"So there was too much carrot and too little stick initially."
"We have also pursued evolution rather than revolution."
"We put aside more radical solutions, for instance on simplification, in our pioneering attempt to fix the DAS."
"Obviously, five years for our Action Plan was not enough."
"Some results of our Action Plan are only now starting to show their impact."
"The next Commission will reap the benefits, which without the Action Plan could not be expected."
"But your question is, 'how and when can you guarantee a positive DAS?'"
"First, I should remind honourable Members what the so-called 'negative DAS' is."
"Article 248 of the Treaty gives the Court of Auditors the task of providing a Statement of Assurance 'as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions'."
"It was inserted into the Maastricht Treaty at the last moment without any real discussion about the implications."
"This has proven highly problematic since."
"The so-called negative DAS is part of the Court of Auditors' opinion."
"It says that certain areas of expenditure are still materially affected by errors, although to different levels."
"The Court also states that our annual accounts are reliable and gives many positive and adequate comments about our financial management."
"As such, the DAS does not sound at all special, compared to how audit opinions are generally phrased."
"But we face a highly politicised and often deliberate misinterpretation of this sentence."
"So I must confess that it has surprised me how difficult it is to convince elected politicians and public opinion that budget management in the European Union is much better than what is reflected in this sentence."
"So we must do something to end this damaging political assessment of the use of European funds."
"For urgent, more guaranteed results, one could imagine three options:"
"Option one: change the Treaty."
"The way the current Treaty is phrased, the reasonable public expectation for sound financial management has been undermined - automatically and almost inevitably - every year since the Maastricht Treaty entered into force."
"During the Intergovernmental Conference on the Lisbon Treaty, I looked at whether one could fix Article 248 of the Treaty."
"Together with the Court, we looked at what could be a more realistic task for the Court, perhaps covering the budget over a three-year cycle, rather than annually, and asking the Court to take into account that most Commission control systems are multi-annual, ensuring that errors are corrected over time."
"We contacted several national delegations: they all agreed; nobody acted."
"Option two: I now come to the second option and the most radical short cut to the positive DAS."
"Under the current Treaty we should perhaps stop allocating funds to management schemes so complex that we cannot meet the current low thresholds for error."
"If we cannot collectively handle the current sophistication, then we must simplify."
"'Simplify' is a nice word which everybody likes."
"There are millions of transactions to check."
"How could 480 auditors, based in Luxembourg, however competent, working with a very complex legislative environment, in 27 Member States with 23 official languages, possibly have the basis for issuing a statement each year on the legality and regularity of all underlying transactions in all spending areas?"
"If you wish simplification to have a quick and effective impact on the error rate, my view is that it means abandoning shared management in some areas."
"It means reducing the number of transactions from millions to a few thousand."
"Taking the example of the Structural Funds, it would mean clearly defining the responsibilities that are currently shared."
"To achieve that, the Structural Funds could be turned into budget support to the poorer regions."
"An eligible region or Member State would see EU funds channelled into the state budget, to be spent via national systems, under the exclusive accountability of the minister of finance, and audited by the supreme audit institutions of Member States."
"A Member State would get one annual tranche from the EU budget, and would be accountable to its own citizens and other Member States based on results."
"Eligibility rules, procurement procedures and absorption rates would no longer be a European problem."
"In this radical scenario, we would drop the millions of projects too small and sophisticated to be under arms-length oversight from Brussels."
"No more small, creative projects ending up being ridiculed in the Euro-sceptic press!"
"Option three: If you cannot change the Treaty or its interpretation, we could perhaps discuss what it means for a given type of transaction to be 'OK'."
"We could set realistic and cost-effective thresholds for what 'legal and regular' is."
"This is the discussion about tolerable risk."
"For the moment, the Court applies a uniform 2% materiality threshold across the board."
"The Court itself has asked for better risk analysis and political agreement on the tolerable risk in various budget areas."
"To move this discussion forward, you now have a communication from the Commission on the table."
"Your rapporteur is suggesting welcoming this communication as a 'solid methodological basis' and calls for further analysis, data collection, dialogue and concrete proposals."
"I would be grateful for this support and suggest we move ahead as quickly as possible."
"The Council also now seems ready to engage."
"Based on your overall political support, the Commission would like to proceed with proposals to set specific tolerable risk levels, budget heading by budget heading."
"For each future spending proposal, you would be asked to 'tolerate' a carefully calculated level of risk, so that the Court - hopefully - would adjust its materiality threshold on that basis."
"We must start now."
"If we wait for a revised Financial Regulation, or indeed the next Financial Perspectives after 2013, this would not be reflected in the discharge procedure for the next five years."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today you are preparing to vote on whether to grant discharge for 2007, a year for which the auditors now say that for all budget areas except that the Structural Funds, as much as 95% or more of the payments are free from serious financial error."
"This is the best DAS ever, an improvement over last year, for a year with higher payment levels, in an increased number of Member States, the EU-27."
"Our financial management is steadily improving and it is certainly good enough to deserve discharge."
"But it cannot stand the test of perfection."
"The EU was created to bring peace and prosperity."
"It has delivered so far."
"Obviously, looking at the EU's institutional set-up, it is possible that no auditor was present at its creation and so it is not perfect."
"But audit perfection is a rare phenomenon anywhere in the world."
"Thank you for your attention and please vote in favour of discharge."
"You will see no complacency from the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism welcomes the fact that utilisation rates for commitment and payment appropriations for TEN-T projects continue to be high, reaching nearly 100%, and calls on the Member States to ensure that adequate funding is made available from national budgets to match this EU commitment."
"It is concerned by the low utilisation rate of commitment appropriations for transport safety and for the Galileo Supervisory Authority, and of payment appropriations for the internal market and optimisation of transport systems, and for passenger rights."
"It notes with satisfaction that the maximum rate of financial aid for cross-border projects has increased to 30% and the minimum funding threshold to EUR 1.5 billion."
"I would also like to remind you that the evaluation procedure for the selection of projects has been improved together with the relevant monitoring, but at the same time, the committee regrets the fact that the structure for the description of works has not been harmonised and technical and financial monitoring has not been standardised."
"Mr President, employment policy is included within cohesion policy."
"There are still a number of flaws and shortcomings in this area and a number of things about which we have reservations."
"Around 27% of cohesion policy falls within the remit of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"As regards the payments, most of them originate from the period between 2000 and 2006."
"It is gratifying to see that 100% of the payment appropriations were used during this period."
"What is sometimes problematic is the lack of evidence for the indirect costs and personnel costs, and the overestimation of such costs."
"We have therefore also expressed our support for a more standard way of indicating this, combined with better checks at Member State level, which we will have during the next period and which may result in improvements in this area in the future."
"After 2006 I was given the honour of drafting the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety regarding the implementation of the budget of the five European agencies coming under our jurisdiction for the 2007 financial year."
"I feel that the general level of budget line implementation in this area, which is 94.6%, is satisfactory overall."
"The implementation rate of the commitment appropriations for the LIFE+ programme was excellent at 98.87%."
"Other outstanding agencies included the European Environment Agency, which achieved 100% in terms of both commitments and payments, as well as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control."
"However, there is still some room for improvement in terms of budget management for the European Medicines Agency, the European Food Safety Authority and the European Chemicals Agency."
"In the case of the latter, 2007 was actually its first year of operation."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I propose that the Commission's agencies be given discharge for 2007 in the areas of environmental policy, public health and food safety with regard to the budget's implementation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Regional Development has thoroughly analysed the results of the Court of Auditors' work, but has also actively participated in the exceptionally penetrating work conducted by the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Comparison of these results with those which were the subject of the previous discharge reveals a fundamental advance in the work of the Commission in terms of the level of supervision."
"However, we are aware that the first visible effects of introducing the plan of action will appear only in the next few years."
"For our committee it is important that the results which appear in the Court of Auditors' report should not interfere with understanding of the importance of cohesion policy in EU policies and that they should not undermine the objectives of that policy."
"We also would like to draw attention to the fact that errors highlighted in the report should not be mistakenly understood as irregularities or possibly even abuses."
"In general we think that there is visible progress and we are going to support granting the Commission discharge."
"The report on the European Commission's discharge for 2007 shows some progress, even though we still need to properly harmonise actions and control mechanisms in order to achieve a more efficient use of resources, reduce the number and severity of the infringements and offer greater transparency and determination, especially on gender budgeting."
"The Commission's responsibility to cooperate with Member States and institutions must not be ignored."
"Cooperation and communication are important tools and we often witness the results of omissions in this respect."
"Without making light of some of the infringements in the newest Member States, Bulgaria and Romania, I think that it is necessary to guarantee equal treatment for all Member States."
"A special cooperation mechanism is being applied to both these countries, which must not be made complicated."
"Some of the texts in the report are unacceptable, in particular, suggestions for a mechanism for drafting quarterly reports for Bulgaria and Romania, as well as special reports on the use of Structural Funds."
"I urge these texts to be dropped."
"This will offer the countries the chance to focus on overcoming the problems which have arisen."
"I would like to say that we have not heard the opinions of the Committee on Development, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Committee on Transport and Tourism or the Committee on Culture and Education, because the rapporteurs did not come to the debate on time, and so there has been a change in the order of speakers."
"We will continue the discussion."
"Mr Ferber will now speak on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - one and a half minutes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that, during this parliamentary term, we have together made some progress with regard to the discharge procedure for the European institutions."
"However, I regret that it has taken so long, because in principle we have only now finished what was outlined at the time of the resignation of the Commission in 1999 - in other words 10 years ago."
"This shows that we quite definitely need to make improvements to our procedures and methods of working and to ensure that the necessary transparency appears quicker when it comes to citizens discovering what their taxes are used for."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Casaca, with whom I had the honour of working on the discharge of Parliament for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I very much regret that a fellow Member who has made very many comments in the press on various matters relating to the European Parliament is not participating either in the debates or the votes in committee nor in the debate here in plenary."
"This is something I want to say very clearly at this point, so that it is retained and remains for posterity!"
"We know very well that there have been and still are a number of problems here, and it is the MEPs who are here now who over the last five years have ensured that the necessary reforms are made in numerous places in the interests of the MEPs."
"For this, I offer my very sincere thanks to everyone."
"We have done what we needed to do and we have not released all of the information widely via the media and then not participated."
"Thank you for your positive cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall start by saying what I always say when we debate budgetary issues and budget control, namely that we are dealing here not with a technical, but with a deeply political procedure."
"The image conveyed to citizens by our Parliament and by the European Union in general is very important."
"In other words, how much of European taxpayers' money we are using and how and what image we are conveying about the transparency of this management to European citizens."
"It is therefore a political process and it is very important that we examine the outlines, the impression we give as the European Union, and not just certain details relating to specific countries, not that this means that we should not talk about every country."
"This observation compels me to say that our reports are also very important."
"One example raised is the example of the improvement which we have finally made in the area of the status of parliamentarians and parliamentary assistants, after many years of endeavour, and at this point I too should like to take my turn in welcoming the efforts made by my colleague Mr Casaca."
"We have a very good result today and that shows that our reports are important and have results and we must take care with them."
"I should like to add a couple of words about the results of our efforts this year."
"I shall say the same as the rapporteur, Mr Audy, that of course we have made progress, but that it is not yet enough."
"The major issue is the problem of the scope of cohesion, but here I want to say that we socialists are calling for improvement, credibility, efficacy and simplification, as the commissioner also said."
"I believe here, Commissioner, that we need to pass from evolution to revolution in the field of simplification; all this is not so that we can abolish cohesion, which is a basic policy of the European Union, but so that we can improve it and make it more effective."
"Finally, one important issue which is also raised in the report is the issue of the ability of the European Union to manage crises."
"We need to manage crises on our own and not to transfer this ability to other bodies."
"I should first of all like to thank the rapporteurs, and also Mr Audy, who, in my opinion, delivered an excellent speech."
"I am also indebted to the commissioner and to the services of the Commission."
"They have always been amenable to Parliament, which is something that I greatly appreciate."
"There was the odd bit of discord here and there, but where does that not happen?"
"The Commission should, in my view, be assessed on what it said at the beginning of the period and on the current outcome."
"Well, as the commissioner has already said, the Commission has not - not by a long shot - achieved what it had set out to achieve, namely a positive statement of assurance (DAS)."
"It did not even come anywhere near to the hoped-for result, which is a problem, although the commissioner did make a number of very interesting suggestions."
"It is unfortunate that these came at the end of the period."
"It may have been possible - I do not know - if we had been able to discuss these three years into his term of office, because many interesting suggestions were made."
"As far as I can see - and the commissioner also made reference to this - what is still of the essence is joint management."
"Can we leave this to the Member States or not, and how can we better monitor the Member States?"
"We stated in the interinstitutional agreement that we want declarations at a certain political level, which has been translated into the Financial Rules and Regulations."
"The big question has always been, for me, whether or not this is sufficient."
"I do not have enough insight into this at the moment."
"I thank the commissioner for the extensive report he sent, although, for me, it lacks clarity in places."
"Where are the carrots for those Member States that do well and the sticks for those Member States that do not?"
"It is not entirely clear to me, and this should be explained in the policy."
"I think that the discussion about a positive DAS should be continued without let-up."
"It is very harmful to public opinion if the situation of a negative DAS is sustained year after year."
"Mr President, our review of the accounts for 2007 shows that this year, yet again, we quite simply are not sufficiently able to manage the large resources provided to the EU by the Member States."
"The committee's excellent reports clearly reveal the serious shortcomings that exist. Allow me to quote from one of these reports."
"With regard to cohesion, the committee states that it notes with great concern the ECA's estimate that at least 11% of the total amount reimbursed in connection with structural policy projects should not have been reimbursed."
"I acknowledge that all of the EU's enormous network of legislation and administrative bodies, combined with poor administration and blatant corruption in some Member States, make responsible financial management difficult, but this is, and will remain, unacceptable."
"There is only one solution and that is to stop paying the large sums of money to the EU, thereby putting a stop to the whole EU redistribution circus."
"My little country, Denmark, will be paying almost DKK 20 billion to the EU this year."
"We would never contemplate using this money for the purposes to which the EU is putting it."
"Even sending the Member States' money for redistribution via Brussels involves a reduction in the net value of this money and contributes to an increase in the unlawful use of citizens' money."
"The EU Member States must finance themselves and not tax their neighbours."
"Finally, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mr BÃ¶sch, for his outstanding management of its work, and I would also like to thank the rapporteur, my fellow Members, the committee's secretariat and everyone involved for their exceptional commitment and very constructive cooperation."
"This time, I shall confine myself to Parliament's budget and should like to express my delight at Mr Casaca's report, particularly the chapter about the voluntary pension fund, in which we approved 10 paragraphs or so."
"A number of these were originally amendments which I had tabled and which, I believed, were necessary at this point."
"What is now happening to this voluntary pension fund has been thrown out by the eurosceptics."
"Rightly so, because it is a disgrace!"
"What is happening is unethical and we have to take action against it."
"We cannot accept that, in times like these, MEPs would sooner consider their own income than that of the citizens."
"Together with Mr Ferber, I should like to say to the eurosceptics sitting there that they have not, in any way, made an attempt to make any constructive contribution towards rectifying the shortcomings during this part-session."
"I should specifically like to ask my fellow MEPs to endorse paragraph 105, which relates to the voluntary pension fund."
"This will ensure that this Parliament's Bureau is prevented from using taxpayers' money to plug the enormous gaps, because that is not justifiable."
"I therefore call on all my fellow Members to give a large measure of backing and approve the Casaca report."
"I have applied for a roll-call vote, as everyone should nail their colours to the mast on this issue!"
"(FR) Mr President, in this period of economic recession, it was important for the European Union to continue to show solidarity towards developing countries."
"Let us recall that, in 2007, the European Community and the Member States together contributed 60% of all development aid, making the European Union the world's leading donor."
"The European Development Fund enables us to combat poverty, while promoting economic development and democracy."
"I am therefore delighted that a budget of EUR 23 billion has been allocated to the ACP countries for the period 2008-2013 under the 10th EDF."
"This figure is almost double the amount allocated under the 9th EDF."
"In its report the Court of Auditors concludes that the accounts for the 7th, 8th and 9th EDFs are, in general, reliable, legal and regular."
"We can only be delighted at the record levels of implementation of contracts and payments under the EDFs."
"However, I also note that there is still progress to be made in terms of strengthening the monitoring and control system, since there is still a significant level of errors affecting certain transactions."
"Equally, an all too often high risk exists in the area of budgetary support, and I believe that such risks should be assessed better."
"In this connection, I share the view that budgetary support should be granted only if the beneficiary country has the capacity to manage the funds transparently, responsibly and effectively."
"Of the priorities that we shall have to work on in the future, I should like to mention the integration of the EDF into the Community's general budget, since this would increase the effectiveness and the transparency of development aid."
"To conclude, Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, the representatives of the Court, and also all of the Commission staff who have done an excellent job on the ground."
"Needless to say, I regret the absence of the Council, and of the Czech Presidency in particular."
"(HU) During this cycle the European Parliament has had the task of exercising control over the administration of an ever-increasing number of agencies, a fact also mentioned by my fellow Member, Mr Fjellner."
"The constructive dialogue which evolved during the monitoring process between Parliament, the agencies and the European Court of Auditors has resulted in increasing transparency and tighter management discipline."
"In the current difficult economic and financial climate, the significance of monitoring has become more important than ever before."
"Looking back on the past period, what is gratifying is that during budget monitoring we have not only established conformity or lack of it, but we have also been able to make forward-looking recommendations to the institutions that have been audited, which have attempted to successfully implement them."
"I believe that it is important, and I support this, that agencies are not only subject to totally objective scrutiny, but also that we should examine their own individual development."
"I am particularly in favour of agencies also being set up in new Member States so as to bring the European Union's work closer to the people living there."
"We almost entirely agree with Mr Fjellner and the final verdict will be delivered tomorrow."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Audy report - my sincere thanks to the rapporteur - really takes us a step further forward, because it contains innovative elements such as naming and shaming - a milestone in budgetary control."
"This means targeted criticism instead of general complaints."
"The fact that the Socialist Group is now backing down and would rather sweep the truth under the carpet is scandalous and does a disservice to our control activities."
"The credibility of Parliament is on the line and I appeal to my fellow Members not to allow that to happen."
"I would like to say something about our biggest problems, Romania and Bulgaria."
"The failure of the Commission in connection with the preparation for the accessions of these countries is most evident here."
"We have lost a lot of money."
"The Commission sat back and watched for a long time and did not freeze the funds until 2008."
"In the meantime, however, over EUR 1 billion was lost in connection with Bulgaria and around EUR 142 million in connection with Romania."
"Freezing funds is no solution to the problems, however."
"The cooperation and verification mechanism, for which the President of the Commission himself is responsible, is a paper tiger, and the progress reports are not worthy of the name."
"The Audy report makes suggestions as to how this could be improved."
"The European Commission deceived Parliament about the readiness of these countries for accession and the Commissioner for Enlargement should in fact learn a lesson from this."
"We are interested in the management of future accessions, however, and therefore this topic remains on the agenda."
"Our Group will grant discharge to the Commission, but, personally, I will refuse to grant it discharge."
"Unfortunately, the Commission's zeal for reform, a tiny spark of which we were once again able to detect over the last year, has already been extinguished again."
"There is a standstill in connection with combating fraud, nothing is happening with regard to prevention and there is no desire for more ethical behaviour, among other things."
"One thing the Commission, and Commissioner Kallas in particular, should be clear about is that whoever wishes to be in the new Commission is dependent on the support of Parliament."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I thank honourable Members for their remarks."
"I can only say that during these five discharge procedures I have enjoyed and been very happy with our cooperation."
"The process has always been complicated, but always constructive and very professional."
"So thank you all for this contribution to the complicated discharge machinery."
"Just two remarks."
"To Mr Liberadzki I would say that the EDF accounts were successfully transferred to ABAC in February 2009."
"We raised the issue, but these are now merged."
"Jan Mulder's question as to why these radical proposals come so late was very good."
"Four years to see this kind of proposal maturing is not too long."
"In Europe things take time, and in this case we are trying to use all possibilities in the framework of our Action Plan since we see that something really serious must be done to get rid of this problem."
"So I do not think this is too late, but I regret of course that this has taken so much time."
"(RO) Mr President, Commissioner, my speech will be brief."
"Among the main conclusions on the European Commission's discharge, paragraph 4 in Mr Audy's report states that he is of the opinion that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria was not treated by the Commission with the necessary seriousness, that at the time of the two candidates' accession, reports for both candidate countries were misleading and that it is regrettable that this misinformation has led to the current situation where Cohesion Funds were released for Member States with non-functioning administrative and legal systems, and that this action misled public opinion and Parliament to the detriment of the EU's reputation."
"I would sincerely like my fellow Members Mr JÃ¸rgensen and Mr Casaca, who tabled this amendment, and the other fellow Members who approved it in the Committee on Budgets to explain these arguments because I think that both Romania and Bulgaria do have functioning administrative and legal systems, perhaps not based on the parameters they should have, but they function all the same."
"I also do not think that anyone has taken the liberty to mislead public opinion and, least of all, Parliament and the Commission."
"Mr President, I believe that the case of Romania and of Bulgaria is worthy of debate, but we really are in an extremely serious situation here."
"As regards the conclusions, I should like to thank the rapporteurs from the political groups and all of the speakers, especially the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I should like to conclude on several issues."
"Firstly, there is no fraud where the budget is concerned."
"Secondly, we have many errors, and this is for two reasons."
"The first is that our regulations are too complex, and so final beneficiaries find it difficult to apply them and commit errors, which are not too serious."
"The second reason is that the European Court of Auditors applies too low a materiality threshold: 2% to all sectors; as audit methods go, these ones must be re-examined."
"Thus, it is said that things are going badly, but because we are all responsible."
"The Commission is responsible because it has not kept its promise, and thank you, Commissioner, for examining the proposals for the next mandate."
"The Council is responsible because it is losing interest: it is not here."
"The Member States are responsible because they are not applying the regulations with enough rigour."
"The European Court of Auditors is responsible because it must reflect on its audit methods, and in particular on the materiality levels; it is the responsibility of the Court, not of the Commission or Parliament, to lay down the materiality thresholds."
"Parliament is responsible because it must be clear about the current imperfections and must accept the reforms."
"In short, I believe that we have a series of joint responsibilities."
"The summary is done at the end of this mandate."
"Well, we hope and pray that this reform will take place so that we will at last have a positive statement of assurance, in forthcoming financial perspectives."
"We hope too that if we have a negative statement of assurance, we will have a negative vote from Parliament, so that there is political consistency between the bodies that have to take budgetary control decisions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honourable task of offering my thanks, firstly to the rapporteurs, who have done a great job and have tabled constructive reports, one of which we still have to debate tomorrow."
"Secondly, I would like to thank the excellent secretariat that has supported us in recent years."
"With regard to those who succeed us, I can only hope that they have such an excellent staff working for them."
"However, there is something, Mr President, that I do not understand."
"Looking at the press preview - the preview of the plenary sitting of 21 to 24 April - I can read about the important reports on the immunity of MEPs, but there is nothing about the discharges for the 2007 financial year."
"If we do not recognise the rights of Parliament, who then in the general public will recognise us, take us seriously and vote on 7 June if this is what we do with the most powerful right that Parliament has?"
"This right is to control how over EUR 100 billion was spent during 2007."
"If we do not discuss facts then we will have to discuss rumours."
"Mr Ferber has already mentioned this point."
"We have to build this Europe on facts."
"We need the cooperation and constructive ideas that we have developed over recent years."
"It is not surprising that, at the end of this period, we have actually created the greatest productive power and the greatest degree of clarity in this period."
"This is partly due to the people involved, whom I would like to congratulate, but it is also due to the fact that we have ourselves become clear about various things, one of which being what control ultimately means to European taxpayers."
"We ought to know that we also go beyond this single year of 2007."
"Of course, we know that some wrong turns were taken and we have rectified these to some extent."
"I am very grateful to Mr Costas for what he said."
"During this period, we have established a Statute for Assistants."
"This is something that we were criticised for a few years ago."
"We established a Statute for Assistants and we were also criticised for this."
"Some people may not be one hundred percent convinced about this, but let us not forget, as members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, that things cannot always be done according to the German, Portuguese, Austrian or Spanish model."
"We need a European model."
"That is sometimes rather difficult and, particularly during election time, occasionally hard to represent."
"I am very grateful to everyone who has resisted the temptations of the forthcoming election campaign and said: we will stick to the facts, and we are also prepared to explain these facts to our fellow Members and also to the voters."
"Mr Kallas, I would like to add one more point, as we will also talk about this in connection with the Audy discharge, which I very much welcome."
"It relates to an alleged bank fee."
"For many years the Commission has been tardy in its calculation of the gross domestic product of the European Union in order to get the GNI, which is actually stipulated, onto a proper footing."
"That costs various Member States several million euros, which we have talked about."
"I hope that you or your successor will clear this up accordingly."
"Mr President, I am very thankful for this excellent piece of work produced by my committee and, as you know, tomorrow we will recommend that the discharge not be granted."
"I am very pleased to be chairman of this committee. Thank you very much."
"Mr President, there are a lot of 'thank yous' being said, but I would nevertheless like to take the opportunity to thank our eminent Chairman, Mr BÃ¶sch."
"I think that he has done a splendid job in chairing the committee over the last two and half years."
"Although there was not very much debate on my reports on discharge for the agencies, I hope that all of my fellow Members will choose to support them, irrespective of how they voted in the committee or of what they have previously indicated."
"It is important for Parliament to be united on these issues."
"As this is a joint debate for all of the reports, I would like to comment on a report that is not one of mine."
"I feel very strongly about Mr Casaca's report, which I think is an extremely good one, particularly paragraph 105, in which we note the fact that Parliament will not provide extra money from the budget to cover the voluntary pension fund's deficit for us MEPs."
"I know that many of you think that these points are very controversial, but in my opinion at least they are a given."
"A lot of people have been criticising this fund for many years."
"I would like to say that I think that the fund itself is something of a scandal."
"We are all being affected by the global financial crisis at the moment."
"At a time when ordinary people are seeing their pensions reduced, politicians must not save their own skins by using more of taxpayers' money for their own pensions."
"I hope that this is a message that those running this Parliament will really take on board and that they will refrain from topping up the fund using yet more taxpayers' money."
"On the contrary, we must put a stop to this and we must do so as soon as possible."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 23 April 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has asked that discharge be granted to the Commission, as well as to the five Community agencies that lie within its competencies."
"Even so, our committee is concerned by the low implementation rate of payment appropriations in the area of freedom, security and justice compared with 2006 (60.41% in 2007 and 86.26% in 2006)."
"Nevertheless, we are aware that responsibility does not so much lie with the Commission as with Member States, and that the low implementation is particularly due to the approval, in May and June 2007, of funds included in the solidarity framework and management of migration flows, and to delays in the implementation of other specific programmes (such as those relating to civil justice and information, and drugs prevention)."
"As I was saying, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has recommended that discharge be granted to:"
"the Agency for Fundamental Rights,"
"the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon,"
"Frontex,"
"Eurojust, and"
"CEPOL."
"I would like to make the following points on the latter two agencies:"
"we hope that Eurojust will reduce the excessively high carryovers and that it will standardise the way in which it awards contracts, as stated by the Agency;"
"bearing in mind the criticism addressed to CEPOL by our committee, it is our view that discharge for the Agency should not be postponed."
"As far as we are aware, the Director of CEPOL has worked closely with the Committee on Budgetary Control and is doing what is needed to correct the management errors that were detected."
"in writing. - (DE) Around 80% of EU funds are still being managed and spent by the Member States and there are still open questions and irregularities in connection with the handling of European Union money."
"The European Court of Auditors has now failed to confirm the legality and regularity of the EU's financial transactions in its annual audit reports 14 times in succession."
"Complete disclosure and inspection of EU expenditure is essential."
"It is necessary for the Member States' finance ministers to submit a national statement of assurance for all of the EU funds used."
"Community framework for nuclear safety (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr HÃ¶kmark, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council directive (Euratom) setting up a Community framework for nuclear safety - C6-0026/2009 -."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I think it is fair to say that we are now in a new era of energy policy, where there is a need for energy policy to be consistent with a policy for stopping climate change, and at the same time to be combined with a policy for energy security."
"Those three legs - energy policy, climate policy and energy security - must function together."
"From my perspective this highlights the importance of nuclear power."
"It is important that the existing nuclear power plants are managed in as safe and secure a way as possible, but it is also important that we have clear rules to ensure that the future power plants of the European Union are as secure and safe as possible."
"This is not only a matter of preparing the ground for more nuclear power."
"I think that there is rather large support for such a policy in the European Union, that it is growing and that we need to live up to the responsibilities that this gives us all."
"I respect those who are hesitant about or are against the use of nuclear power, but whatever opinion and whatever view we have on nuclear power, there can be no disagreement on the need for the rules to be as safe and secure as possible for the nuclear power we have."
"It is from this perspective that I would like to present this report on the Community framework for nuclear safety."
"There is a legal basis for this and there has been a debate in committee on whether all the procedures have been fulfilled."
"A letter has been sent from the Committee on Legal Affairs to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy saying that if it is a new proposal then there is a need for a new opinion from the group of experts."
"My view, and the view of the majority of the committee, is that this is a revised proposal which we have been working on in the European Union for nearly seven years."
"It has been changed because of an opinion from the group of experts and because of the opinion given by Parliament and I must say that now is the time to reach a decision."
"I hope that Council will be able to take this decision this spring."
"If we do not and if we delay this process, we will see in reality that new nuclear power plants will be planned and constructed without this Community framework."
"So this is the time for action."
"Those who are trying to hinder this because of their attitude to nuclear power are in reality preventing the European Union from having a Community framework establishing as safe and secure rules as possible."
"I have tried to position my report in three ways."
"First of all to give a clear structure on the responsibilities of Member States and governments, licence holders and national regulators."
"Secondly, I have been very clear about the independence that the national regulators will have and I am strengthening the requirements on national regulators, meaning that they must be able to act when they see any risk of a nuclear power plant not fulfilling the security rules."
"Thirdly, we are including in an annex the rules of the IAEA as binding rules, thereby making this Community framework clear, strict and firm, and that is the note on which I end."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, nuclear safety is an absolute priority for the European Union, as the rapporteur said, and I would like to thank the rapporteur for a very strong, clear and comprehensive report."
"As the use of nuclear energy in the European Union is a reality and will be a reality, and nuclear safety is not constrained by national borders, we need a Community-wide framework aiming at achieving, maintaining and continuously improving nuclear safety in the European Union."
"This is the objective of the revised proposal for a directive that sets up a Community framework for nuclear safety."
"The fundamental goal of the proposal is to establish binding legislation, the only solution that offers guarantees that political and industrial commitments to continuously improve nuclear safety are followed by concrete measures."
"These International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safety Fundamentals and the obligations of the Convention of Nuclear Safety constitute the core of the directive."
"De facto, their transposition into binding Community legislation would bring legal certainty."
"The proposal also aims at ensuring that national regulatory authorities in charge of nuclear safety are independent from any governmental decision-making body and any other organisation that would have an interest in nuclear matters."
"They can, therefore, preoccupy themselves solely with the safety of installations."
"The proposal aims to enhance the role of regulatory authorities by ensuring that the Member States provide them with adequate authority, competence and human and financial resources to fulfil their responsibilities."
"The revised proposal takes into account the outcome of a consultation process that started in 2004 with the Council's Working Party on Nuclear Safety."
"It was discussed, before adoption, with the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group, as well as in other fora."
"It also reflects the substance of the opinion given by the Scientific Group of Experts, referred to in Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, and the current nuclear safety proposal is a second revision of the regional proposal in the area of nuclear safety."
"Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty does not require a resubmission of the revised proposal to the Scientific Group of Experts."
"Moreover, close cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency has ensured consistency with international practices."
"The Commission agrees with most of the proposed amendments that reinforce the line taken."
"The report clearly recognises the obligation of the Member States to respect the Safety Fundamentals stemming from the IAEA and the provisions of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, as well as seeking to reinforce the role of nuclear regulatory authorities and ensure their independent decision-making role."
"I am, therefore, confident that the Council will take into consideration Parliament's position whenever it contributes to improving and clarifying the objectives of the directive."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament does not really have anything to say on this matter."
"It has been consulted and it is being used for the preparation of a directive which will serve to maintain uncertainty rather than help to increase safety in the nuclear sector."
"The directive is irrelevant to all existing nuclear power stations in the European Union."
"It is also irrelevant to high risk projects, such as those currently planned in Bulgaria, Slovakia and Romania."
"It has absolutely nothing to deliver in this regard."
"Moreover, if it survives, namely in connection with future planning that has not even begun yet, it will not lay down the current highest available scientific and technological standards, but will recommend compliance with principles."
"I ask myself why we as Parliament are allowing ourselves to be used in this way with this token gesture, which will not serve to ensure the safety of citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the decision we have taken is a smart one and it has been cleverly presented."
"It is also a smart decision for Parliament to contribute to harmonisation in Europe and to establishing more security rules."
"We have a duty to do that."
"Mrs Harms, I think you are quite wrong on the one hand to demand more and more safety in the nuclear sector and to complain that nuclear technologies do not have sufficient guarantees of safety while at the same time using every opportunity to obstruct such decisions here in this House."
"You cannot complain about the European Parliament concerning itself with this matter and then be dissatisfied that nuclear technology is not safe enough."
"We have fulfilled our duty today."
"We are attempting to contribute to providing a minimum level of safety for nuclear technology throughout Europe while, of course, also - as we have jointly established with a large majority in other decisions in this House - stabilising and supporting nuclear technology as one of several options in the energy mix."
"In this connection it is also relevant to ask how things stand with regard to safety."
"The answer must be given, we cannot simply keep asking for it."
"This proposal is on the table today and I hope that it will receive a majority vote tomorrow."
"We will close a very important debate tomorrow with a vote on this proposal, which will undoubtedly increase the security of Europe's citizens and their sense of security."
"The aim of this is not for us to find a solution, but for us to make progress in relation to the current situation."
"I feel, at any rate, that drafting a Community regulation marks a serious step forward for national regulation."
"This is why we give our absolutely unreserved support to the directive put forward by the Commission and to Mr HÃ¶kmark's report."
"We have tried to make further improvements through our proposed amendments."
"I believe that Europe's citizens deserve for us to make progress on nuclear energy, which actually accounts for 32% of our electricity supply."
"Let us do it together then!"
"Mr President, my group fully supports the aim of this directive, which is to establish a Community framework to ensure and maintain the continuous improvement of safety in nuclear installations within the European Union."
"Our Parliament has always stressed the urgent need to implement clear and rigorous legislation and to adopt practical measures at Community level in areas relating to nuclear safety, radioactive waste management and the decommissioning of nuclear installations."
"Our debates have raised the issue, among others, of training and knowledge."
"It is vital for Europe, which has nuclear expertise, to preserve this knowledge, not least by ensuring that safety inspectors within nuclear installations are trained and qualified."
"Finally, I am satisfied that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has accepted an amendment to the legislative resolution calling on the European Commission to consult the group of experts, in accordance with Article 31 of the Treaty."
"I repeat: we demand transparency, and we want clear and rigorous legislation."
"I am grateful to our rapporteur, Mr HÃ¶kmark."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal currently on the table is to be welcomed."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs, and your predecessor, Commissioner Palacio, who had already realised that it is important to think about safety."
"I also believe that it is important to improve the independence of national regulatory bodies."
"If regulatory bodies in all of the other countries were as independent as the regulatory body in France we would already have made a great deal of progress."
"It would, of course, be even better if we had an EU-wide regulatory body with the ability to remove dangerous nuclear power stations from the grid in the peer review process."
"It is also important to have strict mandatory safety standards and to ensure, through the European regulator, that shutdown is carried out."
"Safety and protection are extremely important for public health and receive our full support."
"More must be done in relation to this in future."
"(BG) I too would like to take the opportunity to mention how important the Commission's proposal is for a framework directive for nuclear safety."
"I believe that this document provides a good basis for producing binding regulations in the European Union on this issue and for providing reassurance to all countries, including those which do not use nuclear energy, that the nuclear energy produced in the European Union is safe."
"I want to emphasise that I am pleased with the amendments which have been adopted and which I tabled with regard to defining specifically the directive's scope, ensuring a regular exchange of best practice between Member States and more clearly assigning liability between countries, licence holders and the regulatory body."
"I would like to emphasise that this directive once again highlights the right of any country to choose its energy mix, even if it wants this to include nuclear energy, which saves on carbon dioxide and is beneficial to the environment."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as has been rightly said the aim of this proposal is to create a Community-wide framework."
"It was not easy to achieve this."
"We based our work on the Western European Nuclear Regulators' Association (WENRA) and on experience in the High Level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management."
"We also worked together with the Council, which had discussed more or less the same proposals in 2003."
"I believe that it strikes the right balance at this stage;"
"I believe it gives European citizens a clear understanding that there is a Community-wide framework."
"I am confident this framework will evolve with time, but I very much welcome Mr HÃ¶kmark's report because it strengthens the proposal while keeping the balance we need."
"It is the national regulators who are responsible for the safety of the installations running in their countries."
"These issues are so sensitive that we cannot, and should not, sidestep them, but we do need constantly to improve nuclear safety standards."
"I believe this directive gives us that opportunity."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, first of all I think it is important to say that no one should be against increasing the level of safety and strengthening the safety rules."
"There must be no tendency, just because one dislikes nuclear power and is against its use, to underplay the importance of the rules we need."
"In that sense, I think it is a step forward that we have a common Community framework because it creates a consistency, a transparency and an opportunity to ensure our common development towards higher standards."
"This directive really does apply to existing power plants because it increases the importance and the independence of national regulators - which is crucial - and it paves the way for us to secure higher and higher requirements in order to have, as it were, a 'race to the top' regarding safety."
"Let us be very frank about this."
"We will have nuclear power in the future, whatever all of us here today agree about on this issue."
"In my view, it is important that we can lay the ground for having more nuclear power plants."
"They must be credible and there must exist a credibility in public opinion, but - even more importantly - there must be a substantial, real safety in managing nuclear power, as there should be in every other thing we do."
"The existing rules are good and strong, but we are making them more consistent, and that is a step forward."
"I would like to thank you for your cooperation and for the discussion."
"I think that we have achieved a better result, and I hope that the Council will listen to this opinion."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - I would like to draw my attention to the environmental situation of Marsaxloqq Bay."
"The most picturesque bay in Malta was destroyed when a power station was built."
"This has had a health impact on the residents in its region especially those of Marsaxloqq."
"Now an incineration plant is being planned in this bay and once again the inhabitants of this region are going to be subject to environmental nightmare."
"In addition, there is a health hazard which cannot be estimated."
"When I was the lawyer in a case trying to prevent the construction of a power station in the bay I was able to prove that discharges were not all being absorbed by the atmosphere."
"Some discharges were found too heavy to evaporate and would find themselves falling in the vicinity of the station."
"Tiles in open places were visibly stained by a rust-coloured substance."
"It resulted that those stains were a result of discharges."
"What is the situation going to be when increased discharges from the incineration plant will be allowed into the atmosphere?"
"Following a delay of almost six years, the EU is today close to adopting a nuclear safety directive, an important political document for nuclear energy in Europe, which is used to produce almost one third of the EU's electricity."
"Member States have the exclusive right to decide themselves whether to rely on nuclear energy."
"For countries both accepting and rejecting this form of energy, it is just as important that the highest safety standards in nuclear energy apply."
"I welcome the inclusion of the IAEA's basic safety principles as an annex to the directive."
"This will ensure that the best developments in nuclear safety standards become an integral part of European legislation, which Member States are accordingly bound to comply with."
"The lack of generally approved nuclear safety requirements in the EU allowed, in the not too distant past, some of the countries joining the EU to have political solutions imposed on their nuclear energy, which are not in line nowadays with the EU's objectives for limiting climate change and for energy supply security."
"At a time when a number of new nuclear power plants are under construction in the EU or in the pipeline, the timely adoption of the nuclear safety directive is not only justified, but is mandatory because of the guarantees it offers for the population's safety and peace of mind."
"Addressing the challenges of deforestation and forest degradation to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss - Timber and timber products (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the Commission statement - Addressing the challenges of deforestation and forest degradation to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss, and"
"the report by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the obligations of operators who place timber and timber products on the market - C6-0373/2008 -."
"Mr President, deforestation is responsible for approximately 20% of greenhouse gas emissions at global level."
"Consequently, from the point of view of climate change, addressing deforestation is an important priority."
"At the same time, addressing deforestation helps to achieve other important objectives, such as eradicating poverty and reversing the loss of biodiversity, which is another major environmental threat to our planet."
"Deforestation has now become a major issue at international negotiations, on both climate change and biodiversity."
"In order to promote a policy to address this issue, the European Commission issued a communication in October 2008, which the Council accepted in full last December."
"This communication refers to the question of deforestation and the deterioration in forests in developing countries and proposes, among other things, the development of a financing mechanism in the aim of providing incentives to maintain existing forests."
"This proposal is already being discussed and processed at the international negotiations on climate change currently under way."
"In its communication, the Commission also acknowledges that various European policies, at both internal level and internationally, may have an indirect impact on global forest resources."
"As such, the Commission has made specific undertakings in the aim of strengthening the cohesion of European policies."
"The proposed measures include the following:"
"an impact assessment on the consumption of imported goods in the European Union which may contribute towards deforestation;"
"continuing the procedure to review the cohesion of our development policy, which is needed to support developing countries in their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"These undertakings will also be implemented through the European Commission's policy on sustainable consumption and production."
"The aim of this policy is to stimulate growth and the demand for sustainable goods and services, including timber and timber-based products which come from forests to which sustainable management methods are applied."
"Allow me now to refer to one of the main factors of deforestation: illegal logging."
"Illegal logging is very often the first step towards the general exploitation of natural forests."
"Consequently, addressing illegal logging and improving forest management in general are of fundamental importance if we want efforts to limit deforestation and the deterioration of forests to succeed."
"In accordance with the European Union's 2003 Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade, the Commission proposed a series of measures to address the problem of illegal logging and the trade associated with it."
"The core element of the above action plan was the conclusion of voluntary partnership agreements with third-country timber producers."
"We believe that the agreements in question may help to address the basic causes of illegal logging."
"At the same time, however, the Commission has acknowledged that these agreements alone may not suffice to address the problem and other possibilities therefore need to be investigated."
"Based on the results of the impact assessment, the Commission submitted a policy proposal last year based on the 'principle of due diligence'."
"According to the proposed regulation, operators must minimise the risk of placing illegally logged timber and related products on the market by demonstrating due diligence, when they place these products on the European Union market, in obtaining information on the provenance and legality of the products in question."
"I should like to extend my especial thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Lucas, to the shadow rapporteurs and to the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Ford, on their exceptionally diligent work."
"The Commission has examined the amendments to its draft regulation proposed by the European Parliament and I should like to comment briefly on them:"
"The amendment banning the trade in illegally logged timber and related products is very important."
"This ban was included in the options examined by the Commission when it drafted its proposal."
"However, while this approach is quite attractive at first sight, it presents important practical and political difficulties."
"That is precisely why we adopted a proposal based on the principle of due diligence."
"This proposal will achieve the best possible balance between an effective approach to illegal practices, the facility to apply these measures without encumbering operators unnecessarily and, finally, their compatibility with the rules of the World Trade Organization."
"The amendments requiring all manner of operators to exercise due diligence at all stages of the supply chain do not appear to follow the principle of proportionality."
"If the legality of the timber is checked when it is first placed on the market, it would not appear to be necessary for checks to continue at all subsequent stages of the supply chain."
"I should also like to comment on Parliament's amendment proposing a broader definition of 'legal timber'."
"This definition is the epicentre of the proposal and will doubtless be a matter for discussion with the Council."
"The Commission will examine carefully the consequences of adopting any such broader definition."
"As regards the amendments relating to the recognition of monitoring and control authorities, we believe that, by making the Member States responsible for recognising these authorities, our initial proposal is more in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity."
"The reasons why it was proposed to set up an advisory group are absolutely understandable."
"The Commission has always been prepared to consult the stakeholders involved, as it remarked, moreover, in its statement of reasons."
"However, although the Commission has the right of initiative to set up such advisory groups, it is not necessary for any such provision to be included in the regulation."
"Finally, we also understand why it has been proposed to standardise the application of the law in the Member States."
"For our part, however, we consider that the amendments in question should, as a matter of principle, be in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity."
"That brings me to the end of my statement and I shall follow the debate with interest."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to start by saying how relieved I am that, at long last, we finally have before us a proposal for legislation to tackle the problem of illegal logging."
"Parliament has been waiting for this for an enormous amount of time and I warmly thank my colleagues for their persistent efforts to see it brought forward."
"I would also like to thank my colleagues for their outstanding cooperation in bringing us to the point of tomorrow's vote; shadows and staff have truly pulled out all the stops so that we could complete Parliament's first reading in the shortest possible time, so as to be in a position to seek a first-reading agreement and thus to avoid any further delays."
"Sadly, however, the painfully slow rate of progress in the Council has put paid to that idea."
"So it seems that we will have to be content with concluding this work in the autumn, following political agreement by the Council in June, and that is very disappointing both to myself and to many colleagues who have worked so hard."
"Had the Council been here I would have liked to have asked them for a guarantee tonight that they will do everything possible to reach a common position before the summer, because this situation is incredibly urgent."
"Illegal logging is a hugely serious problem, against which the EU has preached for many years, yet all the while continuing to provide one of the world's biggest markets for illegally logged timber and timber products."
"Between 20% and 40% of global industrial wood production is estimated to come from illegal sources, and up to 20% of that finds its way into the EU."
"That depresses timber prices, it strips natural resources and tax revenue, and it increases the poverty of forest-dependent peoples."
"The longer-term effects are even more serious, as Commissioner Dimas indicated, since deforestation, of which illegal logging is a major driver, accounts for nearly one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions."
"With the Copenhagen Climate Conference now on the horizon, credible EU action on illegal logging is ever more important."
"But credible action means effective, binding legislation."
"While the voluntary partnership agreements conceived under the 2003 FLEGT Action Plan have the potential to drive positive change, to date only one has been signed and, as long as their coverage is not universal, the risks of money-laundering and circumvention are just too high."
"The good news is that we do finally have EU legislation; the bad news is that the Commission proposal is distressingly weak and will need comprehensive improvement in order to become meaningful and effective."
"In spite of Commissioner Dimas' good words about the importance of tackling illegal logging, the Commission proposal as it stands simply is not up to the job."
"The preamble to the proposal states that 'weak rules to prevent trade in illegally harvested timber' are at the root of the prevalence of illegal logging, but what the Commission has come up with, I am afraid, will do nothing to change that."
"Quite simply, the Commission proposal as it stands will not achieve our aim of ensuring that the EU no longer provides a market for illegally logged timber."
"The most glaring, gaping hole in the proposal is that it does not actually prohibit the import and sale of illegally logged timber - perverse as that sounds."
"It requires only that operators at one particular point in the supply chain put in place a due-diligence system while everyone else is immune from any obligation as to the legality of the timber or the timber products that they trade."
"Now that stands in stark contrast to the revised US Lacey Act adopted in May 2008, which does enact an explicit prohibition on the import and sale of illegally logged timber, and there is absolutely no good reason why the EU cannot emulate this."
"So, while my report maintains the Commission's suggestion that only operators who place timber and timber products on the EU market for the first time should be required to put in place a full due-diligence system - since they are clearly the actors with the most influence - it makes clear that all operators in the market share responsibility for trading only legally sourced wood and that failing to do that may constitute an offence."
"I should like to say to Commissioner Dimas that I really do believe that our proposals are supplementing due diligence: they are making it more effective, they are making it operational and there is no problem at all with WTO rules."
"If the US can do it, we should do it, and that is why Parliament is seeking to amend this proposal."
"As spokesman for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I regard the two items before us as being equally important: the Commission statement and Mrs Lucas's report."
"In our view, we very much need both of these to halt deforestation, forest degradation and the decline in biodiversity."
"At present, almost 13 million hectares of forest, an area the size of Greece, disappear every year."
"In addition, deforestation is responsible for almost 20% of global carbon dioxide emissions, which is more than the European Union's entire greenhouse gas emissions."
"Deforestation is responsible for the significant decline in biodiversity and for the extinction of certain species, not to mention for the deterioration of the Earth's ecosystem."
"There is no question therefore that we need to act now."
"This means that the European Union must assume a leading role in formulating a global political response."
"Tropical forests aside, I feel it is particularly important to halt the deforestation occurring in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as to create a set of strict sustainability criteria for timber and timber products."
"Green public procurement and sustainability criteria are required for timber and other forms of biomass used for renewable energy production."
"Part of the auction revenues resulting from the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions must be earmarked for halting deforestation."
"I welcome the aspiration expressed in Mrs Lucas's report aimed at tightening controls and creating an effective sanction system."
"Finally, I believe that it is particularly important to set up monitoring bodies and impose financial penalties which reflect proper compensation for environmental damage."
"Mr President, the report on the prohibition of illegal logging, which was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, is a balanced one."
"While it is sufficiently ambitious in the prohibition of illegal logging and the import of, and trade in, products that result from it, it does not create additional bureaucracy for the operators that now behave irreproachably."
"It is vitally important to control illegal logging, which is a major reason for global deforestation, which itself, as someone said here, causes 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major cause of the decline in biodiversity."
"In addition to environmental problems, illegal logging impairs the competitiveness of legal operators in the forestry sector and causes countries to lose huge amounts in income."
"I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Lucas, for her work, thanks to which tomorrow we can vote on a good basic proposal."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, by the time allocated to this debate, one might say that Parliament attaches little importance to saving forests."
"This stops the disappointment of discovering the shy Commission approach to addressing illegal logging, but what disappointed me the most was the repetition of the argument that we should not punish the good-faith EU operators in order to solve an external problem."
"Part of solving a problem is also creating awareness about the problem, and it is high time we acknowledged that some European regions - like mine - are also confronted with rampant deforestation."
"The illegal logging regulation does not aim to punish or to hinder trade but rather to better control trade."
"It is true that the Commission proposals were not really clear on how the system should work in practice."
"I am pleased that the EP managed to strengthen and clarify the proposal by covering all timber products and requiring all operators to exercise some sort of due diligence by introducing a new baseline for financial penalties and providing clear criteria for a credible and independent monitoring system."
"Now our challenge is to have this system adopted and implemented sooner rather than later."
"We need to give consumers the guarantee that they are not fuelling the environmental degradation by accidentally buying illegally harvested timber products."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank all the speakers in tonight's debate for their constructive contributions."
"It is important to underline that tackling global deforestation and forest degradation is a complex issue."
"Solving it requires real political will and actions on the demand side."
"We should keep in mind that patterns of tropical deforestation are the result of the interaction of a number of different factors which vary in importance in different locations."
"Forest cover is not only affected by forest policies, but also by other policies such as taxation policy, land tenure and rights."
"In the European Union we understand that working on the coherence of our policies must go hand in hand with supporting countries in their efforts to strengthen national and local institutions and make progress towards effective governance and use of forest resources."
"I wish to thank again Ms Lucas, Mr Ford and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent work."
"I am encouraged that Parliament, while endorsing the approach of the Commission, wants to reinforce it further and has made amendments to this end."
"Let me assure you that I fully share Parliament's objective of putting in place an ambitious regulation to address illegal logging and its associated trade."
"I also want to assure you that the Commission will give careful consideration to the amendments of the proposed regulation."
"To conclude, I would like in particular to comment on two of the issues addressed tonight."
"Firstly I would like to refer to the due-diligence approach, which is more comprehensive than just a certificate of legality."
"The principle of due diligence reflects the legal obligation of a proactive behaviour to a certain legality and needs to be demonstrated on a basis of comprehensive measures which will enable legality to be reasonably assured."
"In some cases a certificate of legality will only be a starting point, the first measure included in the due diligence procedure."
"Where the risk assessment has shown that the country of origin presents a higher risk of administrative corruption, or in countries where enforcement of national laws is weak, additional guarantees are necessary to underpin the certified legality."
"The other issue I would like to address is the proposed extension of the scope to cover downstream operators."
"According to the principles of better regulation and a reduction of administrative burden, requiring distributors and retailers to demand proof of the due diligence from the proceeding market obligators appears to be excessive."
"If timber was made subject to due-diligence enquires when first placed on the market, why unduly burden downstream operators?"
"In summary, out of the 75 proposed amendments, the Commission can support fully, in part, or in principle, 37."
"I will provide Parliament's secretariat with a list detailing the Commission's position on the amendments."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to thank my colleagues, and Commissioner Dimas, very much for their comments."
"One important point I would like to make is that great care has been taken in our amendments not to reinvent the wheel."
"I have learnt from meetings with numerous industry representatives and other stakeholders that many countries, and also many companies, already have in place excellent systems which would fulfil most, if not all, requirements of the due-diligence system."
"It makes sense, then, that all the work that has gone into establishing those systems does not go to waste and that we do not create unnecessary extra administrative burdens; that is far from being our intention."
"That being so, we have been very careful and have made use of good advice on including wording which would enable good existing systems to qualify under the regulation without the need to establish whole new structures."
"So we have taken very seriously the message that we should not be disproportionate, that we should not be putting too much burden on the different players in the trading system, and that is exactly what our report aims to do: to make sure that all players in the trading system have a responsibility, that we do not put everything onto those who first put the products onto the market."
"That is what seems disproportionate."
"I think it is much more sensible that everybody has a role to play."
"I would also add that many elements of our proposals are actually supported by industry."
"It is rather ironic that in many senses industry seems to be far more ambitious in this area than even the Commission itself."
"I have heard directly from industry how much they appreciate not only the fact that the Committee on the Environment's report provides them with much greater clarity on what will be expected of them, but also precisely this fairer and more effective sharing of responsibility across the different parts of the supply chain which I have just described."
"As far as European operators are concerned, I would like to say very clearly that the regulation as we have amended it should do nothing but benefit responsible European operators, since the vast majority of them already do most of what is being asked, and the existence of the regulation will prevent them from being undercut by other, less scrupulous, operators."
"So we should be very clear that there is nothing in this report that makes life difficult for European operators."
"We have also got some special measures for smaller operators, so we have taken very seriously the risk of being disproportionate;"
"I think we have addressed that very sensibly in the report that we have put before you."
"Having heard again your comments, Commissioner, on the Environment Committee's report, I am afraid I do maintain my view that the Commission's proposal as it stands is disappointing and weak and simply will not do what it claims to do."
"I fail to see how you can have legislation aimed at preventing the sale of illegally logged timber which does not actually make doing so an offence."
"The way in which the whole Commission proposal is written is very patchy and it is very timid."
"I think most European consumers would be genuinely shocked to realise that the EU does not already have in place legislation against illegal logging, and I suspect that all those who concluded, in response to the Commission's own consultation, that legislation was the only way to really address the problem would not see the particular proposals by the Commission, the due-diligence system on its own, as sufficient to be able to address the problems that we face."
"I will end my comments tonight by seeking - maybe via your good offices, Commissioner - to put some pressure behind the Council to speed up their work, because we really do want to make sure we get a common position from the Council before the summer so that we can move swiftly on with this in the autumn."
"As I said earlier, we had really hoped to get a first-reading agreement."
"Parliament did everything it could to enable that to happen."
"It is, frankly, deeply disappointing that the Council has not acted with equivalent seriousness and speed, but I hope I can ask you once again, Commissioner, to do all you can to ensure that the Council does move swiftly on this."
"The joint debate is closed."
"In accordance with Rule 103(2), I have received one motion for a resolution, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"The vote on this motion for a resolution will take place on Thursday 23 April 2009."
"The vote on the report by Mrs Lucas will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) Combating the trade in illegally harvested timber clearly has to be a priority, given its consequences for ecosystems and the unfair competition to which it subjects 'legal' operators in the forest-timber-paper sector."
"However, if we impose disproportionate constraints - particularly in relation to traceability - on operators who place timber on the market, this will result in our businesses becoming less competitive without for all that reducing instances of illegal logging, which will be redirected to other markets."
"Indeed, we would be unrealistic in thinking that very binding European legislation alone would solve corruption- or State deficit-related problems, which often exist in countries that practise this illegal activity."
"Similarly, I believe that this report goes too far in calling into question the Commission's initial proposal, which is acceptable to operators."
"Thus I do not think it appropriate to call into question the certification systems implemented by professionals, to exclude professional organisations and monitoring organisations financed by operators from the sector, or to do away with the national authority responsible for designating monitoring organisations."
"I believe that the sector's professionals must remain at the heart of the system and should not have overly burdensome administrative measures imposed on them."
"Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Romeva i Rueda, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy - C6-0510/2008 -."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by reminding us all that a few weeks ago Greenpeace reported a Galician company, Armadores Vidal, to the Spanish public prosecutor's office for receiving subsidies to the value of EUR 3.6 million from the Spanish Government, between 2003 and 2005, despite the fact that, since 1999, the company has accrued numerous sanctions in several countries for illegal fishing around the world."
"In fact, the Commission has condemned this situation recently."
"Last week the bluefin tuna fishing season began."
"Scientists tell us that we have already gone beyond the acceptable limits of sustainable fishing of this species, which is clearly at risk of extinction."
"The Spanish defence minister is currently in Somalia leading the operation to protect the tuna fishing boats deployed in the Indian Ocean against pirate attacks."
"If European tuna vessels have to stray so far from home in order to work, it is because, firstly, the closest stocks are on the point of collapse and, secondly, we have an oversubsidised and clearly oversized fleet that seeks profitability even at the expense of using up the main element that sustains its activity: the fish."
"Once again, the common factors in all these cases - and in many others - are overfishing, the excessively large European fleet and, most importantly, the lack of control and capacity to impose sanctions."
"That is why our report maintains that applying the rules in a non-discriminatory and effective manner should be one of the basic pillars of the Common Fisheries Policy."
"We therefore ask, for example, that it be explicitly forbidden to give public subsidies to anyone acting illegally, as in the case of Armadores Vidal."
"Complying with the rules and adopting a coherent approach are the best ways to protect the interests of the fishing industry in the long term."
"Such a policy is destined to fail if those people working in the fishing industry, from the fishermen to the traders who sell fish to consumers, do not comply with the rules."
"Fish stocks are fated to disappear along with those who depend on them for survival."
"On a number of occasions, the Commission and the European Parliament have lamented the low level of compliance and we have requested, among other things, that Member States increase controls, harmonise inspection criteria and sanctions, and that inspection results be more transparent."
"In addition, we have requested that Community inspection systems be strengthened."
"The proposed regulation that has given rise to this report tackles the much-needed reform of the existing control system and puts forward a series of recommendations to be added to existing ones following the adoption of the regulation on illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing - 'yo-yo' fishing - or the regulation concerning the authorisation of fishing activity."
"The most important factor of a control system applied to 27 Member States is probably that all stakeholders should be treated equally and, in particular, that everyone along the production chain - fishermen, middlemen, buyers, people who have links to recreational fishing and others - should feel that they are not being discriminated against but also that they have their share of the responsibility on this matter."
"Therefore, we must ensure that conditions are equal across the Community and also along the entire chain of custody."
"While we also mostly support the Commission's original proposal, the proposal we are tabling includes a series of aspects allowing us to make considerable progress in that direction."
"I would just like to highlight one aspect by mentioning the need for the Community Fisheries Control Agency to play a particularly important role, given its Community nature and its impartiality order."
"I therefore hope that the amendments we have tabled at the last minute, so as to finalise the report, will be accepted by my fellow Members as has already been the case in our committee debate, and I hope, indeed, that it will prove a useful tool to save those who are in need of saving: not just the stocks but the communities that make a living from them."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur, Mr Romeva i Rueda, who has undertaken some impressive work on this report."
"What is even more noteworthy is the fact that the rapporteur has undertaken to meet with numerous international and Community stakeholders in several capitals."
"This file was complex and delicate."
"The Commission would like to thank Mr Romeva i Rueda for his work on this report."
"As you know, the current regulation on fisheries control dates back to 1993."
"It has since been amended a dozen times, in particular in 1998, to include the control of fishing effort, and in 2002 on the occasion of the last reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP)."
"However, the resulting system has serious shortcomings that prevent it from being as effective as it should be."
"As both the European Commission and the European Court of Auditors have highlighted, the current system is inefficient, expensive, complex, and it does not produce the desired results."
"This in turn undermines conservation and effort management initiatives."
"Control failures thus contribute to the negative performance of the common fisheries policy."
"The main aim of the control reform is to ensure the respect of the CFP rules by building a new standard framework which will enable the Member States and the Commission to fully assume their responsibilities."
"It establishes a global and integrated approach to control, focusing on all aspects of the CFP and covering the whole chain of catch, landing, transport, processing and marketing - 'from catch to consumer'."
"In order to achieve this, the reform is built on three axes."
"Axis 1: the creation of a culture of compliance and responsibility of the sector."
"The aim of this objective is to influence the behaviour of all stakeholders involved in the wide range of fishing activities in order to achieve compliance through not only monitoring and control activities, but as a result of an overall culture of compliance where all parts of the industry understand and accept that playing by the rules is in their own long-term interest."
"Axis 2: instituting a global and integrated approach to control and inspection."
"The proposal ensures uniformity in the implementation of the control policy, while respecting the diversity and the specific characteristics of different fleets."
"It establishes a level playing field for the industry by covering all aspects from capture through to the market."
"Axis 3: the effective application of CFP rules."
"The reform also aims to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of Member States, the Commission and the Community Fisheries Control Agency."
"Under the CFP, control and enforcement are the exclusive competence of the Member States."
"The role of the Commission is to control and verify that the Member States are implementing the CFP rules correctly and effectively."
"The current proposal does not try to change this allocation of responsibilities."
"However, it is important to rationalise procedures, and to ensure that the Commission has the means to actually see to it that the Member States equally implement CFP rules."
"I would also like to emphasise the fact that the proposal will reduce administrative burdens and make the system less bureaucratic."
"The Commission's impact assessment found that if the reform is adopted, the total administrative costs for operators could be reduced by 51% - from EUR 78 to EUR 38 million - largely through the use of more modern technologies, such as the extension of the use of ERS, VMS and AIS."
"Existing paper-based tools will be replaced at all stages of the fisheries chain - i.e. logbook, landing declarations and sales notes - except for vessels below 10 metres overall length. For fishermen, the electronic system will make it easier to record and communicate data."
"Once the system has been introduced, a number of reporting requirements will be removed."
"The system will be quicker, more accurate, less expensive and will allow for the automated processing of data."
"It will also facilitate cross-checking of data and information, and the identification of risks."
"The result will be a more rational and risk-based approach to control actions at sea and on land, the latter being inherently more cost-effective."
"The proposal will also remove the current obligation on Member States to transmit lists of fishing licenses or fishing permits to the Commission, which will instead be made accessible by electronic means to the national control services, to those of other Member States, and to the Commission."
"Now turning to the report, I would like to comment on the amendments proposed."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that the European Parliament supports the legislation in principle and considers that a new control regulation is necessary."
"Whilst the Commission can go along with certain amendments that are in line with the discussion within the Council working group, it considers it fundamental to retain certain key elements of the proposal."
"The Commission can agree with an important number of amendments, in particular Amendments 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13 to 18, 26 to 28, 30, 31, 36, 44, 45, 51 to 55, 57, 58, 62, 63, 66 to 69, 82, 84, 85, and 92 to 98."
"The Commission cannot, however, accept the following amendments, which could be summarised as follows:"
"Concerning the monitoring of fishing activities: Amendment 23 modifies the margin of tolerance to be applied to logbook catch entries to 10%, instead of 5% as in the proposal."
"This will seriously affect the accuracy of the logbook data that is essential when using such data for cross-checks."
"Since such cross-checks will be used to identify data inconsistencies as indicators of illegal behaviour on which Member States should concentrate their scarce control resources, this amendment would also negatively affect the operation of the computerised validation system foreseen in Article 102(1) of the proposal which is considered to be the backbone of the new control system."
"The most important argument is, however, that fishermen can indeed estimate their catches within an accuracy level of 3%."
"After all, fish is stored and transported in boxes and they know how much weight of fish a box can hold."
"Regarding Amendment 29 on prior notifications, the Commission believes that the idea to reserve the granting of exemptions to the Council would complicate enormously the procedure and would not allow for timely reactions to developments on the ground."
"The Commission also finds that the reallocation of unused quotas is a management matter that should be dealt with in the context of the CFP reform."
"Thus, Amendment 41 on corrective measures cannot be accepted."
"On transhipments of stocks subject to multiannual plans, Amendment 42 deletes the entire Article 33."
"This is not acceptable because, as you know, transhipments have been used in the past to conceal illegal catches."
"For that reason it is essential to maintain Article 33 and that quantities to be transhipped are weighed by an independent body before they are taken on the transport vessel."
"Amendment 47 deletes the entire section on real-time closure of fisheries."
"By accepting this, the Commission would lose a very important instrument for the protection of stocks."
"Real time closures are directly linked to control issues."
"Therefore, this amendment cannot be accepted."
"Amendment 102 is not acceptable since it deletes the article on the ability for the Commission to close fisheries if so required by the Commission."
"A similar provision exists already in the current control regulation, and it is a necessary tool to ensure that, if a Member State fails to close a fishery, then the Commission is entitled to close that fishery in order to ensure the respect of quotas - and this we did last year for the bluefin tuna and the year before for cod in the Baltic Sea."
"Similarly, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 103, which deletes the provisions on corrective measures."
"This would weaken the role of the Commission as the guardian of EU law ensuring that all Member States are able to take full advantage of their fishing opportunities."
"Moreover, this provision already exists in current legislation."
"As regards new technologies: concerning the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and the Vessel Detection System (VDS), Amendment 19 foresees the entry into force of these electronic devices for vessels between 10 and 15 metres as of 1 July 2013, instead of 1 January 2012, as laid down in the proposal."
"Amendment 20 foresees that the installation of VMS devices and electronic logbooks is eligible for funding, with 80% cofinancing from the EU budget."
"Regarding Amendment 19, the proposal already provides for a transition period, as this obligation would only apply as of 1 January 2012, whereas the entry into force of the regulation is foreseen for 1 January 2010."
"Since the new control system intends to make the best possible use of modern technologies, in order to develop an efficient automated and systematic system of cross-checking, it is important that these provisions apply on the date foreseen in the proposal, so as not to further delay the implementation of the new approach to control."
"Regarding the concerns on the cost of introducing these new technologies, the cofinancing by the Commission is already available under Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006, which establishes cofinancing rates, and in the framework of this Regulation the Commission will consider increasing such rates."
"It would, however, go against the budgetary rules to lay down in another legislative act the rates for cofinancing."
"Concerning recreational fisheries: on this controversial subject, I would like to indicate that, in contrast to what has been widely reported, the draft regulation does not aim to place a disproportionate burden upon individual anglers or on the leisure fishing industry."
"What is proposed is to subject certain recreational fisheries on certain specific stocks, namely those subject to a recovery plan, to certain basic conditions on permits and catch reporting."
"These requirements will also help to obtain information allowing the public authorities to evaluate the biological impact of such activities and, where necessary, to prepare the measures needed."
"Concerning the EP report, the Commission welcomes the fact that a definition of 'recreational fisheries' is provided for in Amendment 11, and that Parliament foresees that, where a recreational fishery is found to have a significant impact, catches should count against the quotas."
"It also welcomes the fact that the EP agrees that the marketing of catches from recreational fishing shall be prohibited except for philanthropic purposes."
"However, I would like to stress that it is important to maintain an obligation for Member States to evaluate the impact of recreational fisheries as set out in Amendment 93, and not just the possibility to do so as contemplated in Amendments 48, 49 and 50."
"The Commission, of course, wants to ensure that the final regulation adopted by the Council achieves a fair balance between, on the one hand, obtaining accurate information on the impact of recreational fisheries on recovery stocks - following a case by case analysis - and, on the other, ensuring that recreational fishers, whose catches clearly have a negligible biological impact, are not burdened with disproportionate requirements."
"Concerning sanctions and enforcement: Amendment 64 inserts a new Article 84(2a) indicating that as long as a holder of a fishing authorisation has been given 'penalty points' the holder should be excluded from receiving EU subsidies or national public aid during that time."
"The Commission cannot accept this amendment."
"In the same vein, Amendment 61 cannot be accepted."
"In fact Article 45, point 7, of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing already provides the possibility to ban offenders temporarily or permanently from access to public assistance or subsidies."
"To introduce such a rule additionally in the context of the penalty point system would be disproportionate."
"Amendment 107 deletes the minimum and maximum levels of sanctions proposed by the Commission."
"This is not acceptable, since comparable sanctions in all Member States is an important element to achieve the same degree of deterrence in all Community waters and thus create a level playing field through the establishment of a common framework at the Community level."
"The provision does not affect the discretion of Member States to determine which infringements are to be characterised as serious."
"Concerning the powers of the Commission: Amendment 71 imposes the presence of an official of a Member State during inspections carried out by the Commission, and in the same vein, Amendment 108 limits the possibility for the Commission to carry out inquiries and inspections only in cases where a Member State has been previously informed."
"The capacity of the Commission to undertake autonomous inspections would be seriously affected when officials of the Member State concerned have to be always present during inspections."
"By not providing an official, the Member State concerned could even prevent an autonomous inspection from taking place."
"Amendments 104, 108, 109 and 110 are also problematic since they restrict the competencies of Community inspectors, restrict their ability to perform autonomous verifications and autonomous inspections."
"Without such competencies for Community inspectors, the Commission cannot ensure the same quality of application of CFP rules in all Member States."
"Amendment 72 takes away the basis according to which Community financial assistance can be suspended or cancelled when there is evidence that provisions of the regulation have not been complied with."
"The Commission cannot accept this amendment."
"With this amendment the simple conclusion by the Commission that the Member State concerned has not taken adequate measures would be sufficient to take measures against that Member State."
"On the other hand, Amendments 111 and 112 limit the competence of the Commission to suspend Community financial assistance."
"This would seriously undermine the capacity of the Commission to apply this measure."
"Furthermore, the amendment does not clarify who, instead of the Commission, is supposed to take such a decision."
"Concerning the closure of fisheries: Amendment 73 limits considerably the cases in which the Commission will be able to close a fishery for failure to comply with the objectives of the common fisheries policy."
"'Evidence' of non-respect will be much harder to prove than 'reason to believe'."
"In order to ensure that the rules of the CFP are equally applied in all Member States and to avoid a particular threat to sensitive stocks, it is important that the Commission has the possibility to close a fishery when the relevant Member State fails to do so itself."
"In the same vein, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 113, which proposes to delete this article."
"Amendments 74 to 78 reduce substantially the pressure on Member States to respect national quotas."
"Acceptance of these amendments would simply mean maintaining the status quo."
"The amendments reduce substantially the possibility for the Commission to take measures to ensure that Member State fishers do not fish on a regulated stock for which the Member State has no quota or has a small quota."
"This would be particularly detrimental in cases where such fishing effectively prevents other Member States from fishing their quotas."
"Amendments 79 and 80 delete Articles 98 and 100, which give the Commission the possibility of deducting quotas and to refuse quota exchange for failure to comply with the objectives of the CFP."
"The Commission wishes to maintain this provision, which is an important instrument, to ensure the respect of the CFP rules by Member States."
"It responds to the recommendation of the Court of Auditors to reinforce the capacity of the Commission to put pressure on Member States."
"It will also help demonstrate to national fishing industries that the respect of the CFP rules by their national administrations is also in their interest, and they can be expected to exert a positive pressure on their national administrations to that effect."
"Amendment 114 proposes the deletion of Article 101 on emergency measures."
"The Commission cannot accept this amendment since this provision is an important instrument to ensure the respect of the CFP rules by the Member States."
"I would once again like to thank Mr Romeva i Rueda for the report and the committee for the attention it has given to this very important issue."
"This report is a significant contribution to a truly efficient control system."
"I would like to apologise for taking up so much time."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there is one initial, major objection that has to be raised against this proposal: that is, its total failure to consult the sector concerned."
"It is unacceptable for the Commission to continue stating that its whole fishing policy is to be based on talks with stakeholders, at the exact same time as it is drafting a regulation that is to have the most serious, immediate consequences for the fleet, when the industry is, in fact, deprived of such dialogue or prior consultation."
"This is a bad start to an attempt to establish the culture of compliance to which the Commission so often refers."
"The timing of this is also highly questionable."
"While it is true that the control policy is one of the most resounding failures of the Common Fisheries Policy, it is also true that the Commission has maintained it since 1993 and has decided to modify it just as it presents a draft report on the reform of the CFP announcing a complete review of the conservation and management system."
"Given that control is a permanent feature of any management system, it would have been much more sensible to coordinate both reforms without running the risk of the 2012 reform leaving this proposal obsolete; some of its measures are not even due to come into effect until 2012 at the earliest."
"These two major errors detract from what could have been real successes, such as the attempts to harmonise infringements and sanctions, and the objective of holding Member States definitively responsible for the clear lack of political will to apply control measures."
"Mr President, it only remains for me to thank the rapporteur for his work and say that I am sorry we have so little time to deal with such an important matter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Romeva i Rueda, who I congratulate on his openness, has the principal objective of ensuring respect for the rules of the common fisheries policy."
"Respect for these rules and a European approach to fisheries are the best way of protecting the interests of the fishing sector."
"If those involved in the sector - from the crews on board to the traders who sell the fish - do not respect the rules, they will be doomed to failure."
"The attempt to apply European rules without taking account of the diversity of European fleets will also contribute to this failure."
"That is why I suggested that the Commission's proposal should be brought more in line with the reality facing small-scale and artisanal fleets - although I wanted to go further - which basically exist throughout the European Union, particularly in the outermost regions, without ever forgetting that a common fisheries policy needs adequate control measures."
"On several occasions, as rapporteur for the fisheries budget, I have regretted the inadequate compliance with European rules."
"I have particularly demanded better control by the Member States, transparency in the results of inspections and strengthening of the Community inspection policy, provided that these are accompanied by financial support measures for the sector."
"Clearly we should have liked to have gone further, but I must congratulate the rapporteur on the proposal and the measures that he has presented, and I hope that the commissioner will give an appropriate response on this issue."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, beyond congratulating Mr Romeva i Rueda on his report, I would like to address the content in the wider context of the common fisheries policy."
"In the last 10 years I have heard many criticisms of it, including the lack of a level playing field, insufficient stakeholder involvement, inadequate balancing of economic, social and environmental imperatives and too much by way of micro-management from the centre."
"Recently, though, I have been able to assure people that the policy is undergoing significant change."
"Of course there is still a long way to go - eliminating discards, for example - and there are times when the Commission still seems to veer towards micro-management."
"I mention here Article 47 of the control regulation, at least in its original version."
"I have often said, though, that the common fisheries policy is a bit like an oil tanker: it takes a considerable time to turn round, and I do believe that the control regulation will go a long way to achieving the necessary level playing field where enforcement and sanctions are concerned, just as the development of regional advisory councils shall do much to bring improvements in other respects."
"So I would like to finish on a personal note, by expressing my appreciation of the valuable work done by members of the Fisheries Committee throughout and by thanking Commissioner Borg and his team for all that has been achieved in their five years at the helm."
"Mr President, Portugal encompasses the historically defined territory on the European continent and the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira."
"The law defines the extent and limit of its territorial waters, its exclusive economic zone, and the rights of Portugal to the adjacent seabed."
"The State will not transfer any part of the Portuguese territory or the rights of sovereignty that it holds over this."
"Article 5 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic could not be clearer."
"As a result, in accordance with and fighting to ensure respect for the provisions enshrined in Portugal's fundamental law, we tabled an amendment stating that this proposal for a regulation should respect and not threaten the competence and responsibility of Member States with regard to inspecting compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy."
"However, the amendments made by the Committee on Fisheries, although in some respects they minimise certain negative aspects of the European Commission's unacceptable proposal, do not safeguard the principles that we regard as central."
"In particular, among other worrying and inadequate aspects, it is unacceptable that the Commission should have the competence to independently carry out inspections without prior warning in the exclusive economic zones and territories of the Member States, and that it can, at its discretion, prohibit fishing activities and suspend or cancel payments of the Community financial assistance for a Member State."
"It is also unacceptable that a Member State can inspect its fishing vessels in the exclusive economic zone of any other Member State, without the latter's authorisation."
"I will end by recalling what this Parliament has itself approved: the importance of control in the management of fisheries, which is the competence of Member States."
"We hope, once again, that Parliament will not go back on its word, as has unfortunately been its custom."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I must declare an interest in this subject."
"I am a lifelong keen sea angler, as are most of my family."
"I enjoy this because it is one of the last basic freedoms that we have."
"We can go onto the beach or out in our boats, catch a few fish and take them home to eat."
"Now, for some years, recreational sea anglers have been lobbying for their sport to be included as part of the CFP."
"I have said for years, 'be careful what you wish for'."
"Well, now it has happened and it is called Article 47, and it is called this Maltese Commissioner, Joe Borg."
"There are over one million of us in Britain: we are conservation-minded; we are sensible."
"We do not need regulating, Mr Borg, by the likes of you."
"That is why we need an outright rejection of Article 47 because nothing else will do."
"If you get this power, you can come back year after year."
"We may say now that beach angling has been exempted, but once it is under the auspices of people like you, Mr Borg, you can come back next year or the year after and start to regulate it."
"As far as boat angling is concerned, the door with all of this is open for everybody being required to have licences and to report."
"Any mini-victory that we feel that we won at committee stage by changing the words 'Member States shall' to 'Member States may' start to collect this data is lost: I am afraid, with Defra back home, I feel they will take any opportunity to use EU rules to control us in any way that they can."
"Sea angling needs encouragement."
"We should be building offshore reefs."
"We should be recognising - as the Americans have done - the enormous economic impact that it can have."
"Instead, we have a common fisheries policy that has been an environmental disaster already."
"It is prejudiced against the British working fleet and it will now ruin sea angling in Britain if we give this man, and people of his ilk, power."
"So, Commissioner Borg, my advice is 'sling your hook'!"
"(FR) Mr President, thank you for SÃ¨te."
"There are indeed fisheries resources, and a new monitoring system, which we are debating this evening, but above all there are fishermen, their jobs and their livelihoods, and being a fisherman is the hardest job in the world."
"It is not that of an official or elected representative, and it shapes men who are free, but desperate today, hence the uprisings of the tuna fishermen in the Mediterranean, in SÃ¨te, in Le Grau-du-Roi, and the irate fishermen in Boulogne, in France."
"We have regulated their fishing since 1983, so for 26 years."
"However, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Rome, Articles 32 to 39 on the CAP have also related to them, and the very first Community regulation on fishing came into force in 1970."
"For 39 years we have been legislating: on the shock of the arrival of Spain in 1986, and of Denmark in 1993, on gillnets, driftnets, fishery agents, total allowable catches, quotas, aid, fleet restructuring, and modernisation."
"We legislate on sanctions, biological rest periods, stocks, discards, monitoring systems, humans, species, cod, hake, bluefin tuna, and even international agreements, and now, on recreational fishing!"
"What is more, it is still not working."
"Blue Europe is becoming greyer and greyer."
"Why?"
"Because fishing is part of the 21st-century global food challenge; it is at global level that it will have to be managed."
"Like the financial crisis, pandemics, climate change, immigration and serious crime, fish are alter-globalists."
"They respect neither borders nor Community law."
"Europe is too small to regulate fisheries resources, and, from Peru to Japan, Moscow to Dakar, Ireland and Valencia, we are going to need regulations on the global shared ownership of fisheries resources."
"That is the path, Mr President, that Brussels must also take."
"Well, after that torrent of words, Mr Stevenson has the floor."
"Mr President, you are probably aware that two fishermen, a father and son, from Northern Ireland, who fish out of Peterhead, have been jailed in Liverpool after being fined GBP 1 million and that the Assets Recovery Agency, which is an agency normally used for measures against drug dealers and gangsters, was utilised to hammer these two working fishermen, who, admittedly, were involved in landing illegal catches, which no one would condone - but to treat working fishermen, even guilty of that offence, as criminals, as gangsters, in the same way as we would treat drug dealers, is appalling."
"This proves why we definitely need some measure to introduce a level playing field as is contained in Mr Romeva i Rueda's report, because a similar offence in some parts of the EU would probably merit a fine of just EUR 2 000 or EUR 3 000."
"I want, however, to use the remainder of my time to talk about Article 47, not surprisingly, because I believe that there is a need to differentiate between the word 'shall' and the word 'may' as contained in Amendments 93, 48, 49 and 50."
"We won considerable support in committee for my amendment that contained the word 'may', but now you have informed us, Commissioner, that you would reject that in any case, so it seems we have been wasting our time."
"I do hope you will consider this again."
"If a Member State does not think it is necessary to pursue this course of action, I hope you would respect the subsidiarity principle."
"(SV) Mr President, as a eurosceptic, I often feel a certain Schadenfreude when various EU institutions come up with unreasonable and ridiculous proposals like Article 47."
"Such proposals help to undermine the unjustified respect that many citizens of EU Member States feel for the EU's efforts - efforts to transfer power from democratic Member States to a bureaucratic Brussels."
"Such proposals therefore make it easier to fight against centralisation and bureaucracy."
"At the same time, however, I take my role here in the European Parliament seriously."
"We must put a stop to this trend, and I hope that the majority of the Members of this House feel the same way."
"If not, I hope that a majority will at least fear the voters' judgment at the beginning of June and therefore realise that, in their own interests - something that they are fully aware of - they must reject this proposal."
"If the principle of subsidiarity cannot even enable the EU to keep its paws off recreational fishing in Stockholm's archipelago, then the future is bleak for the European project."
"Mr President, I would like to tell the Commissioner that I too favour 'may' and not 'shall'."
"I am a co-signatory as well."
"The whole culture of compliance with the common fisheries policy will not be established until we have equity and fairness at the centre of the inspection policy and of subsequent proceedings taken against our fishermen."
"We do need, as this regulation proposes - and as the rapporteur also says - Community-level control and compliance which the needs of this situation reflects, while leaving ultimate responsibility to Member States."
"At the moment it is appalling that fines range from EUR 600 to EUR 6 000 for similar offences in different Member States."
"There is no respect at all for the common fisheries policy, which is commonly agreed to be a flawed instrument."
"We do not need this at the centre of it."
"On Article 47, recreational fishing, I welcome the definition, which was missing in the draft proposal."
"We need a commonsense reaction."
"Yes, Member States can evaluate if there is serious impact on quotas of vulnerable stocks, but we should not let it be the rule of thumb."
"It must be the exception and not the rule."
"Please move on discards - it is immoral and totally unacceptable that we are criminalising our fishermen."
"We must not encourage by-catches, but we must not criminalise fishermen for landing them either."
"Get the balance right, please, Commissioner Borg."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, your proposal is absolutely fundamental."
"No one reading the Court of Auditors' report on the state of control over the common fisheries policy can have any doubt that this initiative by the European Commission is absolutely vital."
"However, it is also true that our rapporteur has done some absolutely exceptional work in this case, and has managed to take into account many of the specific characteristics, in particular of small-scale fisheries, and has included some of our suggestions."
"I should like to warmly congratulate him on his exemplary work."
"However, I should also like to say that I am in favour of subsidiarity."
"Yet there can be no subsidiarity in control if there is no subsidiarity in the logic of the common fisheries policy."
"That is the challenge facing the commissioner in the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"I hope that he will be very committed to and successful in meeting this challenge, which is vital to fisheries throughout Europe."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for this interesting debate."
"Clearly we are equally strongly aware of the need for a meaningful reform of our control systems."
"Let me try to touch on a number of points that have been raised, first of all with regard to the question concerning recreational fisheries."
"As I said, this is a very contentious topic, probably the most contentious of all the control provisions contained in the proposal."
"However, it has given rise to a number of misconceptions as to what the real objective and purpose of the provisions is."
"I said that we are prepared to accept the definition that is proposed in one of the amendments."
"I will be setting out clearly our position on the definition and on the proposed regulation of recreational fisheries in the coming days, including by writing directly to the anglers' representatives in order to spell out the objectives, the parameters and the details concerning recreational fisheries."
"Then, I hope, I will be receiving feedback from them and, if necessary, we will look into the provisions in order to make them more finely-tuned to the only objective that we need to target."
"We have a significant problem with recovery stock."
"There are certain recreational activities which impose big pressures on such recovery stock and we need to address this point."
"This is only fair for the professional fishermen that we address this."
"Otherwise we can never hope to turn the situation around if there is pressure from a significant fishing effort, even though it is carried out in a recreational manner and no earnings are derived from it."
"The stock cannot hope to recover if there is significant effort, as scientific reports have indicated to us."
"(Interjection from the floor: 'No science for that at all!')"
"Concerning the total lack of consultation of the sector, I think that we have consulted the industry."
"I myself took part in such a conference in Scotland some time ago."
"All RACs have submitted their opinions and, furthermore, as in any other legislation, we organised a public Internet consultation."
"The sector was specifically consulted in the framework of the Advisory Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture in the course of 2008."
"Concerning the point made on small-scale vessels, the Commission believes that the small-scale fleet can have a significant impact on resources."
"This is the reason why there is no general exemption for this fleet in the proposal."
"However, the proposal provides specific exemptions for certain categories of vessels, in general those under 10 metres, and in particular on the VMS, on log book, on prior notification and landing declarations."
"In this regard, the proposal respects the principle of proportionality."
"Financial aspects are also taken into account at the level of EU cofinancing of up to 95% of the costs for those electronic devices, to help the stakeholders to use the new technologies."
"Exemptions will be examined further within the final Presidency compromise."
"I would also like to say, with regard to the points made by Mr Guerreiro, that many of the points that he mentioned already exist in the existing control provisions."
"Therefore, were we to take up the amendments that he suggests, we would actually be moving backwards with regard to control and enforcement, rather than strengthening the provisions that need to be strengthened."
"We are seeking a level playing field in the sanctions provisions as contained in the proposed regulation."
"Obviously we are prepared to look into them further in order to see whether there needs to be further fine-tuning, but the main objective of the provisions on sanctions in the proposed regulation is to ensure that there are no significant discrepancies, such as exist today, between sanctions given by certain Member States, or by the judicial authorities of certain Member States, and sanctions that are given by the judicial authorities of other Member States."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mr Farage for his confidence shown in my staying here for a second term!"
"Mr President, I would like to use these last two minutes of time to express my thanks."
"Firstly, to the Commission, not only for the work it has carried out and the opportunity it has provided: indeed, I think it is never easy to raise an issue of this nature and this depth, but I feel it was necessary at least to begin the debate."
"It has done so boldly; naturally, there will always be those who think that the time is never right, but I believe that the debate has at least helped and will continue to help us to clarify some of the difficulties we have in achieving greater and better regulation of this sector."
"Secondly, I would like to thank the rest of the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs because, indeed, as we have seen during the debate, we have very differing points of view and we have made a considerable effort to find common positions."
"May I also acknowledge the effort everyone has made on this."
"The conclusion we have reached may not be the one that all of us had hoped for."
"Taking the margin of tolerance as an example, I agree with the Commission that 5% was sufficient."
"The 10% margin is part of our compromise because there were other Members who wished to go much further."
"We are in a similar situation as regards the possibility of extending or, in any case, postponing the period for implementing the electronic system."
"I would also like to remind us all that this will not have any additional cost, a detail that sometimes gets forgotten."
"In any case, special resources are available for this from the Commission."
"With regard to the final question of recreational fishing, perhaps the most controversial but not necessarily the most important part of this resolution, I would like to focus on one aspect: that of non-discrimination."
"If we fail to realise that we all have to play our part in sharing responsibility, it is unlikely that we will achieve the desired result."
"The compromise we reached in our negotiations was not easy, of course, but I feel that it is fairly acceptable."
"Nevertheless, our agreement did not cover the question of whether or not the study of the potential impact of recreational fishing should be carried out voluntarily or mandatorily."
"Given that some exceptions for the recreational sector are being proposed, I feel it would at least be good to see Member States commit to providing the necessary information rather than be forced to do so because, I repeat, we either share responsibility or, in the end, we will all - the recreational sector included - find ourselves affected by the lack of regulation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009."
"Conservation of fisheries resources through technical measures (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Visser, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning the conservation of fisheries resources through technical measures - C6-0282/2008 -."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for highlighting some of the main concerns raised by the Commission's proposal."
"One is the new tendency to regulate individual areas of issues that are pillars of the common policy."
"While this approach may, in theory, be understandable in the case of technical measures, we must be very careful to make sure that subsequent regional regulations are limited to aspects relating solely to the application and regulation of technical details."
"I mention this because drawing up framework regulations containing minimum measures which are then followed by different laws for individual areas is, together with an increasing tendency to turn to comitology, one of the options the Commission is prepared to take if faced with the prospect of a codecision procedure on fisheries, as the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries itself freely admits in the Green Paper on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy."
"We should also bear in mind that it is not an ordinary policy we are talking about here, but a common policy, which requires total clarity as regards what may be involved in a more or less covert handing-over of control to Member States or an excessive territorialisation of what should be common rules intended not to disrupt competition and to avoid discrimination among fleets."
"Therefore, while it may be reasonable for very local species to have their minimum size regulated by regional regulations, those cases should make up the lowest number; minimum sizes in general, like measurements of nets or criteria according to which catches can be unloaded and sold, should be universal and adopted by the Council and Parliament."
"Some of the main changes introduced by the Committee on Fisheries also move in that direction, trying to limit any application of the comitology procedure to details alone and insisting that the Council should have rules at its disposal in order to establish seasonal closures, net dimensions and measures to eliminate or reduce discards, for we understand that all Community fisheries have to be bound by certain rules that are the same for everyone."
"It should be remembered that the only truly communitised aspect of this policy that we call 'common' is access to markets, while the conservation and management policy - let us stop calling it a control policy - leaves certain room for manoeuvre that Member States generally have no qualms in using to the benefit of their fleets and to the detriment of those of others."
"We have just witnessed the Commission's strong commitment to communitising and standardising control, and it would prove difficult to understand the way in which the remaining measures serve, on the contrary, to break up and fragment that control, or the fact that different rules are created for the same activity, depending on where it is carried out."
"This jeopardises the entire credibility of the Common Fisheries Policy and its own future as such, something that should not be assumed before the 2012 reform."
"Finally, with regard to the controversial 'one net' rule, I believe that Parliament has offered the Commission a good alternative approach, indicating in which cases this may be unviable; it should, therefore, be acceptable to take more than one fishing net on board."
"Hence, I hope the Commission can show sensitivity to what are clearly major concerns for the fishing industry and our own Committee on Fisheries."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Visser, Ms Fraga and the Fisheries Committee for the draft report on the Commission's proposal for technical measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea."
"This is a very technical file and, as you are aware, technical conservation measures in the Atlantic and the North Sea originate to a large extent from existing rules."
"In Community legislation the measures are spread out in different regulations: the 1998 general technical measures regulation for the Atlantic and the North Sea; the additional technical measures regulation for the recovery of cod and hake; and the annual TAC and quota regulation, which also contains a number of technical conservation measures."
"Apart from this legal complexity, the present rules are in some cases very complicated and difficult to implement and control."
"The Commission adopted the proposal for a new Regulation on technical conservation measures for the Atlantic on 4 June of last year."
"The proposal was drafted after extensive consultation of stakeholders and Member States during 2006 and 2007."
"It groups together all the relevant rules into one single legislative act, which will therefore improve legal consistency."
"Furthermore, the proposal seeks to simplify, clarify and streamline the various rules."
"Special attention has been paid to simplifying onboard inspections and reducing the costs for fishermen."
"There are also some additional rules to reduce discards, such as the establishment of a legal framework for real-time closures, already applied in the North Sea."
"A new decision-making structure is being proposed, using a Council-level decision for the general and essential provisions and comitology for the more detailed and technical region-specific provisions, thereby avoiding micro-management at a political level."
"This new approach is not supported in your report, where Amendments 1, 6, 7, 25 and 26 call for Council regulations both for general and for detailed technical rules."
"The Commission, particularly in the framework of the CFP reform, does not want to continue with micro-management measures at a political level."
"However, taking into account the point made in the report regarding comitology, the Commission is ready to study any procedure which, while maintaining comitology for regional technical rules, will enable the raising at Council level of any matter which appears to be essential or political."
"The Commission can partially accept Amendments 2 and 3, relating to additional illustrations of fishing gears, if needed, and to certain specific market provisions, particularly on the minimum size of species, with the aim of harmonising measures."
"In line with discard policy, the Commission is proposing new rules about real-time closures and moving-on provisions for specific fisheries in order to reduce discarding practices."
"Both measures are considered to be efficient tools and, in order to reduce discards, are important in order to allow for a switch from rules dealing with landings to provisions on real catches."
"For that reason, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 4, 5, 21, 23 and 24."
"However, Amendment 20, only in so far as it calls for 'quantity' to be replaced by 'weight' to define the level of by-catch, is acceptable."
"In addition we can positively consider the second part of the amendment regarding the derogations on distance."
"The parameters of such a derogation, however, would have to be studied in some detail and will be laid out in the implementing regulation."
"The Commission, mainly for inspection purposes, intends to implement the one-net-rule provision, which should be applicable to most European fisheries."
"The Commission is ready to examine possible derogations for specific fisheries, where these are justified and well argued, and where they take into account the criteria set out in Amendment 11."
"Such derogations should be part of the regional regulations."
"The other aspects of the Commission's proposal are very technical, with many details related to the construction and use of fishing gears in the Atlantic."
"I note that the rapporteur and the Fisheries Committee also addressed the very technical elements of the proposal and suggested a number of amendments, with the intention of improving the proposal."
"However, I must express my reservations regarding Amendments 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 22."
"The technical rules proposed on the basis of scientific advice have been simplified in comparison with current legislation, and will facilitate inspection on board and reduce costs for fishermen."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 18 and 19, since the provisions proposed are already in force, subsequent to a political agreement in Council on a proposal from the Commission based on scientific advice, and no new information is available to justify any modification."
"I can support the idea set out in Amendment 27, and therefore, when introducing new technical measures, the Commission agrees to delay their entry into force so as to allow fishermen enough time to make the necessary adaptations."
"Let me again express my gratitude to the rapporteur and the Committee for their work on this proposal."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the Commission on its legislative initiative, and also our rapporteur who is represented here today by our fellow Member, Mrs Fraga."
"I believe that it was indeed vitally urgent to simplify the legislative framework in this respect."
"However, I also believe that we must go much further, particularly in two fundamental areas, the first of which is discards."
"I believe that the planned reform must, in principle, purely and simply prohibit any discards."
"Discards must be absolutely prohibited."
"Secondly, I believe that we must establish the principle of respect for stricter rules than the European ones by all vessels in regions in which the regional or national authorities understand it as such."
"These are two fundamental principles that are absent here, and I hope that these will be taken into account in the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"Mr President, I welcome these measures to encourage selective fishing practices, which minimise harm to the complex ecosystem in which the resources are found, while enabling responsible fishing to continue, and to maximise returns while minimising by-catches and subsequent discards."
"We must get to the point of banning discards as soon as possible, Commissioner."
"The variety of the fishing grounds found in the EU is part of our strength, but consequently an additional complication when producing legislation that is adequate, responsive and coherent."
"Each of the seas in Europe has its own specificity, and it is important to recognise the level of knowledge and expertise that can be provided by the stakeholders on the ground and to resist the temptation to micro-manage on an EU level."
"As this is our last debate on fisheries in this political mandate, I would like to thank you, Commissioner, and all your staff for your huge commitment and thorough knowledge of your brief and for the time and attention you always gave to the PECH Committee. You were always available for us."
"It has been much appreciated and noted and the comparison made with other Commissioners' availability."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Davis for her kind words just expressed."
"I would like to say that with regard to this regulation, as I said in my opening statement, the issue of comitology is aimed at simplifying the currently over-complex system of decision-making on very technical issues."
"However, I agree that we have to have a procedure in place that will nevertheless allow an issue to be raised at Council level should any matter appear to be of a significant or political nature."
"On the question of discards, we have already started to take measures to reduce discards, in particular within the parameters of the North Sea and of the cod recovery plan."
"We will continue and we will be coming up with further proposals, for example on the banning of high grading, in a general manner which we will be proposing for 2010, and we hope that we will be dealing with this issue holistically in the discussions on the reform of the common fisheries policy with a view, I hope, to the final result being the total elimination of discards."
"I would like myself to thank the Members of Parliament, in particular the members of the Fisheries Committee, for the constant support they have given the Commission in dealing with the sometimes intricate and politically sensitive issue of fisheries."
"Mr President, I am grateful to the commissioner for one comment he made in particular, which is that he is prepared to reconsider the Commission's position on the issue of comitology."
"I welcome the news because Parliament has clearly shown that, throughout this debate in the Committee on Fisheries, it does not agree with the Commission's keenness - also apparent in the draft Green Paper on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy - to turn to the subject of comitology excessively and with particular interest."
"In addition, the Commission justifies this in the Green Paper, alleging that proceedings may now be delayed, given the codecision procedure that Parliament is going to apply to the area of fisheries for the first time, once the Treaty of Lisbon comes into effect."
"I do not believe this to be true;"
"I feel that legislative procedures are often delayed not because of Parliament or the codecision procedure but, rather, because sometimes the Commission is also late in presenting its proposals."
"In my view, this is a matter of interest and one that should be debated."
"I understand the commissioner's point when he says that with a regulation as technical as this one, some aspects have to be decided by comitology and cannot all be dealt with by the Council."
"However, I think, Commissioner, that there is a certain difference between what you consider to be 'technical' and what we in Parliament consider to be 'technical'."
"We are more restrictive than you tend to be."
"As a final point - I do not wish to spend too long on a matter for which I am not the rapporteur - I wish to mention the one net rule."
"Commissioner, during the debates we had in the Committee on Fisheries, it became apparent that the Commission defends this principle chiefly for reasons of control."
"We all understand that the issue of control is a great deal simpler with the single net rule, but this matter also poses serious problems for certain fisheries, as you are indeed aware."
"Therefore, let us not always use the issue of control in order to be highly restrictive at times, for some decisions do not always need to be made."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009."
"Common Immigration Policy for Europe: Principles, actions and tools (short presentation)"
"The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on a Common Immigration Policy for Europe: Principles, actions and tools (2008/2331)(INI))."
"If I had to sum up my report in two lines I would say, firstly, the European Parliament is strongly in favour of a common policy on immigration, and secondly, that Parliament does not want a fragmented immigration policy anymore."
"Rather, it wants a coherent one, because only a coherent policy can be effective."
"I say this now with stronger conviction, in light of the recent case that took place these past few days, which saw the ship Pinar save 154 immigrants found in international seas."
"This case highlights the need for a common policy."
"In fact, this underscores the price that we are being forced to pay because of the lack of a sound common policy."
"What price?"
"The price being that everyone shrugs off their responsibility and places it on the shoulders of others, and while we are busy pointing fingers at each other, there are people who are drowning and dying every day in front of our very eyes."
"It is a disgrace that a country of a population 60 million uses its laws in an attempt at brushing off its responsibility onto a country with a population of less than half a million."
"I augur that this was simply an isolated case, and that the Italian minister from the Lega Nord was playing to his audience a few weeks before the European Parliament elections."
"These political gimmicks are easy to spot but this does not make them acceptable."
"I would like to laud the constructive spirit that the Maltese and Italian Prime Ministers favoured when they intervened to solve the Pinar situation."
"Thanks to their intervention, reason triumphed over dramatic antics."
"Common sense prevailed over intransigence and respect for the law reigned over the law of the jungle."
"I hope that, owing to the Pinar incident, we all come to understand that while it is easy to shrug off one's responsibility onto others and to accuse each other of wrong doing, the easy path does not lead to solutions."
"It is the path to a truly European policy that leads to a solution, even though it may be harder."
"There are six main points to my report."
"Firstly, that we must put a stop once and for all to the human tragedy that we are facing because of illegal immigration; secondly, that the burden sharing mechanism found in the immigration pact has to be implemented without delay and that it must be converted into a binding legal instrument; thirdly, greater emphasis must be placed on the return of immigrants who have no right to remain on European territory; fourthly, that every agreement concluded between the European Union and a third country must also include the issue of immigration; fifth, that the FRONTEX agency must be strengthened, not only financially, but even more importantly in resources; and finally, that we must be tougher in our battle against organised crime."
"To conclude, we managed to reach compromises on several points in this report."
"Unfortunately there is still one pending point that was entered due to a majority formed within the Socialist Group on the immigrants' right to vote."
"This was not something I could accept."
"Therefore, I have presented an alternative resolution to the report; that is, to substitute the reference to the right to vote with a compromise that comprises a re-wording."
"On behalf of the European Commission, I would like to congratulate Mr Busuttil on the important report he has drawn up."
"This report discussed a central issue that is tied to the continuous development of the European Union; that is, a common immigration policy."
"As the report indicated, the Immigration Pact adopted by the European Council last year served as a launching point towards a common policy in the field of asylum and immigration."
"We must now ensure that the commitments stipulated in this Pact are implemented."
"Next month, the Commission will propose means by which the implementation of this Pact can be monitored."
"This will take place through an annual report that will be issued by the Commission."
"These reports will serve as the basis for the annual debate within the European Council on the immigration and asylum policy as of the year 2010."
"The definition of the general aims for the common policy as established in this Pact shall also be included in the multiannual programme, that is the Stockholm Programme that is due to be adopted later this year under the Swedish Presidency."
"The Busuttil report provides the Commission with extremely useful information which will help it to make its planned contribution in the form of a communication, which should be adopted by this summer."
"I would like to underline the general convergence of our ideas."
"In various parts the Busuttil report urges the Commission to take action."
"Here I would like to reply by saying that the Commission has already actively committed itself."
"Examples of this can be seen in the development of facilities for temporary and circular immigration, the improvements made in the area of data collection and analysis, the dissemination of information both on the realistic opportunities available to immigrants and the risks involved in illegal immigration, and also in the area of cooperation with third countries."
"I would like to refer to a particular area where Mr Busuttil voiced his concern, which is solidarity between Member States on immigration issues."
"As the rapporteur stressed in his speech, the recent events that took place in the Mediterranean have once again accentuated the problems and the serious pressures that certain Member States are facing."
"I would like to assure you, Mr Busuttil, that the Commission is fully committed to finding solutions to help these Member States that are experiencing particularly intense immigration pressures."
"Here I would like to mention three examples of measures that have either already been taken or are due to be taken in this regard."
"The Dublin Regulation shall be amended in such a way as to allow the suspension of transfers to those Member States that are undergoing particular pressure."
"The European Asylum Support Office is going to be set up in order to provide support to these same Member States, and funding will be made available to the Member States aiming at internal and voluntary redistribution of immigrants."
"The item is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"The European Commission estimates that by 2050 the EU will need 60 million workers from third countries at a time when the working population will be declining at an accelerated rate."
"Consequently, in the long term, the Lisbon Strategy's ambitious objectives are subject to the contribution of labour from outside the EU."
"However, at the moment, during the economic crisis, the unemployment rate is seeing a significant rise, with many cross-border workers from the new Member States featuring among those affected by job losses."
"As a result, it is vital to link immigration and employment policies in order to achieve a fair and practical position, while observing the Community preference principle."
"I feel that it is wrong for us to grant immigrants the right to move around inside the EU, while Romanians and Bulgarians do not enjoy complete freedom of movement in the European labour market."
"It is immoral and dangerous for us to encourage the brain drain from developing countries without taking into account the risk of the boomerang effect and without showing any concern for the discrimination taking place, whereby the majority of immigrants are offered jobs below their level of qualifications, especially women, making them all victims of the negative stereotypes and practices in the country of origin and of those in EU Member States."
"According to Eurostat, population ageing in the EU will become a reality in the medium term."
"Immigration could act as an important stimulus to ensure good economic performance in the EU."
"Against this backdrop, we must recognise the essential nature of immigration to the EU."
"Illegal work needs to be tackled given that it fundamentally violates the rights of migrant workers."
"We must promote a European policy which encourages illegally resident migrant workers to register with the authorities, whilst ensuring that this does not lead to summary procedures of return in violation of their rights."
"These workers are already in a position of inferiority when they arrive in Europe and it is clear that proper management of migratory flows can benefit the EU and third countries simultaneously."
"We must combat the wastage of skills that is being seen repeatedly among migrant workers. These workers, notably women, often end up in jobs for which they are over-qualified."
"I feel that the Commission must pay particular attention to the question of skills recognition and the incentive for lifelong training, while also ensuring that immigrants have opportunities to learn the language of the host country in order to ensure their social, professional and cultural integration in the European Union."
"Migration to Europe is a phenomenon which has been going on constantly for a long time, and is fostered by factors such as significant material differences in standard of living between Europe and other regions of the world."
"Europe definitely needs a common approach to immigration in the EU."
"The failure of one Member State to act may have a direct influence on other States."
"Bad management of migration may have serious consequences for the countries of origin and for the immigrants themselves."
"We should be aware that legal immigration is a beneficial phenomenon which brings opportunities to many different groups."
"Migrants have played a very significant role in the development of the European Union in recent decades, and the EU still needs their work."
"In connection with this a common political vision is necessary, which is based on past achievements and also has reference to the future."
"To achieve that objective, more effective cooperation is needed."
"There are many people who risk their lives or their health to cross the new southern and eastern borders of the EU in particular."
"Thousands of them die at sea, while they are looking for a better life."
"Immigration is one of the most serious challenges which Europe currently faces, and how we respond to it depends on us."
"We can turn it into an opportunity, or we can do harm to many people by handling it wrongly."
"Based on the fact that Europe is the main destination for immigrants, harmonising the immigration legislative framework must be among the EU's priorities."
"If we Europeans are not going to take measures now to promote a common immigration policy, we will suffer the consequences later of not having done it on time."
"I can envisage the scenario of thousands of illegal immigrants losing their lives at sea."
"I think that it is our duty to prevent the loss of human life."
"In this respect, we must totally commit to active cooperation with the countries where the illegal immigrants come from."
"I believe that a common European immigration policy must prove to be a policy supporting solidarity with Member States located at the EU's borders, which suffer large influxes of immigrants."
"I support the view that the battle against illegal immigration can only be waged through promoting controlled legal immigration."
"Every Member State must individually make firm commitments to create favourable conditions for legal immigration."
"I welcome this report, which has turned out to be fairly ambitious, and I hope that it will get through with flying colours during the plenary session vote."
"Control of the budgetary implementation of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (short presentation)"
"The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on Control of the Budgetary Implementation of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) in 2007."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to reiterate that the instrument for pre-accession assistance is the Union's new financing instrument for granting pre-accession assistance for the period 2007-2013 and replaces the previous programmes for candidate and potential candidate countries, namely the PHARE, CARDS, ISPA and other programmes."
"The new instrument includes five components which cover the priorities defined in accordance with the needs of the beneficiary country, namely transition assistance and institution building, cross-border cooperation, regional development, human resources development and rural development."
"This report by Parliament is the first examination of the application of this new instrument and has a twofold objective:"
"firstly, to bring the project financed more closely into line with pre-accession priorities, especially for the environment, gender equality, nuclear safety and increased employment;"
"secondly, to avoid the mistakes of the past, such as those belatedly identified in the application of the PHARE, SAPARD and ISPA programmes in Bulgaria and Romania."
"We believe that this can be better achieved if Parliament closely monitors the application of the new instrument from the outset, which is why we called for this own-initiative report."
"Parliament expresses its satisfaction in this motion for a resolution at the high implementation rate of IPA commitments in 2007 and its regret at the considerable delays both in approving the relevant regulations and implementing the programmes which started in 2008."
"We would also point out that the objective of parliamentary control of pre-accession assistance is not only to examine if the funds available were used legitimately, but also to evaluate if they were actually allocated to accession priorities and if the desired results were achieved."
"We call in our report for a better balance between projects earmarked for meeting political criteria and projects earmarked for bringing the country into line with the Community acquis and we call for horizontal and regional programmes to be strengthened."
"We also call for particular emphasis to be placed on combating corruption, organised crime and unemployment, especially unemployment among young people."
"We call for more funds to strengthen women's rights and equal opportunities in general."
"We also call for cross-border cooperation to be strengthened, in order to promote reconciliation and good neighbourly relations between beneficiary countries and between them and the Member States of the European Union to a greater degree."
"To close, we consider that the instrument for pre-accession assistance is a rational and flexible mechanism for optimising financial assistance to candidate and potential candidate countries."
"However, in order to get the maximum return, it needs to remain firmly in line with accession priorities and the social and political conditions peculiar to each country."
"For this reason, Parliament hopes to play a fundamental role in the application and adaptation of this instrument."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, on behalf of the Commission I would like to thank Parliament for giving us the opportunity to comment on the report on the control of budgetary implementation of the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) for 2007, and to extend our thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, for the very valuable report that she initiated and prepared."
"We can, overall, concur with the findings and recommendations of the report, which are fully in line with the views of the Commission on how best to use financial assistance for the Western Balkans and for Turkey."
"The Commission acknowledges the late launch of IPA 2007 programmes because of the late adoption of the legal framework for IPA."
"I can assure you, however, that the Commission made all efforts to limit the delay of implementation on the ground, and that preparation of management structures and detailed project design were pushed ahead all through 2008."
"Within this framework the Commission will ensure that the impact of IPA will become visible in the beneficiary countries."
"Allow me to elaborate on some of the issues raised in the report."
"As regards the balance between political criteria and transposition of the acquis communautaire, the Commission has already increased the allocations for projects in the area of the political criteria in IPA 2008 in all countries, and will continue to do so gradually."
"However, in the face of the current financial crisis, we will also need to strike an appropriate balance in the 2009 and 2010 programmes between continued support for political reforms and financial assistance to help the countries mitigate the consequences of the economic downturn."
"In this regard the report rightly identifies the challenges generated by the financial crisis and the need for an EC response."
"To that end, the Commission has put together an IPA crisis response package of about EUR 250 million at the end of 2008 with the aim of leveraging some EUR 600 million in loans from international financial institutions."
"Measures will focus on support to private sector SMEs, energy efficiency investments, and support to investments and infrastructure under national IPA programmes in close coordination with international financial institutions."
"The Commission also fully concurs with the need to establish the decentralised management system as a step to promoting ownership and responsibility of candidate countries and potential candidates."
"Guidance and assistance is being given to them in order for these countries to build the required public management structures and public financial control systems."
"According to the principles of IPA, environmental protection, good governance, civil society development, gender equality and non-discrimination are all cross-cutting issues and are an integral part of project design."
"Civil society organisations are now more actively involved in the development and the initiation of projects."
"In 2008 the Commission launched the civil society facility as a tool for promoting civil society development and advancement of regional cooperation, for which an indicative budget of EUR 130 million is earmarked for 2008-2010."
"The Commission also shares the rapporteur's views as regards the importance of education, regional and cross-border cooperation and gender equality, to name but a few issues."
"The services of the Commission have fully taken on board the recommendations of Parliament and we look forward to reviewing progress with you during our regular rendezvous where we have the opportunity to discuss the financial assistance strategies and their implementation."
"This will allow the further enhancement of the ongoing dialogue between our respective institutions."
"The item is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009."
"Effective enforcement of judgments in the EU: the transparency of debtors' assets (short presentation)"
"The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Gill, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the effective enforcement of judgments in the European Union: the transparency of debtors' assets (2008/2233)(INI))."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, behind the Commission consultative paper on debtors' assets is the concern that late payment and non-payment of debts jeopardise the interests of businesses and consumers."
"This is particularly the case when the creditor and the enforcement authorities have no information about the debtor's whereabouts or his or her assets."
"The problem can be resolved where the debtor has assets in the EU and it is possible to trace them and bring legal proceedings."
"The Commission, in its report, suggested drawing up a manual of national enforcement laws and practices and highlighted the possibility of increasing access to population registers."
"It also raised questions on whether enforcement authorities should be given better access to social security and tax registers."
"The proposal suggested that the cooperation between public enforcement bodies might be improved and, lastly, it put forward the idea of a European assets declaration, which would oblige debtors to disclose all their assets in the European judicial area, possibly backed by sanctions."
"My report, as voted by the committee, suggested that creditors would benefit from the introduction of a simpler, more flexible procedure, effective throughout the EU, to obtain an order to disclose information about assets which may then be made the subject of a judgement."
"Such measures could take the form of an interim payment order, giving the creditor immediate payment pending resolution of the underlying dispute."
"The report also calls for a study into how the present national systems work, with a comparison between common-law countries, such as Britain, and other European jurisdictions, and how existing arrangements could be improved."
"It also highlights the need to consider areas in which further cooperation with Member States could have a positive effect and how the proposals will work alongside existing data protection and human rights legislation."
"We have endeavoured to shape the report along these lines and the compromises arrived at by the committee have already ironed out some of the discrepancies between Member States' legal systems."
"Many of the additions we have made are designed to make the proposal more transparent and easier to use for the creditor."
"It will therefore be imperative to ensure that the proposed manual of national enforcement laws and practices is kept updated and that the information is provided in easy-to-use format and that it should be written in an accessible language."
"It will also be crucial for the initiative to act in tandem with - rather than replacing the work of - national courts."
"This will require the legislation to be restricted only to cross-border cases."
"By bearing this caveat in mind, the enforcement of this legislation will made to work efficiently and proactively."
"Overall the report will do much to help small businesses and enterprising individuals to overcome a significant obstacle to their success because they lack the resources of large enterprises to track down debtors and bring legal action against them."
"Small businesses are affected disproportionately by people defaulting on payments."
"If companies are thereby discouraged from trading abroad, this represents a real threat to the very functioning of the common market."
"It will be vital to protect the activities of small businesses at this difficult time because SMEs make up a large proportion of our economy."
"I would like to thank the Legal Affairs Committee secretariat and to praise the excellent support they have given me on this report."
"Thanks must also go to colleagues from other groups who have made very constructive suggestions."
"What is key, I believe, is for this legislation to be brought forward as soon as possible."
"I call on the Commission to act on Parliament's recommendations with urgency."
"Much of the good work that the Member States have been doing in responding to the market downturn has to be focused for large-scale enterprises."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to discuss Parliament's concerns regarding the issue of debt recovery abroad."
"I would also like to thank Ms Gill for the report."
"What is at stake?"
"Both Parliament and the Commission agree that the problems of cross-border debt recovery may constitute a serious obstacle to the free circulation of payment orders within the European Union and may impede access to justice."
"Furthermore, this is key for the survival of small businesses in the current economic climate."
"Against this background and in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, what should be the Community objectives?"
"The European Union has an impressive set of legal measures to ensure access to justice in cross-border cases and to facilitate the free circulation of civil and commercial decisions within the Union."
"However, there is no doubt - as stated in the Hague programme on mutual recognition adopted by the European Council - that it would in fact be much easier to enforce judgments within the European Union if it were possible to obtain accurate information on debtors' financial positions."
"The Commission published a green paper on the transparency of debtors' assets in March 2008, and all the replies - including a summary - can now be accessed by consulting the public web site."
"Most of the respondents agreed with the need for measures at Community level to increase the transparency of debtors' assets, though views differ as to what can be done in practice."
"I am grateful to Parliament for presenting such a detailed response to the green paper."
"The report is rather sceptical of the ideas put forward in the green paper, believing that the main problem is that of recalcitrant debtors who are unscrupulous."
"The report is also very concerned about the data-protection/privacy issues related to obtaining information about people's financial situation."
"The Commission is also committed to protecting privacy and the personal data of citizens."
"The report instead calls for the adoption of national directories of foreign lawyers working in other Member States as a way to help creditors and suggests a Community provisional measure."
"I would like to inform Parliament that improving the practical enforcement of judgments will be a high priority of the Commission in the future Stockholm programme in the area of justice, freedom and security for the period 2010-2014 that the Commission will present in 2009."
"However, the Commission has not yet programmed any specific legislative measure in terms of follow-up to its green paper."
"Finally, in the light of the first results of the consultation, the Commission believes that this proposal - that is, to draw up a manual of national enforcement laws, to increase access to commercial and public registers, to improve cooperation between enforcement authorities and to create a compulsory assets declaration by the debtor - will go some way towards fulfilling our objectives."
"In this respect, of course, careful consideration will be given by the Commission to Parliament's resolution on the different issues incorporated in this report."
"The item is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009."
"Annual report on the deliberations of the Petitions Committee 2008 (short presentation)"
"The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs McGuinness, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the year 2008."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, by its very nature this report contains a great deal of statistics."
"You can look at, read and analyse those, but obviously the work of the committee throughout the last 12 months is there on view."
"This committee that I sit on is a peculiar committee of Parliament."
"It has very direct links with citizens and it deals with problems raised by individuals and groups."
"Yes, people come to this committee with problems that we very often cannot solve, but at least they have a port to call on and, where cases are inadmissible, we try to redirect."
"We deal with many, many problems from across Member States but, as the statistics show, some countries use the services of the committee more widely than others, perhaps because there are members of the committee who are from those countries and therefore they attract problems from their constituents."
"I am always fascinated by the reality, particularly in an Irish context, that sometimes people complain that Europe is too powerful and yet, when they have a problem and turn to Europe for help, they sometimes complain that Europe is not powerful enough."
"I think that is quite significant."
"The Petitions Committee works, in my view, on the basis of 'soft power' and I think the work of the last 12 months has been about trying to influence Member States who are not implementing legislation in the manner that they should to change their ways."
"But we can only work by virtue of the people who come to us with problems and address them and their particular needs."
"I want to talk about some of the issues we dealt with, not in detail but just to give a flavour."
"Obviously, the environment is the major area where complaints come to us from citizens of the European Union."
"Some of the major ones relate to water quality."
"The Baltic Sea issue was a very contentious one dealt with by the committee in harmony with other committees of the Parliament."
"Property rights are a very major concern for citizens and one that I fear will become increasingly so, if I judge by the complaints coming into my own constituency office from citizens who have purchased properties across Member States of the European Union."
"Our powers in this regard are limited but this does not mean that we cannot speak on these matters and try and make improvements."
"In relation to business directories - where companies, individuals, schools, have been trapped into paying money to companies that publish names and then require payment, where people initially did not believe payment was necessary, or indeed required, or worse still, where people did not want the service at all - we are still inundated by individuals who are trapped and feel powerless to resist the pressures of these unscrupulous business directory companies."
"We have called for the Commission to take action in this regard."
"We also stress in this report that we are concerned about the lack of progress on Equitable Life, on which the Petitions Committee did some work in 2007 and on which I chaired the Committee of Inquiry."
"We would urge the UK authorities to take on board all of our recommendations: apologise, yes, but also compensate those who were so severely affected."
"In my final few seconds, let me talk about the committee itself and the procedures under which we work."
"We would rather only admissible petitions came our way and we need to work very hard with citizens so that they know what we can and cannot deal with."
"I want the timeframe in which complaints are dealt with to be improved as we go forward."
"As one who has served on this committee in this parliamentary term, I believe that, because it deals directly with citizens, it has a great role to play in reducing what I discussed in a school in Ireland yesterday, the so-called democratic deficit."
"At least people come here to the Parliament and they are heard and listened to."
"I think that is extremely important."
"As we move to another year, let me thank the secretariat of the committee, the group staff and my own staff for their assistance in this report."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to express my appreciation for the work of Mrs McGuinness on this report, which I know she did in difficult circumstances."
"She has succeeded in illustrating the great variety of the work of the Committee on Petitions and I would like to reconfirm, as I have no doubt she expects, the Commission's willingness to cooperate in all ways we can with the work of the committee."
"I would just like to pick up on two of the points she makes in the brief presentation of the report."
"Mrs McGuinness, first of all you underline the importance of direct contact between Parliament and the everyday, very real concerns of citizens who petition you."
"I agree, and I should know."
"You have dealt with nearly a hundred petitions coming from Malta since 2004, which is a rather high rate when taken pro rata to the population."
"Some of these petitions are common to many other Member States as well, but many were quite specific to Malta."
"This demonstrates the useful direct contact with the citizen that the committee provides."
"In addition it is also true to say that a good collaboration with the national authorities and the organisation of fact-finding missions are definitely useful ingredients for your work."
"Besides agreeing on the importance of working directly with citizens, the second thing I would like to pick up on is the general issue of fundamental rights."
"They crop up in many places in your report, whether about nationality and related rights, individual and family rights or the right of property, and as you know it very often happens that people who petition Parliament about their fundamental rights end up being disappointed."
"This is because such rights, more often than not, turn out to be outside the scope of Community law, as you have just rightly pointed out."
"To use your own words, there is a lot to be done to separate the wheat from the chaff, those concerns which we can work on and those on which we cannot."
"My wish, my very sincere wish, is that your report will help people to see this clearly and realistically."
"With these two comments, which I am sure will be taken in the spirit in which they are intended, I would just like to say that I wish the rapporteur every success and thank her again for this report."
"The item is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009."
"Gender mainstreaming in the work of committees and delegations (short presentation)"
"The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on gender mainstreaming in the work of its committee and delegations."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"In recent years women's dignity and calling have taken on a new dimension."
"This is particularly noticeable within the framework of Community horizontal policies defined in the Lisbon Strategy, demographic challenges and efforts to achieve a work-life balance, as well as moves to combat violence against women and people trafficking."
"The report on gender mainstreaming in the work of committees and delegations is one of the regular reports of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality which I have had the honour to present to Parliament on two occasions during the legislative period."
"Although some people welcome the growing presence of women in the European Parliament, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality deplores the fact that women are still insufficiently represented in the senior functional bodies of the Parliament."
"At the general directorate level the representation of women is still insufficient."
"We support the creation of networks of officials in secretariats, committees and delegations specially trained in this issue, with the aim of regularly exchanging tried and tested procedures."
"The report calls on the general secretariat to continue implementing an integrated work-life strategy and to facilitate the career progress of women officials."
"The report emphasises that gender mainstreaming is a positive development both for women and for men and that the requirement for gender equality must make itself felt through a practical approach which does not pit women and men against each other."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality stresses the need for committees and delegations to have suitable instruments at their disposal for ensuring maximum awareness of gender mainstreaming."
"We need indicators, data and statistics grouped according to gender, and we also need budgetary resources to be allocated from a gender equality perspective."
"We call on political groups to take account of gender balance when nominating persons to senior roles."
"The gender mainstreaming report is the result of cooperation between parliamentary committees and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"As Chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and rapporteur I would like to thank you sincerely for this work."
"I would especially like to thank my fellow Members on the various committees who were responsible for this work."
"The work has been unanimously adopted in committee and I value that highly."
"The committee has created a new methodological model which makes it possible to evaluate the work of every parliamentary committee."
"The model is described in detail in the explanatory statement."
"The evaluation would certainly have greater evidential value if all of the committees and delegations of the European Parliament had responded."
"Within the framework of the discussions a number of amendment proposals were adopted, increasing the significance of the report."
"I value the fact that the report was created through pluralistic parliamentary discussions and has stressed the importance of this topic."
"In the context of the European elections I would like to stress the importance of voters of both genders making an effort to ensure that women are represented at the European Parliament in the greatest possible numbers."
"Women are in the majority, this evening, in Parliament, in the Chamber. I should just like to point that out."
"The item is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"We welcome the fact that some progress has been made with regard to achieving a balanced representation among the administrator and assistant positions at committee secretariat level."
"We hope that similar measures will be adopted too in relation to senior posts within the political groups and especially at political function level in Parliament."
"We cannot but fail to note, however, that these changes are only a minor aspect of what is required by gender mainstreaming."
"The application of gender mainstreaming would mean that every piece of legislation is accompanied by a preliminary gender-specific impact study."
"Similarly, awareness of gender issues and a minimum level of expertise would be required in every committee."
"The reality shows us that during the 2004-2009 parliamentary term, not a single piece of legislation submitted by a committee was rejected for not including this impact study, even though its inclusion would be mandatory since the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Unfortunately, we must acknowledge that minor positive results have been achieved and that the objective of gender equality is still far off."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ on her report, which highlights the fact that, although some of the European Parliament's committees have adopted a strategy for promoting gender equality, there are also still obvious deficiencies when it comes to the consistent application of this principle."
"This report also makes a number of forward-looking recommendations."
"One such proposal, for instance, is the initiative for officials working in the European Parliament to attend equal opportunity training, since appropriate knowledge is indispensable when putting this principle into practice."
"Gender equality is one of the basic principles of Community law."
"However, the European Parliament can only retain its credibility in the eyes of the public if it insists on the introduction and total implementation of measures promoting gender equality within this institution too, especially with regard to its committees and delegations."
"With this aim in mind, we must devise a strategy which sets out concrete objectives for actively promoting equal opportunities and in relation to gender mainstreaming."
"The regrettable fact is that practically no progress has been made since the report drafted by Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ on the same topic in 2007."
"We hope that this latest position statement will yield more results."
"Women represent 52% of the European population."
"The task of women who are active in politics is to convince female voters in particular that the participation of women in European politics is important for future generations and for the proper functioning of democratic systems."
"I firmly believe that the representation of women in politics should not be based on the introduction of mandatory quotas, which would establish minimum numbers of female candidates, but on the ability of female politicians to seek, adopt and promote the kind of issues that will help women to solve their actual problems."
"As a member of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality I have spoken in the European Parliament many times about the suggestions I receive in meetings with women."
"In particular I regard the inclusion of child-rearing in the calculation of pensions and the provision of more crÃ¨ches and nursery schools as key to achieving a work-life balance."
"I firmly believe that a politician who acts on the basis of her personal experience of motherhood and family life will best understand women's problems."
"The report by Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ on gender mainstreaming in the work of committees and delegations testifies to the fact that the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is working exceptionally actively in the European Parliament."
"It has adopted many reports and opinions which deserve more attention from the other committees in Parliament."
"For this reason too the numbers of women MEPs should increase a one third to a half."
"Nowadays, there is an ever-increasing number of women becoming involved in politics and making major decisions in companies."
"In 2006, 32.6% of managers in the EU were women."
"The percentage of women in the European Parliament rose from 16.3% in 1979, when the first European elections took place, to 31% in 2009."
"However, it still seems necessary to adopt and apply a gender mainstreaming strategy incorporating specific targets in all Community policies which come under the remit of parliamentary committees and delegations."
"I support the need for the parliamentary committees and delegations to have at their disposal appropriate means for gaining a sound understanding of gender mainstreaming, including indicators, data and statistics broken down by gender, and for budgetary resources to be allocated with a view to ensuring gender equality."
"All these options must encourage the continual exchange of good practice, with the aim of implementing the integrated strategy for combining family life and work life and facilitating the career development of female employees."
"As a social-democrat, I believe that this is an excellent initiative for transferring to national parliaments the positive model offered by the EP on gender equality (11% of the members of the Romanian parliament are women)."
"Green Paper on the future of TEN-T policy (short presentation)"
"The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Lichtenberger, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the Green Paper on the future TEN-T policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for remaining here for this topic, which is actually a lot more important than it would seem from the number of Members present in the House."
"It relates to the revision of transport policy in respect of the trans-European networks."
"Firstly, allow me to extend my thanks to my colleagues who have contributed to this, in particular the Commission and the secretariat, which provided excellent support."
"The trans-European networks have a long history."
"For 15 years, projects were presented, lists discussed and decisions deferred."
"This was and is a reason to look more closely at the whole story, to revise it and to see to what extent the goals have been or can be achieved."
"The trans-European networks have not always been successful."
"That - as so often in the European Union - is partly down to funding, and in particular to the lack of funding in Member States which still have the unfortunate habit of demanding a lot of support from the European Union."
"However, when it comes to payments to the European Union budget, the sack is then firmly drawn shut and very little is given out."
"Well, since nothing comes from nothing, many projects did not get off the ground, and we need to look at this more closely once again, particularly in light of the more recent challenges that we are facing with regard to European transport policy as a whole."
"On the one hand, we are facing new challenges brought about by climate change, and we must respond to these challenges."
"The question of sustainability with regard to transport and the question of damage to the climate caused by certain means of transport must be asked anew again and again and must also be reflected in the actions of the Member States and the European Union."
"The second point that we, of course, need to deal with very decisively is the current financial crisis, which under certain circumstances will restrict still further the ability of some Member States to take action with regard to infrastructures and the associated investments that are needed."
"However, enlargement has brought us completely new tasks to do in Europe that did not exist when decisions were taken on the list of trans-European networks."
"Therefore, after long discussions in committee, the decision was taken in favour of an approach that is intended to address these issues in particular."
"Firstly, the various modes of transport should be networked considerably better than they have been up to now."
"This has been ignored in the past."
"This affects ports and the hinterland in particular, which have been neglected in recent years and now form the main focus of this report."
"However, this also requires the development of a core network and the network connections on which the whole system is based and with which the whole system is connected, allowing sound development in the transport sector and the continual improvement of its management."
"We need not only a geographical network, but also a conceptual network between the modes of transport, better intermodal links and better technical work being carried out on the networks."
"This relates to software rather than hardware."
"This is the core of our report and I hope that we can agree on this resolution, which has broad support, and that we do not take a retrograde step, as currently indicated in an alternative resolution."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, since the trans-European transport network policy was established 15 years ago, it has contributed significantly to the functioning of the internal market and to economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"It now needs to be adjusted to new challenges."
"The green paper on the TEN-T policy review addresses these challenges and proposes measures to tackle them at both the network planning and the project implementation stages."
"The Commission appreciates very much that the European Parliament is following this revision process from the outset, as reflected in this resolution."
"This underlines the determination of both institutions to develop a future-oriented TEN-T policy."
"There is a high degree of conformity between our proposals and the objectives and calls set out in Ms Lichtenberger's report as adopted by the Committee on Transport: that is, a more integrated and coherent network approach is necessary, in which intermodal connections such as rail connections to ports and airports and intermodal terminals, the link between long-distance and urban transport systems as well as interoperability must be strengthened so as to improve the basis for efficient, safe and high-quality services for passengers and for freight transport."
"The Commission also shares the view set out in the report that - in particular in the freight sector - it is vital to facilitate co-modal chains in which waterborne and rail transport play an important role and intelligent transport systems help to optimise infrastructure use."
"In the draft report, the Transport Committee has chosen option three, a dual layer consisting of a core and a comprehensive network."
"By supporting this option, Parliament confirms the need to combine traditional transport infrastructure policy with an appropriate consideration of new conditions and circumstances; the need for more flexibility and responsiveness to changing situations and more openness for the identification and support of infrastructure measures resulting for transport service requirements; and the economic and environmental challenge to promote a coordinated improvement of transport corridors through a series of small infrastructures and ITS projects."
"We note that, after the vote on the draft report by the Transport Committee, an alternative resolution has been proposed which supports option two, a single-layer network with priority projects or a priority network only, and therefore without a comprehensive network."
"This is, as we see it, in contradiction with some other points of the draft resolution."
"I would also like to recall on this occasion the advantages and disadvantages of the comprehensive network."
"While being too large to allow for clear priority-setting and the focus of Community instruments to stimulate its implementation, it contributes to ensuring the TEN-T access function and to facilitating cohesion."
"It has also proved to be vital as a reference framework for various transport policy actions and legislation: in particular, interoperability in the railway sector and road safety."
"Elimination of the comprehensive network would therefore have some perverse effects."
"On the network implementation side, we fully agree with the view set out in the report that Member States have a crucial role in deciding, planning and financing transport infrastructure."
"Sufficient financial resources are needed under the TEN-T budget and coordination of territorial development objectives and TEN-T policy need to be enforced, whereas public/private partnerships have to be further promoted."
"The Commission also underlines that TEN-T investment is key to sustainable economic development and thus is an essential way of helping to overcome the current crisis."
"To conclude, we are very grateful for the motion for a resolution on the future of the trans-European transport networks policy."
"We would like to thank the Transport Committee for its constructive debate on it, and in particular Ms Lichtenberger for her comprehensive work."
"It will constitute a valuable contribution to the next steps of the process in the debates with the other institutions."
"The item is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"As the current term of the European Parliament draws to a close, we have the opportunity to comment on the changes in approach to the Community's biggest infrastructure project, the trans-European Transport Network, which are being planned by the Commission for the near future."
"Currently, sections of the network are being built in Member States."
"The logical continuation of this, which will also be the final stage, is the integration of individual components in different countries into a cohesive whole to create a trans-European system."
"The geography of the European Union is changing."
"Therefore, the need to introduce changes to the alignment maps of the network appears justified."
"In connection with this the financial needs of the investment are changing."
"The final stage of integrating the network should place greater emphasis on the financing of its cross-border elements."
"Raising the quality of existing transport connections in Europe and building new ones will help reduce road accidents, which is our constant priority in the fight for better mobility for EU citizens."
"In addition, introducing all forms of technological innovation, and the recent popularisation of intelligent transport systems, is justified by European infrastructure priorities for the 21st century."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"All that remains is for me to thank our members of the public, who are few in numbers but attentive, for their presence."
"It also remains for me to close what is surely my last evening sitting as president."

"Credit Rating Agencies - Reporting and documentation requirements in the case of merger and divisions - Insurance and reinsurance (Solvency II) (recast) (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Mr GauzÃ¨s, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Credit Rating Agencies - C6-0397/2008 -,"
"the report by Mrs Weber, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directives 77/91/EEC, 78/855/EEC and 82/891/EEC and Directive 2005/56/EC as regards reporting and documentation requirements in the case of merger and divisions - C6-0330/2008 -, and"
"the report by Mr Skinner, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (recast) - C6-0231/2007 -."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on rating agencies with which I have been entrusted has been particularly interesting to draft, and I am delighted, above all, that we have been able to reach an agreement with the Council and with the Commission so that this report has a chance of being adopted at first reading."
"Analysing the various causes of the financial crisis has shown that there was an urgent need to enact legislation on rating agencies."
"The proposal for a regulation submitted by the Commission has been examined very carefully by Parliament in order to ensure that European legislation is at once exemplary, effective and pragmatic."
"The recent conclusions of the G20 have further strengthened this determination."
"The compromise reached by the Commission, the EU Presidency and Parliament adheres to the guidelines sought by Parliament on the essential points of this regulation: the scope, the ratings of third countries, and the prevention of conflicts of interest."
"Above all, however, I am delighted that this text has been able to lay the foundations for European supervision in the spirit of the findings of the de LarosiÃ¨re group's report."
"Indeed, Parliament has kept to the idea that the CESR should be the single point of entry for the registration of agencies."
"We knew that, given the current state of the law, there was not much more that could be done, but by acting in this way we have laid the foundations for this future European supervision."
"Over the coming months the Commission will propose a legislative initiative that will enable the guidelines of the de LarosiÃ¨re report to be implemented, so as to create European supervision that is effective and coordinated."
"As a stop-gap measure, and in anticipation of the Commission's legislative initiative, the regulation will be overseen under the coordination of the CESR by a college made up of representatives of the competent authorities of the Member States, the legal force of the decisions being guaranteed by the competent authority of the place in which the agency is registered."
"I should like today to point out how appreciative Parliament was, during the second stage of negotiations, of the very constructive and very cooperative attitude of the Czech Presidency."
"This has meant that, through intelligent discussion, we have been able to develop a number of rules that should make it possible to guarantee this necessary transparency and to remedy the problems and the shortcomings that have resulted from the absence of legislation on rating agencies."
"This result is therefore most satisfactory, and for this reason a global amendment reproducing the text on which the Commission, Parliament and the Czech Presidency - that is to say the Member States - have come to an agreement will be presented tomorrow to Parliament."
"I believe that in this way the European Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency will have proved that, when faced with a crisis on an unprecedented scale, the European institutions were very resourceful."
"I hope that, in the same spirit, we will be able to adopt the other provisions of this financial package, and in particular the recast of the Directive on the capital requirements of banks, also referred to as Basel II."
"During this period in which Europeans are questioning Europe's effectiveness, it seems vital to me that we be able to prove that Europe is capable of tackling the crisis."
"rapporteur. - (RO) I believe that we are now at a time when we must do as much as we can to keep alive commercial companies in Europe and, in particular, find those incentives to make successful businesses capable of providing as many jobs as possible."
"Such an initiative is all the more important now during the period of crisis we are going through."
"I welcome the Commission's proposal for a directive to simplify the reporting procedures in the case of mergers and divisions because its objective is to cut European companies' administrative costs by 25% by 2012, the precise aim being to boost their competitiveness."
"The report which we have drafted and which we will vote on tomorrow reflects the Commission's thinking and is guided in particular by the following few factors."
"Firstly, the reporting obligations in the case of mergers and divisions must be reduced so as to offer Member States and companies greater flexibility in deciding which reports they really need on a case-by-case basis."
"At the same time, provisions resulting at the moment in double reporting, thereby incurring unnecessary costs, must be removed."
"Thirdly, the rules on publishing and providing information must be adapted to the new realities involving the use of the Internet so that we make full use of these new means of communication, while also conveying a message about protecting the environment."
"We must not forget either that the measures stipulated by the directives currently in force on providing information to shareholders were thought up 30 years ago and have never been adapted for the current technological options available."
"I would like to sincerely thank the shadow rapporteurs for the close cooperation we have had with them and for their support throughout this process of drafting the report."
"I would also like to thank the representatives of the Council and Commission for making themselves available and approachable over these recent months."
"On 7 April COREPER reached an agreement on the entire compromise package negotiated with Parliament with the aim of adopting a directive on mergers and divisions at first reading."
"We would like this to happen, which is precisely the reason why many amendments have been submitted for tomorrow's plenary session vote, by adopting the compromise which we reached during the informal trialogue."
"Issues which were of major concern to some Member States, such as publication in local newspapers or the provision of hard copies and the use of the Internet were resolved, and the representatives of the political groups have given their consent to these amendments."
"With regard to publishing information in local newspapers, this practice will still be possible in those Member States which will consider this to be necessary."
"Regarding hard copies, the rule is that they will no longer be necessary if shareholders have the opportunity to download and print the documents, but Member States can arrange for commercial companies to provide these documents at their office for consultation."
"Another important compromise relates to the date of the directive's implementation, which will be 30 June 2011, as specified in the Commission's proposal."
"Member States will also have the opportunity to decide what the consequences will be in the event of temporary disruption to Internet access as a result of technical problems."
"A substantial amendment relates to simplified mergers and divisions, when general meetings will no longer be required to approve them."
"Based on applying these simplified procedures alone, it is estimated that savings of around EUR 154 million will be made every year, which makes it worth us adopting this directive at first reading."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, you caught me slightly unawares as I had not seen the complete change of the timetable today, but I am very grateful for the chance to address the Chamber about a very important issue of the financial services industry, that is, the insurance and reinsurance industry, what we have done with the Solvency II report and how we have finally brought this now to Parliament in order to be able to establish what I think will be a very concrete basis for regulation across the European Union."
"It is, of course, something which we are coming back to."
"There was Solvency I, and I am grateful to Mr Ettl when previously in Parliament we discussed this at some length and we managed to come up with some basis."
"But now we have to modernise, and the insurance industry is amongst many financial services industries which have to be at the forefront of change."
"It is clear, with the financial crisis and everything that has gone along with it, that the insurance industry is something which cannot be left alone."
"There are several measures which come about from Solvency II which I think have helped to make this one of the leading reports, which will be a global leader at that."
"Amongst them is the issue of management of risk."
"I think it is not enough now that regulators simply tick boxes to establish whether or not the industry that they are meant to be guarding and protecting on behalf of the consumer is doing the right thing."
"It is essential that the day-to-day business of insurance and reinsurance companies is actually watched, managed and monitored by regulators over a period of time."
"It is by this process and this process alone that we will be able to establish a proper and appropriate form of regulation."
"It is the reporting of companies: yes, they will be doing things to tell regulators what they are doing, but regulators will have to be involved."
"And across 27 Member States: not each individual Member State with their own separate rules now, considering what they can apply in terms of that regulation, but indeed they will be applying a standard formula of regulation across the European Union, which will lead, frankly, to the better consumer platform of protection that we expect."
"Similarly, companies will manage to get economies of scale from this regulation, because now they will be reporting only in one way to each of the regulators."
"What they produce, what they have to say, what they do and how they report, will not just be to one regulator but it could be to a college of regulators, especially for groups, because, as insurance companies cross borders, it is now important that regulators team up and work together to ensure that the appropriate levels of reporting, the appropriate levels of figures and what information is supplied, are brought to bear to make sure that the markets are best protected."
"It was during the discussion with the Council that Parliament saw some interesting and perhaps sometimes even deliberate ploys to move national industries one way or another, so I cannot pretend that this has not been a very difficult dossier to try to negotiate with the Council: it has."
"Parliament has pushed the Council a long way."
"It pushed it further than I think the Council established and really wanted to go under the last two presidencies, so I am very proud and pleased to have worked with the team that I have in order to be able to get the Council to move."
"Unfortunately we will not have the kind of group support that we initially envisaged that we should, but because we are able to insert a review clause in this directive, we will be able to come back to group support and, three years after the introduction of this particular directive, I am hoping - and I expect the Commissioner to tell me that he will anticipate doing this as well - to be able to bring back group support in one way or another, specifically to match the economic side of this particular approach."
"We want a regulation that is risk-based and principle-based, but one that will also support the capacity of the industry and one that will promote the very best instincts of regulators across the European Union and abroad."
"I will just finish on this one note. We must also challenge regulators elsewhere in the world and recognise country-to-country regimes only."
"I hope the Commissioner will agree with me about that."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, today's debate takes place at a time when we are facing the greatest challenge to the European economy in modern times."
"Action is needed urgently: vigorous, targeted and comprehensive action in order to restore confidence, growth and jobs and to repair the financial system, to rebuild stability for the future, to promote trade and investment and to better protect our citizens - in short, to deliver an effective and stable financial system."
"Based on the Commission's communication of the beginning of March, the Spring European Council set out a strong EU action plan for the future - a strategy to address the regulatory gaps in the financial sector, to restore incentives and to reform supervision to match the single EU financial market."
"In a few weeks' time the Commission will present its views on the road towards building a state-of-the-art supervisory framework in Europe."
"These will be discussed by the heads of state or government in June."
"The Commission is ready to put concrete measures on the table in the autumn."
"Clearly, global problems also require global solutions."
"The EU initiative to agree a coordinated global response to the financial crisis has been very successful."
"At the London meeting, G20 leaders made extensive commitments to address the weak points of the financial system in a coordinated manner, to jointly build a new financial architecture while defending an open, global economy."
"The situation in the EU financial sector is serious."
"But a lot has already been done, and I am glad to note that the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council have reacted quickly and cooperated closely to respond to the crisis."
"We are about to successfully conclude the adoption of three key measures: firstly, the regulation on credit-rating agencies; secondly, the recast of Solvency II, as well as, thirdly, the revision of the Third and Sixth Company Law Directives on domestic mergers and divisions."
"Firstly, the agreement reached on a regulation on credit-rating agencies will help address one of the problems that contributed to this crisis and thus will offer some prospect of restoring market confidence."
"The proposal adopted by the Commission last November sets some clear objectives for improving integrity, transparency, responsibility and good governance of the credit-rating agencies."
"The thrust of the initial proposal is preserved in this regulation, which will in particular secure the analytical independence of credit-rating agencies, the integrity of the rating process and an adequate management of conflicts of interest that existed before in the rating process."
"Moreover, a comprehensive supervisory regime will be put in place."
"European regulators will supervise the conduct of credit-rating agencies and take enforcement action where necessary."
"On the issue of supervision, I have been vocal about the need to strengthen supervisory cooperation."
"I have therefore no difficulty in agreeing on the need to push forward in this crucial domain."
"Therefore, in order to ensure consistency and coherence in all relevant financial sector regulation, the Commission agrees, on the basis of the recommendations of the de LarosiÃ¨re report, to examine the need to strengthen the provisions of this regulation with regard to supervisory architecture."
"On the issue of the treatment of credit ratings issued in third countries, the outcome of the G20 summit has changed the global situation."
"All G20 members have agreed on regulating credit-rating agencies through the introduction of mandatory registration and oversight regime."
"That is why I agree with the solution agreed in the negotiations between the Council and Parliament on the treatment of ratings issued in third countries."
"I am pleased to note that the ambitious goals set by the Commission proposal have been kept."
"The Commission is very pleased with the outcome of the codecision process."
"Let me now turn to Solvency II."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, and Parliament for their work and their willingness to compromise in order to reach agreement in a single reading on this important subject."
"Such an outcome will be widely welcomed by the EU insurance industry, by supervisors and by stakeholders in general."
"However, I also have to admit that I am disappointed with certain aspects of the compromise."
"The deletion of the group support regime, which I consider one of the most innovative aspects of the Commission's proposal, means that we will not be able to modernise - as much as we wanted - the supervisory arrangements for insurers and reinsurers operating on a cross-border basis."
"I also remain concerned that some of the amendments regarding the treatment of equity risk could result in the introduction of an imprudent regime for investment in risk-based capital."
"This is particularly the case for the amendments which introduce the so-called duration approach as a Member State option."
"The Commission will pay close attention to ensure that the implementing measures brought forward in this regard are prudentially sound."
"Nonetheless, the Commission will support the agreement between Parliament and the Council, if it is endorsed by your vote."
"The current Solvency regime is over 30 years old."
"Solvency II will introduce an economic risk-based regime that will deepen integration of the EU insurance market, enhance policyholder protection and increase the competitiveness of EU insurers."
"As confirmed recently by CEIOPS in their report on lessons learned from the financial crisis, we need Solvency II more than ever as a first response to the present financial crisis."
"We need regulation that requires companies to properly manage their risks, that increases transparency and that ensures that supervisory authorities cooperate and coordinate their activities more effectively."
"Solvency II will bring about a regime for the insurance industry that can serve as a model for similar reforms internationally."
"The introduction of a review clause specifically mentioning the group support regime will enable the Commission to come back to this issue."
"I expect that progress in a number of different areas, connected to the recommendations of the de LarosiÃ¨re report, will have created a more favourable environment for reforms related to cross-border cooperation between home and host supervisors."
"I now turn to the Weber report."
"Thanks to the efficient work of the rapporteur, Ms Weber, it has been possible to identify a compromise on simplified reporting and documentation requirements, in the case of mergers and divisions of public limited liability companies which will maintain a very significant part of the savings potential of the original Commission proposal, which amounts to EUR 172 million per year."
"Measurements and studies carried out in the context of reduction of administrative burdens show that company law is one of the most burdensome areas of the EU acquis."
"For several reasons, administrative burdens hit SMEs harder than bigger companies."
"An expert report from 2007 estimates that small enterprises spend 10 times the amount that large enterprises have to spend in order to comply with information obligations imposed by legislation."
"Ten times, I repeat."
"At the same time, small businesses are the backbone of our European economy, and they are currently facing very difficult economic times."
"In the current difficult and challenging economic situation we cannot afford such impediments."
"Instead we must strengthen our effort to ease the burden on our companies."
"In its resolution of 12 December 2007, the European Parliament welcomed the Commission's determination to reach the goal of a 25% reduction in administrative burdens on undertakings at EU and national level by 2012 and underlined that it would examine legislative proposals in this light."
"Today, only seven months after the proposal was put forward by the Commission, I am very pleased with this compromise, even though the Commission had gone even further in its original proposal."
"I look forward to Parliament endorsing this compromise, which will rapidly bring significant benefits to companies, especially to SMEs."
"And we should not stop there."
"Simplification and reducing red tape will remain at the heart of the Commission's agenda."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Madam President, I do not want to aim this at anybody in particular."
"I think that Solvency II, regulation and CRAs are all very relevant and very important, but we need to build a fire station as well as douse the flames."
"I think we have got too much into the detail of saying: oh, we are going to build this fire station at some time in the future."
"I cannot believe that, if President Sarkozy were still President of the European Council, we would still be going at the snail's pace we are going at."
"The Czech Presidency is a great disappointment, and the President of the Czech Republic in particular is a great disappointment."
"I would say to you that if the Czech Presidency, or its successors, is not capable of doing the job, then it shows that we really do need Lisbon: we really do need somebody on a more permanent basis to give leadership to the European Union."
"People are looking for hope; they are looking for some information about recovery."
"Does anybody in this House really believe that, if Jacques Delors were President of the Commission, we would be going at this snail's pace?"
"It is time for action and for leadership, and we are not getting that action or leadership, and that is an issue that needs to be raised here this morning."
"The European Investment Bank could do much more."
"The European Union and its institutions, together with countries like China, could do much more."
"This is not 1937."
"We did not have the institutions or the capability of addressing things that we have now."
"We do have those institutions now, within and outside the European Union - a small number of institutions that can cooperate together."
"What we are missing is leadership."
"Bring back President Sarkozy, or somebody like Sarkozy, and let us get the Commission properly led, to give people hope and let us start talking about that recovery."
"I do not see this coming from the European Council and it is time it did."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Madam President, I welcome the agreement for Solvency II and, like others, I regret the relegation of group support to a future review and the eventual inability on the part of the Council to explore with us ways to make it workable, taking into account some well founded concerns."
"In both the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs I looked at what happens to the movement of capital at times of group stress, such as near-insolvency, and it is certainly not as straightforward as the Commission draft or insurance industry representatives portrayed."
"However, there are instruments available that could achieve the objective and we recommended Level 2 measures, but now we are left to look for the future for ways to maximise safe, economic use of capital in a group."
"I hope that Member States will rise to the challenge when it comes to looking for better solutions on winding-up."
"Turning now to some of the things in the package, changes to Article 27 specified that supervisory authorities must have relevant expertise and capacity."
"I made the original amendment in part with the report on Equitable Life in mind, but in the context of the financial crisis it has a wider resonance and I have achieved similar inclusions in the capital requirements and credit-rating proposals."
"It must be absolutely clear that taking a risk-based approach is not a soft option."
"Proper understanding of models and underlying assumptions should be a more intensive way of supervising than tick-boxes."
"Stress tests must challenge beyond the comfort zone of assumptions, and correlation factors should remain under active review."
"Group supervision is now made an inclusive process, not winner-takes-all for the group supervisor, although there has to be responsibility at a single end point ultimately."
"The role of CEIOPS is augmented, and it is worth stressing that it was the discussion around Solvency II that led the way towards mainstream thinking on enhanced roles for the Level 3 committees."
"Importantly, it is also clarified that there should not be conflicts between the mandate of a national supervisor and its role within CEIOPS."
"These amendments were somewhat prescient when made quite some time ago, but have shown their worth as the financial crisis has developed."
"As the rapporteur has said, the Parliament team has done well and in the context of Solvency II; so has the Czech Presidency."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur has already pointed out both the aspects worthy of criticism and the positive aspects of the result achieved on Solvency II."
"I believe we can say that it represents significant progress towards rendering the European insurance industry workable in future, even in times of crisis."
"I also believe that, as has already been said, we have made clear where the aspects worthy of criticism lie, namely in group supervision."
"There is, of course, more work to be done in the combined area of group supervision and group support."
"In a crisis, however, when capital flows are not as would normally be expected, it is natural that there is a need to catch up in this field and also to show consideration for countries experiencing difficulties."
"We have also discussed another issue that is crucial, since there are 500 million consumers in the European Union, who are also all insured persons, with 'equity risk'."
"Industry, the economy and the Member States also all have clear opinions on the subject."
"We have had to accept a compromise on this, which may also be reflected in the analysis at some stage under a review-clause system."
"The important thing is that we can say that the European Union has sent out a signal in this regard that Europe is on the move, that it is capable of action."
"I believe that the United States, China and the other countries working on these prudential issues and preparing better systems for the future in these particular circumstances have also recognised this signal."
"That is one of the important insights."
"I should also like to reiterate the following very clearly with regard to the past."
"Four presidencies have been involved, including the current one."
"The negotiations have varied widely, naturally also under the influence of pressure from the respective Member States, but we have achieved a result."
"That is one insight."
"The second is that we have worked together with the European insurance industry, and that the impact studies on the individual fields were very important in this regard."
"Why was that?"
"It was because of the need to involve the insurance industry in finding a path to this solution in view of the very complicated system and subject matter."
"If we consider that 1 400 undertakings took part in the last impact study - both large and small, as the aim is not market clearance but to involve all actors in the interests of consumers - then this has been a great success."
"Together with the Solvency II negotiating team, we have refused to be intimidated by any particular sources of pressure, and instead have steered a clear course in the interests of consumers, of the insurance industry and, above all, of course, of our parliamentary duties."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is clear to everyone that a cycle of development is over, a cycle that in recent years brought to light the imbalances and contradictions of a certain way of understanding globalisation: an ultraliberal globalisation that in too many cases has benefited from the weakness of the institutions and has looked on politics as a hindrance, an annoyance of which to rid itself."
"It now falls precisely to politics to restore citizens' faith in light of the severe economic crisis we are experiencing."
"In order to do so politics must take the lead, indicating the future prospects and obstacles to be overcome."
"We must redress the contradiction between the rapid growth of the world market and the weakness of the institutions capable of counterbalancing and controlling the excessive power of the financial economy."
"The rating agencies regulation represents an important step forward in this sense."
"I have worked on this dossier as the shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, in full cooperation with JeanPaul GauzÃ¨s, the report's author, whom I sincerely congratulate."
"The most significant points of the regulation are the product of Parliament's commitment during the difficult negotiations with the Council."
"I refer to solid achievements such as the requirement for agencies to register on European territory, forecasting and civil liability, the dual security system for the approval of notes from third countries and above all the possibility that this regulation may enter into force quickly and not after two years, as initially requested by national governments."
"The regulation also has a strong symbolic value, however."
"We are in fact regulating a sector that like others - I am thinking for example of speculative funds - has benefited in recent years from a total legislative void."
"The outcome of this kind of self-regulation is clear for all to see, and it is terrible."
"Now is the time to take courage and build a new structure for the financial markets."
"We must be aware that in this sector, even more than in others, Commissioner, it is not enough for national governments to act alone!"
"For this reason, I feel a pang of regret despite the excellent result obtained, because an opportunity was missed; due to opposition from the Member States - for which the Council has a serious responsibility - the will was not there to make provision in the text for a single, European supervisory body for the ratings sector."
"An official request for this was made to Parliament, but a lack of political ambition and realism has so far prevented it from finding support."
"On this point, Parliament continues to demonstrate its ability to look well into the future, and I hope that the national governments will do the same."
"Madam President, the failings of the credit rating agencies that preceded the crisis have made the regulation of these agencies inescapable."
"The objectives of the present Regulation on the registration of credit rating agencies are, once again, transparency, guaranteed high quality, greater competition, the overcoming of conflicts of interest and, as a result, better protection of investors."
"Reaching agreement was no easy task."
"The positions of the Commission, Parliament and the Council started off far apart but, on the whole, these objectives have now largely been achieved."
"One good thing is that there is to be only one rating category."
"Categories 1 and 2 for regulatory and other purposes will be a thing of the past."
"Conflicts of interest have been overcome: there will be no advisory services in addition to credit rating activities."
"Credit rating agencies from countries outside the European Union will have the opportunity to approach the European market and operate here by means of an equivalence regime involving certification - which is important for small agencies - or by means of the endorsement system - which can be used by large agencies."
