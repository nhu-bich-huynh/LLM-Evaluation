"Text"
"Five years have gone by, and the results have yet to be felt."
"Most of the measures agreed remain on paper."
"Concerns are being expressed not only about the lack of results in the economic field, but also about the lack of progress in combating discrimination."
"Women continue to fare worse than men on the European labour market."
"This is clear from the significant pay gap between men and women and from the obstacles the latter are confronted with when seeking employment."
"Although the percentage of women in employment in Europe rose slightly in 2003, it remains the case that only slightly over half of European women work outside the home."
"New jobs created for women tend to be insecure and poorly paid, and women’s pension rights are considerably lower than men’s."
"Currently, 58% of people with higher education qualifications in Europe are women."
"Nonetheless, they tend to be promoted less frequently and still earn between 15% and 40% less than men for work of equal value."
"If the Lisbon Strategy is to be implemented, priority must be given to specific actions aimed at supporting and promoting employment for women and female entrepreneurship."
"Changes to an employment policy that discriminates against women are essential, especially in view of the theories propounded recently according to which a woman’s so-called natural role is in the home, and that in the 21st century women’s role in society should be simply to keep house."
"If women withdrew from the labour market men might be able to fill the vacancies created."
"A number of Polish politicians believe that this would be an effective way to combat unemployment."
"Is this really the road an innovative and competitive Europe should go down?"
"I very much hope not, and therefore strongly support Mrs Estrela’s report."
"– Mr President, it has been said repeatedly that the European strategy on employment is a basic means of applying the Lisbon Strategy and makes provision for a European employment rate of 70% and, more importantly, a female employment rate of 60%."
"The own-initiative report on which we are being called to vote today, whose rapporteur, Mrs Estrela, I honestly congratulate, together with the committee and honourable Members who participated today in the debate – because they truly have enriched the subject with their ideas – will help to realise this objective, while safeguarding the much-debated equal treatment and the qualitative improvement of the opportunity for women to participate in the job market."
"Women in the Union not only account for over half the overall population, but also represent 58% of university graduates and 41% of PhD graduates."
"They are a resource which must be maintained through lifelong learning and developed in quality jobs and new forms of services, such as part-time employment, teleworking and flexible hours which are chosen of their own free will and will not end up splitting women's personality to the point at which they become schizophrenic."
"Situations such as these arise not only from unequal treatment on pay, but also from a lack of legal protection in professional development, which is affected by family life and, whether we like it or not, it is on this family life that the demographic development of the Union depends."
"Inequality begins in the training period."
"From this study period onwards there is a difference of treatment which obstructs family development. At the same time, there is no harmonisation of predictions in order to safeguard these times as working times."
"Objectives to meet 90% of the demand for day-care facilities for school-age children and 33% for infants are not enough, unless quality preschool education is provided, which is only the case in a few European countries."
"These places must be cheap and must not be accompanied by a reduction in women's income."
"However, women's income is reduced by different treatment of their tax and pensions."
"Another issue which was raised and which I too for my part wish to emphasise is the acknowledgment of non-standard work by women."
"Help must be given not only to mothers of single-parent families, but also to mothers in general bringing up one, two or more children."
"This is the only way we shall be able to be proud of the fact that we are trying to make Europe the leading world power and to support the development and prosperity which will come from social cohesion."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Estrela on her report and add something to what has been said so far, most of which I agree with."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if, as paragraph 23 of the report states, the aim is to achieve greater coordination between gender equality policies and the Lisbon Strategy in order to take better account of the gender perspective in fulfilling the objectives set out for the European Union in 2000, I would like to draw attention to what is still the very small number of women both in the scientific and technological fields and in important decision-making positions in the business world."
"If, as the Lisbon objectives state, we want Europe to become a dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy, then science, technology and innovation must play a fundamental role in it, yet the participation of women in these fields, at all levels, still far from matches that of men."
"This is a question not only of justice, but also of efficiency."
"Women make up approximately half of the population, and to use just half of the brains available to us is neither intelligent nor efficient."
"The studies prior to the negotiation of the Seventh Framework Research and Development Programme, which is underway, showed us that Europe needs 750 000 new, properly trained male and female researchers."
"This is the time to take the necessary measures to ensure, without giving up on excellence, that men and women have equal access to these new jobs."
"The majority of studies carried out have also stressed the lack of data broken down by gender in scientific and technological fields."
"This is a further difficulty in terms of implementing effective policies that tackle the roots of the problem."
"The European Institute for Gender Equality will have to play an important role and deal with this deficiency as a matter of priority."
"We would call on the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, to take the action necessary in order to make progress on resolving this problem. To do so is essential if the Lisbon Strategy is to bring the success that all women and men want to see."
"Analysis of growth in the European Union has shown that we are not taking a sufficiently effective or serious approach to the fulfilment of the goals of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The fact that in the area of employment and wages women are still in a markedly worse position than men is something that is quite unbelievable and completely unacceptable for the countries of the European Union in this day and age."
"In view of the fact that we are encountering a serious problem in Europe, namely an aging population and a low birth rate, we must deal with the issue of inequality in the workplace in conjunction with these problems."
"This should be of sufficient concern for us to direct all our efforts, both in the European Union and in our individual Member States, towards determining the causes of this issue and to finding as effective and serious a solution as possible."
"We need the genuine cooperation of the whole of society, since responsibility for the present situation cannot simply be lumped onto women, who are no longer prepared to assume total care of children and at the same time to find themselves often financially disadvantaged, first in the short term, and then in the long term when they retire."
"What we need, therefore, are appropriate legal measures, the consensus of the whole of society, and the readiness of both female and male citizens to take on the responsible yet wonderful job that we call parenthood."
"In this we must enhance society’s positive attitude to life and encourage women not to miss or renounce that most beautiful mission and joy in life that motherhood brings."
"Motherhood does not necessarily preclude a professional or political career, you just need to choose the appropriate time for each thing."
"We may even look to the women Members of the European Parliament as a model, since some of us can boast three, five and even nine or ten children."
"And these very Members did not come to Parliament to rest, but are working very responsibly and effectively, since they know how to work with a feeling for the needs of the individual, and they also have a feeling for the community."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the very few men who have been present at this debate and the even smaller number who have spoken."
"It all goes to show that women are right to say there is still a lot of work to be done."
"I therefore wanted to truly congratulate those who have taken part in the debate, because it deals with a subject that does not concern women alone, but is the concern of all of society and everyone involved in society."
"That is the perspective in which the Commission intends working on this problem."
"I would also like to say that I share the main ideas that have been expressed in this Assembly and to which I have listened most attentively."
"I do not, on the other hand, agree with certain speakers who want to keep women in stereotypical roles, I would go so far as to say roles of another age."
"Working women are not the cause of unemployment."
"That is an argument we hear all too often in some quarters and it is clearly against such arguments that we need to fight, because they are preventing significant progress being made in some countries."
"That being the case, what is the Commission doing?"
"I would like to point out that, for the most part, the demands that have been made are matters for national policy."
"It is still up to the Member States to legislate on the major questions that have been raised."
"I do of course recognise that the Commission has its part to play and I am going to explain the areas where it intends taking action and how."
"The new integrated guidelines clearly restate the necessity of making the gender dimension, gender mainstreaming, part of all employment policies and they reaffirm the need to promote equality between men and women in every action undertaken."
"The new strategy for employment takes up the target of a 60% employment rate in 2010."
"In particular, it includes in the guidelines the elimination of gender disparities and the promotion of reconciliation between professional and private life."
"The Commission has also made mainstreaming a fundamental principle of Community action."
"May I remind you that it is included as such in Article 3 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community."
"Mainstreaming is implemented through a Community framework strategy for equality between women and men."
"This strategy seeks to establish a framework for action in which all Community activities, including economic activities and policies and employment policy, can contribute to achieving the objective of eliminating inequality and promoting equality between women and men."
"The Commission is currently preparing a roadmap for equality between men and women, which will take over from the framework strategy starting in 2007."
"Like the framework strategy, its aim will be to implement gender mainstreaming effectively in all Community policies, and more particularly the Lisbon Strategy."
"I would like to say a word about the pay gap."
"The pay gap between men and women is a complex phenomenon and discrimination is not its only cause."
"In fact, it results from a number of factors, such as segregation on the employment market, the persistence of stereotypes, especially in education and training, and the difficulty of reconciling professional and private life."
"We therefore need to respond to all these underlying factors."
"I would like to emphasise the particular attention we intend paying to reducing the pay gap in the employment strategy."
"Two guidelines call explicitly on the Member States and the social partners to work towards this."
"It should also be noted that the Austrian Presidency has announced its intention of organising a conference on the subject of the pay gap in Brussels at the end of May, and I think it will be quite a special opportunity for making new progress in this field."
"A word on the method of studying and analysing the changing position of women on the employment market from the point of view of awareness of their rights and of the role of men."
"The Commission is constantly monitoring equality policy and regularly undertakes or commissions analyses and studies of the economic and legal aspects of equality."
"The annual report on equality between men and women, which the Commission has presented to the spring summit of the Heads of State or Government since 2004, is a very important document for monitoring the question of male-female equality in the European Union."
"The report sets out the main changes in the respective positions of women and men in education, employment and social life."
"It identifies the progress made and the challenges still to be taken up."
"From this point of view, too, the Commission is also analysing the Member States’ national reform programmes under the Lisbon Strategy, and this will be an important contribution to the ‘Employment’ chapter of the annual monitoring report."
"How does the Commission intend improving the statistical methodology to take account of the gender aspect?"
"The gender dimension is of course included in the statistics."
"This is done by using a statistical methodology and statistical data that take account of the gender aspect."
"As the draft resolution underlines, the availability of adequate, consistent and comparable statistical indicators is absolutely essential for policy monitoring."
"Eurostat is collaborating actively with the national statistical institutes in order to put in place a common methodology that will enable reliable and comparable data to be collected at European level."
"It is in fact important that such data should be collected at that level."
"The future Institute for Gender Equality should also make a significant contribution to improving the statistical monitoring of equality policy."
"I would nevertheless like to point out, because I believe it is useful to tell things as they are, that this institute will be primarily a technical instrument and will certainly not be a political body or a supplier of financial resources."
"Such, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is the Commission’s response; it fully shares the concerns expressed in the report and once again congratulates the rapporteur on her excellent work."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (O-0080/2005 – B6-0345/2005) by Mr Bowis, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on disability and development."
". Mr President, you, the Commissioner and I all live with a disability."
"If we are without our glasses, we cannot operate;"
"I cannot read, I cannot drive or avoid bumping into things, but I live in a society where I am helped to overcome that disability and therefore to function, even as a Member of this Parliament."
"However, if I lived in a developing country I would be less fortunate."
"One in ten people in developing countries live with disabilities."
"One in four families in poverty in developing countries has some member living with a disability."
"That is the challenge, but this debate is not just about long faces, sympathy and pity; it is about celebrating the abilities of people with disability and seeing how we can enable them to function and to contribute to their own lives, economies and communities."
"Our policy, or resolution, is all about ending rejection, ending the concept of a scrap-heap, ending stigma where disability is concerned."
"We want a policy of prevention, of care, of enablement and of human rights."
"We want an end to no-go areas for people with disabilities."
"We want, if I can use the phrase, to see disability ."
"We want to see a break with that link to poverty so inevitable for people with ill health and disability in developing countries: no wealth without health, but no income without medicine."
"No income means no medicine; no transport means no school; no health certificate means no work; no access means no opportunity to prove one’s worth."
"It is not just about mobility, it is about all the disabilities that we have to learn to cope with in our different ways, whether it is sight, hearing, learning difficulties, respiratory problems or seizures."
"Our policy must be twin-track, and I use that word advisedly: it is in the guidance that the Commission has produced."
"It is the twin-track of prevention and care services."
"It is the twin-track of policy for people with disabilities and policies developed by people with disabilities, decided by them, with their involvement in policy making."
"We remember with pleasure those Ugandan members taking the seats specially reserved for them in the Ugandan Parliament for people with disabilities."
"We want to see support for organisations of disabled people."
"We want recognition that neglected diseases are some of the biggest causes of disability."
"Some need those new partnerships to develop drugs; many need access to the drugs that we in the West take for granted."
"I live with diabetes."
"I have said that on many occasions."
"However, I can function with the pills, blood tests and specialist attention that I receive to overcome that and to live a reasonably normal life."
"But when I was in Mali and went to see the services there for people with diabetes, I saw one room in a clinic and one in a hospital with people with amputations of legs and arms, losing their sight, their liver destroyed and facing early death."
"We need a policy that helps people to overcome."
"Those people could be contributing to the economy of Mali."
"Our ACP adopted resolutions in Brussels in 2001, in Cape Town in 2002 and in the Year of People with Disabilities, in 2003, in Europe, we got the guidance note."
"But that is one of the best-kept secrets in Europe and in the developing world."
"My plea to the Commissioner is to draw out the excellent words of that and put them into practice."
"In particular, we do not want to see any more public European money used to continue building barriers for people with disabilities."
"The years 1999 to 2009 are the African Decade of Disabled People, set up by the African Union."
"That target date coincides with the end of our term as Parliamentarians and Commissioners."
"By that date I hope we will look back and say that we made the effort to help disabled people achieve, to enable them, and to make them real, whole people in the economies and communities in which they live."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the guidance note on disability serves as a benchmark for taking account of disability issues in development policy."
"Incidentally, I would like to thank the honourable Member for the specific and obviously very interesting light he has shed on this very serious problem."
"The note provides a series of guidelines and practical suggestions; it is not therefore really a question of implementing it as such but rather of ensuring it is circulated widely among the personnel concerned."
"It has already been widely circulated in the RELEX family of directorates general and the delegations."
"In addition, a training session on disability was held in September 2005."
"The Commission has also distributed its note externally."
"It has been published in the form of a brochure in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese and placed on the Internet."
"The inclusion of disability in development policy is also covered by point 97 of the European Consensus on Development, which you approved a few weeks ago."
"That point is concerned with preventing social exclusion and combatting all forms of discrimination, including that based on the condition of disabled persons."
"To that end, it stipulates that the Community will promote social dialogue and social protection."
"The national level is the most appropriate for implementing this dimension."
"Preventing exclusion and fighting discrimination will therefore be done on request and on the basis of dialogue with the partner countries."
"Any disability-related programmes will therefore be developed on that basis and at that level."
"Obviously, the Commission is in favour of improving outcomes in health and education by means of projects and, increasingly, by budget support."
"Political dialogue is an integral part of that support and it is within the framework of that political dialogue that the Commission is able to answer the calls made in this debate."
"The Commission will therefore try to encourage the inclusion of disability or of disabled persons in our partner countries’ development strategies while respecting this principle of appropriateness."
"We will be trying to convince governments that it is important to tackle these questions effectively."
"Obviously, we will be throwing all our weight into the battle so far as this is concerned."
"I am fully aware of the tragic situation of disabled persons, a situation that is all the more tragic in the developing countries and especially among the poorest, because I witness these human tragedies very regularly; that is why I am very happy to be speaking to you about it now."
"I also have to confess that I also sometimes witness the lack or total absence of interest in the disabled, not to say their exclusion, in some utterly deprived societies."
"I am therefore entirely convinced that your desires, your attention and your concern are justified and I will not fail to use all the power at the Commission’s disposal to deal more specifically with this question."
"Mr President, 10% of the world’s population has a handicap, but, as Mr Bowis has just said, the percentage is often much higher in the developing countries."
"When discussing handicapped people in developing countries, we are talking in terms of people with both physical and mental handicaps, not only the blind but also children traumatised by war, and that adds up to hundreds of millions of people."
"Developing countries often lack facilities for handicapped people, who often live isolated lives."
"UNESCO estimates that 98% of children with a handicap in these countries do not go to school."
"The figures speak for themselves; policy-makers need to be particularly aware of this group of people."
"It will, moreover, be all the more difficult to achieve the millennium objectives if such a large segment of the population is left out of consideration."
"After all, handicapped people do not benefit automatically from programmes to combat poverty, an area in which there is no mainstreaming for them."
"The problems were, and are, plain to see; the question is what we are doing about them."
"As has already been said, it was in 2003 that the Commission produced a guidance note for all delegations and services that gave handicapped people a place in development policy."
"In view of what the Commission has already said about the priority given to political dialogue, I would like it to tell us whether there is anything more to be said about the results."
"Is it possible for more action to be taken for the specific benefit of handicapped people?"
"Have practical solutions been found for specific problems, for example in the educational field?"
"Education is, after all, fundamental to the combating of poverty and social exclusion, which affects most handicapped people."
"Have handicapped people themselves been involved in the design and implementation of programmes?"
"This is what is done in the Netherlands, and the results are very good."
"In conclusion, what is the Commission doing about exchanging knowledge and combining learning in this field?"
"Mr President, this debate demonstrates that disability is a significant issue and that it must be taken into account when drawing up the European Union’s development cooperation policies."
"It is clear that disability and poverty are very closely related, and disability is also closely linked to disease and lack of health care."
"We already knew this in Europe, where disability is much more widespread in the marginal sectors of society and where, furthermore, disabled people from those sectors suffer much more as a result of their condition than those from other more comfortable sectors."
"What we are seeing now is that, in a similar way, disability affects the developing world much more than our industrialised countries and that disabled people in the South suffer as a result of their condition much more than those in the developed North."
"The resolution that we will adopt identifies this situation and calls on the European Union to take responsibility for combating it."
"The Commission will receive a recommendation from Parliament, calling on it to take account of the phenomenon of disability in all of its actions, both in the European strategy for the development of Africa and in the European consensus on development."
"This resolution should also help increase awareness of this problem on the part of our governments and populations."
"Having said all of that, however, and though the Socialist Group is committed to making every possible effort in this field, I feel that it is important to highlight the actions of certain developing countries that are demonstrating an admirable degree of solidarity in combating those forms of disability most closely related to poverty, lack of health care and underdevelopment itself."
"Cuba is unquestionably one such country: It has not been content simply to have a policy aimed at preventing and alleviating disabilities within its own society but, for some years now, has also been providing very significant assistance to other countries in relation to this phenomenon."
"An example of this is what is known as ‘Operation Miracle’, as a result of which, and with resources provided mainly by Venezuela, more than 208 000 blind Latin Americans and Caribbeans had their sight restored in 2005 following free operations in Cuba."
"The recently elected President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, signed a series of agreements in Havana."
"One of them is intended to allow more than half a million blind Bolivians to be treated firstly in Cuba and then in several ophthalmological clinics that will be set up in Bolivia by Cuban specialists and using Cuban technology."
"Similar projects are underway in Venezuela and other Latin American countries, and talks are being held with South Africa in order to explore similar initiatives."
"These actions should be valued in the European Parliament, just as they are in the countries in question, much more than fine words and well-intentioned resolutions."
". Mr President, I welcome the chance to debate this issue, and I should like to thank Mr Bowis for this opportunity."
"Disabled people, as we have heard, make up about 10% of any population, but 20% of the poorest are disabled."
"Eighty-two per cent of disabled people live below the poverty line in developing countries."
"They are even more excluded than disabled people within the EU."
"They are excluded from social, economic and political life and, in many cases, are denied access to food, water and shelter."
"When we talk about disability and development, we are not talking about charity but about basic human rights."
"All people – disabled or otherwise – should be treated as equal."
"That is why I am pleased that we are stressing the rights-based approach."
"We must ensure that disabled people and disabled people’s organisations are involved in discussions about what is needed and in the delivery."
"I am pleased that we have made progress on the UN Convention on Disabled People’s Rights."
"Hopefully we will see something by 2007."
"Many of you know that I was rapporteur for Parliament’s position on this."
"We must ensure, however, that monitoring and enforcement procedures are included within the Convention."
"That is why I called for a legally binding Convention."
"It is important that whatever we bring forward, real action is taken and that action is monitored and evaluated."
"Part of that action is to prevent more people becoming disabled."
"One way to eradicate this is to ensure that landmines and cluster bombs are not used."
"We must take action against all countries that manufacture, sell or use them."
"Mr President, the burden of avoidable disability and disease in developing countries should weigh heavily on our conscience: when a child develops a disabling parasitic disease from contaminated water because its mother cannot afford two tablespoons of bleach to add to the family’s bucket of drinking water; when a child develops HIV from the shared needles used by aid agencies; or when a man or woman is disabled by dangerous exploitative work that creates cheap consumer goods for us."
"We are so well, healthy and rich."
"We must give something back and more."
"We must not take from poorer countries in destructive and disabling ways."
"We like to put provisos in our aid packages."
"The proviso we need to include in aid packages is that aid should include people with disabilities and funded projects should include schemes designed to meet their special needs and open up new and equal opportunities."
"We must include enablement in all our approaches to development in developing countries."
"And I would remind you that disability is, in itself, still an area for development within the EU."
"– Τhe next item is voting time."
"Mr President, under the Rules of Procedure concerning voting, you have just said that it is the right of every single Member to call for a check."
"It is also the right of the President to point out that there is an overwhelming majority in favour; and when colleagues from UKIP start shouting at the back, please ignore them!"
"– Mr Beazley, that is the decision of the President directing the proceedings in the House."
"My decision is that the vote will be checked in order to satisfy everyone that that indeed was the result."
"Mr President, is it your wish that certain Members of this House be regarded as second-class citizens or not?"
"– I have no wish to continue this discussion."
"Mr President, I refer to Rule 168 in conjunction with Rule 53 of the Rules of Procedure and would like in this connection to ask the Commission whether it is able to accept the amendments adopted by Parliament in this report, in particular Amendment 14, under which 50% of the restructuring funds, which total EUR 6 billion, will go to the producers."
"This amendment was voted on by the Committee."
"The amendment was tabled by Mr Goepel."
"I would also like to ask the Commission to accept Amendments 10 and 11, which require an economic development plan to be submitted for the region when restructuring measures are to be introduced, such development plans to be notified by the Commission and the Member State in question."
"Mr President, I believe it will be helpful to answer this question by clarifying this point."
"The Commission is able to agree to at least 10% of restructuring aid amounts being reserved for sugar-beet growers and machinery manufacturers."
"This amount could be increased by the Member States, depending on their specific situation."
"Mr President, speaking on behalf of my group and further to Rule 168, I rise to request that this report be referred back to the Committee in order that we might negotiate with the Commission and the Council and get these two points accepted."
"The Council stated in its decision that only 10% of these restructuring funds should go to producers – including those in the developing world – and that the remainder should go to the sugar industry without conditions imposed, thus enabling it to fund its decommissionings without having to take job losses and the needs of the region into consideration in any way whatever."
"We would therefore like to see negotiations opened in what would be a hearing."
"The only possibility left to us for getting the Council to negotiate is that we send the report back now and use the four weeks that are left to us between now and the next part-session to secure an increase for the producers."
"Mr President, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is right in the sense that we tabled the amendment on the understanding that at least 50% of the restoration fund would be deployed."
"Instead, the Commission has proposed a minimum of 10%, with each Member State being entitled to increase this amount without limit and at its own discretion, and so our group believes that this is no longer an issue."
"I ask the House to reject this amendment."
"Mr President, I fully agree with what the representative of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has just said: that was one of the things the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was calling for."
"As the Commissioner said two days ago, the Commission is willing to allow the Member States to increase the 10% level."
"The question is therefore settled and for my part I am therefore against referring it back to committee."
"Mr President, if we are to vote now, I should like the vote to be by roll call."
"It was not possible to table a motion for a roll call vote earlier on, as we did not know whether we would be voting."
"It follows that the request can be made only now, and orally."
"I therefore request a roll call vote."
"). Mr President, I refer to Rule 138 concerning translations."
"Amendment 1 tabled by the Independence and Democracy Group proposes an alternative draft resolution that heeds and respects our nations’ rejection of any super state and therefore of any constitution."
"The translation of this amendment, the English version in particular, distorts the sense of the original in several places."
"For example, where we refer to ‘the pursuit of European construction’, a politically neutral expression, the translation refers to ‘European integration’, an expression for the supranational process that we reject."
"It is no doubt a Pavlovian reflex that has contaminated many offices in this building, still not accepting that a different Europe is possible."
"I would therefore like to point out that only the original French version is authentic."
". Mr President, unless I have misunderstood you, you called the honourable Member who has just spoken under my name."
"I would not want the impression to be given that the rapporteurs are in agreement with his interpretation."
"This desperate attempt to use translations as a means of altering substance must not succeed."
"The rapporteurs will have nothing to do with it."
"Mr President, I wish, as chairman of the committee, to thank the rapporteurs for working through one of the most important issues to concern us in 2006 at a time when much is in flux, and, in my capacity as a German MEP, to give the services a series of corrections."
"The German translation is sometimes misleading and sometimes wrong, with – to give just one example – the term ‘European papers’ translated as ‘Euro papers’."
"It is not paper that we want to produce, but political substance."
"I shall let you have a series of corrections."
". Mr President, to bring the text into line with the Treaties, we would prefer the wording ‘EU outermost regions adjacent to the European continent’."
". Mr President, the rapporteur and the PPE-DE Group’s voting list objected to the Liberal proposal to insert the sub-heading ‘Maghreb’."
"You went too quickly and were not looking in my direction."
"The PPE-DE group opposes the sub-heading ‘Maghreb’ after paragraph 33."
"."
"Mr President, just for the sake of completeness, to call the Vatican City State a ‘country’ is stretching the definition a little far, so I have changed the wording to ‘sovereign states’. (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote)"
"Mr President, my group does not agree that Amendment 2, tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, lapses if our Amendment 24 is approved."
"As we see it, they do not contradict one another but are mutually compatible, so that it is possible to vote in favour of both of them."
". Mr President, I agree that Amendment 2 does not fall."
"We can have a separate vote on it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we propose to replace the word ‘Hezbollah’ with the words ‘all Lebanese and non-Lebanese Militias’."
". Mr President, this is quite a complicated oral amendment."
"As you may appreciate, negotiations are going on today in London."
"They are very delicate, regarding finding a long-lasting peaceful solution to the Ngorno Karabakh dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"To bring the wording into a more neutral stance, I would like the paragraph to read as follows:"
"‘Takes the view that the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is impeding the development of Armenia and Azerbaijan and regional cooperation as well as the effective implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy as such; calls on both parties to refrain from unilateral actions and aggressive statements and to work for settlement of the conflict in a constructive dialogue with all the forces concerned, on the basis of respect for minority rights and on the basis of the principles of international law;’ – that is key – ‘emphasises the importance of continuing democratic reforms for the development of the region and its relations with the EU; urges all parties concerned to find ways to permit the gradual return of refugees on the basis of minority rights, in particular with regard to the return of Azerbaijanis to the occupied territories; calls on the member countries of the OSCE Minsk group to coordinate more effectively their action with the EU Special Representative for South Caucasus in order to move forward with negotiations’."
"– That concludes voting time."
"Mr President, what is the point of this so-called amendment to the rules against heckling in the Chamber when this Parliament is one of the dullest, dreariest and most unexciting assemblies in the world?"
"Moreover, it will not apply only to the Chamber, but also to what goes on in the corridors!"
"A number of our colleagues were made to remove an authorised display showing the similarities between the culture of death of the Hitler regime and the culture of death of today’s hedonistic society, both inspired by eugenic principles."
"As I now speak in this Parliament, however, another display is boasting the supposed merits of Chinese Maoist democracy, where even today there are still tens of millions of prisoners in labour camps, held because of their beliefs, and where the communist totalitarian ideology that still holds sway has committed its worst atrocities!"
"Mr Onesta, the author of this report, is a respectable man, but he belongs to a group that was responsible for the most unbelievable uproar directed against a Head of State who was present in this House, President Jacques Chirac, who had just been elected at the time."
"What is right today is wrong tomorrow: two standards, depending on whether you belong to a large group or a small one!"
"Mr President, I too have some qualms about the Onesta report, despite having voted for it."
"I have great respect for the rapporteur, who is a truly nice man and has helped me on many occasions."
"However, my concern is over how the rules will be interpreted by a partisan President of Parliament such as our current President, who does not seem to understand the concept of free speech and is very authoritarian in the way in which he deals with Members of the House."
"At the solemn sitting in homage to the victims of terrorism held in this House in March 2005 he wisely counselled us not to use such terrible events to push political messages, and then did so himself."
"Therefore, how will he police the new rules in this House?"
". It is necessary to tread very carefully when drawing up a code of conduct for MEPs, as this is a thorny issue."
"Parliament is the institutional embodiment of freedom."
"Political representation was found to be the very embodiment of democracy; legislation as an act of the will of the electorate, in a spirit of mutual consent and sovereign expression."
"Democratic political systems heralded parliamentary institutions, because of the openness and transparency of their debates and because the people could monitor the Members at election time."
"Representatives do have a ‘special status’ which is conferred on them because they are seen as a ‘cross-section of the population’."
"Their freedom is a right and a duty, their responsibility is politics, and, as Popper once said, their judgment day comes on election day."
"This is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has advocated a cautious approach to the issue in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"After all, a code of this nature has limits, and those limits arise from the integrity of Members exercising their mandate."
"They are the limits of freedom with which the people made Parliament, within which they are represented in Parliament and which they do not wish to see removed from Parliament."
"The report by the French member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Mr Onesta, on the penalties imposed on Members causing a disturbance inside and outside the Chamber is a blow to freedom of speech, especially for political minorities."
"It is the beginnings of regimentation, a form of concealed totalitarianism, of normalisation as they used to say when communism was at its height, and coming from the Greens that is not surprising."
"Clearly, it is not enough for the European Parliament that its minorities, especially the non-attached Members, should be victims of outrageous discrimination as regards Parliamentarians’ rights; we have to go further and punish them, even punish them financially, if the majority considers their behaviour ‘politically incorrect’."
"This regulatory is intolerable and destructive of freedom."
"When there are more than 20 million people unemployed in Europe and immigration is swamping our nation states, I think the European Parliament has better things to do than flout parliamentary democracy, even if it is European."
". I voted for this report."
"It is an indictment of the conduct of a minority of members that this report is even necessary."
". This report comes from a pen of considerable scientific authority in parliamentary law, and it is clear from reading it that he has used the great authorities in the discipline, such as Eugène Pierre."
"It is based on a philosophical choice: the choice of oligarchy, in other words, in the language of Aristotle, 'the rule of a few'."
"Thus, thirty or so MEPs (session presidents, and those who impose penalties, hear those penalised and confirm the penalties) will be responsible for supervising their colleagues."
"As all Members owe their position to sovereignty, be it popular or national, it is sovereignty itself that will find itself under supervision."
"France invented parliamentary sovereignty back in 1791, supplanting popular sovereignty."
"However, as Parliament, by virtue of its composition, represented only one social class – the bourgeoisie and the other so-called liberal professions – it seized popular or national sovereignty for its own benefit."
"In this report, this little band of oligarchs is setting up instruments to neutralise any representatives of the people who might get through the electoral and media filters."
"Consequently, this report, which should have restricted itself to a single word – 'freedom' of the people's representatives – can be summed up with a different word: oligarchy."
". – The new amendments to the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure relating to standards for the conduct of Members of the European Parliament is an attempt, in the name of the smooth functioning of Parliament, to use policing and sanctions in order to restrict and control the expression of reaction, protest or disagreement and terrorise those Members who wish to express their opposition to the anti-grass roots policy of the ΕU, to aspects of it or to serious political events."
"The new autocratic measures make provision for financial penalties, exclusion from meetings and institutions, even a proposal to be removed from parliamentary office."
"In this way, they are attempting to restrict any reactions with placards, pickets and so on, noting 'daintily’ that they are not tolerable if they create 'clashes' or disrupt parliamentary business."
"Similar threats and sanctions are provided for in cases where provisions are infringed governing confidentiality relating to 'closed meetings' and the publication of documents which, it should be noted, often circulate on the media."
"We are voting against the new autocratic amendments and declare that we shall not be disciplined and shall try in every way to project the problems of the working classes and inform the people to whom we give account."
". The sense of responsibility, respect and high intellectual rigour expected of the MEPs’ mandate has never hindered their ability to express their views openly; far from it."
"While there have been a number of well-documented, unacceptable abuses, it is also true that some countries have developed certain practices and customs that actually enhance the prestige of their parliamentary assemblies and lend them their own particular character and flavour."
"Take the United Kingdom, for example."
"I feel that, quite apart from the provisions of the regulations in force, rules and behaviour are primarily dictated by precedent, which, by definition, is very much a work in progress in the case of the European Parliament."
"The mandate of MEP is the exercise of both freedom and responsibility, and there is no reason to believe that the elected representatives are lacking either of these."
". I am in favour of much of the measures in this report, though am firmly of the view that Parliament should have an individual vote on changes to our procedures, where this one vote covered a number of points in one."
"On these grounds I abstained, though welcome the adoption of the report as a whole, as it is clear that, for one example, a number of members have taken advantage of our pretty lax rules to date."
". I voted in favour of Mrs Vlasto's excellent report on implementing the European Charter for Small Enterprises, as those small enterprises are at the very heart of the creation of wealth and social progress for a very large number of our fellow European citizens."
"I support the proposals that aim to give international collaboration between Chambers of Commerce an important role in terms of the competitiveness of small enterprises and the recognition of craft enterprises."
"This report quite rightly emphasises that neither the European Commission nor some of the Member States have grasped the scale of the considerable challenge presented by the retirement of millions of people who run small enterprises."
"Finally, we must make every effort to make the day-to-day running of this economic stratum, which is so vital for growth, employment and consumer satisfaction, simpler and more secure in legal, fiscal and social terms."
". The British Conservative delegation is content to endorse the content of most of Mrs Vlasto's report but has decided to abstain because of the wording of paragraph 22."
"We believe that tax competition is beneficial and does not constitute illegal state aid; we do not favour the creation of a common, consolidated corporate tax base."
"Nevertheless, we congratulate Mrs Vlasto and restate our commitment to the creation of an environment that encourages small businesses to flourish."
"Small enterprises are crucially important to creating jobs in the Member States and thus to Europe’s future development."
"This is not, however, a cross-border issue."
"On the contrary, each Member State must decide for itself how it wishes to design its small enterprises policy."
"Institutional competition, in which the Member States are able independently to find sound solutions without being locked into rigid EU regulations is incredibly important to the development of small enterprises."
"Precisely for that reason, we believe that the EU is not the solution when it comes to bringing about an environment friendly to small enterprises."
"The report states that there are obstacles to the development of small enterprises, for example in terms of obtaining credit and dealing with complicated tax systems and with administrative procedures for gaining access to Structural and Development Funds."
"The Member States must do more to make things simpler for small enterprises, and concerns are expressed about there being big differences in respect of education in entrepreneurship and the cultivation of the spirit of enterprise in schools."
"It also states that the Charter should have the force of law and be binding because the Member States’ involvement would then be greater."
"Believing that a European Charter and annual reports are the solution is just another example of the EU not being sufficiently rooted in reality."
"The June List has therefore voted against the report."
". Small and medium-sized enterprises play a vital role in competition and innovation, in vocational training and even in spatial planning."
"They create jobs and wealth."
"This is all the more remarkable when you consider that they are often collapsing under fiscal, social and regulatory burdens that are as much as they can bear; that they have to face unrestricted global competition without the weapons of the big companies to defend themselves; that they find it more difficult to access capital, which is so vital to investment; and that a change of ownership often threatens their very existence."
"Could the solution come from Brussels?"
"I doubt it."
"Europe's policies have never really taken account of the interests and characteristics of SMEs, even though they make up 99% of businesses."
"Aid and Community programmes are mainly accessible to firms with specialised departments to deal with them."
"European legislation is staggeringly complex, and the standards imposed are expensive to implement."
"The policy of opening up the market to unbridled and unfair global competition only adds to the problem."
"It is true that free enterprise creates wealth and employment, and it is true that we need to promote it."
"But if the European Union is to play a part in this, it cannot continue to be a technocracy that is more committed to European ideology than to the interests of Europeans."
". This Charter is a good thing, and even a success, in that it has been implemented in 35 countries."
"However, this implementation leaves much to be desired, as illustrated by this fifth report which, moreover, relates to only three of its ten lines of action."
"I tabled an amendment in an attempt to rectify an omission in this Charter, which fails to take account of the fact that, in many Member States, the owners of these small enterprises and, above all, the millions of spouses working for them, are not covered by social security."
"Since 1997, Parliament has been calling for a framework statute for this invisible workforce."
"We proposed an amendment to the 1986 directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity."
"The European Commission has ignored our requests."
"I find that particularly regrettable given that the report on which we are voting does not include my amendment and that some arcane procedure has prevented me from putting it forward again in plenary."
"However, since the resolution makes reference to social security systems for stimulating business enterprise, I hope that my suggestion will be taken into consideration when applying the Charter's third line of action, focusing on better legislation and regulation."
"I wish to congratulate Mrs Vlasto on her important report on implementing the European Charter for Small Enterprises. I lend my full backing to this report, and particularly welcome the idea of extending the Charter to cover a wider range of countries, not only EU candidate countries but also Mediterranean countries, which will help develop the European neighbourhood policy."
"It is essential that specific, simplified measures and investment programmes be adopted, namely the creation and development of local funds of risk capital and ‘business angels’ financing programmes, which will pave the way for increased investment in innovation by local and regional small businesses."
". I welcome this report on the implementation of the European Charter for small and micro-enterprises."
"The focus of the Charter should be kept and the participation of these enterprises in various EU programmes further encouraged."
". The report on the European Charter for Small Enterprises is of major importance given the fabric of European business, which is mainly made up of small enterprises."
"As the rapporteur on sustainable tourism for the EU, I have no hesitation in welcoming the measures being taken in this key area for tourism, which is clearly one of the most important economic sectors in European economic growth and development."
"In our view, the priorities of a qualified workforce, training in entrepreneurship and better legislation will make it possible to play to the sector’s strengths, to address any shortcomings and to support growth in the various countries parties to the Charter."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Vlasto report."
". SMEs are the backbone of the European economy, job creation and regional development."
"The involvement of SMEs is therefore a vital factor in implementing the objectives set in the Lisbon Strategy aimed at fostering sustainable growth and creating more and better jobs."
"I therefore welcome the implementation of a European Charter for SMEs, which will enable EU Member States to enjoy the benefits of exchanging good practice."
"The purpose of this report is to strengthen the SME dimension in Community policy. To this end, it recommends streamlining existing European instruments."
"This report once again draws attention to the difficulties experienced by SMEs in accessing European Union programmes and related funding."
"In addition to these obstacles, the situation will only become worse, given that the financial envelope for the next financial perspective 2007-2013, as adopted by the Council, fell victim to swingeing cuts of some 50%."
"I refer to projects from which the SMEs benefit under the heading ‘Competitiveness, growth and employment’, and more specifically the Seventh Framework Programme for development and the programme for competitiveness and innovation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I voted today in favour of Mr Fruteau’s reports on reform of the sugar market, I did so quite deliberately, for the sugar market in the EU is a very sensitive one."
"Sugar beet is an important product for many of our farmers, being one that can be cultivated in places where the conditions are too adverse for other agricultural produce, and so well-considered reform is vital if the survival of farms – the small and medium-sized ones in particular – is to be ensured."
"Reform is needed, but the Commission’s ideas about it again far overshoot the goal, and so we are today calling for even smaller cuts in the price of sugar and beet, more support for the cultivation of sustainable raw materials as a substitute for the cultivation of beet and higher compensation payments."
"The Council, too, has seen the need for adjustments and has, in its decision, referred to many of our demands."
"The Council decision in itself amounts to a triumph for this House and for Europe’s sugar-beet farmers, but the cuts still go too far."
"In the light of these events, I think it sends completely the wrong signal that the Council should, at the Commission’s insistence, formulate a statement of intent even before Parliament has voted."
"I believe that the amendments we have proposed today represent an even better way."
"What we have here is a good reform;"
"I want a better one."
"It is for that that I stand, and for that that I, today, have voted."
". We have to stop giving with one hand and taking away with the other!"
"This report tries to strike a balance between protecting the income of European farmers and that of farmers in the ACP countries."
"It thus provides for a smaller reduction in price, spread out over time, so that the ACP countries are better able to absorb the impact of reform, and a substantial increase in access to the European market for sugar from the least developed countries."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament's two amendments also move in the right direction, by providing for the complete elimination of European export subsidies (by 2013 at the latest) and compensation for the restructuring of the sugar sector in the ACP countries, based on an estimated requirement of EUR 200 million a year."
"Admittedly, I would have liked the EU to go further, by providing the funds for this restructuring immediately, instead of the miserly EUR 40 million that has been promised (we proposed twice that amount in the Committee on Development)."
"I would also have liked the 'everything but arms' initiative to enter into operation as of 2009 and the EU to make it impossible to export sugar at low prices under quota C."
"We will continue the battle as part of the ongoing negotiations on the financial perspective."
". The reform is essential."
"However, the collateral damage of this reform should not be felt by small, vulnerable ACP economies with whom we have a very special relationship."
"African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries rightly feel that they have been abandoned and betrayed by what has been agreed in the Council."
"What has been proposed by Parliament today is equally unsatisfactory and for this reason I voted against the resolution."
"Parliament has today voted for a delay in the implementation of the Everything But Arms (EBA) Agreement."
"Such a move would seriously limit the promise of an initiative designed to provide least developed countries with duty-free and quota-free access to the EU's sugar markets."
"I call upon the Council to honour its commitment to EBA by implementing no delay or safeguard mechanisms."
"We now must look to the future and make sure we provide ACP countries with adequate financial support for their restructuring."
"Compensation amounting to EUR 7.5 billion has been offered to European farmers, whereas so far the ACP has only EUR 40 million."
"Today, Parliament agreed that the Commission's estimates of ACP needs of EUR 200 million must be met with new and fresh funding."
"I hope this will be listened to."
". I welcome the decision taken by Parliament today to endorse the much-needed reform of the EU Sugar Regime."
"This reform will improve the competitiveness of the EU sugar sector by removing the artificial supports to production that have encouraged overproduction and dumping of subsidised EU sugar on world markets at prices often below the cost of production."
"To this end I voted in favour of ending trade-distorting EU export subsidies at the latest by 2013."
"These subsidies depress world market prices, have an adverse affect on the ability of developing countries to trade and contradict the Union's own development policy objectives."
"I also voted to ensure that the EU honours its commitments to some of the poorest countries in the world to allow duty-free and quota-free access from 2009 to our markets for their sugar through the Everything-But-Arms Initiative."
"There should be no further delays and no restrictions as an incentive to these countries to develop their infant industries."
"I regret that no new money has yet been agreed to help producers in the 18 ACP Sugar Protocol countries in view of the generous financial package available as part of this reform to EU producers."
". The Commission's philosophy is Malthusian; its slogan is 'No future'."
"It takes its inspiration from nihilism."
"Destroy: destroy the coalmines, the steelworks, the textile industry and, above all, agriculture."
"We have arable land: they leave it fallow."
"We have milk: they impose quotas."
"We have vineyards: they tear them down."
"But all of that was not enough to kill us off, so they overhauled the common agricultural policy."
"They invented decoupling – in other words, being paid for not producing anything – because that is their philosophy: do not create."
"They have just one ideal: a vast continental retirement home, fed by mass redundancies."
"The overhaul of the common organisation of the market for sugar is a perfect example of this ideology."
"We have sugar refineries: the Commission is going to pay them not to produce anything."
"For every tonne of sugar they do not produce, they will be paid EUR 400, 500 or 600."
"For four years."
"After that, there will be no producers left, just consumers who have no means to consume, and it will only remain for them to be eliminated."
"Long live death!"
"That was the rallying cry of the Brahmans."
". We very much welcome the reform of the sugar regime, but there are many parts of this report drawn up for Parliament by its Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for which I will not be voting."
"The sugar regime had been in need of reform for at least 15 years when the Court of Auditors carried out an extensive study on the sugar regime (Special Report 4/91) and concluded that the system suffered from oversupply and inefficient production patterns and that it was not budget neutral."
"I cannot accept the call for the 'introduction of modifications'."
"We need radical overhaul, not just modifications."
"I cannot vote for lesser price cuts, increased compensation, and less quota cuts than proposed by the Commission."
"I will not vote for structural or social cohesion policy instruments to be used to cushion sugar farmers."
"Large amounts of CAP funds are already available for EU farmers."
"I agree that we need to control imports from Lesser Developed countries (LDCs) and guard against triangular trade, but we are talking tiny amounts here: 125 000 tonnes from LDCs."
"EU sugar production is around 17.4 million tonnes. Why are we focusing so much on LDC imports here?"
"Market imbalance is not going to come from LDC imports."
". The reform of the EU sugar regime will require a great deal of restructuring by EU producers and farmers, as well as by farmers in the Sugar Protocol countries, whose livelihoods have been structured by trade with the EU for over 40 years."
"Whilst necessary compensation and support schemes are available to EU farmers as part of a generous financial package, I regret that no new and fresh money has yet been agreed to help producers in the 18 ACP Sugar Protocol Countries."
"I believe that the EU has a duty to provide adequate funds for restructuring assistance to these countries under the financial perspectives, above and beyond the 40 million euros committed so far for 2006."
"I therefore voted in favour of an amendment to enshrine EU assistance to the ACP countries within the Direct Support proposal."
"I believe the Commission proposals for the new financial perspective, allowing for an amount of 190 million euros per year to help ACP producers adjust to the sugar reform, are the basis for a more acceptable adjustment scheme for our ACP trading partners."
". The British Conservative delegation voted against this report because its main recommendations do not serve the interests of efficient UK sugar producers, nor would they, in our view, bring about the reduction in EU sugar production needed to avoid linear quota cuts in future."
"It is unfair that our growers, who tend to produce more than 300 tonnes per year, should be punished for their efficiency by receiving only 50% compensation."
"This figure is considerably lower than that proposed by both the Commission and Council."
"Furthermore, the idea that Member States may retain an unspecified amount of their subsidies linked to production flies in the face of the recent CAP reform and would allow less efficient producers to maintain overall production at an unsustainable level."
"However, we support the report's direction in terms of increasing the energy crops premium and increasing the maximum guaranteed area for such production so as to encourage the promotion of biofuels."
"Mr President, I have always accepted the need for a review of the common agricultural policy’s sugar regime, but I object to the total destruction of the sugar industry in my country and in other EU Member States."
"Ireland is facing the prospect of closure of its only processing plant."
"According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, world sugar consumption in 2004-2005 was 144.8 million tonnes, with production at only 149 million tonnes. We can expect an exponential increase as China, India and many other rapidly developing economies increase their sugar consumption from the present 10 kg per capita per annum to the European average of 35 kg per capital per annum."
"We must retain production and processing capacity to face these future challenges."
"Having lost the vote on the common organisation of the market, I logically supported the other two reports – on direct support schemes and the temporary restructuring of the sugar industry – in order to secure the best possible deal for Irish, EU and ACP growers."
"Overall, Parliament’s position is an improvement on the proposals from the Commission and the Council, but it does not go far enough."
". I acknowledge that the European sugar sector is in need of reform."
"In order to make it fair and effective, however, the reform needs to strike a balance between:"
"international trade commitments entered into;"
"the proposed objectives for increasing the sector’s competitiveness;"
"the stability of the EU market;"
"the sector’s viability and sustainability, with particular regard to guarantees of income for European producers;"
"and the preferential trade arrangements granted by the EU to ACP countries and the least developed countries, not least via incentives to export sugar to the EU, under the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative."
"To this end, I welcome the broad guidelines for reform proposed in this report, along with the amendments to improve upon the Commission’s proposals for reform, as follows:"
"a less drastic reduction in prices;"
"the establishment of a trade regulation;"
"the implementation of measures aimed at absorbing the economic shock of the reform;"
"and support for developing different products to provide sugar production with an alternative outlet."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
". They say it is better to give a fishing rod than a fish."
"Of course, if we are going to callously shut down sugar production in Ireland and the EU, we can and must properly compensate the farmers and producers....even if just to salve our consciences."
"But are we crazy?"
"Why are we shutting down sugar production when we desperately need to find alternatives to petroleum fuels?"
"Why are we paying to have empty fields and rusting equipment, when we need sugar production more than ever."
"Sugar has other uses besides sweets."
"On the one hand, we are warning of the disappearance of oil and promoting alternatives."
"On the other hand sugar - one of the viable alternatives - is being made to disappear."
"One hand doesn't seem to know what the other is doing."
"How can we accomplish anything?"
"And while we are planning our own compensation package, remember third countries like Mauritius which are being devastated by our sugar reform."
". There is broad agreement that the sugar sector needs to be reformed in order to make this important industry more sustainable, in line with the latest reform of the CAP and with the EU’s international obligations."
"Despite these noble objectives, however, the reform proposed by the Commission would cause serious problems for Europe’s farmers, not least the swingeing reduction in the price of sugar."
"I therefore endorse Mr Fruteau’s report, along with the work carried out by the various political groups in the Committee on Agriculture, which I feel sends out a very clear message to the Commission and the Council."
"In addition to capping price reductions to 30% in the Common Organisation of the Market in sugar, I wish to highlight Amendment 3, on support schemes for farmers, which refers to the possibility of Member States continuing to enjoy production-linked subsidies, at least to some extent. This will help prevent the rapid disappearance of the sugar sector in the regions most under threat from this reform."
"I would also highlight the safeguarding of the possibility of the restructuring fund supporting those giving up on part of the quota, Amendment 7, which will enable some businesses to effect their conversion."
"We support a radical reform of the sugar sector within the EU."
"It is absurd to prop up an uncompetitive market through extensive protectionism and significant financial aid."
"The European Parliament is attempting to impede the Commission’s proposals for reform."
"The European Parliament wants the reform to be implemented over a longer period of time, price reductions to be limited, restructuring aid to be increased and production in areas with ‘climatic structural conditions’ to be accorded special forms of support."
"As a consequence, necessary structural adjustments will be postponed."
"Overall, the Commission’s proposals for reform are more far-reaching."
"We have thus chosen to vote against the European Parliament’s proposals."
"."
"I would explain my votes against Amendments 73, 18/rev. and 18 to the Fruteau reports on, respectively, the COM in the sugar sector, common rules applicable within the framework of the CAP, and the scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the EC."
"I have followed this extremely closely, given the social and economic repercussions that a bad reform could have for many European regions, many of them Spanish."
"I well remember the arguments put forward both by the Commissioner and by the chairman of the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture, defending the possibility that the Council might adopt a political agreement before the parliamentary procedure had been completed."
"The Hong Kong Conference was not going to wait for us, and nor was the sowing season."
"President Daul explained this by means of a letter to Commissioner Fisher-Boel."
"The arguments were powerful, and we understood that."
"I cannot therefore, in relation to this dossier, vote today in favour of this entirely unjustified criticism of the Council."
"For all of these reasons, and because the agreement reached is as close as possible to the position of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I have voted against these three amendments."
". The sugar sector needs to be reformed in order to make it more sustainable, following the latest reform of the CAP."
"This reform, however, would cause serious problems for Europe’s farmers, not least the swingeing reduction in the price of sugar."
"The fact that the Commission’s proposal was drawn up more from the point of view of the interests of the major surplus producing countries than that of the smaller countries which do not even produce enough sugar beet to satisfy consumption, as in the case of Portugal, only serves to remind us that it is not countries like Portugal that are unbalancing the international market."
"I should accordingly like to point out the possibility, proposed in this report, of Member States continuing to enjoy production-linked subsidies, at least to some extent. This will help prevent the rapid disappearance of the sugar sector in the regions most under threat from this reform."
"It strikes me, therefore, that the possibility of the restructuring fund and support for those giving up on only part of the quota has been safeguarded. In this way, the sugar industry in some countries, such as Portugal, can move away from the agricultural sector towards sustaining the processing side of the industry."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Fruteau reports."
". I voted for this resolution."
"I strongly condemn the continuing abuse of the human rights of innocent citizens on a massive scale in Chechnya."
"Democratic, human rights and governance aspects must be an integral part of the EU's policy for cooperation with Russia."
"A Russia characterised by democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights is a Russia that is more attractive to foreign investment."
"It is also a neighbour that is more stable and more predictable."
". Chechnya was conquered by Imperial Russia in the 19th century, its people were intermittently deported by Stalin, and, more recently, under Yeltsin and Putin, they have been bombed and murdered."
"Following the first war, in the 1990s, the peace negotiator Alexander Lebed agreed, on Russia’s behalf, to the democratic choice of independence being made possible following a transitional period, but this has never come to pass, and so one can no longer expect the Chechens to regard their country as part of Russia."
"No people is willing to subject itself to those who have been most brutal in murdering and oppressing them, and so the resistance will never come to an end, and, I fear, nor will its suppression by means of a military superpower."
"This resolution is relatively mild about the intimidation and deception that marked the elections that have now been held, with the intention of conjuring up majority support for Moscow’s puppets."
"Moreover, the text again lays emphasis on the territorial integrity of Russia, even though the retention of this region as part of Russia is founded upon nothing more than violence."
"Given the present desperate situation, this resolution, which rightly draws attention to the many abuses, is preferable to continued silence in the face of the misdeeds of our principal supplier of energy, and so I have voted in favour of it."
". I was glad to support this resolution and the work of my group colleague Bart Staes who I know has been working closely with the Chechen community."
"The situation in Chechnya can be ameliorated by EU involvement, and this motion contains ideas which we must ensure are taken forward."
"Mr President, the Duff/Voggenhuber report amounts to the European Parliament itself wiping the floor with democracy and is an expression of its belief that the referendums in the Netherlands and France are an irrelevance and that the Constitution must enter into force in 2009 by whatever means and no matter what else happens."
"That is actually even worse than the European Commission’s simply acting as if it is no concern of theirs."
"That is actually just as bad."
"We in this House are in very bad company when the EU is under the presidency of Austria, whose Chancellor, Mr Schüssel, is actually so shameless as to call for new referendums in France and the Netherlands, the idea being that the people must carry on voting until they vote the way the Eurocrats want them to."
"That itself is perhaps not that bad, given that there are also countries in which the people are not getting a vote at all – my own, for example, where there be no vote on such things as the European constitution and the monstrous thing has to be whipped through the parliaments without democratic consultation."
"In any case, all the European institutions are manifestly united in their contempt for national democracies and for the democratic will of the public."
"This is not the way to do something about the great repugnance that our people have for Europe."
"Mr President, having listened to the debate yesterday on this subject, I decided I had to say something about the bizarre concept of democracy that some Members in this place and the Commission have."
"I heard it said that in the referenda so far, more people have voted ‘yes’ than ‘no’ across all countries and that therefore we should be going ahead with this wonderful Constitution."
"As a group of my very wise constituents from Northampton and Daventry said to me during the general election in the UK last year, in England my party – the Conservatives – polled more votes than the Labour Party or the Liberal Democrats."
"So, maybe, using this wonderful Eurocrat vision of democracy, we should be the ones in power."
"Democracy is about following the democratic wishes of the people and ensuring individuals have the power to choose the direction in which they would like their local council, Parliament or Europe to go."
"It is not about stripping power from people, ignoring their views and giving it to a political class that believes it knows best."
"That is why I voted against this report."
"Mr President, during the discussions on the Duff-Voggenhuber report, some Members have made some very amusing comments, comparing Members who disagreed with them with ostriches."
"They have done so with good humour, and I congratulate them for that as, on the same subject last year, they did so rather violently – which just goes to show that we were right to amend the Rules of Procedure."
"I would like to come to the defence of this much-maligned bird, because no naturalist has ever seen an ostrich put its head in the sand."
"On the contrary, it is well known that, when approached by a lion, an ostrich will sacrifice itself to protect its young, by moving away from the nest and allowing the beast to eat it."
"The ostrich, therefore, is there to sacrifice itself for future generations: it is a symbol of courage and devotion!"
"So, for any scientist or naturalist, being described as an ostrich is not an insult, but an honour!"
"Mr President, I would like to make a brief statement on how I voted on the Voggenhuber/Duff report."
"It is a good report, the main gist of which is that Europe needs to move on, and that is important, because those, too, who voted ‘no’ in the referenda were not happy with the present state of Europe."
"The report argues that popular support is essential, and that a variety of options are available, and that too is important since the referenda are a matter of fact, with the ‘no’ votes in the referenda in France and the Netherlands and the ‘yes’ votes in those in Spain and Luxembourg."
"I am also very glad to see that the present text incorporates Amendment 18, which explicitly states that the objections of citizens in countries like France and the Netherlands must be met halfway."
"That is clear as daylight; it is what makes this such a good report, the gist of which is that we must move on, that we must be bold enough to get out of this impasse, but that we must do so by way of the various options open to us; the period of reflection in which we now find ourselves, taking the public into consideration, including in the countries where things have gone wrong."
"That strikes me as a healthy approach, and that is why we, in the CDA delegation, are enthusiastically supporting this course of action."
"Mr President, half a year on from the French and Dutch ‘no’ vote, we see the European Parliament consigning to the wastepaper basket the democratically expressed will of the majority."
"It appears that the Constitution absolutely must, come what may, enter into force at some point during 2009."
"It is ironic that one reason cited in the report for why a European constitution is necessary is that, following the accessions of Bulgaria and Romania, no further enlargement will be possible under the terms of the current Treaty of Nice."
"It is a matter of common knowledge that opposition to further enlargements, and certainly to the possible accession of Turkey, was one of the most important reasons for the rejection of the Constitution."
"Today sees this House proving once more just how remote it is from the citizens that it claims to represent even so."
"In this report on the period of reflection, Parliament had a unique opportunity to do something useful: it could have been the first European institution to reflect on realistic options for resolving the situation created by the 'no' votes in France and the Netherlands, based around two aspects: a constitutional text refocused on Parts I and II and a revision of Part III on policies."
"That was what the co-rapporteurs from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, whose ceaseless efforts I welcome, wanted, and I co-signed their amendments advocating a 'constitutional core'."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament rejected this pragmatic and worthwhile policy, and restated their commitment to the current text of the Constitution."
"This is the idea that it is still possible to make the French and Dutch vote again on the same text."
"This denial of the popular vote is futile, whatever the positions of the various parties: that is why I am pleased that the French socialists, with a few exceptions, abstained."
"In the end, the only useful message to be taken from this report is that the period of reflection will need to continue until June 2007."
". The pause for reflection on the European Constitution has so far been characterised more by silence than by debate."
"Although Parliament, by means of this resolution, is making a creditable attempt at re-launching the debate, the resolution also gives voice to the expectation that one result of the period of reflection will be the retention of the present-day text of the Constitution, something I regard as deceptive and undesirable, in that it takes no account of the rejection of the Constitution by the French and Dutch electorates."
"It is lamentable that Parliament has, on this point, disregarded the warning given by its rapporteurs, Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, and it is for that reason that I have abstained from taking part in the final vote on the resolution."
"The period of reflection must be used to prepare agreement on a procedure that is as democratic as possible for a new reform of the Treaties."
"In saying ‘no’ to the Constitution, the French and the Dutch were certainly not saying ‘yes’ to the way Europe is today."
"We have voted in favour of the report on an assessment of the debate on the European Union."
"We believe the report to be mainly sound, but we wish to emphasise that it is not the European institutions’ task to convince people about which changes are necessary or constructive."
"Opinion forming and political debate must have their basis in the commitment of individuals and be inspired by those who play a role in democratic society, by political parties and by other voluntary associations."
". The Duff/Voggenhuber report misjudges the political realities, both in the Netherlands and in France."
"To call, as it does, for the Constitution’s entry into force in 2009 to be guaranteed is an insult not only to the Dutch voters, but also to the rule of law within the EU."
"Other passages (paragraphs 1, 5, 7, and 31) also fail to do justice to the unambiguous no vote in the Netherlands."
"It is for that reason that I find it impossible to vote in favour of the report."
"I also think that the Netherlands has to make clear precisely what it wants – whether it wants to renegotiate the Constitution, continue on the basis of the Treaty of Nice or begin the whole process anew."
"If the Netherlands opts for renegotiation, it will have to state clearly what it wants."
"A clear message to the Netherlands from this House would have been all the more helpful in view of the fact that, in the Netherlands, the debate has been cancelled."
". I support and voted in favour of the report before us."
"The European Constitution has not ‘died’."
"The ‘no’ votes in the French and Dutch referendums on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe were not a ‘death certificate’, but merely the adjournment of the ratification process under way at the time."
"Nevertheless, in light of the negative results in France and the Netherlands, it does not seem possible to continue to try to ratify the current text without amending it."
"That being said, the idea of abandoning the draft Constitution is out of the question."
"A constitutional agreement, as the rapporteurs point out, is essential if the EU is to (re)gain the confidence of European citizens, to maintain the dynamic of European integration and to play a credible role on the international stage."
"Against this backdrop, the ‘period of reflection’ should serve to relaunch the draft Constitution, based on wide-ranging public debate on the future of Europe, involving the citizens, civil society, the social partners and national and regional parliaments."
"The purpose of this debate should be to clarify, deepen and perfect the Constitution, to examine the criticisms levelled at it, to find solutions to the constitutional crisis and to address the concerns of Europe’s citizens."
". We voted against this report, which we consider to be unacceptable pressure on the Member States and their democratic institutions, following the rejection of the so-called European Constitution by the people of France and the Netherlands."
"Although Parliament acknowledges that ratifying the Constitution now faces ‘difficulties that could prove insurmountable’, unless measures can be taken to address the concerns expressed in France, the Netherlands and in other Member States, the majority will still go ahead and transform the current period of reflection into the relaunch of the draft Constitution, on the basis of broad public debate on the future of European integration."
"What the majority in Parliament would like to see is a major propaganda campaign to pressure the citizens into accepting the so-called European Constitution."
"Although we agree that the Treaty of Nice does not constitute a foundation for the future – and this is why we voted against – we object to attempts at following the path of deeper neoliberalism, federalism and militarism."
"We want a Europe in which there is greater cooperation between equal, sovereign Member States, greater economic and social cohesion, greater solidarity and genuine commitment to peace and social progress."
". The failure of the Constitutional Treaty is less a problem of text than of context."
"From the outside, Europe is seen as the political entity with the highest level of public freedoms, social rights and environmental protection in the world."
"On the inside, though, our people have their doubts about an integration project for which the Member States refuse to provide the resources."
"Parliament's report has no answer to the doubts, the fears and the national egotisms."
"Instead of tackling the problems – lack of growth, unemployment, tensions in the countryside and in the cities – the Commission and Parliament are advocating dialogue and forums, in other words 'idle chit-chat'."
"Dialogue, yes, but about what?"
"About questions to which the political classes are unable to find answers?"
"The Union lacks not only a concrete vision for the future, but also true statesmen."
"I did, nevertheless, vote in favour of this report, but only to avoid siding with the opponents of a more integrated Europe with greater solidarity."
". The debate on the great European issues that has gone on over the last few months has been characterised more by emotion than by thought."
"Whether we are talking about the Constitution, the services directive or Reach – to name but a few – the challenge before us is to simplify the language we use and the way we communicate, in order not to leave the field to the so-called populists."
"Scarcely any other institution possesses so many structures and so many means for supporting communication, yet scarcely any other institution uses a language the complexity of which leaves it wide open to deliberate or involuntary misinterpretations."
"All too often, the two things that fall by the wayside in any debate about Europe are common reference to what has been achieved and an explanation of the new in that context."
"There are in essence two great schools of thought where the future of Europe is concerned."
"One of the things that the Constitution did was to show how those who want more Europe and those who want less combine to bring Europe to a standstill – not in the way they think, but in the way they vote."
"If these contradictions are made clearer and more readily comprehensible for the citizen’s benefit, a new and real European debate will be the result."
"The Duff report goes in the right direction; all that is needed is action."
". The majority in Parliament, including the Portuguese socialists and social democrats, has adopted an all-singing, all-dancing report."
"Under the cloak of a ‘period of reflection’, it says that there must be debate, yet, throwing caution to the wind, has already announced its conclusion: ‘to relaunch the constitutional project’; ‘to avoid another defeat’; ‘to deepen’ the ‘consensus around the Constitution’; ‘publicising’, with ‘adequate funding’, to ‘reassure and convince public opinion’; and to ‘ensure that the Constitution enters into force’, ‘during 2009’."
"Quite apart from the fact that it does not have the power to do this, Parliament is trying to muddy the waters and make the fraudulent claim that the ‘European Constitution’ has not actually been rejected."
"It was rejected by the French and by the Dutch, whereupon it ceased to have any value, at least according to the Treaties."
"It is no coincidence that UNICE, the European employers’ association, said in a letter to the Austrian Presidency: ‘there is an urgent need to find a way out of the current institutional crisis in the EU’."
"Europe’s captains of industry and the political forces carrying out their guidelines are, once again against the wishes of the people, trying to regain the initiative."
"I have voted in favour of paragraph 27, but I am not in sympathy with its second sentence."
"Public opinion does not need to be reassured."
"People can think for themselves and adopt their own view of the Constitution."
". I wish to congratulate Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber on their excellent report on the period of reflection: structure, subjects and context for an assessment on the debate on the European Union."
"I agree with the proposal that this period of reflection should be used for the purpose of relaunching the constitutional project on the basis of a broad public debate about the future of European integration."
"I also agree with the suggestion that this new democratic dialogue, which should be seen as a chance to promote European democracy, should be conducted and coordinated across the Union, structured by common themes and in realistic stages according to an agreed framework for evaluation, and designed to lead to decisive political choices."
"I also recognise that it is strategically important for political institutions to encourage a pro-active attitude on the part of the media (in particular television, the press and local radio) and to enlist them for the purpose of publicising and intensifying the debate."
"I agree, moreover, that the conclusions of the period of reflection should be drawn at the latest during the second half of 2007, and that a clear decision be reached at that stage about how to proceed with the Constitution, and that, in any case, every effort should be made to ensure that the Constitution enters into force during 2009."
". I welcome this report which clarifies, after the French 'no' to the Constitution, where we are in terms of future constitutional reforms of the EU."
"The rapporteurs are right to note that there are a number of options available to the Union, ranging from abandoning the constitutional project altogether, continuing to try to ratify the present text unamended, seeking to clarify or add to the present text, restructuring or modifying the text or embarking upon a complete rewrite."
"No conclusions should be reached on these options until the conclusion of the period of reflection, which should be in the second half of 2007."
". The Constitution, which the voters in the Netherlands and France so overwhelmingly rejected, was a mixed bag."
"Most of the electorate are all in favour of Council meetings being open to the public, of a subsidiarity test for national parliaments, or the tentative moves towards a citizens’ initiative in Article 47."
"These things could have been brought in long ago, even without a constitution."
"Far more contentious were the economic and military policy choices that this text was to set in stone, such as free unhindered competition being one of the EU’s main objectives, the constantly-extended liberalisation of services, or the constant upgrading of the Member States’ weapons systems."
"The practice of tied sales, which involves good points being taken hostage by bad ones, is one that the two rapporteurs want to adopt, in the belief that approval is only a matter of time."
"They even want to put a stop to the admission of new Member States until such time as the constitution has been approved."
"My party, the Socialist Party, is the largest of the parties that, in the Netherlands, waged a successful campaign against this draft Constitutional Treaty."
"After it was rejected by the voters, we tabled proposals in the Dutch Parliament for openness, a subsidiarity test and citizens’ initiative, similar to what Mr Brok recommended to this House on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the very same alternative that I had put forward in Amendment 6, the rejection of which represents a missed opportunity."
". Mr President, the scant attention paid to the historical and religious roots of the Union, the unimaginative ‘cut and paste’ approach to inserting the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty without anyone having the opportunity to intervene on its contents, the non-existent or, at any rate, limited information that reached Europeans regarding the decisions being taken within the Convention and an enlargement process which, despite undoubtedly adding value to and enriching the whole of Europe, was presented to Europeans without an effective media campaign that explained the reasons behind the enlargement and the opportunities it offered to everyone, are only some of the reasons for the breakdown in the ratification process of a Treaty that should have been a fundamental part of a Union with which, even today, its own people sadly find it difficult to identify themselves."
"I am convinced that the improvements made to the Constitutional Treaty are necessary and, with this in mind, we hope that at the end of the reflection period we can embark on a new path that enables us to clarify today’s controversial issues in a more effective and intelligible manner."
"For that reason, we will be voting in favour of this resolution in the hope that, with the involvement of all the Community and national institutions and of the representatives of civil society and the academic world, we can quickly arrive at a new and perhaps simplified text, but one that is endowed with a common soul with which all Europeans can identify themselves."
". – The report constitutes an unacceptable attempt to distort the will of the people of France and the Netherlands, who jubilantly rejected the reactionary European Constitutional Treaty, and attempts to reintroduce it through the back door."
"The report does not even bother to negotiate minor amendments to the content of the European Constitution, which it takes as given."
"With the most insolent disdain for the will expressed by the people, it attempts to organise a misinformation campaign in order to coerce the workers into finally accepting the European Constitution, so that it can enter into force in 2009."
"That is why it aims to organise an arranged 'social dialogue' and gives the media an even more active role in the attempt to brainwash the masses so that, with a gun to their head, they will consent to the adoption of the European Constitution."
"That is why it proposes that there should be a River Pactolus of money, in order to achieve the objective of changing people's minds."
"They need to accept the fact that the European Constitution is dead and no campaign to coerce the masses will resurrect it."
"The peoples of the ΕU need to understand that there will never be a good European Constitution from the imperialist union of European capital."
"The only positive development for the workers and working classes is the policy to weaken the ΕU and finally bury any attempt to reintroduce any so-called constitutional arrangement of this reactionary body."
". These are the reasons why I still reject the EU Constitution:"
"1."
"If we are to have any hope of a social and civil Europe, the Constitutional Treaty for the EU must once and for all be consigned to the archives."
"2."
"The EU Constitution is intended to significantly accelerate the militarisation of the EU and (in III-311) lays down a whole range of militaristic projects."
"3."
"The EU Constitution is intended to prepare the EU to be able to wage war on a global scale."
"It opens up scope for worldwide military interventions (I-41,1 and III-309)."
"4."
"The Constitutional Treaty for the EU includes an explicit obligation to rearm (I-41,3)."
"If it were to be ratified, there would be an even greater tendency to spend more money on armaments."
"5."
"With the Constitutional Treaty for the EU, the EU’s foreign policy would be bound only by the principles of the UN Charter rather than by the Charter as a whole (I-3,4)."
"This would make it possible for the EU to interpret them in such a way as to be able to wage war even without a UN mandate."
"6."
"The Constitutional Treaty for the EU serves as a programmatic blueprint, making it possible to push the militarisation of the EU forward without reference to the treaties as they currently stand."
"Among the examples of this are the extension of the EU Armaments Agency (III-311) and the establishment of the Battle Groups (III-312)."
"7."
"The Constitutional Treaty for the EU is intended to put neo-liberalism on a constitutional footing (III-177), something of which the anti-social Bolkestein directive is but an initial foretaste."
"The proposal by the German Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, that a repeat vote be engineered in France and the Netherlands by adding to the EU Constitution a declaration on the ‘social dimension’ of Europe which would not be legally binding is nothing short of scandalous."
". One of our most pressing concerns is to prepare the EU’s institutional structure for forthcoming challenges, such as future rounds of enlargement."
"I therefore agree that we will soon have to resume the institutional debate."
"I also feel that the debate that began with the ‘Constitutional Treaty’ needs to be concluded."
"The idea that there must be reflection, debate and closure on this issue would be one which I would accept and support."
"On the other hand, the idea behind what some have been saying, namely that there is only one possible outcome, whatever that may be, is one that I would neither accept nor support."
"Debate, and in particular the much-needed debate with the citizens, is by definition open and free, and I would strongly object to any attempt to restrict it."
". The draft constitution was just not the way forward for Europe, so attempts to rehabilitate it are not welcomed."
"I would be the first to say that the EU needs a new way of working, and indeed a new constitution, but not the flawed text so comprehensively rejected by the voters of the Netherlands and France."
"We need to take the EU back to first principles and establish what it is for, where it adds value and where indeed it does not."
"Across the EU, the institutions and practices of the EU find little favour in the eyes of our electorate, and we cannot blame them, we must alter our ways of working."
"If the EU did not exist we would need to invent one, but not under the draft constitution and not in its current form."
". I voted against this Report because I am wholly opposed to any initiative to resurrect the European Constitution."
"The welcome failure of the Constitution should have presented an opportunity for genuine reflection by the leaders of the European nations on the nature and direction of the European Union."
"Certainly the British people, and the people of many other countries, do not wish to subsume their nationhood into some state called Europe."
"Many share the British Conservative vision of an EU that is a loose community of sovereign nations, focused on the single market and cooperating closely in other areas where there is real added value."
"I note with concern the determination of the euro-integrationists to reintroduce a European Constitution by 2009, to spend more public money on propaganda campaigns to support this objective, and to introduce geographical and political limitations on the EU."
". I have voted against Amendment 26, 2nd part."
"This should not be taken to indicate that I am against a Europe-wide consultative referendum."
"In fact, I am very much in favour of that."
"However, all the academic and practical experience of referenda indicates that they should not be held on the same day as elections to a representative assembly or parliament."
"The conclusions of this report do not reflect the current situation in the European Union: how can we declare that the European Constitution must be ratified in 2009 and that the Treaty of Nice is completely useless?"
"How can we talk of a 'period of reflection' when the current draft Constitution was rejected definitively by two founder Member States of the Union?"
"The current treaty is certainly inadequate, but it has its uses."
"It needs to be improved gradually by means of other treaties and agreements, which could include some elements from Part 1 of the Constitution."
"At this stage of European reunification, is a Constitution not a bit premature?"
"It is now more vital than ever, in the interests of the Member States and the citizens, and in the interests of Europe itself, to come closer to the reality of life as experienced by the citizens of the new Member States and not to ignore them, otherwise the democratic deficit will worsen further."
"Can we give the new Member States confidence so that they can believe in the European project?"
"We must not draw premature conclusions, on behalf of the citizens of our Member States."
"Mr President, it is well known that this Parliament struggles to communicate with the people it supposedly represents."
"I recently talked to a group about how best to solve that problem and they told me that, in general, politicians were seen to be boring, grey and used language that is completely out of date."
"They kindly made the following suggestion, using the words of a contemporary recording artist, Tony Hatch, on how to make the European neighbourhood policy better understood."
"They said: ‘Neighbours, everybody needs good neighbours; just a friendly wave each morning helps to make a better day."
"Neighbours, everybody needs good neighbours; with a little understanding you can find the perfect blend."
"Neighbours should be there for one another; that’s when good neighbours become good friends.’"
"For all those that know the work of Tony Hatch, they would be very proud of the fact that this was read out here today."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I supported Mr Tannock's report on the European Neighbourhood Policy, which was adopted on the same day as the Duff-Voggenhuber report on the future of the constitutional process."
"Parliament has thus taken a consistent and ambitious political position that I very much welcome."
"The Constitutional Treaty will not be ratified without clearly established borders, enabling us to say which of the countries of Eurasia are not cut out to join the EU and which should be making active preparations for accession."
"In addition, the European Union's ambitions include a common foreign and security policy that, before putting the EU on the grand international diplomatic stage, should concentrate on its sphere of influence, and partnerships with the States and political communities around us."
"The whole point of this valuable contribution from Parliament is to define the future content of our policy towards Russia, Turkey, the Middle East and the Maghreb."
"Finally, I would like to welcome the report's reference to the need to define this neighbourhood policy in the near future, in agreement with the existing pan-European organisations such as the OECD and the Council of Europe."
"Mr President, I was pleased to vote for the report on the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"The European Union is not a fort; the European Union is not an island."
"We need good neighbours, cooperating partner states."
"The more countries living in peace, stability and prosperity we have in our neighbourhood, the safer we will be ourselves."
"The reason I still asked for the floor is that in my opinion, the importance of the good neighbourhood policy far exceeds the interpretation currently given to it by the European Union."
"In our current thinking, forced enlargement plays a much more serious part than the neighbourhood policy."
"Certain countries can never become members of the European Union, others are given vague promises, and others yet are regarded by some as privileged."
"I believe that it would be wiser to develop some sort of special partner status, and deepen the neighbourhood policy."
"Rather than accepting some countries and punitively ignoring others, we should be thinking in terms of a good neighbourhood policy."
". The EU must not overlook its duty to champion respect for international law and the development of a social market economy."
"We therefore need to shape the EU’s image in the world, by giving the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) a central role in maintaining constructive relations with those nearest to us, in order to build an area of peace and prosperity."
"I voted in favour of the Tannock report, on account of the importance that it attaches to Article 6 of the Maastricht Treaty as a cornerstone of the ENP, whilst making it clear that this policy is not an alternative to membership of the EU."
"Lastly, I welcome the recognition of the contribution made by future partners such as Cape Verde to our common fight against terrorism, illegal arms trafficking, poverty and human slavery."
"This recognition arises from the excellent geo-strategic positions adopted by these partners and the fundamental reforms that many of them have undertaken, not to mention the long-standing cultural and historical affinity with mainland Europe and with the outermost regions, including those in the Atlantic, owing to their geographical proximity."
"Generally speaking, the June List supports the EU’s neighbourhood policy because it is aimed at strengthening democracy and promoting trade and prosperity in countries within the EU’s immediate vicinity."
"We are therefore voting in favour of the report in the final vote."
"We believe that the instruments for the neighbourhood policy need to be flexible and cost-effective."
"There must be clear requirements for following up the results."
"The neighbourhood policy should be limited to issues concerning cooperation on trade, democracy and human rights."
"It must not, as it is at present, be used for extending the EU’s sphere of interest through the common foreign and security policy."
". The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is indicative of the high importance that the EU attaches to the construction of future relations with its neighbours, whether or not they are candidate countries for EU accession."
"It is certainly in the EU’s interest to promote democratic development in its immediate neighbourhood."
"The ENP should draw up a clearer strategy for relations with our neighbours that will contribute towards building and developing a common area of peace, stability, security, respect for human rights, democracy, the rule of law and prosperity, and will offer partner countries privileged relations and a prominent position in the EU’s external relations with other regions of the world."
"I support the rapporteur’s proposals highlighting the need to increase funding for the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) in order to address the problem of access to the internal market, to set out a clear strategy to combat international terrorism and organised crime, to improve legislation on energy networks and transport networks, and to cooperate on environmental issues."
"Lastly, special prominence should be given to energy policy, given that the EU is surrounded by the biggest oil and natural gas reserves in the world."
". I welcome this report."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy is a key strategy for the enlarged EU for establishing structured relations with all its new eastern and southern neighbours, the aim of defending and affirming the common values of democracy, respect for human rights and the development of common policies"
". The report, which this House has voted on today, by the British Conservative MEP Charles Tannock, reinforces once more the outlines of the EU’s neighbourhood policy, which is intended to pursue the EU’s geopolitical interests while being cloaked in rhetoric about human rights."
"1."
"The intention is that the EU’s neighbourhood policy should be a means towards creating a geopolitical sphere of influence for the European Union and its Member States, its efforts being aimed at the creation of ‘privileged partnerships’ for the neighbouring countries, including those of the South Caucasus."
"2."
"The report is quite frank about the geostrategic direction of the neighbourhood policy being towards securing the supply of raw materials for the EU."
"‘Energy policy’ is to be an important theme in the EU’s neighbourhood policy, as the EU ‘is surrounded by the world’s most important reserves of oil and natural gas (Russia, the Caspian basin, the Middle East and North Africa)’."
"It repeatedly emphasises the geostrategic significance of such transit countries as Georgia and Armenia."
"4."
"The plan is that the EU’s influence should be underpinned by bringing about regime change in Belarus and elsewhere."
"All that is needed is to consider the different treatment meted out to Belarus and Uzbekistan, the latter of which tolerates the presence of EU Member States’ military bases, such as the German one in Termez, for it to become clear that the primary concern here is with the extension of the EU’s sphere of influence."
"5."
"In terms of military policy, too, the neighbouring countries are being locked in to the EU, the idea being that they should be able to take part in military interventions and participate in the military structures of the EU."
"The EU has everything in place to be an important player on the international stage; not in the way that some would wish, but certainly an important body in international relations."
"This idea came from the European Neighbourhood Policy – in both formal and substantive terms – given that, in my view, it is close to home that the EU can and should play its main role on the international stage."
"Whilst I am in favour of greater enlargement, I am also aware of the finite nature of the process and of the fact that, come what may, it will always be necessary to develop policy aimed at promoting a vast area of peace, stability and prosperity around us."
"This is both a geo-strategic necessity and a moral obligation."
"I therefore feel it is vitally important for Parliament to keep a close eye on this policy – and the corresponding financial framework – because this is one area in which it is possible to translate words into action."
"The Mediterranean experience may not augur well, but there have been other, more positive, experiences, and we should be drawing on those."
". Cape Verde is a perfect example of democracy, good governance and respect for human rights and has deep-rooted historical, political, cultural and geographical ties with the EU."
"This puts it in a unique and privileged position for developing closer ties between Europe and Africa. The country is also a stable and secure outpost of the European area."
"Although it is Europe’s Southeast Atlantic border, Cape Verde has been included in other programmes that, in themselves, neither reflect the country’s actual proximity, nor recognise its identification with the values we share, such as the rule of law, the promotion of good neighbourly relations and the principles of the market economy and sustainable development."
"It is well known that the first contact has been made by the government and the largest opposition party in Cape Verde, to argue the country’s case for obtaining special status or establishing a partnership with the EU."
"The inclusion of the country in the Neighbourhood Policy could prove an important step in this direction. Cape Verde could also represent a vital counterweight in the policy, which would be all the poorer were it narrowly centred on the Union’s southern and eastern borders."
"I welcome the adoption of Amendments 36 and 38."
". I myself have seen in various countries the EU neighbourhood policy in action, and it is vital that this policy area be maintained so that our area of democracy and freedom can be extended."
"The EU is more outward looking than it is often given credit for, and while the past years have seen internal preoccupations claiming the most headlines, most of the achievements have been external, often behind the scenes."
"It is vital that these actions are continued and I was pleased to support this resolution."
"– Mr President, the fact that the Estrela report is certainly not the worst report we have approved in the history of this Parliament is of course a consequence of our fundamental agreement on the heart of the matter."
"Women have the right to be integrated into the normal working processes as the equals of men in every respect, with, moreover, the right to equal pay for equal work, although it is common knowledge that there is still a need for more progress in this area."
"On that, then, we are in agreement."
"I do, however, want to point out that, in every European Union Member State, a remarkably large number of women freely choose to work at home among their own family, and that even more women would be willing to take that option if it were financially feasible."
"Part-time work and good childcare facilities are partial solutions, but the introduction of full parental pay for those who work at home or have small children would be a very good step to take."
"In addition to that, it has to be said that there needs to be a solution to the issue of pensions rights and to the social security arrangements of parents working at home for all or part of the time, whose contribution to society is of incalculable value."
"We voted in favour of Amendment 19."
"We interpret the concept ‘guaranteed minimum income’, which appears in the above-mentioned amendment, as involving a guaranteed reasonable standard of living, as we are well-disposed to the idea of a guaranteed reasonable standard of living but opposed to the introduction of state-regulated minimum wages."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues fully support the principle of equal opportunities between men and women."
"We strongly believe that women as well as men have an important role to play in achieving the economic goals of the Lisbon strategy which must be to secure long-term economic growth and high employment levels."
"However, we have abstained in this report as we believe the measures identified are so prescriptive that they would achieve little in the way of the desirable goals of improving the position of women in the day-to-day economic life of the Member States of the EU."
"Men and women require, above all, to work in societies where economic growth leads to more and better career and job opportunities, thus enabling the higher degree of social provision this report states it wishes to see."
". The aim of the EU’s economic, social and environmental renewal, as projected in the Lisbon Strategy, was to turn Europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."
"As I wholeheartedly endorse these objectives, my concerns lie principally with the fact that European families still face inequalities in our societies."
"These must be fought in order to help people reconcile their work, family and private lives."
"This is the only way in which we can build a society geared towards lifelong education and training, at the root of which is ensuring that our citizens are knowledgeable and well-informed."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Estrela report."
". Social inclusion and respect for gender equality are fundamental principles underpinning the Lisbon Strategy."
"These principles, however, have yet to be anything more than good intentions."
"With regard to gender equality, the situation is most alarming: different levels of employment, salary, access to and progress in the labour market, education, participation in vocational training programmes."
"Equal treatment should be a key principle of Community law, yet we must translate political principles into practical action."
"The diagnosis has long been known."
"It is always the same problem: the Member States lack the courage and the determination to implement the solutions that have been identified."
"The financial perspective, in the form in which it was adopted by the Council, did not augur well, in terms of the swingeing cuts to the funds most closely linked with the Lisbon Strategy."
"I sincerely hope that the talks between Parliament, the Commission and the Council succeed in limiting the damage already done."
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on disability and development."
"Mr President, there are more than 600 million disabled people in the world, and over 400 million of them live in developing countries."
"Many disabled people are kept out of sight, insofar as their fellow citizens refuse to recognise the problem."
"In general, the disabled are also poor."
"They tend to be denied their fundamental rights such as education and work, and to be prevented from developing self-esteem."
"Clearly, however, the disabled do have the potential to be actively involved in developing their countries."
"It is often the case that development aid is not directly linked to the problems of the disabled."
"This means that the latter are condemned to social exclusion, marginalised, and become caught up in the vicious circle of poverty and disability."
"In this connection it is worth bearing in mind that disability and poverty are often related."
"The relationship works both ways."
"Disability increases the likelihood of poverty, whilst poor living conditions and a life of poverty increase the likelihood of disability emerging."
"One of the reasons why disability has not been given the attention it deserves may be a failure to understand and appreciate the potential of what might seem a powerless group, namely the disabled and their families."
"Taking the large number of disabled people into account, the short-term cost of their education and integration is bound to lead to economic gain for the disabled in the longer term, and for their families and for society as a whole too."
"In addition it should be noted that unfortunately the Millennium Development Goals also fail to take account of the needs of the disabled."
"In practice, neither cross-sectoral nor sectoral programmes make adequate provision for the disabled."
"Programmes aimed specifically at the disabled tend to be very small, and to have little impact on national or international strategies for combating poverty or for development."
"This should be remedied."
"We must remember that development also involves integrating individuals who have been excluded, such as the disabled, and making it possible for them to lead full and active lives."
"This means enabling them to attend schools, bring up their children, access health services and therapies, and be active members of society."
"The disabled have the right to break out of the vicious circle of poverty and disability."
"The number of disabled people in the world is vast."
"I will take the opportunity of Mr Bowis’ question to focus on two categories of preventable disability in the developing world: child blindness and explosive amputation."
"As we sit here today, there are approximately one million blind children in the world whose loss of sight could have been prevented; one of the most important causes being easily and cheaply treatable eye infections."
"At the cost of a few million euros, probably amounting to only a small fraction of one percentage point of our budget, we could have prevented one million children from living in total darkness for the rest of their lives."
"I dare propose that in addition to the WHO campaign VISION 2020, we attempt to set up and fully finance an EU ‘Stop Child Blindness Now’ task force with the aim of eradicating preventable paediatric blindness, as soon as possible, and certainly much sooner than 2020."
"Equally disturbing is the situation with the catastrophic effect of landmines."
"Many thousands of children in developing countries have had their legs and arms traumatically amputated as a result of landmine explosions."
"Before this parliamentary debate is finished, the chances are that a few children somewhere in Asia, Africa or South America will have their limbs blown to pieces by these satanic devices."
"We know very well which countries manufacture, sell and use landmines, yet we do not do enough to stop them and punish them for their evil doings."
"I dare propose that such countries should be blacklisted as soon as possible and drastic measures, such as a total economic embargo, should be imposed on them by our Union and preferably, if possible, by the whole international community."
"Child blindness and landmine-related loss of limbs in children are two forms of serious disability in the developing world that can be prevented to a very large degree, if we show willingness and determination so to do."
"Commissioner, please make the drastic proposal necessary to reduce these forms of disability and be sure that you will have the full support of our Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Bowis and the various speakers for having truly highlighted an issue which is too often forgotten and which illustrates particularly serious aspects of the human dramas that come with poverty."
"The education of disabled children, for example, is an integral part of education strategies in many developing countries, such as Uganda or Ethiopia."
"This issue is systematically dealt with within the framework of the programming and implementation dialogue between the Commission and the governments of the partner countries."
"I must say that the discussion that we have held today has come just at the right moment."
"From next week, and until April, I shall be visiting all of the regions that correspond to the regional organisations."
"I shall therefore be debating, discussing and defining and also listening to individual countries and regional organisations in order to try – as I had promised in the general development policy statement – to help our partners to develop or to propose coherent programmes that are genuinely convergent."
"That is not an easy task, because each partner keeps to its own domain."
"I must tell you, Mr Bowis, that I entirely share your view: so far, in the poor countries where many people are suffering, disabled people have been a category apart."
"For example, I have discovered genuine dramas, the extent of which is unimaginable, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it is normal for people to indulge in the hunting of ‘child-witchdoctors’."
"These are the children known as ‘child-witchdoctors’ simply because they are street children, who live alone and who are hunted down as if they were animals."
"It is horrific!"
"I have held political dialogue with the DRC and certain local associations on programmes which will be funded with a view to combating this phenomenon."
"I have seen and met these children."
"It is absolutely horrendous; there is no way to describe it."
"Not only do they suffer from physical handicaps, but sometimes also from mental handicaps."
"Armed, therefore, with the road map, the guidelines and the motion for a resolution that you will undoubtedly adopt, I promise you that I will make a point of dealing with this issue in all of the seminars and bilateral meetings that I hold in each country."
"In the country strategy papers, I shall ask for programmes and projects to be proposed directly involving these children and these disabled people."
"I believe that this has come at a really good time and I thank you for drawing my attention to this problem, because in the heat of action, we tend to neglect certain issues, and though it is true that the partner countries must make proposals, we must also make our own suggestions."
"Our partners usually focus on the problems which they see as priorities, but they ignore the marginal categories, the rejects, with all the dramatic consequences that that implies."
"On my return from these working visits on the country strategy papers, therefore, the objective of which is to produce a proposal on programming common to the Member States and the Commission, with a view to becoming more effective and consistent in the definition of our development programme, I propose that I present you with a report."
"I shall produce a report to Parliament at the beginning of April on the proposals or projects to which we have committed ourselves and, together, we shall evaluate the programme and any progress that has been made."
"I do not believe I can offer you anything more: I promise that I will use your motion for a resolution as a speaking note, and you will then judge whether any significant progress has been made."
"I promise to be systematic in the steps I take and to report to you objectively."
"I promise that I will do everything in my power to convince the partner States to make this dramatic issue an essential element of their social policy, of their education policy and of their cultural policy."
"I know of certain cultural projects aimed at groups of disabled people which have enabled young people to express themselves through art."
"There is a whole range of possibilities, and I can assure you that it is in no way a one-off appeal that I am making."
"You have made me very much more aware of this problem to which we often do not pay sufficient attention."
"I hope that, in April, I will be able to show you that the work of Parliament and the initiatives you have taken have not fallen on deaf ears: your proposal will be given the full place it deserves, since I am convinced that this is a just cause."
"To end the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions(1) in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place following this afternoon’s votes."
"The next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on Peru: extradition and trial of former President Alberto Fujimori(1)."
". Mr President, Mr Alberto Fujimori, the ex-President of Peru, found refuge in Japan after his government was accused of a number of corruption and human rights abuse charges."
"Numerous extradition attempts were turned down by Japan, but unexpectedly Mr Fujimori turned up in Chile recently as part of a strange attempt to return to political life in Peru."
"Subsequently the Peruvian Attorney-General requested his extradition from Chile in order to face a total of 12 charges, including using a death squad to kill 25 people in two separate incidents."
"We welcome and support the extradition of Mr Fujimori to Peru so that he may face the serious charges against him in a court of law and, if found guilty, be punished accordingly and appropriately."
"At the same time, I cannot help querying in my mind why it is that, although we expect extradition from Chile to take place, we were not so demanding on extradition from Japan when it was repeatedly requested in the past."
"Mr President, as the panel indicates, I am co-author of a motion signed by various groups supporting the extradition from Chile to Peru of the fugitive former dictator, Fujimori. This is to be done on the grounds of defending human rights, combating impunity and also helping to strengthen democracy in Peru."
"The combined evidence and documentation, provided not just by the Peruvian Government and judicial authorities, but also by international human rights organisations, is so overwhelming in relation to the murders, torture, corruption and abuse of power attributable to the former President Fujimori who, over ten years of authoritarian government, many of them under a dictatorial system, oppressed the Peruvian people that I believe that this extradition will take place, particularly in view of the enormous prestige of the Chilean judicial system."
"Nevertheless, the fact that an institution like the European Parliament is supporting this process is also undoubtedly going to help create an internationalist climate of cooperation between the two countries, whose relations are not easy, and this would be a step in the right direction."
"We have therefore helped support this resolution, and I am doing so now through my words and my vote."
"Mr President, it is important to understand that the resolution that the European Parliament is going to approve this afternoon is not directed against anybody."
"On the contrary, the Chilean Government and judiciary have acted in an exemplary fashion."
"The Peruvian Government has complied fully with its obligations by requesting that a fugitive from justice be extradited in order to face the many outstanding charges against him."
"Specifically over recent days we have witnessed a good example of democratic maturity in Chile, where the opposition candidate has sportingly acknowledged his defeat and made a point of personally congratulating the President-elect."
"We should not therefore be surprised that, following a model transition, Chile has become a benchmark for progress and growth, as well as for stability and democratic normality."
"The European Union, and this Parliament in particular, have also expressed their solidarity with the cause of democratic consolidation in Chile."
"It was my privilege to head a mission of Members of the European Parliament that attended the presidential election in 2000."
"For this reason, and on the basis of a request from the competent Peruvian authorities, I would ask, Commissioner, that the Union send a mission of electoral observers to the coming presidential elections in Peru in order to demonstrate our solidarity with the cause of democratic consolidation in that country."
"Mr President, nothing could be more logical in this context than the resolution that the European Parliament is going to approve this afternoon, the only purpose of which is once again to stress as emphatically as possible that, in a democracy, laws are designed specifically to be obeyed and that nobody either can or should be above the law."
". Mr President, the last two presidents of Peru, Fujimori and Toledo, presented themselves as miracle-workers and as saviours of the country."
"Each of them thereby managed to win the voters over once, only thereafter to leave them disappointed."
"Mr Fujimori himself makes no secret of his opposition to parliamentary democracy and ruled with disregard for the wishes of the electorate."
"That is in itself a good enough reason to punish him and deny him a second chance of leadership; the attempt to get rid of him by reason of his Japanese background has far less to commend it."
"It is reminiscent of the method that was used against the former Zambian President Nkomo, whose ancestry was used as an excuse to deny him the right, having been defeated once, to stand again."
"Having committed his misdeeds, Fujimori fled first to Japan and then tried to come back by way of Chile, evidently under the illusion that the great mass of Peruvians wanted to be led by a dictator and that they would return him to power."
"Now, throughout Latin America, presidents of a better sort are being elected."
"Fujimori’s miscalculation offers an outstanding opportunity to make it clear that even former presidents can be punished for their abuses of power."
"We are justified in insisting that he be put on trial in Peru."
"Mr President, in Latin America, dictators are gradually falling and democrats coming to power."
"I am particularly pleased that the abilities of progressive Latin American women are beginning to be recognised and that they are being democratically elected as Heads of State."
"Good luck, President Bachelet."
"The challenge is now for these democrats, both men and women, to take up the fight against impunity and courageously to ensure not only that the truth comes to light but, above all, that justice is done in their respective countries."
"Like Pinochet's arrest in London, Fujimori’s arrest in Chile is a clear sign that it is not only necessary, but also possible, to make progress towards such justice."
"Everybody knows today that, under the Fujimori regime, there were many violations of human rights, and in fact that regime was an exemplary example – if you will forgive the repetition – of nothing other than institutionalised corruption across the board."
"The extradition of Fujimori to Peru, where he must be tried with guarantees, is therefore desirable, though not sufficient."
"The European Union, in line with its firm commitment to combating impunity, must recognise the important work of the organisations of victims of the Fujimori dictatorship and of human rights activists and support them in their work."
"It is therefore desirable, for example, to support the National Coordinator of Human Rights’ initiative of 11 January 2006, urging the presidential candidates to sign up to an agreement on practical measures to support respect for human rights. These measures include implementing the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee and of the Integral Plan of Reparations for the victims of the internal armed conflict, thereby strengthening the High Level Multisectoral Commission (CMAN)."
". Mr President, speaking as a longstanding friend of Chile and Peru, the Fujimori extradition question is one of great interest to me."
"These two countries have very long memories, stretching back to the War of the Pacific in the 19th century, in which Peru lost Arica and Tacna to Chile."
"Thus it is that bilateral questions sometimes, regrettably, are coloured by the cloud of revanchism and regional rivalry."
"This House must emphasise that this can play no part in the decision regarding the request for Fujimori’s extradition."
"It is also clear that it has been a longstanding political objective of Mr Toledo’s present government of Peru to seek the return of former President Fujimori from Japan to face trial on charges of corruption and human rights violations during the long conflict with Sendero Luminoso and Tupac Amaru."
"Indeed, Mr Toledo’s officials raised this matter with me personally in Brussels last year during his state visit to Belgium."
"They requested that the EU raise the matter with Japan, and I agree with the previous speaker that we have been somewhat neglectful of this issue."
"It is also alleged that Mr Fujimori was elected President for the second time, in 2000, following a fraudulent vote."
"Fujimori, as we all know, eventually fled into exile in Japan in November 2000 after his security chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, was exposed as having bribed a congressman."
"Fujimori then rediscovered his Japanese nationality, something which under Peruvian law would have forbidden him from standing for public office, particularly as president, under Peru’s Constitution in 1990."
"It is scandalous, therefore, that Japan went along with this fiction."
"Although this is now a matter for the Chilean courts, extradition always has a political dimension between sovereign states, so I hope that the judges in Chile will accept that Mr Fujimori has a very serious case to answer before his people, whom he let down so badly in the past."
". Mr President, it has been said today, several times over, that this resolution is not directed against anyone, but that the European Parliament rejoices at this turn of events, and welcomes the cooperation between Peru and Chile that has resulted in Fujimori being arrested."
"The European Parliament, furthermore, supports Peru’s application for Fujimori’s extradition, and calls on the Peruvian authorities, as a matter of policy, to make sure that all witnesses receive comprehensive protection."
"Both of these are important factors in getting Fujimori to answer – as he must – for the human rights abuses and the corruption that went on in his country."
"The struggle against ‘impunity, is not just one of the main pillars of the European Union’s foreign policy, but also one of the foundations underpinning all states governed according to the rule of law."
"There are not a few Latin American states in which an excess of impunity has left so many open wounds, and they add up to yet another reason for supporting this cause and advancing it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the European Parliament for offering me the opportunity to take part in this debate on a possible resolution on the extradition of former President Fujimori to Peru."
"Peru has been courageous in analysing the unprecedented situation of political violence that the country suffered between 1980 and 2000."
"The ‘National Truth and Reconciliation Commission’ was created during the time of the transitional government led by Valentín Paniagua and confirmed by President Toledo."
"The European Union and its institutions have supported the work of this commission from the outset, and this support takes the form, in particular, of financial support from the Community budget."
"The European Union and the European Parliament have demonstrated their support for the work of this commission and the implementation of its recommendations."
"The European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights currently supports that implementation through a programme that has just been established with the ."
"It is within this framework that Peru is currently preparing for the presidential elections of April 2006."
"The international community sees it as extremely important that these elections take place within a climate of transparency, stability and calm and that they represent progress in the process of democratic consolidation underway."
"As you know, the European Union has made the defence of human rights and democracy the cornerstone of its foreign policy in general and of its policy on Latin America in particular."
"The fight against impunity is clearly an essential element of this."
"The Commission congratulates the Chilean and Peruvian Governments on their cooperation in the arrest of Mr Fujimori by the Chilean authorities, and of course we would encourage the two governments to continue to cooperate in this manner."
"Within this context, the Commission must express its confidence in the judicial systems of the two countries in question."
"The Commission is sure that Peru’s extradition request will be treated by Chile fully in accordance with the applicable legislation and that any solution will respect fundamental rights, entirely in accordance with international laws and standards."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place following this afternoon’s debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Egypt: violence against Sudanese refugees(1)."
". Mr President, on 30 December 2005, the Egyptian security forces cleared a camp that had been set up in front of the UNHCR’s main office in Cairo in September of that year as a temporary home for over 2 500 Sudanese migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers."
"In doing this, the security forces acted with great brutality, and the outcome of their actions is a very, very sad one: 30 dead and over 60 injured."
"The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior tried to pin the blame on the Sudanese, claiming that they had panicked and tried to flee, but journalists who were present report that nothing of the sort happened."
"If we adopt this resolution, we in this House will be joining a number of leading figures in the United Nations who have already denounced these occurrences."
"The UN’s Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, was critical of the security forces’ brutality and said that there could be no justification for this sort of violence and that this loss of human life was indefensible."
"It is a good thing that the Egyptian authorities have now decided to investigate what happened."
"We call on the Egyptian Government to allow the involvement in these investigations of human rights experts from the United Nations and independent Egyptian human rights organisations."
"Since respect for human rights is fundamental to Egypt’s association agreement with the European Union, we urge the Council and the Commission to raise these incidents at the next meeting of the EU’s Association Council with Egypt."
"The last thing I want to say is that I would like to move two oral amendments before the vote."
". Mr President, I should like to point out to the Commissioner that we welcome the decision of the Egyptian Government to start a full investigation into the incident of 30 December, in which, after the attack by the Egyptian police on the Sudanese refugee camp in Cairo, many deaths and injuries resulted."
"We hope that the investigation will be thorough and objective."
"We do not in any way prejudge that the blame for the incident will be placed at the feet of the Egyptian authorities."
"Nor are we claiming that the UNHCR regional representatives, and certain isolated elements within the refugee protestors, do not necessarily share some of the responsibility for what happened."
"That is why we feel that it is imperative that a truly independent investigation should be carried out into the incident in which, we should remember, 27 people, including children, died."
"We are confident that a fair investigation would not only get to the bottom of the problem, but will assist in the prevention of similar incidents occurring in the future."
". Mr President, I am glad to have an opportunity to speak and be one of the authors of this resolution, which aims to highlight a tragic and brutal event that occurred in Cairo, Egypt, on 30 December 2005."
"At least 27 people died: 9 women, 7 men and 11 children, according to the Egyptian authorities."
"However, certain eye witnesses, NGOs and members of the international press, would claim that the death toll was far higher."
"This happened when Egyptian security forces evacuated by force about 2500 Sudanese migrants, refugees and asylum seekers who had settled in front of the UNHCR headquarters, requesting to be relocated to third countries."
"In the short time available to me, I want to focus on a few points."
"Firstly, this Parliament has a responsibility to highlight and condemn actions taken by authorities that are a blatant and tragic breach of peoples’ human rights, particularly when these events occur in the EU neighbourhood and with countries that we are working with through cooperation and/or association agreements."
"In this case, the EU and Egypt have an association agreement that has been in force since June 2004."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Agreement, to which the EU and Egypt are parties, is also relevant, as is the Barcelona Process."
"So anyone who suggests that this issue is solely an internal issue for Egypt is wrong."
"This is our business, in the same way that what happens within the EU is Egypt’s business when it affects the agreements mentioned."
"Secondly, I welcome the commitment by the Egyptian authorities to start an investigation into what happened on 30 December."
"I urge the authorities to ensure that this investigation is absolutely open and transparent and involves UN experts and, if possible, Egyptian human rights organisations."
"The inquiry or investigation must be credible if we are to learn lessons from what happened."
"I hope that the silver lining on this very dark cloud that sits over the event will be a credible assurance from the authorities in Egypt that their security forces will act in compliance with international standards and without a disproportionate use of force in the future."
"Finally, this motion supports the UNHCR and calls on the Commission to establish a closer partnership with the UNHCR by offering both political and financial support to assist them in their office in Cairo in order to work more closely with the Egyptian authorities to find lasting solutions to the difficult situation of Sudanese migrants and refugees in Egypt."
". Ladies and gentlemen, the human rights situation in Egypt is highly unusual."
"Although not even the European Parliament has been able to protest at the fact that the army prevented voters from entering polling stations in a number of towns during the recent election, political stability must be safeguarded in Egypt in order to secure peace in the Middle East."
"Yet we must ask ourselves whether such political stability should be achieved at the expense of citizens’ fundamental democratic rights."
"The situation outlined in the motion for a resolution should serve as a stark warning in this respect."
"If the Egyptian authorities now not only regard supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood as a threat, but are even attempting to adopt regulations banning secular parties, then attention should be drawn to this fact."
"This would help to correct the mistaken belief that the approach adopted by the Egyptian courts is not something we view as a major departure from the norm."
"A situation in which the perpetrator of a questionable offence can be sentenced to several years in prison can only be interpreted in one of two ways."
"Either the country’s legal system contains highly irregular provisions, or the outcome of the judiciary’s work suggests the involvement of politics."
"In either case, we cannot remain indifferent."
"How can we ignore the fact that refugees from Sudan or elsewhere are being turned over to their country of origin, where they face the threat of death?"
"The fact that a peace deal has now been signed between the parties to the conflict in Sudan does not mean that the Darfur conflict has been resolved."
"The problem of the refugees and their possible repatriation needs to be tackled, in cooperation with the Sudanese and Egyptian Governments, although I am aware of the problems this entails."
"We should therefore support the work of the UNHCR, and prevent any further incidents that would violate international commitments, and in particular the UN Convention on Refugees."
"As I see it, it is utterly intolerable that prisoners should be tortured – even though this is the approach chosen by the United States – or that refugees should die when refugee camps are closed down."
"There can be no question that, pursuant to the Association Agreement, such matters must be investigated in an annual report, and I trust that this will happen."
"I am therefore in favour of the resolution."
"Mr President, the tragic events of 30 December in Cairo led to the deaths of 27 people, according to the Egyptian authorities, but in reality there were many more: dozens, even hundreds, up to 220 dead according to some sources."
"These events must be condemned as vigorously as possible, and the people responsible must be clearly identified."
"First of all, the responsibility of the Egyptian security forces, whose violence on this occasion must be condemned as vigorously as possible, must be acknowledged."
"They unfortunately have a reputation for resorting to systematic and excessive violence."
"The HCR must also bear some of the responsibility."
"Firstly, because it allowed the situation to become inflamed."
"Then, because it used ambiguous, even contradictory, language on the subject of the status of the Sudanese people."
"One only has to read the correspondence between the office of the HCR in Cairo and the Egyptian authorities to see this."
"Finally, because it directly called upon the Egyptian authorities to intervene, thereby running the risk of things getting out of hand."
"Nor must we lose sight of the deadlock in which these players found themselves."
"Following the signature of a peace agreement on 26 May 2004 in Sudan, all of the resettlement programmes were halted, even though we know that the situation in Sudan is still very unstable, as many reports indicate, including the recent report by Human Rights Watch."
"The States refusing to receive these people solely because a peace agreement has been signed should also therefore bear some of the responsibility."
"It is not proper to ask Egypt, which already accommodates between two and three million Sudanese, of whom 27 000 are registered with the HCR, to receive all of the refugees from that country."
"For all of these reasons, as other Members have said, I believe that it is important that an investigation be carried out."
"It is also important, however, for the Egyptian authorities to release all of the people still being detained, to cease all expulsions and to allow the representatives of the HCR free access so that they can look into the refugees’ demands."
"It is also important for this tragedy to be seen within the context of the general asylum and immigration policy."
"We cannot refuse asylum to people who are in danger in their country, and this is not just an issue for Egypt and Sudan, just as Ceuta and Melilla was not a Hispano-Moroccan issue."
"The Euro-African conference on migration must be held as soon as possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to repeat the arguments already expressed by the Members who have drawn up this motion for a resolution, but I really would like to emphasise the importance of this resolution, since it results from an extremely serious incident: the deaths of 27 people – officially, though the real figure is probably much higher, as other speakers have said – who had gathered peacefully outside the Office of the High Commission for Refugees in Cairo."
"As a result, we need to carry out an in-depth, serious, exhaustive, transparent and independent investigation, not just in order to call for any appropriate penalties to be imposed and civil, criminal or administrative liabilities to be established, but also in order to eliminate the possibility of any similar situations arising in Egypt in the future. The fact is that the flow of Sudanese people is going to continue, given the immigration from South to North - which also takes place in the region close to my own country - from countries to the south of Morocco, towards Morocco and towards Spain."
"The principle of human rights must be defended everywhere, whether in Morocco, Spain, Egypt or anywhere else. It must, as other speakers have said, especially be defended in a country that benefits from conditions attendant on its being a neighbour of the European Union."
"Mr President, have not the Sudanese people suffered long enough?"
"Firstly, they succeeded in surviving and fleeing from a war, and now they are persecuted in Egypt when they try peacefully to contact the UN."
"Egypt replaced many of its more senior officials and ministers at the end of last year, and now it is time for them to replace their police chiefs."
"We can never accept a state of affairs in which countries with which we cooperate so much should allow police forces to attack civilians in that way."
"I hope that we can cooperate very well with the UNHCR in order to obtain clarity about everything that happened in this situation."
"I wish finally to remind you that, for example, my own country has, with the help of the CIA, sent so-called terrorist suspects off to Egypt to be tortured."
"That is something that we ourselves must stop doing."
". Mr President, the subject of today’s debate on infringements of human rights and democracy are the tragic events in Cairo, where several hundred police officers attacked a significantly smaller group of Sudanese refugees, who had travelled to Egypt in search of help and shelter."
"The refugees were cornered and the Egyptian police then attacked them with water cannon and truncheons."
"Several of the refugees died and the fate of the rest of the group, which included women and children, is unfortunately unknown."
"Egypt likes to call itself a democracy, yet by this act it has joined ranks with the many other observers of the conflict in the Sudan, not all of them passive."
"The fighting has gone on for over 20 years, and two million people have lost their lives."
"Six million were forced to leave their homes and thousands of women and children have been kidnapped or raped."
"The United Nations Organisation has done little to support Sudanese refugees."
"It has granted refugee status to only a few thousand, most of whom wished to emigrate to the United States, Canada or Europe."
"In practice, Sudan has been in a state of war ever since it gained independence."
"The darker-skinned African population in the South of the country is protesting against discrimination by the Arab population that is now in power in Khartoum."
"Religion also plays a part in this internal conflict, because once in power the mostly Muslim Arabs have been treating the animist and Christian darker-skinned Africans like slaves."
"This is why so many attempt to flee to neighbouring countries such as Kenya, Egypt, Uganda or Ethiopia"
"We wish to register our outrage and protest against the treatment meted out by the Egyptian authorities to people seeking help."
"As we debate the issue in this House, we would be wise to consider not only the causes of the conflict but also the sources of the arms used in Sudan."
"The rich G8 countries promised to work towards an end to poverty and injustice."
"Nonetheless, these same countries are still exporting arms, ammunition and military equipment to poor countries involved in conflicts and helping to support repressive regimes."
"By so doing, the G8 countries are party to human rights violations and anti-democratic activities."
"The conflict in Sudan is also indicative of a failure on the part of the international community."
"The latter has not demonstrated the will to limit or put an end to the series of aggressions and injustices perpetrated over many years."
"We support the resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission believes it to be essential for all of the signatories to the Geneva Convention on the status of refugees to apply its provisions."
"For this reason, it shares the concerns expressed by the delegations of the European Parliament in relation to the tragic issue of the forced evacuation of Sudanese migrants and refugees in Cairo and the imprisonment of many of them."
"The Commission supports the initiative aimed at calling upon the Egyptian authorities to release all of the asylum seekers still behind bars."
"Following the recent release of two hundred and fifty refugees, we do not have any precise information about whether there are still women, children or refugees from the region of Darfur in prisons."
"All prisoners not accused of criminal acts should of course be released."
"We also agree with the demand that the process of expelling Sudanese asylum seekers be suspended and we insist on strict compliance with the principle of non-refoulement."
"The Commission also supports the request presented to the Egyptian authorities that they establish a public institution in accordance with international standards, which will be responsible for dealing with asylum requests."
"Within the framework of the action funded by means of the programme in the budget line relating to cooperation with third countries in the field of migration, since 2004 the Commission has been funding a project worth more than EUR 1 million through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, with the aim of enhancing protection for asylum seekers and refugees in Egypt."
"One of the objectives of this project is to support the creation of a unit responsible for asylum issues within the Egyptian Government."
"In this regard, the Commission has been informed that the negotiations between the HCR and the Egyptian Government have not been successfully completed."
"The Commission would like the Egyptian authorities to commit themselves as soon as possible to the actions laid down in the project."
"With regard to the responsibility of the HCR, I personally cannot endorse the criticisms expressed by one speaker in this regard."
"I know that it is extremely difficult for HCR officials to deal with issues of this nature. Through my job, I have very frequent contacts with staff of the HCR and I can tell you that the work of these officials is extremely difficult."
"They are obliged to respect the rules imposed on them in often extremely sensitive circumstances because, in order to help refugees, they must maintain correct, or at least positive, relations with the different governments."
"I therefore find that criticism rather excessive."
"I am not going to pass judgment on what has been said, but I believe it to be premature and, above all, these accusations would have to be verified."
"Within the context of the neighbourhood policy, the Commission, with the support of the Presidency and of the secretariat of the Council, is in the process of negotiating an action plan containing a proposal aimed at establishing a dialogue on asylum issues."
"The negotiations are underway."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place following this afternoon’s debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Cambodia: political repression(1)."
". Mr President, Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the world."
"It also suffers from the lack of an independent judiciary and widespread corruption."
"People trafficking, child prostitution, plus persecution and torture of political opponents with impunity are but a few of the features of everyday life in Cambodia."
"Repression of this kind, together with the arrest in recent weeks of representatives of humanitarian institutions, trade unions and journalists accused of spreading so-called false information have rightly awakened the concern of the international community."
"The Cambodian Government routinely uses the justice system as a means of repressing political opposition."
"Cambodia is in permanent breach of international agreements on human rights, notably the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention."
"It metes out inhuman treatment to people attempting to flee from Vietnam and organises brutal deportations."
"The international community must take decisive action to secure the freedom of all humanitarian organisation activists and to have the charges against them dropped."
"It must also press for an end to persecution and intimidation."
"The 1993 European Union-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement binds the Union to take specific steps to ensure full respect for all human rights in Cambodia, including economic, social and cultural rights."
". Mr President, last month, a court in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, sentenced the opposition leader Sam Rainsy, , to a prison term of eighteen months for slandering the prime minister, Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh."
"Mr Sam was also fined the sum of 20 million riel, which amounts to some EUR 4 000, allegedly for blackening the good names of his political rivals."
"At the beginning of this month, the Cambodian Government arrested two human rights activists: Kem Sokha, chairman of the ‘Cambodian Center for Human Rights’ and Yeng Virak, director of the ‘Community Legal Education Center’, who are being held in connection with the display of a banner marking the International Day of Human Rights on 10 December."
"A meeting with the American diplomat Christopher Hill resulted in the prime minister agreeing after all to release Kem Sokha and Pa Nguon Teang on bail, which happened on 17 January, but the charges of defamation against them and a number of others who were freed were not dropped."
"The sentence passed on Sam Rainsy and the arrest of the human rights activists are just a couple of examples of a whole series of slurs and accusations levelled at public figures in the last two years, which have seen the suspension of parliamentary immunity and the sentencing of Cheam Channy and, in his absence, of Chea Poch."
"This is a return to the days of the one-party state under Hun Sen. These developments are indicative of a new backlash and a slap in the face for the process of democratisation in South-East Asia."
"Dissident opinions and comments should be challenged by means of public debate rather than in courts of law, and the arrest of dissidents in Cambodia is a serious threat to freedom of expression and political pluralism in that country."
"We have to take action against this new attempt by those in power to neutralise the opposition and complete the process of turning Cambodia into a dictatorship."
"Mr President, Cambodian culture was once known worldwide as a symbol of peace, yet, since then, scarcely any other country has had as much to endure as Cambodia, which was occupied by foreigners during the Second World War, the later Vietnam War and twice over in the war over Indo-China; it then suffered the terrors of the Khmer Rouge, with their policy of exterminating millions of people in ways that defy comparison, followed by another variety of Communism – the Vietnamese one this time – which, too, involved rule by foreigners."
"After the country had endured all these horrors, the setting in motion of a peace process there has called for a great deal of political effort on the part of the United Nations, the European Union and, not least, the people who live there; it has been a complicated business and has called for a great deal of dedication and a lot of money."
"It can be said that what was accomplished then is, today, in ruins, for we see that another unjust regime is establishing itself in Cambodia, and, as that is something that we cannot accept under any circumstances, I would refer the House to paragraph 5 of our resolution, which states quite clearly that the agreement that we concluded with Cambodia is founded upon democracy and human rights."
"That is not an empty diplomatic phrase with which we politely introduce agreeable transactions; on the contrary, it spells out the terms on which business is done at all."
"The Council, the Commission, and this House, now have the task of making it plain to our Cambodian partners that if they keep on violating those terms, they will no longer be able to do business with us."
"We must, once and for all, get effective pressure put on Cambodia to uphold human rights, and that means more than just sending protest notes."
"It is for that reason that I would suggest that we should – and as soon as possible – invite the United Nations special envoy to Cambodia to this House for in-depth discussions with him about the state of affairs in this tormented country."
"We can rejoice that our pressure and that exerted by the Americans – for it is good that we are cooperating in this – has resulted in the release of prisoners, but, while certainly acknowledging this, we know that they are still going to be put on trial."
"We know that there are many other prisoners, and that many more summonses and arrest warrants have been issued, and we are particularly aware of the repression of minorities."
"In contending against these things, we must do so with persistence, for persistence, above all, is what human rights policy is all about."
". Mr President, Cambodia was a peaceful neighbour to Vietnam, until foreigners intervened in its affairs at the beginning of the 1970s."
"In Vietnam, war raged over the reunification of the Northern and Southern sectors of what had once been a French colony, with America wishing to keep the south as its own sphere of influence."
"The suspicion that the Vietnamese guerrilla movement, which fought for the reunion of North and South, was making use of supply routes running through inhospitable parts of Cambodia was reason enough for the Americans to intervene and bring it under the control of a friendly government."
"Since then, Cambodia, formerly so peaceful, has been a country at odds with itself."
"It appears that state power, having been achieved with so much difficulty, must not be put at risk in any way."
"A tradition has developed of parties being no more willing to enter into coalitions with others than they are to tolerate opposition."
"First, there was a government friendly to the Americans, which was followed by Pol Pot’s pro-Chinese reign of terror and then, with Vietnamese help, the government of Hun Sen. Subsequent elections have produced results that have made it virtually impossible to form governments with widespread support."
"Various parties are unwilling to cooperate with each other, wanting instead to rule on their own."
"This attitude has now resulted in the arrest and imprisonment of opposition members of parliament."
"Journalists, human rights activists and trade unionists are also arrested on charges of defamation."
"The consequence of all this is that the police and the judiciary are being turned into instruments of political in-fighting."
"For the moment, I do not get the impression that the opposition is much more democratic than the party in government."
"All the political forces in Cambodia should abandon this sort of behaviour."
"Up to now, the outside world has failed to help Cambodia develop a tolerant democracy."
"It is worth recalling that Pol Pot’s bloodthirsty regime remained internationally recognised for a long period of time, even after being defeated, the only reason for that being that the new regime under Hun Sen, which had liberated the country from that band of murderers, was suspected of maintaining friendly relations with its Vietnamese neighbour."
"In future, Cambodia must get a quite different message."
"Europe must not take sides on the basis of considerations that the Cambodians find incomprehensible, but must consistently stand up for human rights and democracy, irrespective of who is in power."
". Mr President, I believe these urgency debates are important for this House and for the European Union."
"I believe they are worthy."
"However, as we discuss Cambodia, I am struck by the fact that we have been here before, and that we have heard all this before."
"Specifically, we have been here before on 13 January 2005, 10 March 2005 and 1 December 2005."
"Will anybody take a bet with me that we will be here again in six months’ time?"
"I am not saying that we should not have these debates."
"But I am saying that we should have our concern matched by action from the other EU institutions and the Member States we serve."
"I would refer you to paragraph 4 of the resolution in particular."
"We are not without arms; we are not without pressure that we can exert."
"The Cambodian Government relies on the donor community for 50% of its annual expenditure."
"We must use that pressure more forcefully to achieve change, as opposed to just using warm words."
"This is not the West dictating to a developing nation how it should run itself; this is the European Union expecting Cambodia to honour the agreements it has already signed up to, and to live up to international standards of decency."
"We are willing to play our part in that process."
"In paragraph 12, we reiterate our call for an ad hoc delegation from this House to go to Cambodia to see the problems for ourselves."
"Let us start there."
"This motion for a resolution has the enthusiastic backing of my group and indeed my own backing."
"It contains a welter of information and worthy aims, but without more overt economic pressure from us, I fear that it will remain a shopping list never to be fulfilled."
". Mr President, I can only echo the statement made by the honourable Member, Mr Smith."
"We do seem to be going over the same subject again and again, with no real result."
"Is it because Cambodia is too far away?"
"Human suffering, regardless of where it happens, is always the same when it comes to the individual."
"I should cite what Human Rights Watch said about Cambodia in 2005: ‘The political opposition was effectively dismantled with the arrest or threat of arrest of opposition parliamentarians and the impunity of perpetrators of human rights abuses continued."
"Political trials demonstrated the Government’s ongoing control, interference and intimidation in the work of the courts.’"
"That is the bleak situation in Cambodia."
"I should remind you that in 1997 the only opposition politician, Sam Rainsy – who, paradoxically, is protected by this House’s Freedom-Passport Initiative – was giving a speech in the capital when several grenades were launched into the crowd in front of him and at least 16 people died."
"That is what happens when an opposition leader makes a speech in the capital of that country."
"We cannot continue just paying lip service; we must put our money where our mouth is."
"As Mr Smith said, one of the most effective penalties would be to stop giving money to Cambodia as long as the criteria of democracy and human rights are not fulfilled."
"Also, a travel visa ban on officials would be very effective, because the elite of that country come to the capitals of Europe to shop and so forth."
"In contrast, however, free trade has to be retained."
"Trade sanctions will only increase the poverty and misery of the people."
"The sympathy of this House is with those people in Cambodia who are fighting for democracy and human rights."
"Mr President, I agree with the words of the previous speakers but, in particular, those of Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg, a member of my group and author of one of these resolutions that we are going to vote on next."
"Cambodia does indeed have a recent tragic history of flagrant human rights violations and, in the past, horrendously violent wars."
"The discouragement felt by many Members when we see that things are not improving and that we have to deal with this issue over and over again in this Chamber is understandable, but we must not for that reason cease to raise the issue whenever events such as the recent ones take place, involving the repression of human rights activists, radio stations, teachers’ unions, activists, journalists, trade unionists in different fields, former parliamentarians, etc. Only with the help of vigorous and decisive measures on the part of the European Union, the Commission and this Parliament where Cambodia is concerned might actions of this kind be reduced or eliminated."
"There are five points that I am not going to mention, but I would like in particular to remind Cambodia of the action that the community of donors can and does take and of the human rights clause in the European Union-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement."
"It is also important to send a delegation to Cambodia to assess the situation."
"Finally, I would like to demand recognition of the refugee status of Khmers from Vietnam."
"I shall not say any more, Mr President, due to lack of time, but I would emphasise that I agree with what previous speakers have said."
". Ladies and gentlemen, human rights represent a set of ideals."
"Even the most democratic of countries only comes close to these ideals in certain spheres."
"In any event, until recently Cambodia was still faced with such problems as the remnants of Pol Pot’s troops, illiteracy and the lack of an intelligentsia or any industry in the country."
"In comparison, the present situation is undoubtedly a clear improvement."
"At the same time, however, it is of course intolerable that basic procedures should be disregarded when members of the Cambodian Parliament are sentenced to several years in prison."
"There is clearly an urgent need to ensure that conditions are in place that allow representatives of international organisations to do their jobs, as well as to promote the emergence of a free press and respect for trade union rights."
"A fact-finding mission would doubtless be a very good idea, and I would recommend that European Parliament representatives be sent to the country as soon as possible, once an agreement has been reached with the Cambodian Government."
"I find it particularly alarming that it is possible for the judiciary to be misused in order to deal with cases of alleged defamation."
"If we tacitly approve of an approach of this kind, we could be regarded as being complicit in such crimes."
"I am therefore very much in favour of the motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, there were no less than three European Parliament resolutions on Cambodia last year, and I should like the House to bear this in mind as I speak on the matter."
"The Cambodian authorities show blatant disregard for the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders and for the European Union guidelines on the subject adopted two years ago."
"I was very pleased that six days ago the Austrian Presidency lodged such a strong and unequivocal protest against the worsening situation in Cambodia."
"The arrest of journalists, independent activists and trade unionists testifies to the increasingly repressive nature of the regime in that country."
"I agree with Mr Smith and Mr Vatanen who said that we must apply economic pressure to the Cambodian authorities."
"Fifty per cent of Cambodia’s budget is overseas aid, and we should use it as a tool."
"I am also very much in favour of sending an delegation as suggested in the resolution."
"We really need to see for ourselves what the situation is like on the ground."
". Mr President, the current political situation in Cambodia remains of serious concern."
"Since the lifting of parliamentary immunity for Mr Sam Rainsy, the leader of the Cambodian opposition Sam Rainsy Party, and two other members of the National Assembly in February last year, the political situation has deteriorated considerably."
"The recent arrest of Mr Kem Sokha, Director of the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights, and other human rights defenders constitutes the latest chapter in this depressing story."
"It is sadly ironic that these latest arrests relate to events which took place on Human Rights Day, when a number of organisations were peacefully celebrating and trying to uphold the principles of human rights and democracy."
"The Commission strongly welcomes the recent release on bail of Mr Sokha and four other individuals but would have wished the Cambodian authorities to have gone a step further and dropped the charges altogether."
"The Commission believes that the weakening of the opposition through the politicised use of the judiciary threatens to disrupt the still-developing democratic process in Cambodia."
"Moreover, the targeting of human rights organisations through a series of arrests on criminal – not civil – charges which are out of proportion with the alleged crimes is creating a climate of fear for human rights defenders in the country."
"The Commission and EU Member States have agreed to a number of measures to respond to the situation."
"Following the issuing of a strong EU declaration on the subject, the EU intends to raise these issues directly with the Prime Minister at the first opportunity."
"At the same time, the Commission and Member States will work even more closely with the human rights organisations which have been targeted in order to support their work."
"As recommended by Parliament in its last resolution on Cambodia, the Commission is currently considering whether to propose the establishment of a working group on cooperation in the areas of institution-building, administrative reform, governance and human rights in order constructively to engage the Cambodian authorities on these issues."
"Finally, in the forthcoming donor meeting in Phnom Penh in March, a strong message will be passed to the Cambodian authorities by the EU and the donor community as a whole that freedom of expression and other basic human rights must be upheld in the interest of all Cambodia’s citizens."
"I would like to assure this House that the Commission, through its delegation in Phnom Penh, and together with the missions of EU Member States in Cambodia, will continue to monitor the situation very closely."
"The international community, especially the EU which had such a vital role in the establishment of the new Cambodia, should ensure that the political situation does not deteriorate further and should support the strengthening and deepening of Cambodia’s democracy."
"I agree, of course, with the honourable Members of the European Parliament that the events in question are very serious and deserve our full attention."
"The Commission, together with the EU Member States, is exploring the possibility of undertaking further measures beyond the ones I have just mentioned."
"However, I do not believe that at this point the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement should be suspended."
"This would put our political dialogue on hold and interrupt our development programmes to the detriment of the poor people in Cambodia."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a few moments’ time."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, I wish, on behalf of my group, to move a correction to Recital F, which should refer, not to 462 Sudanese nationals, but to 650, that being the number of persons threatened with deportation."
"We also wish to move, as part of the same amendment, that this change be made to paragraph 5 as well."
"I have checked the French, Spanish and German versions, and the change has already been made in them. I would ask you to request the services to examine all the language versions with this in view."
"Mr President, in this amendment the name of one of the members of parliament was omitted by us and I would appreciate it if it could be inserted."
"It is the name of Chea Poch."
"It would then read: ‘the judgment against Sam Rainsy and Chea Poch’."
"It is an addition, Mr President."
"One of the problems in Cambodia is that it has something in common with Belarus, whereby if you insult the Prime Minister of Cambodia it is deemed to be a criminal offence, which is very unusual in the modern world."
"Normally, an insult at worst is a civil offence and results in a fine or a defamation suit."
"In Cambodia you go to prison, hence the reason why some of these individuals have been imprisoned."
"We wish to add the following text: ‘… and questions the need for defiling the office of the Prime Minister to be a criminal offence’."
"Mr President, my English is not as good as that of my colleague, Mr Tannock, but I think ‘defiling’ is the wrong word."
"It is ‘defaming’, is it not?"
"So can we make sure we have the correct wording in that oral amendment?"
"I am very happy to accept the suggestion to change the word ‘defiling’ to ‘defamation’."
"That was my original intention."
"That concludes the vote."
". I welcome this motion which addresses the important issue of how mainstreaming the needs of the disabled into development policy might be achieved and how issues such as stigma towards disabled people, treatment and care are being dealt with."
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 19 January 2006."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before beginning our plenary sitting, I believe that, under the circumstances, the Presidency must make a short statement relating to the two tragic events that have taken place in two countries of the European Union."
"As you know, the accident on 19 January involving a Slovakian army aircraft led to the deaths of 42 soldiers as they returned from a NATO peace-keeping mission in Kosovo."
"This brings to mind other similar tragic events relating to the presence of Spanish soldiers in Afghanistan."
"This time they were Slovakian."
"On 28 January, in Katowice, the collapse of the roof of an exhibition hall led to the deaths of several dozen people and to some one hundred people being injured. An unknown number of people are missing."
"The Polish people have been shaken by this tragedy, as have all of the other peoples of Europe."
"I have expressed the European Parliament’s sincerest condolences and solidarity with the victims and their families."
"The Slovakian and Polish flags are flying at half mast in our Parliament as a sign of mourning."
"On behalf of all of you, I have sent a letter to both Heads of State to express our condolences."
"I would now ask you to observe a minute’s silence in tribute to these victims."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mrs Frassoni has the floor."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my speech is going to be really simple, very brief and not at all exciting: I should like to say that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to add its signature to the resolution on Cuba."
"All right, that will be done."
"The next item is the joint debate on the common foreign and security policy on the following points:"
"– the Statement by the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy on the common foreign policy perspectives for 2006; and"
"– the report by Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the CFSP, including the financial implications for the general budget of the European Union – 2004 (2005/2134(INI)) (A6-0389/2005)."
"Before the speakers take the floor, I would like to thank Mrs De Keyser, chief European Union observer at the Palestinian elections, and Mr McMillan-Scott, who led our delegation of 27 parliamentary observers, for the work they have done."
"We will no doubt have the opportunity to hear what they have to say during the debate, but at this point I would like to stress the important role played by our Members in terms of providing an objective view of the vitality of the electoral process in the Palestinian territories."
"I also believe that this is a good opportunity to express our hope that the circumstances will not prevent President Mahmud Abbas from accepting the European Parliament's standing invitation for him to come here whenever he likes."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by joining with you in congratulating, in particular, the person who has embodied the European Parliament and the European Union as a whole in the electoral observation mission to the Palestinian elections, Mrs De Keyser, a good friend of all of us and a good friend of mine, on the great work she has done over this very difficult time, during which the mission of observers has been extremely important."
"I do not know whether Mrs De Keyser is in the Chamber, but, in any event, I would like to acknowledge her and express my admiration for her and once again tell her that I think of her as a friend."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you quite honestly that I find it very difficult to begin this sitting of 1 February 2006."
"If we cast our minds back just one month, to 1 January of this year, and look at what has happened in the world over the intervening thirty days, it is clear that it may be genuinely useful for us to reflect here in this Parliament; we should reflect on the European Union’s capacity for politics, the European Union’s capacity for international politics and the obligation facing all of us."
"If we look carefully at what has happened over these thirty days that I am about to discuss, we should draw certain conclusions with regard to how we cannot continue to act and how we should actually begin to act."
"So please allow me, therefore, to remind you very briefly of what has happened over the last thirty days."
"Many of us stayed awake the whole of the night of 1 January 2006, trying to resolve an extremely serious problem that was affecting us: Ukraine and Russia had a problem that was very difficult to resolve because of the lack of an energy agreement between the two countries."
"If, rather than an energy agreement, disagreement had remained, that would have had extremely serious repercussions for the energy supply of many European Union countries."
"That was the first night of the year."
"On the third night of 2006, the Iranian Government took an extremely important decision: to commence enriching uranium."
"And less than a week later, it began to break the seals that had been affixed by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council and of the Board Governors of that Agency."
"A few days later, Prime Minister Sharon was taken into a hospital in Jerusalem, and unfortunately he has yet to recover fully."
"If you will allow me, I would like to say to the family of Prime Minister Sharon, on behalf of all of us, that we wish him a speedy recovery."
"Regardless of the differences that may have arisen between us in the past, regardless of the difficulties and misunderstandings that we may have had, men who have fought, people who have worked with us, must be acknowledged in their times of difficulty."
"A few days later, serious problems arose with the beginning of the elections in Palestine, and once again Mrs De Keyser was there to try to solve them."
"The Palestinian elections took place at the end of the month, and the result caused a commotion."
"Some days later, within the context of another issue which is absolutely fundamental to the European Union, President Rugova, President of Kosovo, died suddenly."
"Also in the final days of the month, there was a crucial meeting of the African Union, with which we are cooperating extremely closely in an attempt to resolve a serious problem: the problem of Darfur."
"Finally, just a very few days ago, also during this month, the Secretary-General of the United Nations called upon us to be ready to take a decision on the possibility of the European Union becoming involved in security and protection at the elections that are going to take place in a few months’ time in Congo."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we think for just a few moments about these last thirty days, we will see that there are immense lessons to be learnt."
"And many of them relate to the European Union’s influence in today’s world, because in relation to all of these issues that I have mentioned, all of them, the European Union has had to play a fundamental role: on the issue of energy security, which is fundamental and which will remain with us throughout 2006; on the issue of Iran, which will continue to occupy us over the coming days and no doubt beyond, and I will discuss this in a moment; on the Palestinian elections and their consequences; on the death of President Rugova and the consequences that it will have in 2006, and let us hope that it is only 2006; on the final agreements on the status of Kosovo; and on issues relating to the changes that have taken place in the African Union, our relations with which are marked by profound friendship, affection and cooperation."
"If the President will allow me, I shall comment very briefly on these issues that I have mentioned, the most important issues to have arisen over the last month, and which are unquestionably going to make up this Parliament’s and the European Union’s fundamental agenda for 2006, but not without firstly saying once again to the Presidency of Parliament and to its Members that there is no question that the European Union is an essential player in international politics, that this must continue to be the case, that experience has shown us that, whether we like it or not, it must be the case, and that over just thirty days we have had to deal with so many issues, and at times this has stopped us being able to think; such has been the activity in which we have been immersed throughout this month."
"This morning, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs received two personalities from Ukraine: the Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Tarasyuk, and Yulia Timoshenko, a very distinguished parliamentarian."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs has seen — I hope that many of you have been able to say this — the extremely difficult situation being faced by Ukraine, a country that is a friend of ours and that is fundamental to the stability and security of Europe."
"About a year ago now, all of us, the European Parliament and myself, were trying to resolve an extremely serious problem in Ukraine."
"Today, a year later, many of the problems that existed at that time are not as serious, but they are unfortunately still sufficiently serious for us to have to continue working, essentially in order to ensure that that country does not lose its way, that this great country continues to move along the path of economic and political development, security and increasing closeness to Europe that we all want to see."
"Those of you who have listened this morning to both the Foreign Affairs Minister and Mrs Yulia Timoshenko will have realised that the problem is unfortunately very serious and that we must attach particular importance to it."
"In the few minutes I am allowed for this first speech, I shall not go into any more detail, but I would like to say that the elections that are going to take place in Ukraine, not in a year’s time, but in two months’ time, will be absolutely fundamental to all of us, not just for the European Union, but also for Ukraine, undoubtedly, and for all of the countries of the eastern part of our continent, which will be affected by their results."
"It would be extremely sad for all of us if what a year ago we called the Orange Revolution were to stop being an orange revolution and turn into a revolution of a different kind or a step backwards after the series of steps forward that that country took a year ago."
"I would like, Mr President, to move on to the second point on which I wished to comment: the situation with Iran."
"I believe that the honourable Members are well informed about what has happened in Iran since 3 January of this year, just a little while ago, and in particular about what has happened since the 13th, when, in Berlin, the European Union took the decision to call for an extraordinary meeting of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency and subsequently to call upon the Board of Governors to pass the dossier on Iran to the United Nations Security Council."
"Many things have happened since then, because the days pass as if they were seconds and months as if they were hours."
"I can tell you that, at this very moment, the Chinese and Russian representatives are in Tehran, with a mandate from the five permanent members of the Security Council plus the European Union, to try to make the final effort to reach an agreement at the meeting that is going to take place on the 2nd, that is to say tomorrow."
"I can tell you that, the night before last, the members of the European Union and the United States held a meeting until the early hours of the morning, which I believe was very important, with Russia and China, with a view to reaching a possible agreement on a draft resolution."
"And I can tell you that we reached that agreement, and that this very afternoon it will be presented in Vienna for debate tomorrow."
"It is a draft resolution, ladies and gentlemen, that makes the following appeals: firstly it calls upon Iran to return to the previous situation, that is to say, not to persist in its aspirations to enrich uranium, but to return to a negotiating position; and secondly, it calls for the resolution that is going to be presented this afternoon, with the support of Russia and China, to be approved and for that resolution and all of the related resolutions adopted over recent months to be passed on to the Security Council and for that Council not to adopt any resolution until the ordinary meeting of the Board of Governors in March."
"Our intention here is to send a clear message to the Iranian authorities and, at the same time, to create the greatest possible degree of consensus within the international community."
"The issue we are dealing with is fundamental, linked to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and it therefore seems to us to be essential to achieve the greatest possible agreement amongst the members of the international community and, specifically, amongst the members of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"I do not wish to say that I am optimistic, because I believe that it is difficult to be optimistic on these issues, but I believe that we have worked extremely hard over recent hours amongst all of the members of the international community, led, without any doubt whatsoever, by the positions that the European Union has held for several months and years."
"We therefore hope that the debate that will begin tomorrow, and will no doubt last more than one day, will enable us to make progress in terms of rationalising Iran’s position on nuclear issues."
"The third point that I wished to mention very briefly, Mr President, since time is pressing, is the Palestinian elections."
"I have already mentioned the good work that the European Union has done in terms of observation; I would like to make two or three observations about the results."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the results have surprised everybody: they have surprised Hamas, they have surprised Fatah, they have surprised Israel and they have surprised the international community."
"Hamas were certainly expected to achieve better results than they have done before, but nobody ― either in Hamas, in Fatah, or in the international community ― expected Hamas to be so successful."
"What positions do I believe we should take at this time?"
"And these are not personal positions, they are positions that have been agreed by the General Affairs Council, by the Foreign Affairs Ministers on Monday morning ― that is to say, very recently ― and in the afternoon, in the Quartet, with our friends from Russia and the United States and with the Secretary-General of the United Nations."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we believe ― quite rightly I believe ― that we must continue to help President Abu Mazen."
"He stood in the elections on the platform that we supported: one of progressing towards peace; recognising the need to negotiate with Israel; of ending the Intifada; and of implementing the roadmap."
"Those were the positions of President Abu Mazen, and they had the mass support of his Palestinian fellow citizens."
"There have subsequently been elections which Hamas has won by a very substantial majority, by an absolute majority, on a platform that to a certain extent is different to that of President Abbas."
"There is therefore no doubt that in the future ― when the government is formed following the negotiation that will take place, very probably within several weeks, and we will therefore probably not have a government for two or three months at least ― there may well be a clash of positions amongst the different parties, between what President Abu Mazen has represented and what Hamas represents."
"In Monday’s statement by the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers, which was then also recognised in the meeting of the Quartet, we said what I believe are some important things which should be known and, above all, explained."
"We stated clearly that, according to the report by the observers and in particular by their chief observer, the elections took place in an open, clean and fair manner."
"We then went on to say in this statement that Europe is entirely prepared to carry on working with our Palestinian friends, with whom we have cooperated for many years, since the Oslo process, during which we have invested European economic resources and also political and psychological resources, to a large extent, and that we are prepared to carry on doing so; and there is absolutely no doubt that we are prepared to carry on doing so in the time between now and the formation of the new government."
"But when the new government is formed, on the assumption that it is led by Hamas, this House will have to reflect and set certain conditions."
"It would be difficult for the European Parliament and the European Union as a whole not to say various things very clearly to our Palestinian friends; specifically, three things: the first is that violence is not compatible with election results in a democracy."
"In a democracy, parties that have been elected must abandon violence and must play by the democratic rules."
"The second thing we should say with the same affection and friendship we have always felt for our Palestinian friends is that, if they want the European Union’s assistance, it is essential that their policy is compatible with the position that this Parliament and the European Union have maintained since the Oslo agreements in 1993."
"We want to see two States living together in peace and prosperity; we want negotiations to take place via the peaceful route ― not by any other route ― and we would therefore call upon the two parties ― if that is what we want ― to recognise each other."
"This Parliament could not possibly support anything that does not involve an explicit recognition on the part of all of the Palestinian authorities, whoever they may be, that Israel is a reality with which they must hold dialogue and reach agreement."
"Thirdly, we would like to say to our Palestinian friends ― I have said this personally on several occasions since the elections, and I am able to speak to the President practically every day ― that it would be a very good thing for the new government which emerges following these elections, in three months, also to recognise all of the agreements that the Palestinian Authority has signed over recent years."
"It would be absurd to go right back to zero after all the work we have done over such a long time and after the work many of you have also done over such a long time."
"This is what we want to say very simply, therefore, ladies and gentlemen, and I believe that everybody must understand it; and I believe and I hope that our Palestinian friends, regardless of the party they are from, regardless of the party or formation they represented in these elections, understand that this does not mean imposing anything on anybody, or trying to force anybody’s will, but that it is a question of affirming in a clear and simple manner what the European Union’s position has been; not since yesterday, but since 1993, when the Oslo agreements were signed."
"And I believe that we should all be united here in this task;"
"I believe that, as we have done in the General Affairs Council and as the Quartet did on the night following the General Affairs Council, we must stand firm in this area."
"This does not mean that at this difficult time, at this time when President Abu Mazen has the enormous responsibility of forming a government and of making contact with all of the different political factions, we should not help, or we should not help President Abu Mazen as much as possible at this time when he still has control of the situation, so that over these three months that he surely still has before there is a new government, the Palestinians do not face economic bankruptcy."
"In my view, it would be an extremely serious mistake for us now to abandon President Abu Mazen, in an economic sense, and for those resources not to be used, or not arrive, and for us to run the risk of the Palestinian Authority finding itself in a very difficult situation at this point in time."
"This is an appeal to all of us and the European Parliament ― if at some point the Commission presents a request or a recommendation to the European Parliament in this regard, and I hope that it will ― to have the generosity to support President Abu Mazen over the months remaining before a new government is in place, so that he can establish himself and find a place for himself and what he signifies."
"I believe that we should say ‘yes’, a resounding ‘yes’, so that that is what happens in the future."
"I would like to say that what we have before us is going to be a new situation, it is going to be difficult, it is not going to be easy, but I believe that we must remain determined to ensure that this peace process moves forward under the conditions to which I referred before."
"They are not absurd conditions, as I have said; they are not conditions that have just been plucked from the air, but they come from many years of work, of working together, of work with our Palestinian friends to ensure that the process can move forward."
"Mr President, I will now say a couple of very brief words about the situation in Kosovo, following the death of President Rugova."
"It was my sad duty – though I was delighted to go – to attend the funeral of President Rugova."
"The family asked me to speak on that occasion on behalf of the European Union, and I did so. I did so thinking of all of you, I did so thinking of all of the citizens of Europe, whose thoughts I am sure were with President Rugova at that time."
"But let there be no mistake; it is going to be a difficult process."
"Because if the process was difficult enough when President Rugova was alive and acting as a sort of 'umbrella’ for the whole political operation that we are facing, imagine what it is going to be like without him."
"In my speech, I called upon the Kosovan political leaders and people in general to show generosity, unity and responsibility at this time so that progress can be made, and I believe that to a certain extent those words, spoken by myself and by others, have been heard: we now have somebody to replace President Rugova, something that I feared was going to take much longer, and who is also going to head the team which, under the direction of Mr Ahtisaari, former President of Finland, will jointly lead the negotiation with our Serbian friends."
"Let us hope therefore that we can move in that direction and that we can move relatively quickly, but I would emphasise once again that great energies are going to be required in order to progress along this path towards a definitive solution to the situation in Kosovo, which would unquestionably represent an essential step towards stability throughout the Balkan region, stability for the countries to which we have offered a future in Europe, at the Thessaloniki Summit and on numerous occasions."
"Mr President, I believe that my time is running out, and it would be a great shame not to discuss some of the other issues that I wished to raise with you, given the enormous amount of activity that has taken place over the last twenty days."
"I would like to tell you that we are continuing to work very hard with the African Union to try to resolve the problem of peace in Darfur."
"We have made a lot of progress on the North-South negotiation, and we have reached an agreement, but we unfortunately have the Abuja process, which has not made any progress."
"We are working as hard as we possibly can in that regard."
"Fortunately, the meeting of the African Union has found a compromise formula whereby, rather than making the President of Sudan the President of the African Union, which would have been a great problem for the future negotiations, it has chosen President Brazzaville of Congo."
"We will therefore be very happy to do everything we can to ensure that the Abuja process moves forward and at the same time will begin to plan ― because we are going to have to take on many responsibilities ― the transition from a force that is present on the ground, led by the African Union, to a force which, sooner or later, but within a few months, will be United Nations blue helmets and with which we will undoubtedly have to continue cooperating."
"The last thing I would like to say, Mr President, is that, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, we have received a request ― or at least the Presidency and myself have received a request ― from the Secretary-General of the United Nations, asking us whether we could assist in the elections that are going to be held in the Democratic Republic of Congo and which will provide the final impetus for the process of democratic transition in Congo; if it goes well, it will bring stability to a significant part of Africa’s backbone; this issue is therefore fundamental for all of us."
"We are being asked to help, and today there is a fact-finding mission in Kinshasa, and I hope that in a few days time, on the 7th, it will be able to give us its results, so that we can see whether, in the end, the Member States of the European Union can take the decision to support the United Nations in response to this offer, or request."
"To do so would be a good decision."
"I shall end here, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"There are endless things I would like to share with you on this first day of February 2006, a year which has begun with some truly frenetic activity, which is going to make us all frenetic and which must make us work with an energy, a capacity and a dedication that we have rarely seen in the European Union."
"Through the will of the Members of this Parliament, through the will of the citizens of Europe and through the will of the governments of Europe, the European Union must be a fundamental player on the international scene."
"And as you have just heard, ladies and gentlemen, given the things that have happened during this last month alone, we have no choice but to play that role, whether we like it or not: we cannot close our eyes to the world’s problems, and I would like to say to you that the world wants Europe to act."
"Wherever we go, we come across people, political leaders, knocking on Europe’s door and saying, ‘Act."
"Act; we like the way you act; your way of acting suits us; the way you act is better for the world, the multilateral world in which the citizens of the European Union believe’."
"The Eurobarometer, Mr President, tells us every day, every month, or every two months, or every time we ask it, what the Members of this Parliament want."
"Let us therefore continue along that path, let us ensure that Parliament and all of the institutions can work together, because we are necessary if we are to create a better world."
"Mr President, I would like to say much more, but I know that that is not possible."
"So I will stop and I will await any question the honourable Members wish to ask me;"
"I shall do my best to answer as best I can, with the same respect and affection that I have always shown to this Parliament."
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen."
". Mr President, Mr High Representative, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, considering where European foreign and security policy started off from several years ago, we cannot do other than observe that those involved in it can point to some extraordinary achievements, that hitherto impossible things are being achieved in the Balkans, through the EU troika and in many other areas, and that the European Union, through its enlargement policy, its neighbourhood policy, its Mediterranean policy and much else, has made a major contribution to global stability."
"Parliament has been constantly supportive of this work and is well aware of its own inability to actively engage in foreign policy, that being a task for the executive."
"While it must, however, be open to Parliament to monitor it, the position we are in prevents us from doing so to an adequate degree, since we are mainly informed after the event and no priority is given to our being included in the discussion process."
"There is room for improvement here; we need to move things on in line with this interpretation of Article 21, and I hope that we will be able to use peaceful means in getting the Council and the Commission to agree to this."
"It must also be clear to us, though, that this House has so far been able to bring forward little other than budgetary arguments in its attempts to get its way, and we have to move on from this if this House is to be better enabled to monitor and be consulted."
"One might ask, by way of an example, what is going on in the Congo?"
"We have all read in the newspapers about the plans that are being considered for military intervention there, but at no stage of the proceedings has anyone thought to give this House or the relevant committee within it prior notice of this."
"I do not think that we can go on like this."
"Although I did say that a lot of good things had been achieved, it is possible to regard a glass as either half full or half empty."
"We are in a much more difficult situation than we were a year ago; far from being something that can be blamed on European policy, this is a matter of the way things are, and Mr Solana gave a few examples at the beginning of the year."
"Consider, if you will, the state of affairs in Iran, where we are laboriously endeavouring to get talks underway, and where nobody has any real idea of how to prevent matters escalating now there is the possibility of Iraq ending up with a Shiite government that could ally itself with Iran, in view of the Palestinian elections having been won by Hamas, which is linked with and funded by Iran, not to mention Hezbollah and all the rest of it."
"If you consider what this scenario means in terms of world peace, and might also mean in terms of the security of our energy supply, bearing in mind at the same time the way in which a politically resurrected Russia uses energy as a political instrument, causing countries in our neighbourhood to fear for the maintenance of their independence and freedom to make decisions for themselves, then it can be a depressing one."
"And that is just a small sample."
"The whole scenario shows that we, in the European Union, are in a worse position in terms of foreign policy than we were a year ago, and that we therefore need to come up with a strategy for dealing with the situation."
"We must become much more pro-active and, whether dealing with the Ukraine situation or energy policy in general, establish connections in such a way that no single country is penalised, but that, rather, we join together in defending our interests."
"Our Member States and our neighbours must come to understand that we have no chance of defending our interests unless we do so together rather than each looking after his own."
"None of us can save ourselves; it is only together that we can defend our own interests, and this is something that has to be spelled out with greater clarity."
"We have something to contribute, and one place in which we can do so is the Balkans, where, this year, there is to be a referendum in Montenegro and negotiations on the status of Kosovo, and so important decisions are in the offing."
"The question of how we involve Serbia in all this is one of the really big and difficult issues with which we have to deal."
"There must also be a marked improvement in trans-Atlantic relations, so that, through the values we share, order may be brought into the scenario I described earlier."
"That also means that we have to be strong enough to have an influence on American policy, which means reinforcing the preventive dimension of policy and its character as a dialogue, in order to ensure greater security in a multilateral world."
"It means that we have to sharpen up some of our instruments."
"We would like to see Mr Solana become Europe’s Foreign Minister on 1 January 2007; while the failure of the Constitution means that he will not, another consequence of that is that the instruments need to be improved in order to maximise the effectiveness of all the institutions rather than have them working against each other."
"As Mr Solana said, this multilateral approach is one reason why the world wants European foreign policy."
"The public want it too; nothing matters so much to them as that we should take joint action in this area, and that imposes on us the obligation to join with our counterparts at the national level in putting the half measures of the past behind us and agreeing on ways to secure our citizens’ right to life."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in introducing his statement, the High Representative referred to the first 31 days of this year – and hence also of the Austrian Presidency of the Council – as having been a turbulent time, and that they indeed were."
"Evidence of that could be found on the order of business for the first meeting of the Council under Austrian Presidency two days ago."
"It was important that we in the Council should consider the issues, to many of which Mr Solana has alluded, and come to decisions that carried a clear message, for it is indeed important that the European Union should, where today’s important issues are concerned, speak to the world clearly, unmistakeably, and with one voice, and this we are doing, of course, together with the Commission, while also seeking dialogue with you in the European Parliament."
"I would point out that, in the 31 days of the Austrian Presidency so far, the foreign minister, many other Council chairmen and I myself have had many opportunities to come here and debate many issues of concern to your House, and that I yesterday had the opportunity – for which I am very grateful – to report to the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the foreign policy aspects of the first meeting of the Council under Austrian Chairmanship."
"The Austrian Presidency wants to continue offering this willingness to engage in discussion on behalf of the Council and wishes to maintain dialogue with your House."
"In this brief statement, I would like, in essence, to focus on two points: firstly, the Council’s annual report to the European Parliament on the main aspects of, and fundamental options for the common foreign and security policy – which is what this item on the order of business is all about – and, secondly, relations between your House and the Council as regards the budget for it."
"Firstly, the 1999 interinstitutional agreement on budget discipline and improvement of the budget procedure specifies that the Council shall draw up a report setting out the main aspects and basic choices of CFSP, along with its financial implications for the overall Budget, and so it was that the Council, in April 2005, forwarded to Parliament the report for 2004, which is on our order of business today, and in which it endeavours to do as Parliament has asked it to do and reflect on Europe’s security strategy."
"As a result, the report gives particular attention to important issues in connection with this, notably such aspects of the common foreign and security policy as, for example, crisis management and conflict prevention, combating terrorism, disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and small arms, external relations in different geographical areas, and so on."
"The Council endeavoured to make the report a comprehensive one that would give a full account of the outcomes and activities in connection with the common foreign and security policy."
"Its production of these reports is a matter of obligation, and they help to make visible and transparent the work that is done in connection with the CFSP."
"Efforts have also been made to accommodate the views of the European Parliament, one consequence of which is that the report includes a special chapter with an overview of future activities and suggestions for activities in the coming year and for possible responses to any crises that may occur."
"If I might move on to my second subject, the Budget for the common foreign and security policy, I would like to point out that the coming into being of the CFSP, as also of the European Security and Defence Policy, is without doubt one of the European Union’s success stories; the crisis management operations in the Balkans, in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East have helped to make the European Union more visible on the international stage."
"The continuation of this in accordance with the European Security Strategy is a matter of priority, but that can be done in an effective manner only with the appropriate funding."
"In the conclusions to the agreement on the next financial perspective, the European Council requests ‘the budgetary authority to significantly increase the funding under the Budget for the common foreign and security policy for the period beginning in 2007 in order to cover the foreseeable need for resources as estimated on the basis of prognoses produced annually by the Council, with a reasonable margin being left for unforeseen activities’."
"One outcome of the trialogue was an agreement to add EUR 40 million to the CFSP Budget, bringing it to a total of EUR 102.6 million for the current year of 2006, and, although that is a step in the right direction, there are great challenges lying in store for us."
"If the European Union becomes active in Kosovo, that will probably require substantial funds that the current CFSP Budget for 2006 will be incapable of providing."
"Work is in progress on the question of how a situation of this kind can be dealt with."
"The Presidency’s report to the European Council on the ESDP invited the Austrian Presidency to continue working towards securing adequate funding for civilian ESDP missions from the CFSP Budget."
"The presidency looks forward to working constructively with the European Parliament on this issue and will shortly provide it with relevant information in accordance with the agreement reached during the trialogue on the 2006 Budget."
"It is expected that the Political and Security Committee will, through its representative, report on the subject in March of this year."
"Let me conclude by emphasising once again that the Presidency looks forward to working constructively with your House towards the end of an increased and more efficient CFSP Budget in the negotiations on the future inter-institutional agreement and in the 2007 Budget procedure."
". Mr President, while in 2004 and 2005 we saw the terrible scenario of the tsunami, I agree with Mr Solana that this year, particular political challenges lie ahead."
"I would like to start with Ukraine and Russia, because that brings me to a very important point."
"As you know, the Commission – President Barroso, Commissioner Piebalgs and I – have been working both in the background and at the forefront in order to facilitate the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia."
"The important thing is, firstly, that we – as well as they – have come to a solution."
"Secondly, we also have learned a very important lesson from this, namely that the question of energy is of great importance and has to be placed much higher on our political agenda."
"The issue of energy covers energy security, the question of diversification and the ways of dealing with this question in the future."
"The Commission will therefore prepare a communication on this matter, which will take all these issues into account."
"The second point I would like to make concerns the Palestinian elections."
"I wish to pay tribute to Mrs De Keyser."
"We met in Gaza two weeks ago under difficult circumstances, when the security situation was still unclear."
"We thought that Hamas would have 30-40% of the votes."
"Like everybody else, we were taken by surprise."
"However, let me say that the most important thing is that the elections were held freely, fairly and in relative security."
"This is already an achievement."
"It leads me to believe that election observation missions are becoming more and more important."
"We see it in Sri Lanka, Palestine, Gaza and Afghanistan, to name just a few."
"In the future, we will see it in Congo and in Haiti."
"This is a very important tool that we will certainly want to use in favour of all our European friends in Parliament and Council and in favour of the European public."
"To come back to Palestine, we had a very important Council meeting on Monday and a Quartet meeting on Monday evening."
"Mr Solana has already reported on the main thrust of the three important principles: there has to be a commitment to non-violence, the new Palestinian Government has to recognise the State of Israel, and it also has to stand by its existing obligations, i.e. Oslo and the roadmap."
"However, we are also faced with a challenge."
"The caretaker government could stay in place for two to three months."
"What do we do, in particular with regard to financial support?"
"We in the Commission have to find solutions."
"I have already said that we would try to release EUR 10 million from our infrastructure facility – there is some money there to be disbursed."
"We also said we would help with the utilities, paying these directly to the Israelis in order to help that government too."
"However, we also have to see what can be done with the money in our World Bank Trust Fund."
"It was blocked and has not been disbursed because the benchmarks had not yet been met."
"A World Bank mission will be going there and we will have to see what can be done."
"This means that we will try to work in a coherent way, together with the President, the Council, the Council secretariat and Mr Solana to see which are the best instruments to use in order to make the foreign policy coherent, speedy and effective as quickly as possible."
"Whilst on the subject of foreign policy issues, the Ukrainian elections are forthcoming."
"Within the last hour I met Boris Tarasyuk."
"We know how important these elections will be."
"Again, an election observation team from the OECD, perhaps with your support, will be important."
"We could also say that a lot was done in 2005, for example, on the market economy status, where we were working with the Ukrainians."
"We could work on quite a number of issues that are important, such as visa facilitation and readmission."
"We hope that after free and fair elections we can offer them an enhanced agreement, perhaps a free trade agreement."
"That would give them an even better stance and approach towards us."
"All of that brings me to the more general questions."
"Both Mr Brok and Mr Winkler, the President-in-Office, have stressed the importance of the coherence between the different instruments at the disposal of the European Union under the first and second pillars."
"I could not agree more."
"In our view, it is a very important task to ensure that all EU foreign policy instruments – development aid, diplomacy, trade policy, civilian and military crisis management, institution-building, humanitarian assistance – work as part of a coherent whole, like interlinked cogs in a well-oiled machine."
"After all, this is the rationale behind the Commission being ‘fully associated’ with common foreign and security policy."
"It also reflects the direction in which the Constitutional Treaty was taking us."
"As Mr Brok’s report highlights, the security challenges we face span the fields covered by all three EU pillars."
"Security is not only about defence and military deployment, it is also about civilian crisis management and the wise management of bilateral relationships – and we have a lot of those."
"It is also about public health: think of avian flu."
"It is about the environment: think of the Kyoto Protocol."
"It is about the fight against terrorism and organised crime."
"Yesterday we had the Afghanistan conference."
"It is also about working together for institution-building, or fighting the scourge of drugs."
"We have so many instruments that we can use and apply together."
"It is not only about energy supplies and prices, but also about the fight against poverty in the world, and our ability to integrate our immigrant populations."
"The European Union is increasingly called upon to face these global responsibilities in the field of peace and security."
"We now have an impressive toolbox with which to do so."
"But a smart toolbox is no good if the tools do not work very closely together."
"This, therefore, has to be our aim."
"An effective crisis response requires instruments that complement one another."
"We need strong Community instruments working alongside the instruments of the CFSP."
"It is a recipe that can work."
"For example, our contribution to the Aceh peace process is a mix of CFSP and Community instruments."
"The Commission also financed, for instance, President Ahtisaari’s peace negotiations using the rapid reaction mechanism."
"We have therefore tried to be flexible."
"The CFSP launched the Aceh Monitoring Mission to monitor compliance with the peace agreement."
"At the same time, for instance, the Commission and Member States, working with the international community, put in place a package of long-term measures to support the peace process."
"Another example is the border assistance mission in Moldova and Ukraine, where the Commission is funding the deployment of mobile teams to provide advice and on-the-job training to Moldovan and Ukrainian border and customs officials."
"The long-term objective of facilitating a resolution of the Transnistria conflict matches that of the EU’s Special Representative."
"The Border Assistance Mission and the EU Special Representative therefore work closely together."
"Our head of mission also acts as his senior political adviser, and one of his team is based at our mission’s premises."
"Early results are highly positive."
"Community assistance enhances the impact of the CFSP assistance, and vice versa."
"In neither case would the European Union’s contribution have been comprehensive or meaningful without utilising both Community and CFSP instruments."
"And most importantly, its impact on the ground – on peoples’ lives – would be significantly reduced."
"We also need to enhance the EU’s existing instruments in support of our security objectives."
"Diplomacy requires carrots and sticks, whether we are talking about weapons of mass destruction or promoting stability and prosperity in our neighbourhood."
"Access to the world’s biggest internal market or our sizeable assistance programmes is a considerable carrot."
"This complementary use of Community and CFSP instruments needs to become the rule, not the exception."
"In 2006 the task for us all – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – is to work to improve the coherence of our different pillars and policies."
"The issue will also be dealt with in the concept paper on the EU’s external project which President Barroso announced at Hampton Court, now planned for the June European Council."
"The Commission will focus in particular on building up its crisis response capacities."
"Within DG External Relations a ‘crisis platform’ will improve both internal and external policy coordination and will also ensure a more efficient implementation of projects and operations."
"It will complement our existing instruments such as the civil protection mechanism, humanitarian assistance and the rapid reaction mechanism."
"We also want to build on our strategy for disaster alert and preparedness."
"Under the new financial perspectives, the stability instrument will also help ensure continuity between short- and long-term interventions."
"Our aim is to develop flexible and responsive solutions to crisis situations and thus be a better partner for the military component of crisis response."
"Finally, we will also cooperate very closely with the two arms of the budgetary authority to ensure adequate resources for CFSP."
"The Commission welcomes the substantial increase of the CFSP budget in 2006 in order to meet concrete new demands."
"We know there will be new demands."
"We also understood the conclusions of the European Council with regard to the future financial perspectives."
"Our common aim must be to have sufficient resources to cover all external relations priorities, bearing in mind the 20% cut in the Commission’s proposal for Heading 4."
"In the light of past experience, one particular issue will be to ensure sufficient flexibility to respond to unforeseen needs."
"I also hope there will be continued support for our stability instrument to enable us to make real progress in crisis response and coherence."
"This is the main thrust of how we would like to face 2006 and its political challenges."
". – None of this is new to me, because I have for many years been in agreement with what my friends Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner have been saying."
"The only point on which I disagree is the idea that resources are sufficient for the EU to be a player on the world stage, as Mr Solana put it, which is what our partners and the citizens are demanding."
"This is not the case."
"It is not the case either in terms of resources or in terms of organisation, and the right thing would be to think about how best to use the instruments provided for in the Treaty of Nice, in such a way that we can coordinate internal actions and organisation more effectively."
"In order to address the lack of resources, we must establish priorities, and in this regard the support of the institutions is crucial."
"Furthermore, Parliament’s support, following prior consultation rather than notification after the fact, is crucial if consensus is to be reached. There is therefore no major difference between what we are hearing from the Council and the Commission regarding the guidelines."
"Yet not even great chefs, not even the very best chefs like Bocuse or Alain Ducas, are capable of making decent omelettes if they do not have enough eggs."
"On the other hand, in addition to unity between the European institutions, it is nowadays crucial to guarantee strategic partnerships with the main partners, the most important of which is a transatlantic partnership, followed by strategic partnerships with Russia and China, and on the next level with India, Brazil, Indonesia and Pakistan."
"This aspect is vital in view of the international issues at stake, such as money laundering and drug-trafficking, but in order for it to become a reality, the resources must be there via the various strands."
"Another question, Mr President, that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner briefly touched upon is that of immigration."
"The ageing population in the EU means that in the coming decades there will have to be a significant amount of immigration, from both the South and the East."
"We will have to monitor this situation, both actively and proactively, and will need domestic policies enabling us to host and integrate these immigrants in a suitable way, and to control our external borders more effectively, given that the enlargement altered the borders that were there until recently."
"As for the most contentious issues in this debate, I wish to say that we see eye to eye on both Palestine and Iran."
"We must be cautious and prudent, but must also stick resolutely to our principles."
"Under no circumstances must we waver on the principles that have always guided us, and, specifically on this issue, the principles that have been in place since the beginning of the 1990s."
"We must also engineer some room for manoeuvre on the other side."
"‘Firmness’ and ‘caution’ should be the watchwords in this debate on Iran and the Middle East."
"As regards Kosovo, a key element for many years when it comes to the Balkans, we continue to emphasise that territorial integrity must be maintained and that minorities must be respected."
"Unless these two principles are upheld in Kosovo, we will have great difficulty in achieving any kind of stability in the region."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, energy security is of course a technical question, but it has also become a political question, because, while demand continues to rise, the trend in the coming years will be for supply to level off."
"Consequently, tension will rise and I would suggest that as the major countries do with their vital supplies, we could carry out a thorough, inclusive study on the possible scenarios and the strategies for addressing those scenarios."
"If we do not do this, a number of surprises lie in wait."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the account that Mr Solana has given us of the way 2006 has started is a sobering one."
"In essence, what Mr Winkler had to say stressed the current presidency’s view that there are hard times ahead of us this year, and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, for her part, said much the same thing."
"There are, then, challenges for us to face."
"Europeans must be aware that what Mr Solana, Mr Winkler and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner have set out is none other than the neighbourhood policy of the European Union, on whose doorstep lie the crisis regions that they have described."
"They are at a critical stage in their development, and there are risks inherent in that which threaten every single citizen of this Union of ours; there is no other way of putting it."
"If one turns from that to consider Mr Brok’s description, in his report on the current state of European foreign policy in the hands of the executive institutions, of the instruments available to the institutions themselves and to us in this House, one finds that an equally sobering account."
"More than ever before, the European Union’s foreign policy is a core element in European policymaking, and it is worth noting, as Mr Brok rightly points out, that it is one that the people want and support."
"Let us, though, be honest with ourselves: we do not have enough of the instruments that a European policy requires in order to be effective and faithful to its task, and so we in this House must insist on improvements being made in this area."
"Let us take Ukraine as an example: a year ago, we all saw how effectively we can act when we are present on the ground with all our capacities bundled together in the persons of Javier Solana, the High Representative of our Union, empowered to speak and act on behalf of all of us; the Polish President, Mr Kwasniewski, as the head of an immediately adjoining state, with good opportunities for exercising influence in the country and with constant backup from other Heads of Government, who can in turn influence other stakeholders – the Russian Government, for example – through the European Union – these men helped to bring the Orange Revolution to a peaceful conclusion."
"A year has now gone by, and today we hear, from Ukrainian visitors to this House, that many of the things achieved over the past year are again at risk and are being rolled back."
"I do not need to add to the description of the threat presented by the energy situation, by which, of course, Ukraine is also seriously affected."
"How, actually, is it possible that what we celebrated with such enthusiasm a year ago should now – within the space of a year – be rolled back in such a way?"
"This is something we have to think about, and Mr Winkler is right to say that we have to do so in the context of the financial perspective, for it is quite unacceptable that the Council should, every time it meets, broadcast to the world our need to undertake international commitments, and then make cuts in the funding that such commitments require."
"One thing that is perfectly clear, then, not least in terms of the financial situation, is that we have to commit ourselves to what is needed to bring what stability we can to the Middle East."
"Hamas must indeed renounce violence, but the EU must also keep its word, and we have to talk to Hamas if we are not to make the mistake that was made in Algeria of not recognising a legitimate election."
"We have to be clear in our own minds about that, for our keeping our word is another contribution to peace."
"If we do that, we can also demand that the others – Hamas in particular – move towards democracy, and in that I hope that we will succeed."
"Mr President, a common foreign and security policy that promotes Europe’s values in the world and brings peace and security to our neighbours is what Liberals and Democrats strive for."
"But it is what Europe’s leaders are manifestly failing to provide."
"Acting together, our Union could have used its leverage to promote democracy and stability."
"Instead, its policies have given tacit support to tyrannies like Tunisia, Egypt and Syria."
"We never demanded that diplomacy depend on releasing democrats like Egypt’s Ayman Nour; or, in Asia, on the right to a free return to his country for opposition leader Sam Rainsy, now in exile while we fund the dictatorship of Hun Sen."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Solana, why are you surprised at the Palestinian poll?"
"The European Union has peddled promises of democracy, peace and human rights in Palestine while our development aid has fed Al-Fatah, whose members now burn images of one of our prime ministers and peace negotiations have got nowhere."
"Far from being a key player, Mr Solana, the consequences of Europe’s failure are plain for all to see."
"Israel, undeterred, builds a wall around East Jerusalem in violation of its roadmap obligations and international law."
"The Palestinians, tired of slow progress and shameful social services, turn to Hamas at the ballot box."
"And now the prognosis is worse than ever."
"After demanding democracy, some EU leaders talk of shunning one of the only democratically elected governments in the Arab world!"
"Of course, Hamas must renounce violence and commit to a two-state solution."
"But so must Israel."
"As Leila Shahid, the General Delegate for the Palestinian Authority said today: ‘It takes two to tango’."
"The Commissioner has spoken of policies based on human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles, but where is the emphasis on those fine things when pragmatism devoid of principles is so often the order of the day?"
"A global drive for peaceful conflict resolution would be a major counterweight to the heavy-handed US approach; it would assure Europe’s security, prosperity and global repute; and it would also give us far greater leverage over micro-states like the Maldives or the Seychelles, whose governments abuse human rights despite being almost totally dependent on our aid and trade."
"That is why Liberals and Democrats believe that the time has come for an accountable, properly funded and values-driven European foreign policy."
"According to Eurobarometer, it is a desire shared by 70% of our citizens."
"Mr Solana, Liberals and Democrats object to Parliament’s views being ignored or disregarded on matters of global importance."
"We want to see less of you on television and more of you here in this Chamber."
"And we are tired of Council secrecy and its disregard for Parliament’s right to prior consultation on policy priorities."
"Those rights are enshrined in Article 21 of the Treaty and in the 1999 Interinstitutional Agreement."
"We are facing many grave challenges: to democratise our Near Neighbourhood, especially former Soviet republics currently at the mercy of Russia’s energy politics; to ensure that the elections in Belarus are free and fair; and to ensure that the referendums in Kosovo and Montenegro do not end in violence."
"The role of foreign policy must not end there. I understand that selling arms to China is back on the Council’s agenda, yet China has still not recanted the Tiananmen Square killings, nor released, after 16 years, all those jailed."
"So we demand an assurance from you, Mr Winkler, that the Austrian Presidency will not lift the Union’s arms embargo."
"Most pressing is the question of Iran."
"The IAEA board of governors meets tomorrow to decide whether to report Iran to the Security Council."
"Stopping Iran building nuclear weapons must be our aim."
"That is why Europe must commit to respect the IAEA’s findings due in March."
"But making progress towards the disarmament of the current nuclear powers, in line with the commitments we have made, is the strongest and most convincing message we could possibly send."
"A Europe which learns to use its muscle as a force for good is truly a force to be reckoned with."
". Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Solana, Mr Winkler, ladies and gentlemen,"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, the present situations in Palestine and Iran are indeed difficult, and I envy nobody who tries to intervene in them."
"The only chance that the European Union has, I believe, is to spell out the facts and avoid all ambiguity; we must be unambiguous."
"Hamas’ 1988 charter is indeed appalling, and those who read it can do no other than shudder, but Hamas is now in elected office, and, in dealing with it, we must make it clear that foreign policy and relations with Israel are not in Hamas’ hands, but in those of President Abbas."
"He is the one to whom we must at last give a chance; we must, once and for all, tell Israel to give him a chance to prove that there is a policy other than that espoused by Hamas."
"If we fail in that, then we will lose."
"There must be no ambiguity in our attitude towards Hamas, not only as regards the peace issue, but also as regards fundamentalism."
"There is the risk of a fundamentalist society coming into being."
"The only way we can have any credibility, though, is if we do not mince our words when talking to Israel either."
"There is no future for the Palestinians in being conquered and occupied; that is something that Israel must come to understand; this is a policy area in which it needs a change of approach."
"A wall that stands as a symbol of conquest is not the sort of wall that makes for safety."
"When one considers our history – your own history for example – from the moment when you demonstrated against NATO right up to the moment when you were its Secretary-General; when one considers my own history, when one considers Mr Fischer’s history, one says to oneself that it is important never to give up hope that people can change, and that applies to Hamas."
"– But we cannot simply wait and see what happens."
"This change is necessary to our own security, and we must compel Hamas to make it."
"We can do that only if the Israelis and the Palestinians really grasp the fact that, where the European Union is concerned, there is no debate: the right of Israel to exist is no longer a matter for discussion, and we no longer regard discussion of it as acceptable."
"The right of the Palestinians to a state is no longer a matter for discussion, and we no longer regard discussion of it as acceptable."
"The two are inseparable, and if we can get that accepted as a fact, we will be able to do something even in this problematic situation."
"The position as regards Iran is no different; it, too, has a right to the secure supply of energy."
"As a Green, I am not in favour of nuclear power, but we cannot have a situation in which some states will use nothing else, while, at the same time, telling the Iranians that they may not use it; that is immoral, nothing but immoral."
"By all means, let us say ‘no’ to the atom bomb, but then we must offer Iran, too, security for its territory, for that has been its great fear ever since it was attacked by Iraq."
"That is our task – clarity and security will see us through."
". Mr President, Mr Solana, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Winkler, I should like to seize the opportunity, rare as it is, of Mr Solana’s being present in this Chamber to touch on one or two aspects of the common foreign and security policy that are particularly problematic for my group."
"I will base my remarks in particular on the Operational Programme of the Council for 2006, since that is the most recent background paper."
"What can be observed?"
"Firstly, the disproportionate importance accorded to the military dimension of the CFSP."
"It is with outright greed that the Programme lists one by one the catalogues of forces, the rapid response operations, the battle groups, the European Defence Agency and the strategic partnership between the European Union and NATO."
"The 25 thus have the impression that they are playing with the big boys, but their self-importance is illusory and misplaced."
"On the other hand – and this is my second observation – the large open wounds in some of the most sensitive regions in the world, wounds that specifically require some political creativity from Europe in the face of the irresponsible approach of the US leaders and their allies are, for their part, sidelined in the CFSP agenda."
"Thus, in the Operational Programme for 2006, it is the case that, in 14 pages of text, the Near East is disposed of in less than two and a half lines used to reveal to us, and I quote, that: ‘The European Union will continue its efforts to implement the road map’."
"There is not a single word on the Israeli leaders’ choice of a unilateral strategy, which clearly runs counter to the spirit of the road map and to any peace process."
"Iraq, for its part, warrants three lines, but there is no mention whatsoever of the war nor of the catastrophic Bush strategy, which lands us all into a tragic deadlock."
"This brings me to our main criticism, which I already had the opportunity to voice in this very Chamber in June 2003 at the time of the publication of your report on the European security strategy – which is still in force, Mr Solana."
"The report gives an apocalyptic description of the new threats without once analysing their root causes, and it is with sheer disbelief that one reads - I quote - that ‘by working together, the European Union and the United States can be a major force for good in the world’."
"So what is your assessment, Mr Solana, of two years of implementation of this strategy?"
"Has the world become a safer and fairer place?"
"To my mind, a good yardstick against which to judge this is the case of the Near East, to which I am now going to turn my attention."
"While we are on this subject, allow me to point out to our fellow Members the presence, in our galleries, of Mrs Leïla Shahid, Palestine’s new delegate-general to the European Union, whom I should like warmly to welcome."
"Even before the Palestinian elections, I had called for Parliament’s agenda to include the issue of the European diplomats’ harsh but accurate report on Jerusalem, which the Council kept secret so as not to affect its relations with the Israeli authorities."
"Where are we with this matter today?"
"Like a number of my fellow Members, I have just returned from Palestine, where we were observing the legislative elections."
"We were all pleased and moved to observe the exemplary way in which the ballot was held there, the festive atmosphere in the streets, despite the occupation, and the way in which we, as foreigners, were welcomed."
"This pride in being able to show the world the Palestinian people’s ability to build its democracy is a major asset for the future that the election result must not have us forget."
"The same is true of the Palestinians’ desire to make peace with neighbouring Israel and to have two peoples and two States, which were subjects that featured in all of the conversations we were able to have."
"Anyone who took the risk of starving these women, men and children, or indeed of radicalising them, by cutting off their vital aid, would therefore be shouldering a heavy responsibility."
"Instead, let us count on the aspirations for democracy and for a just peace, which very much have the upper hand in today’s Palestinian society and which any Palestinian authority will have to take into account."
"It is the very future of the partnership between the two regions that is at stake."
"As for the election result, let us be careful not to analyse it purely from an internal Palestinian perspective."
"Certainly, the popular rejection of Fatah is genuine."
"Any hegemonic power tends to become divorced from society."
"Yet, how can one fail to see that the Palestinian Authority has above all lost its credibility with the citizens because it has not succeeded in improving their lot or in offering them new prospects due to the blocked peace process?"
"After the high hopes of ten years ago, the feeling is now one of extreme exasperation in the face of the continuing occupation, the development of settlements, the construction of the wall, the ‘targeted’ assassinations, the arrests, the detention of prisoners, the daily violence and the worsening living conditions as a result of the territories being sealed off."
"As for the Palestinian State and as for Jerusalem, the Palestinian Authority is seen as having accepted a great deal and as having obtained very little."
"What should be done, then?"
"There is no doubt that, as you said, Mr Solana, we should put pressure on Hamas to stop the violence and assassination attempts."
"What are you saying to the Israeli authorities, though?"
"I have heard nothing on this matter."
"We also need clearly to show that, as far as we are concerned, there is no ‘variable geometry’ version of international law."
"Like any State, Israel has a duty to comply with the Security Council resolutions."
"It also has to follow the recommendations of the International Court of Justice. It has to implement its obligations under the road map."
"In that context, Mr President, it stands to reason that, now more than ever, the attitude to be adopted with regard to our diplomats’ report on Jerusalem is this: we must publish it straightaway, implement its recommendations and, more generally, finally choose a real alternative to President Bush’s strategy, which has failed in the Near East and, beyond, in the Middle East."
"Let us be alert to the cries of alarm rising up from societies on the verge of despair."
"I imagine that all of the speakers are aware that there is an item coming up on our agenda specifically relating to the analysis of the situation in the Middle East, the result of the Palestinian elections and whether or not this report to which Mr Wurtz has referred should be published."
"You have chosen to organise the debate by dividing it up in this way."
"I imagine that you are aware that you are effectively changing the agenda and discussing points which we are due to discuss later."
". Mr President, when, exactly one week ago, I was observing the Palestinian elections on behalf of this House, one giant banner, in particular, caught my eye."
"It was in Ramallah, and it depicted Ayatollah Khomeini together with Hamas leaders Yassin and Rantisi."
"The political message is crystal-clear."
"Rather than striving towards settlement or peace with the Jewish state, we should tear out its page from history, for that is what Khomeini called for, and, according to the present Iranian President Ahmadinejad, those are words of wisdom."
"Combined with the nuclear aspirations of the Mullahs’ regime in Teheran – the peaceful nature of which is very much a matter of doubt – this makes for a particularly touch challenge for the Western world, the EU, and the US."
"The historian Dan Diner’s comment on the Palestinian parliamentary elections was that ‘with Hamas in Ramallah, Iran has moved much closer towards Israel’, and he was right."
"According to recent reports from Teheran, many pro-Western Iranians consider this development to be the gradual victory of barbarism over civilisation."
"I sincerely hope that the European institutions, far from sharing this sense of resignation, will make a firm stand for Israel’s right of existence and consequently for our own civilisation."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to four issues where rapid and consistent action is necessary within the framework of the common foreign and security policy."
"The first priority is the Neighbourhood Policy."
"Firstly, the way forward for Russia and Ukraine."
"We ought to take into account the fact that at the moment Russia does not have good relations with any one of its neighbouring states, since relations are formed not on the basis of mutual respect and advantage, but by making itself felt through economic or energy sanctions, and by refusing to sign the agreements that have been prepared concerning borders."
"At the moment Russia is blocking the export of Ukraine’s food products."
"I therefore urge Mr Solana and the Commission to take immediate action to encourage the lifting of this blockade, and at the same time to remind Russia that such action is in clear conflict with the requirements of the World Trade Organisation, which it has declared a wish to join."
"Secondly, the gas supply crisis in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia was like a wake-up call for Europe, showing that these supplies are not secure, that supply diversification is necessary, as is coordination between the European Union’s energy and security policies and the Member States."
"Thirdly, in this context we should mention the agreement concerning the North European Gas Pipeline, in the construction of which the former German Chancellor has obtained a post, giving rise to concerns about political corruption."
"By not evaluating this event from their own viewpoints with sufficient consistency, the European institutions are diminishing the confidence of EU citizens, and, incidentally, preventing us from speaking about combating corruption elsewhere in the world."
"Now, I would like to mention another region — China."
"At the moment China is in a phase of rapid development and it is ready to give high priority to entering into cooperation with the European Union."
"If our dialogue with China does not become more earnest and constructive, it may turn to closer relations in another direction."
"Finally, in relations between the Council and Parliament we would like to see not just consultation, but that the European Parliament’s opinion is actually taken into account, especially in relation to so-called ‘speaking with one voice’."
"Mr President, the fight against terrorism must be one of the priorities of the common foreign and defence policy."
"The report is quite right to draw attention to the importance of respect for human rights and civil liberties."
"I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my total and unconditional solidarity with the Danish Prime Minister, who is currently under enormous pressure to take action against the cartoonists who had the temerity to depict none other than the prophet Mohammed."
"Islamic countries, including Turkey – which is an EU candidate country – demand apologies and sanctions, and even insist on a boycott of Danish products."
"Prime Minister Rasmussen is more than right when he claims that there is no democracy without free expression of opinion."
"The Council, Commission and Parliament should stand united in the defence of our liberties."
"If they fail to do so, then it is hardly worth our while even talking about a security and defence policy, for there will be nothing whatever left to defend."
"Mr President, earlier today Mr Solana stated that the European Union needs to be a global actor."
"Consolidation of the common foreign and security policy is therefore required and the constitutional crisis is certainly not helping matters."
"Cohesion cannot, however, be achieved entirely through common institutions."
"It is achieved mainly through common political will."
"A great deal will therefore depend on the personal actions, good judgment and creativity shown by Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner in the course of this year."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has also promised a special communication the European Union’s energy security energy."
"In addition, Mr Brok’s report refers to the need to draft a strategy for energy security."
"In fact, these are only half-hearted solutions/stop-gap solutions."
"What the European Union actually needs is for us to set ourselves the goal of creating a genuinely common policy on energy security."
"Only then will it be possible to prevent situations like the one that arose two years ago, when Russian suppliers held Belarus to ransom or the one at the beginning of this month when Russia was blackmailing Ukraine."
"Central European Member States were also affected."
"Do we really want to be subjected to blackmail of this kind in the future and do we really want to freeze like people are freezing in Georgia right now?"
"The only alternative is a common European Union energy policy."
"Another point I would like to make is that our policy towards Russia should be modified."
"There is scope for criticism of the lack of progress in certain areas."
"Two of the latter are referred to in Mr Brok’s report, namely problems concerning human rights and arms reduction in the Kaliningrad region."
"The list should actually be much longer, and include a common solution to regional conflicts, notably in Transnistria and the Southern Caucasus, along with the whole Kaliningrad package."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Europeans we have to respect the outcome of the free vote in Palestine and encourage those elected to form a government that chooses the path of negotiation, recognises Israel and renounces violence, as President Abu Mazen himself has indicated."
"The outcome of the vote also reflects the suffering and humiliation of daily life under occupation, squeezed between checkpoints, wall and settlements, and at the same time it rings out as a severe criticism of Palestinian politicians."
"The unilateral withdrawal from Gaza has itself weakened the position of President Abu Mazen, for obvious reasons."
"That therefore gives rise to two compelling needs: not to abandon the prospect of a negotiated peace, and to call on both parties to renounce any actions that might jeopardise peace."
"I therefore agree with the clear conditions that you, Mr Solana, have set the Palestinians."
"In the same spirit, however, I ask you: do you have no objections to make to Israel, which has never accepted the idea of operating within the roadmap?"
"This debate has started in Israeli society."
"In addition, Hamas itself has shown its ability to respect a negotiated truce for an entire year."
"I believe that Israel should put a stop to the settlements and avoid taking any steps to annex East Jerusalem."
"On the subject of financial aid, I agree with you absolutely: it is essential to prevent collapse and to assess the situation as it unfolds."
"In the same spirit, I should like to put a question to you, Mr Solana, as well as to the Council and the Commission: do you not think we should put pressure on the Israeli authorities to stop blocking the transfer of tax revenues to the Palestinians?"
"Since it is Palestinian money, I feel that in the current situation the Israelis are adding fuel to the fire."
"Mr President, I thought my speaking time had been extended by one minute, but you many want to check this out while I am talking."
"Mr High Representative, Commissioner, Mr President, at the beginning of this debate, we were given a breathtaking overview of the events of the past 30 days."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, as well as the presidency, for their unrelenting commitment to dealing with the disasters that have struck and all those painful events."
"I should also like to join in congratulating the EU’s election observation missions in general and those who have been active in the Palestinian regions in particular, for their job must have been particularly difficult."
"I think that we could draw two lessons from the summary which Mr Solana presented to us."
"The first lesson is that the European Union can only be effective when united."
"I was therefore delighted to hear the day before yesterday that the General Affairs Council had reached a unanimous decision in connection with the conditions under which further financial support could be granted to the Palestinian Authority."
"I was also very pleased to hear that the four parties had held an emergency meeting that very evening."
"Imagine the implications if one Head of Government had stated one thing, another Minister had said something else and a third Prime Minister had brought a different message altogether."
"It is obvious that this would have been very pernicious, but that did not happen, and I hope that things are going to stay that way."
"Needless to say, we need unanimity across all the dossiers."
"Sufficient funds must also be made available."
"I am not as confident as the Commissioner that provision will be made for this in the financial perspectives 2007-2013. Like her, I would like to stress that sufficient flexibility must be displayed."
"Finally, I agree that, insofar as the High Representative, the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council involve Parliament in their activities on a regular basis, they will be able to count on our continued support."
"Mr President, further to Mr Solana’s reference to the Balkans, I would just like to take the opportunity of saying that we give our wholehearted backing to his efforts in a place where we bear direct responsibility for peace in Europe; this is something that nobody else can shoulder for us, and we must credibly and undeviatingly develop the region’s European perspective."
"I would like to congratulate you on the decision you took on Monday evening, in which you successfully brought together the very diverse things that are being said in Europe about Iran."
"I would appeal to all, while going down the road thus set out, to leave plenty of room for diplomatic manoeuvre and negotiation."
"The prospect of the Iranians’ meeting with China and Russia now going ahead is good news, but we must not lose sight of the fact that the decision as to whether the red line has been crossed and world peace put in jeopardy is for neither Mr Schüssel nor Mr Steinmeier to take, but for the United Nations and nobody else."
"We cannot control the situation on our own, and it is difficult, when dealing with a hate preacher such as Ahmadinejad, to keep looking for new ways to make him see reason – the reason that is part of the European security strategy that you have set out, which is founded upon non-proliferation."
"We know that, if the situation in Iran were to escalate, it would be an enormous threat to the things that it is in our interests to defend – the prevention of nuclear weapons ending up in Iranian hands, the reduction of the threat to Israel and more security for it."
"I therefore hope that we will find a peaceful way forward, difficult though that task may be."
"Let me say, in my capacity as chair of the delegation, that there is another voice in Iran."
"I will not let diplomatic relations …"
"Mr President, yesterday marked the death of the 100th British serviceman killed in Iraq."
"These brave men made the ultimate sacrifice of giving their lives for their country."
"But they were betrayed."
"They were sent to war on the basis of the lies and fantasies of Prime Minister Tony Blair."
"This happened for one simple reason: Mr Blair and the Labour government have no conception of what constitutes the British national interest."
"Now Mr Blair wants to embroil the British nation in yet another lie and fantasy."
"That lie is that Britain’s national interest lies in something called a European common foreign policy."
"Yesterday also marked another significant event."
"In London, Mr Javier Solana spoke on the Palestinian issue on behalf of the European Union."
"He did so in the de facto role of the European Foreign Minister. This is despite the fact that the European common foreign policy should be dead and buried because of the rejection of the European constitution."
"This is a clear signal that the Labour government is surrendering control of foreign policy to the European Union."
"Chancellor Bismarck once famously remarked that the whole of the Balkans were not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier."
"Well, the whole of the European common foreign policy and the planned European army is not worth the bones of one single British serviceman or woman."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate concerns the need for a more open, more effective and more responsible European Union common foreign and security policy."
"We can be satisfied that, in recent years, much positive work has been achieved in the advancement of Europe’s civil military force."
"Unfortunately, however, the report by Mr Brok shows up too many still unresolved deficiencies and problems with the CFSP."
"There are serious difficulties inherent in adopting decisive positions regarding Europe’s Common Security and Defence Policy (ECSDP) and the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)."
"These policies suffer from a serious lack of resources, and emphasis is also placed on the need for democratic parliamentary control."
"These are only a few of the current issues relevant to the subject of today’s debate."
"So we, the European Parliament, ought to be able to change things for the better, and this includes demanding appropriate policy coordination in order to ensure intensive dialogue between the European Parliament and the Council on these issues."
"We know that this is not easy, but it is a question of the European Parliament’s institutional influence and development."
"The clear backing from Europe’s citizens for joint European security actions imposes a duty on the European Parliament to expand its institutional influence and participation in decision-making."
"Security will only increase if the messages from Mr Chirac, Mr Solana or Mrs Merkel or decisions taken in the spheres of weapons of mass destruction, combating terrorism or energy are predictable, and do not take an unprepared European Parliament unawares."
"Mr President, a common foreign policy might have prevented the energy crisis in Eastern Europe."
"It might also have meant that Poland’s concerns about the construction of the Russo-German gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea were taken into account, and Poland’s interests recognised as being the interests of the whole of Europe."
"The citizens of the European Union and indeed of the world expect us to have a common foreign policy and to defend the weak, with or without a European Constitution."
"Israel cannot therefore be permitted to monopolise foreign policy in its part of the world."
"Hamas will happily renounce terror and violence when a Palestinian State is created, thus reducing the terrorist threat in the world."
"Like Mr Cohn-Bendit, I am against nuclear weapons, but I cannot understand why Israel is allowed to possess an atom bomb whereas Iran is not."
"Mr President, when I hear the litany of crises and problems that confront us, I am alarmed that so many think that the answer to these problems is more European Union."
"The EU’s foreign policy ambitions and pretensions now reach into every area, from defence to immigration to energy supply, and we see few positive results from this."
"I would prefer a more modest approach, with the European Union focusing only on those areas were it can genuinely add practical value through humanitarian and development assistance, electoral observation and the like."
"I would also say that in these dangerous times when new forces have emerged that threaten the very nature of our free societies, we need more solidarity among the democracies and less EU self promotion."
"The lessons of recent years show that where the Western democracies are divided, their interests are damaged."
"The enemies of democracy will exploit these divisions for their own purposes."
"I have just returned from participating in the electoral observation mission in the Palestine Authority areas and East Jerusalem."
"The election results were a cry from the streets."
"You rightly say that the precise makeup of the new government of the Palestine Authority areas will not be clear for some time, but it will undoubtedly reflect the new-found power of Hamas."
"It is indeed vital that we do not provide support to that government unless it forsakes violence, recognises the right of Israel to exist and positively engages in the peace process."
"In the past I have expressed concern about the nature of EU financing and the adequacy of safeguards to prevent misuse of our funds."
"These concerns will now multiply."
"Not only must we ensure that financial assistance is transparent and cannot be used to support terrorism and extremism: there is also a crying need to ensure that our money is used more effectively so that it is of direct benefit to the Palestinian people."
"Finally, let us put more effort into ensuring that there is no difference in approach between the Europeans and the United States."
"We have a common interest in peace and stability in the Middle East."
"Mr President, we have listened with great interest to Mr Solana’s speech, particularly the first part in which he listed what had happened over the course of January."
"I hope that this will not set a trend for the rest of the year and hope that, each month, we will see new elements constantly being added to the foreign agenda."
"What stood out for me were the observations he made, particularly at the beginning, about the situation that has come about in Europe following the problems involving the gas supply to Ukraine and other countries."
"I think that one effect of what happened at the beginning of January has been to push energy policy up our list of priorities."
"I have drawn a few conclusions from those recent events."
"First of all, I have to conclude that we may not have organised ourselves very well as consumers, because our energy supply is so vulnerable, too vulnerable, if you ask me, since the effects of an unexpected energy shortage can be nothing short of devastating."
"Secondly, I have noticed that some Member States are more vulnerable than others, which somewhat contradicts the notion of solidarity that we nurture in the European Union."
"There are certainly countries in our immediate vicinity that are vulnerable – that much has become apparent – and the question of mutual solidarity, not least among our neighbours, is clearly an issue."
"This is also a technical matter, of course."
"We can invest in better and more diversified means of providing ourselves with energy."
"The third point I would like to make, which is actually the most important one, is that energy supplies and access to them are being deployed as political weapons, in this case against Ukraine, but also against Moldova and, in some respects, against Georgia as well."
"We have issued warnings about this in the past."
"The Russians have threatened to do this before and I think that, in this respect, we have to come down hard on them, for that is unacceptable."
"We too must ensure that we do not become dependent on Russia to an extent that we no longer dare say anything to Russia and keep quiet because we have become too dependent."
"I should like to make one final remark about this year’s agenda."
"This agenda sets itself."
"The European Union cannot ignore its responsibility."
"I will, above all, ask the Council and Commission to reconsider the question of how it is possible, following such a success in Georgia, but before that in Serbia, and in Ukraine, that things are now at risk of going the other way again."
"Have we made mistakes?"
"I think that this, too, is something we should analyse."
"Mr President,I should like to point out that, as it considers its common foreign and security policy, Europe would do well to review its guiding principles."
"I believe that where security and consequently peace are concerned, it is essential for Europe to adopt the concept known as human security."
"This involves tackling issues such as how best to cope with major diseases, starvation, infringements of human rights and attacks on democracy."
"In my view, another key element of security policy the Union ought to have in place is a policy on energy security."
"I should like to point out that Europe has so far failed to take into account the fact that energy supply could become a tool for an imperialist policy."
"What is at stake is not a shortage of gas or oil, but the use of huge energy resources as a means of implementing an imperialist policy."
"As I see it, this is a major challenge for Europe to which we have so far failed to respond"
"– Mr President, I have read the report and listened to Mr Solana carefully."
"I am not certain if they primarily serve Europe's interests."
"I have a feeling that we are continuing to serve American interests and that is a problem."
"They are dragging us into enmity with Russia, hostilities with China and the same with Iran."
"We must not get caught up in the American mindset."
"We must learn to say 'no' to the United States if we want to have a substantial foreign policy which, of course, I do not understand can be common to Sweden and Greece, Cyprus and Estonia, given that each State has such different issues to address."
"Mr Schulz said that there is a threat to the underbelly of Europe."
"Yes, there is a threat."
"Τurkey's against Greece constitutes a threat."
"The constant, daily infringements of Greek airspace by Turkish military aircraft constitute a threat."
"The wall in Nicosia constitutes a threat."
"The wall in Jerusalem constitutes a threat."
"Can we therefore say that all the occupying forces should leave the countries they are in?"
"That the occupying army should leave Cyprus, that Israel's occupying army ..."
"Mr President, many issues have been raised in the course of this debate on the European Union’s common foreign and security policy."
"As I see it, three types of security are required if all Europeans are to feel genuinely safe."
"I shall begin with energy security."
"The whole Union is much troubled by the subject, as are individual Member States such as Poland."
"There seems to be no desire to take common action in this field."
"Germany enhanced the security of its own energy supply by signing an agreement with Russia for the construction of the northern gas pipeline."
"Unfortunately, Germany’s action did much to undermine the security of Poland’s energy supply."
"The Union has so far failed to respond to this situation, although it is abundantly obvious that Russia is using the supply of raw materials for energy as an important tool with which to influence other countries’ policies."
"Russia’s decision to shut off gas supplies to Ukraine and Georgia has shown just how effective this tool can be."
"I shall now move on to food security."
"The security of our food supply is based on the common agricultural policy but unfortunately this policy is coming increasingly under attack."
"Finally, I would like to mention physical security, which is now under much greater threat due to terrorism."
"There can be no meaningful common foreign and security policy without significant progress in the three areas I have highlighted."
"I trust Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner will bear my remarks in mind."
"It is clear that the political situation around the world, from country to country and region to region, does not accord with our values, aspirations and expectations, nor is it becoming calmer or more democratic."
"At the same time, however, we are getting explicit requests for more Europe from various parts of the world."
"In Mongolia they say the European Union is our third neighbour. And when I visit the Balkan states, Latin America, Transcaucasia or Central Asia, I hear the same thing – more Europe."
"Yet while numerous partners want more Europe, we often find ourselves involved in our own unproductive concerns, and we are forgetting the fundamental ideas of Schuman and the other fathers of Europe in our desire to build more Europe with less money."
"It does not surprise me that our partners and our citizens do not understand the jargon about the various pillars of our policy, but they can sense precisely when we are united and when we are divided and ineffective."
"The experience with energy supply has taught us that national policies alone will not bring either greater internal security or greater external influence."
"I have the impression that even now the course of events demands more common policy than the already ratified Constitutional Treaty would bring about."
"If we truly wish to play a key role in the Balkans, in the east of Europe or elsewhere, we must find ways of expressing our common foreign and security policy more robustly. Something that would certainly contribute to this is a greater regard for the role of the European Parliament, which has shown itself to be a dynamic and responsible player."
"Mr President, I can virtually carry on where Mr Peterle left off, for if, as you, Mr Solana, have said, many in Europe are bidding us to take action, then the time for action really has come."
"Let me give just two examples of what I mean."
"I am not rejoicing in the sufferings of others when I say that the great American initiative for the wider Middle East has, in fact, collapsed, and that the intervention in Iraq has done nothing to improve matters."
"The inadequate and hesitant support for the peace policy and the peace initiative in the Middle East helped Hamas to victory in the elections;"
"I mention only in passing the fact that Fatah itself must bear much of the blame for this."
"As for Iran, we all know that more involvement on the part of the USA in security policy would play an important part in persuading Iran to refrain from developing its own nuclear weapons."
"Now, then, is the time, for the European Union – working with the USA rather than in opposition to it, which would be absurd – to clearly define what a comprehensive foreign policy in the Middle East might be like, including everything from a determined peace policy to support for civil society in the individual countries."
"The second example is that of energy policy."
"As has already been said, we, being a major consumer, need to present a more united front on the world market; we need to mobilise and form coalitions with other consumers."
"We have seen precisely what happens – in Iran, for example – when we do not make common cause with them."
"If Russia starts to make its energy policy an instrument of nationalist policy, then we must make our own – or at least part of it – more European."
"Commissioner, we await the report with eager anticipation."
"This is an issue that I asked you about as long ago as your appointment hearing."
"It is of the utmost importance that we should now have this report in our hands and be able to say out loud that, while we need our national energy policies, they must be supplemented and extended by a strong European energy policy which is also an essential instrument of foreign policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU’s role as an international player is an important one, and it has strengthened in recent years."
"The EU achieves results the gentle way, by which I mean through negotiations, discussions, persuasion and crisis management."
"This is sometimes a slow process, but it creates a firm basis for lasting solutions and for a viable society."
"In its foreign policy, the EU stresses the importance of democracy, and we want to take that forward."
"In this connection, I would like the EU to emphasise more strongly that without literacy there can be no democracy, nor can there be democracy without respect for women’s rights."
"We should therefore do more to ensure that children, young people and women in different parts of the world know how to read."
"This will create a lasting basis for democracy, peace and respect for human rights."
"Mr President, the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in the French and Dutch referendums (or referenda) has meant that the whole document is now no longer relevant."
"It is proving very hard for some people to come to terms with the disappearance of a concept that has been promoted for so many years."
"The common foreign and security policy was an important part of the aforementioned Treaty, but I would like to remind you it was rejected unequivocally."
"We are therefore amazed to note that efforts are being made to refer to a document that is entirely meaningless and as good as dead."
"Mr Brock’s report is an example of this approach."
"It makes a laughing stock of the House and tramples the democratic principles advocated by the European Community underfoot."
"The requisite period of reflection following the demise of this Treaty should not be devoted to getting specific chapters of the Constitution adopted through the back door."
"The time should be used instead to reassess common action at an international level and to place greater emphasis on the importance of issues such as energy security and the threats posed by epidemics and terrorism."
"Mr President, the European Union is actually blest with one effective security policy, and that is the common agricultural policy."
"For many years now this policy has guaranteed food security for the Community as a whole and for its citizens, nations and countries."
"Food security is vital to them all."
"Europe has now satisfied its hunger, but it has an unfortunate tendency to forget how this came about and thanks to whom."
"The common agricultural policy is under attack and has become a testing ground for irresponsible reforms such as the reform of the sugar market, as a result of which Europe is soon to become dependent on the rest of the world for sugar supplies."
"Protection of European agricultural markets is being phased out, as our farmers are all too aware."
"In Poland, the fruit producers are the ones who have been most affected."
"Ill-considered cuts in the common agricultural policy will result in the collapse of food security, which is crucial to security in Europe as a whole."
"There is still time to prevent this happening, but the political approach to agricultural issues must change."
"Banners carried by Polish agricultural workers’ organisations often feature slogans referring to the part food production played in the long struggle for Poland’s independence, as well as their willingness to fight."
"As we debate and decide on agricultural matters we should always remember that it is the farmers who feed and defend us, and that they are the real guardians of Europe’s security."
"Mr President, I have been listening attentively and I thought I had heard it all, but when I heard Daniel Cohn-Bendit supporting nuclear power – albeit in Iran – I must say I was a little shocked."
"Who says that Joschka Fischer changed?"
"I think ‘red Danny’ has changed a little himself!"
"I will take an institutional perspective and make three points."
"The first is that CFSP and defence are key areas for us in the future."
"We are a superpower in trade and in aid, but we are very often nowhere to be seen in CFSP and defence."
"Something needs to be done and I disagree with Mr Piotrowski."
"The first thing we need is a constitution."
"The second point I wanted to make was that we need three things: firstly, we need a common defence – we need the security guarantees that the constitution would give us."
"Secondly, we need to speak with one voice. For that we need a President and a Foreign Minister."
"Thirdly, we need to increase the CFSP budget."
"All of those should be packaged into one."
"If we get some political will behind it, I think we just might get a common foreign and security policy."
"The third point is that we really need to start thinking about the different elements of the constitution and look at it in two parts."
"There are things that we are already implementing, such as the European Defence Agency, the battle groups and the clause on solidarity with terrorism."
"But there are things that we need to start implementing as quickly as possible when the constitution enters into force."
"Those issues include a President, a Foreign Minister, an external relations service and prior consultation with the European Parliament."
"The final point I wanted to make is that instead of sticking to the institutional battle between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament in CFSP matters, we need to get ready, put our working clothes on and do it together."
"Mr President, I could almost feel my good friend Mr Solana’s pain when you outlined what happened in the first month of this year, imagining that if the rest of the year is going to be like the first month, then it is not going to be easy!"
"But I have another point to make."
"I think that what you said in essence is that the world in 2006 will once again be confronted with a fundamental choice: the choice between pre-emptive wars or pre-emptive policies."
"I am in no doubt that what you are saying and what is clear as a result of your experience, is that in 2006 we need pre-emptive policies."
"The essence of the values of this European Union when it comes to foreign policy is pre-emptive policies."
"When we look at the instruments which the Commissioner so nicely referred to, it is fair to say that yes, maybe it is the most difficult choice, but yes, it is also the choice which, in historical terms, has shown success."
"We need to remember that at this difficult time."
"I want to say to you, Mr Solana, that in Palestine right now there are so many who are taking the lead in the wrong direction and therefore the poor people in Palestine need to have a strong European voice."
"What you said is correct: we need patience, we need wisdom and we need balance."
"I was so happy to hear you say that we should not be those who just make Palestine bankrupt, because you and I know that there will be others who will ensure that this will not happen – Iran, Egypt and others."
"This is not our case and therefore I trust you."
"We will be on your side ensuring, together with the Commission and President-in-Office Winkler, that Europe will ensure open doors and dialogue and, hopefully, open doors once again over the next three months."
"Mr President, I am grateful for everything that has been said on the subject of Ukraine."
"However, we must keep our eye on the ball."
"Events in the next two months will determine whether the fruits of the Orange Revolution will be able to ripen fully, or whether they will fall to the ground unripe."
"Ukraine needs much more Europe over the next two months."
"It is vital for the European institutions to make themselves felt there."
"We must have a constant dialogue with Ukraine’s leaders and society."
"A pro-European front has to be created in Ukraine."
"There is unprecedented Russian involvement in the events currently taking place in Ukraine."
"Gas has been used as a weapon."
"A new constitution is to come into being, and the next parliament will decide if Ukraine is to go full steam towards Europe or go its own way, as it so often has in the past."
"We must encourage the leaders of political parties fighting to be represented in the parliament to form a strong pro-European front, so we can count on a good partner for the next four years."
"Mr President, the implication of Mr Wurtz’s question to Mr Solana as to what had improved in the last two years is that decisive improvements in the state of the world are in some way within the power of the European Union to decide upon and bring into effect."
"Those who wanted to see a multipolar world with the might of its only superpower reduced can hardly be surprised that this is the case."
"What some Members have said tends to reflect their Eurocentric views and their disappointment at our place in this multipolar world."
"I can do no other than bid them welcome to a world that has, alas, become no more pleasant for being multipolar and for being home to burgeoning new powers on a global and regional scale."
"We Europeans are far from that badly off in this situation, and I join with those who have congratulated Mr Solana on reaching, with China and Russia, a joint decision on the issue of whether to make Iran’s nuclear ambitions a matter for the Security Council."
"While I can only hope that that bears fruit, I am far from dissatisfied with the present approach."
"– In his opening remarks, Mr Solana alluded to certain events that took place last month and to certain challenges facing Europe, including the dispute over gas supplies from Russia, the elections in Palestine and the situation in the Middle East, the gloomy situation in Iraq, the crisis concerning Iran’s nuclear programme and the unresolved status of Kosovo."
"All of these events and problems have one common thread: no European country, not even the very biggest, can handle such problems alone."
"In other words, if we are to solve these problems we need to combine our strengths and to develop our common policies on foreign affairs, security and defence."
"This is what politicians from many countries want, and, as previous speakers have said, what the people of Europe want, too."
"Mr Brok’s report, on which we shall be voting tomorrow, refers to progress in the area of common foreign and defence policy, but also mentions a number of problems such as Parliament’s inadequate involvement in the process of drawing up foreign policy."
"I should therefore like to call on the Council to abide by Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union and always to consult Parliament at the start of the year on its progress and plans, rather than simply presenting summaries from the previous year."
"Mr President, let me come back to a few questions that have been mentioned."
"The most important issue, as many of you have said, is that today we need a stronger Europe in foreign policy."
"In order to get a stronger Europe in foreign policy we have to work together."
"We have to work together particularly on those topics that are now very topical."
"One of them mentioned by many of you was that of energy policy."
"As I have said before, we are working on that at the moment."
"That means, of course, that we should have a better conducted energy policy, if not a common external one."
"I know we have to head for this at the very least, and we already have quite a lot of valuable instruments with which to do so, including political dialogues and specific energy dialogues."
"Then there are multilateral dialogues: we have to bring in OPEC; we have to speak more with OPEC and with the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"As I said, the strategy of diversification will be crucial for all of us."
"We have to look into the integration into the European energy market of the energy markets of our neighbouring countries, following the example of the South East European Energy Community, for instance."
"We also have a lot of financial instruments to encourage energy topics to come together."
"The security of energy supply, as I have mentioned before, is crucial."
"Therefore I can promise you that we are working on it and as soon as the communication is out, we will come back to that."
"As Mr Rasmussen mentioned, it is also very important to see pre-emptive diplomacy."
"That is crucial."
"I agree with that."
"Of course, such diplomacy sometimes needs patience."
"You cannot eradicate poverty from one day to the next; you cannot work on all the different kinds of crisis management or even post-crisis management and have a change immediately."
"For that we need a sustainable and cohesive way forward."
"Migration is another very important new topic on foreign policy."
"Again, we will all have to work together with the countries of origin, with the transition countries, with the European Union to find the right way of balancing out an internal and an external policy."
"The fight against terrorism; the fight against drugs: all of that will take us many years, but these battles will increasingly have to be fought from a united front."
"Weapons of mass destruction; the support for democracy, the rule of law and free and fair elections: this is all mentioned in our neighbourhood policy, so of course we will also take that very seriously."
"We have a positive incentive on that in our Barcelona programme, for instance, but we also need every support so as to be able to make real progress with this policy."
"Strategic partnerships with major powers, such as trans-Atlantic relations; relations with China, India, Brazil; and the very good relations with Latin America: these are all important because here we have the possibility to work together in a multilateral framework, also working with the United Nations, as has been said."
"Of course, it is also is important that we are able to combine the work for our common values in the multilateral strategy."
"The neighbourhood policy is an important part of the security strategy, because we really try to export stability by working together with Ukraine, the Southern Caucuses and the Mediterranean countries."
"Therefore we have high aspirations to make Europe safer; we know we have many challenges ahead, but I do not see another way forward other than trying to enhance all our instruments and work for a common Europe built on common values together with the world."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, although I am unable, in the short space of time available to me, to revisit in detail all the many issues that have been mentioned in this debate, there are a few points I would like to address which I, as a representative of the Council, regard as important."
"The High Representative was the first to say – and many of you echoed him – that there is a global demand for European foreign policy."
"It is also something that matters to the European public, and we – that is the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament – must join together in working to meet that need; as Mr Watson said earlier, we must build the European Union on a foundation of values, and that is very obviously and specifically the case in foreign policy, where we have to be exemplary if we want to bring peace and stability to the world."
"I can only agree with that wholeheartedly and assure you that the Austrian Presidency, like the presidencies that preceded it and those that will follow it, is committed, during its six months in office, to the values of the protection of human rights, to the fundamental freedoms, and also, to echo what Mr Geremek said, to what is generally termed ‘human security’ – the striving for health, the campaign against weapons and rearmament."
"The European Union’s foreign policy is a peaceful one; we are not, in that sense, a military power."
"Pre-emptive diplomacy is the essential thing."
"Within our commitment to multilateralism, we endeavour to act in line with the United Nations Charter and in accordance with international law."
"That is the only way we can maintain our credibility in the eyes of the world."
"I would like to comment briefly on some of the issues that have been raised."
"In response to the many speakers who mentioned energy policy, I would like to add to what was said by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner."
"It goes without saying that the Commission is playing a quite essential and important role in this area, and the Council Presidency is working in very close cooperation with it."
"The issue of a European energy policy will be a quite central one at the European Council in March, for which the British Presidency has already laid the foundation stone."
"We want to continue what it has started."
"Reference has also been made in this debate to the security of energy supply, which is a quite crucial issue, which involves the diversification of energy sources and networks, as well as the reduction of one-sided dependency on energy suppliers and networks and, in particular, the support for, and active promotion of, renewable energy and alternative energy sources."
"This is, of course, a matter to which we will devote our attention."
"Russia has been mentioned again and again in this context; the European neighbourhood policy in general terms and the European policy in relation to Russia are both of quite fundamental importance."
"Russia is an important partner, and, in maintaining a dialogue with it, we need to highlight the values of which I have spoken; it goes without saying that human rights are another issue that needs to be raised with Russia, and they are, in a very wide-ranging dialogue."
"I do believe, though, that we must be aware of the fact that Russia is just as important a strategic partner for the European Union as is the United States."
"I am most especially grateful to Mrs Beer for raising the subject of the Balkans, as did Mr Solana in his introduction."
"The Austrian Council Presidency will, over its six months in office, be regarding the Western Balkans as having the utmost priority in the interests of the stability of the region and hence in the interests of peace and stability in Europe."
"Something else said on the subject of European foreign policy was that we should concentrate primarily on our own neighbours."
"That is what we are doing, and it is important that we should do so, but there is, in today’s world, no crisis or situation that does not also touch upon the interests and stability of the European Union; that is what makes the European Union a global player, and that, too, is why it must equip itself with the resources needed to perform that role."
"Today, the High Representative is tireless – in the truest sense of the word – in jetting around the world in the service of peace, and he does so in the interests of a credible European foreign policy, in our own interests, and also in the interests of stability and peace in Europe."
"I would now like to address an issue that is of particular importance to the general public and is also among the priorities for the Austrian Presidency of the Council."
"By that I mean the protection of European citizens in third countries, for which, as recent events and crises have already demonstrated, we in the European Union bear responsibility."
"The Austrian Presidency of the Council wants to help make consular cooperation better organised to protect citizens when they are abroad and also to equip it with the proper resources."
"Finally, let me turn to what was said about China."
"The only thing I want to say about the arms embargo is that there is at present, as you will be aware, no consensus in the Council on this."
"The issue is not on the agenda, but, quite apart from how this decision may turn out, it is a matter of principle for the Council and for European foreign policy that there will be no increase in the quantity of arms exported to China."
". Mr President, I just want to close very briefly, because much of what I said in general terms was a repetition of what we think."
"We are trying to repeat in different words what the majority of people think about the foreign policy of the European Union."
"I would prefer, instead of going through a litany of topics every time we meet, that we try to concentrate on some of the topics and go deeper."
"At the end of the day we have gone through the all the world’s problems in two hours or so, with I do not know how many speakers."
"We want to make this debate useful."
"For that I thank Mr Watson for his good recommendation that I appear less on television and come here instead."
"I promise you that every time I go on television I will call you beforehand, so you can take note of how much time I spend on television and how many hours I spend here!"
"So take note of that!"
"But having said that nicely and kindly to my good friend, I would like, if possible, to organise a debate so that we can go deeper into the topic, which is very important."
"I shall try to concentrate on a small number of topics, which are very important."
"We can talk about common foreign policy, but if we fail, it will not be common foreign policy."
"We may as well just close down if we fail."
"Look at the Balkans: if we are not ready and willing to get the Balkans right, we can talk about Iran, we can talk about whatever you want, but we will fail, and I do not want to fail."
"Therefore, you will always find me working."
"That is what I am trying to do and that is what I will continue to do."
"Thank you for the kind words some of you said about my work."
"Thanks also to those who do not appreciate it."
"I would also like to thank Leïla Shahid for the kind words she has said about me over the last few days when I defend, and as she should defend, the position of President Abu Mazen, whom we should try to help as much as we can."
"I think he is the most important person we should now support."
"On the other issues let us see how things happen."
"In the coming hours we will probably have some very important decisions to take."
"I will be ready and willing, if time permits and you are ready to come, to make a statement to explain if something of great importance happens."
"Mr President, I leave it to you."
"If you want to take it up, do so."
"If you do not, then do not."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"We now come to the statements by the Council and the Commission on the results of the Palestinian elections, the situation in the Middle East and the decision by the Council not to make the report on East Jerusalem available to the public."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although a great deal has already been said under item 4 on the order of business about the elections in Palestine, the consequences resulting from them, and the way forward in their aftermath, I would like to raise a number of points that were the theme of the Council meeting on Monday."
"The first thing to be said – and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs De Keyser and all the Members who have participated in observing this election – is that the elections went according to plan."
"Everyone is agreed on that, and I believe that they were an unambiguous and democratic expression of the popular will."
"That is beyond question."
"The response from the Presidency and practically all the foreign Ministers of the European Union Member States was immediate, and they acted independently of each other, in a manner indicating that they were, in essence, guided by the same principles."
"I would refer the House also to the statements made by the Middle Eastern Quartet between 26 and 30 January, which make it clear that the international community continues to regard a lasting and peaceful solution of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians as conditional upon non-violence, the acknowledgement of Israel’s right to exist, and compliance with all current bilateral obligations."
"It was and is particularly important that the statements by the Council and the Member States of the European Union were almost indistinguishable from those made by our partners in the Quartet."
"What both the Quartet and the European Union expect of any future Palestinian government is an unambiguous commitment to the principles I have enumerated, and they stress that international support for the new Palestinian Autonomous Authority will very definitely be conditional upon adherence to these principles."
"Israel and the Palestinian Autonomous Authority have again been reminded of the obligations imposed on them by the Roadmap, and, in taking this line, the Quartet has received substantial backing from the Council, which also expects of the newly-elected Palestinian Legislative Council that it will endorse a government committed to the principles of a peaceful and negotiated solution to the conflict with Israel founded upon agreements already reached and on the Roadmap, to the rule of law, to reforms and to proper management of its finances."
"If all these things are in place, the European Union will be prepared to continue to support the Palestinians in their economic development and in their building of a democratic state."
"To come to decisions at the present time would be premature, and, as we cannot do that, we must instead spell it out loud and clear that the European Union, like the other partners that are making their own contributions, is prepared to continue giving its support subject to certain conditions being met."
"This debate was, of course, originally prompted by the subject of East Jerusalem, and I would now like to say a few things with specific reference to that."
"What emerged from the previous debate was the very clear expectation that the European Union should take an even-handed approach, with a coherent policy in the Middle East that is guided not merely by the interests of either Israel or the Palestinians, but for which balance is an absolute requirement."
"The European Union is, moreover, concerned about Israel’s activities in and around East Jerusalem, including the continuing settlement and extension of the dividing wall, as well as the destruction of Palestinians’ homes."
"These activities are contrary to international law, make a final settlement of the Jerusalem issue less likely and threaten to make impossible a solution founded upon the coexistence of two viable states."
"These considerations have prompted the Council to ask the relevant Council offices to produce for the EU a detailed analysis of the East Jerusalem situation, drawing on data supplied by the EU’s missions in Jerusalem and Ramallah."
"However, the Council decided on 12 December, in view of the change in the situation, notably the prospect of elections to the Knesset in Israel, not to publish this study, but instead to inform high-ranking representatives of the Israeli Government of the European Union’s concerns in this area."
"Since then, there have been two – one by the EU troika to the Israeli foreign ministry on 19 December and another by the presidency to the principal Israeli political parties on the 23rd of that month."
"The European Union has noted with approval the decision by Israel to allow some voting to take place in East Jerusalem, which will contribute to the successful conduct of the elections."
". Mr President, as we mentioned in the previous debate, we are indeed faced with a new reality."
"On Monday, the EU Foreign Ministers and the Quartet met to discuss our reaction to the entry of Hamas into the Palestinian national political arena, and the implications for our assistance to the Palestinian Authority."
"Let me bear three elements in mind."
"The first are our principles, which should be absolutely clear."
"We supported these elections by providing financial support of 18.5 million EUR."
"In addition, we have heard about 240 election observers under Mrs De Keyser’s great leadership."
"We also demonstrated our commitment to building democratic institutions."
"I think this is clearly a principled position."
"Should we now abandon this position today because we do not like the result of the elections?"
"I think that would also clearly be a mistake."
"On the contrary, we should call for all to respect the outcome of a democratic election."
"When I visited Gaza, I clearly said that we were ready to work with a government that seeks peace by peaceful means."
"As the Quartet reiterated, that means cooperation, a clear commitment to non-violence, a recognition of Israel and the acceptance of previous commitments including the roadmap and the Oslo agreement."
"Secondly, the responsibilities: the ball is now in the camp of the Palestinian leaders."
"It is their responsibility to behave like partners and to meet the criteria set by the international community."
"It is not yet clear how Hamas, under its change and reform platform, will exercise the responsibilities that a new Palestinian government will need to assume."
"This will take time to become apparent."
"In both these discussions, I have advocated a clear message from the international community as to what we expect."
"I have also said that the European Commission stands ready to work with any government that is really seeking peace by peaceful means."
"However, we are mindful of the economic and humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people, which are indeed considerable."
"We are also mindful of the legitimate Palestinian aspirations for statehood."
"We must bear in mind that donor funding is crucial in alleviating the plight of ordinary Palestinians and in preventing the vicious cycle of poverty and extremism."
"But we are also mindful of our own commitment to a two-state solution and to Israel’s security needs."
"Therefore, first and foremost, we expect future members of a Palestinian government to commit to these three principles."
"This applies to the EU-Palestinian Interim Association Agreement."
"This clearly states that freedom of democracy, the rule of law and human rights have to be respected."
"In addition, the Neighbourhood Action Plan also clearly provides that the roadmap has to be the path to peace."
"While the conduct of Hamas, as an organisation, will continue to be the subject of close scrutiny, the new Palestinian government must in the first instance be judged on its actions, including the provision of security and stability."
"The stabilisation of public finances is a major and immediate challenge."
"I am ready to be constructive in reacting to the fiscal problems of the Palestinian Authority – especially now for the interim government and for the caretaker government – by easing their liquidity problems."
"But others, too, must play their role."
"This includes Israel, which has been called upon to continue to transfer customs revenues to the Palestinian Authority."
"I, as well as other Quartet members, will also personally speak to the Israelis about this issue."
"The role of the Palestinians themselves, will also be crucial."
"The World Bank is sending a mission to see what it can do and how the Palestinian Authority could meet the benchmarks, maybe retrenching the budget."
"They have to find a possibility of lifting the suspension on World Bank Trust Fund payments."
"USD 35 million are still lying there."
"They have not been disbursed because they could not be disbursed."
"I hope I can count on the support of Parliament to find a short-term solution."
"However, it will also be important for the new government to get essential reforms back on track."
"This should be done in the same spirit as when we worked with the Palestinian Authority in the past."
"In the meantime, the Commission intends to continue those aid programmes which provide for the basic needs of the Palestinians, including the infrastructure facility, food aid and humanitarian and refugee assistance."
"In closing let me say that the peace process is – as we all know – at a very critical juncture."
"The year 2005 was dominated by unilateral Israeli actions and Palestinian institutional paralysis."
"The international community must now provide a tangible perspective of progress, using our efforts on both sides, with the Israelis and with the Palestinian Authority."
"In this context, I agree, we have to strengthen Mahmoud Abbas and his authority in order to provide stability and demonstrate that the negotiations will bring positive results."
"It is for this reason that I would like to underline the importance of avoiding all unilateral actions which threaten to prejudice final status negotiations, including terrorist attacks, settlement expansions and the routing of the separation barrier."
"Now, therefore, we have to work together very closely: the days and months ahead will be absolutely crucial in determining stability in the Middle East, as well as our own stability."
". Mr President, it was my privilege to be the chairman once again of the largest elected observation mission to the elections in Palestine: that of the European Parliament."
"At the outset I would like to thank the other 26 Members of the European Parliament on the delegation for their work, particularly my deputy chairman, Mrs Napoletano, and, of course Mrs de Keyser, in her capacity as chief observer of the European Union’s team."
"I would also like to thank the staff of the European Parliament who came with us and who did an outstanding job in very difficult circumstances."
"Last week on the streets of Palestine we heard the clamour for choice and change."
"We heard the noise of democracy."
"We found out, as one of my colleagues put it, that the process was perfect."
"Voters went freely to the polls, men, women, young and old."
"The polling stations, usually in schools and administered by teachers, were efficient and well organised."
"By and large the Israeli forces kept out of the way."
"The process was perfect and there is no doubt that the result reflected the wish of the people, but the product more reflects their despair of Fatah than their love of Hamas."
"Indeed, the Hamas people we met were not very loveable."
"Not just in Palestine, but elsewhere in the Arab world – including in Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood did so well in November and December; in the Moroccan parliamentary elections to come – we are about to see the emergence of fundamentalist Islamist politics across the Arab world, an Arab world of 250 million people."
"That is the challenge to all our institutions."
"We must work together, because in my view, although we imparted the process of democracy, we did not impart the values of democracy that we are so used to in the European Union."
"Democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for the protection of minorities: these are the values we need to impart."
". Mr President, my first thoughts go to the members of the mission who are still on the ground."
"I have received many words of thanks that I should like to share with them: they did an extraordinary job."
"I also received a great deal of help from the Council, from Mr Marc Otte, who was there in Palestine, and from Jeanette."
"However, I should like to thank you, in particular, Commissioner."
"You had to guide me through some difficult decisions."
"I will mention two of them."
"Firstly, the deployment of our mission to Gaza amid hazardous security conditions."
"From the beginning, we were the only observation mission deployed in Gaza."
"Next, the delicate decision, Commissioner, to meet the candidates of ‘Change and Reform’, Hamas’ list of candidates."
"Obviously, we chose the candidates that we were going to meet; they were moderate candidates."
"I should also like to say, however, that we were the only mission to meet candidates from the ‘Change and Reform’ party and that history proves us right to have done so, since 44% of the Palestinian population voted in favour of them."
"I should now like to point out that we are faced with three challenges."
"The first challenge – which I too find difficult – is to respect the Palestinian people’s choice, which was, as Mr McMillan-Scott said, one in favour of change and not necessarily of radical Islamism."
"It is not a case of all Palestinians, or indeed of half of the population, having become radical Islamists."
"They want change both inside and outside Palestine, together with the peace that is a long time coming."
"The second challenge, Commissioner, is not to give in to the temptation of unilateralism in the quest for peace."
"Not since the time of Yitzhak Rabin have we seen any hint of bilateralism in the decisions and negotiations between Israel and Palestine."
"The withdrawal from Gaza was a unilateral decision."
"The presence of Hamas in the Palestinian Government today would strengthen that unilateralism and would not lead to peace."
"I hope that the European Union will work along those lines."
"The third challenge consists of making a distinction, irrespective of the circumstances, between the Palestinian Government, which will have to face up to its responsibilities, and the Palestinian people, which cannot be taken hostage on account of the choice it has made."
"Admittedly, the people made this choice, but it has basic needs that we will have to ensure are met whatever the future holds; otherwise we will be heading for a catastrophe."
"To conclude, let me tell you what a Palestinian woman said to me just after the elections."
"In response to my question: ‘are you not afraid of being governed by Sharia law?’ she said: ‘No, we were not afraid of saying no to the Israelis, who are stronger than us."
"We were not afraid of saying no to Fatah because it let us down."
"We will be able to say no to Hamas if it subsequently lets us down’."
"There you have the entire lesson in parliamentary democracy that the Palestinians have completely understood."
". Madam President, elections are like a picture."
"In fact, they are like an x-ray of a society at a precise moment in time."
"These elections are a call for realism for all of us and a call for an end to hypocrisy in the international community."
"Millions of Palestinians are desperate."
"They have nothing to lose and they vote for those who promise any change, any reform, and an end to corruption."
"We speak too much about the Middle East and too little about the real situation of men, women, children and elderly people who, along with their families, are desperate."
"We must respect this will."
"We must deliver a message of respect to this new majority."
"It must, however, be combined with a message pointing out that our support is conditional upon the end of violence, violent resistance and terrorism."
"But we must respect the will of the people."
"Let us not pretend we will keep showing the same movie and keep the same script, but simply change one of the characters."
"That would be a recipe for failure."
"We are faced with a new scenario that requires new proposals, a new commitment and new pressures on both sides."
"The current situation has arisen precisely because we have not done this."
"There must be new pressure on both sides of the conflict."
"We must search for peace, but we must never forget that we are talking about real people."
"Madam President, I believe that the European Union’s mediating role is more necessary now than ever."
"Now would be the worst possible time to abandon the region and the Palestinian people, and at the same time we should learn the appropriate lessons."
"What have we learnt from our involvement in the region and our aid to the Palestinian people?"
"What have we learnt from saying for years that the solution was elections and democracy, that they were a step forwards and a condition for peace, when we are now seeing that those elections have become a problem rather than a solution?"
"I have heard no self-criticism from the Council or the Commission with regard to what we have done wrong, after investing billions of euros."
"I believe that this Hamas victory reflects a situation in which Israeli policy has managed to realise a self-fulfilling prophecy."
"For years they have said: there is no Palestinian partner for peace."
"Well, in the end that is precisely what they have achieved."
"The European Union must now make it abundantly clear that, if Hamas wants to continue, it must accept the rules of the game and the agreements already reached by the Palestinian Government, it must recognise Israel and it must disband its militias."
"And at the same time we must work very hard to open up a prospect for peace."
"One of the fundamental reasons for Hamas’s victory is that there is no hope, there is no hope of a definitive agreement in the Middle East."
"Furthermore, the Palestinians’ quality of life has continued to deteriorate year after year."
"The Quartet’s commitments on the ground to improve the well-being of the Palestinians have progressed at a snail's pace, very slowly, and the complicated procedures and obstacles have not been convincingly overcome."
"I believe that we must mediate and work as we have never done before to open up this prospect for peace."
"– Madam President, first of all I too should like to take my turn in thanking Véronique de Keyser and Eduard McMillan-Scott for the effort they made, together with the other MEPs, during their mission."
"The election count confirmed Hammas as the first political power and this result must be respected."
"At the same time, the result should not come as a surprise."
"It is the consequence of numerous factors both local and international."
"The Palestinians, despite the pronouncements of the West, have unfortunately not yet seen the objective of creating their own independent state being promoted."
"However, they have seen the racist policy of the wall and settlement being legalised."
"The result constitutes a message both to the Palestinians themselves and to the international community, especially us, about our inadequate policy, which failed to exert pressure on Israel to apply the road map and the UN resolutions in order to promote a political process and was content merely to support the Palestinians financially."
"Unfortunately, I am not sure if we were able to receive these messages, given that today a resolution which is one-sided and unilateral is being promoted in the European Parliament."
"Our reaction to the new government cannot be to stop efforts to restart the peace process, as announced by the United States."
"At the same time, Hammas needs to denounce violence, recognise the right of the state of Israel to exist and cooperate with President Abbas in continuing the peace process."
"At the same time, reconfirmation is needed, both by the European Union and by the other members of the Quartet, of the undertaking to create an independent Palestinian state next to the state of Israel with East Jerusalem as its capital."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is reaping what it has sown: the billions lavished on Palestine – money that has been ill used and not properly accounted for – have resulted in the Hamas tsunami."
"A terrorist organisation has thus come to power, one whose declared strategic aim – as confirmed by the countless ambiguities with which the organisation’s leaders answered our questions during the mission – is the creation of a state, waving goodbye to peace, human rights, and the rights of women and religious minorities."
"Hamas has given us a very clear response by rejecting all the requests made by the Middle East Quartet."
"The Socialist International, through Mr Schulz, has already said that it is in favour of negotiating with Hamas, although it has never spoken out against the scandalous use of the aid given to the Palestinian Authority."
"The truth is, however, that anyone who bets on Hamas becoming in any way more moderate is handing Palestine to the extremists for good, and that is a destiny that the brave, humble, intelligent, hard-working Palestinian people certainly do not deserve."
"Madam President, quite apart from the question as to whether or not the notorious report by the European diplomats is official in nature, we have to conclude that the effect of this document, which has been the subject of much debate, is, if nothing else, to provide yet more evidence of the far too one-sided pro-Palestinian stance of the official bodies of the European Union."
"The European representatives constantly claim, as Bismarck did, to be honest brokers, but in reality, they mainly defend Palestinian demands, which is detrimental to the EU’s independence."
"While we are at it, we might as well own up to the fact that the many billions of European tax money that have been channelled to the Palestinian Authority over the past few years by way of aid, have mainly served to support a wholly corrupt regime."
"I have put many questions about this to the Council and Commission, which have each time been rebuffed, and now we are left dealing with the consequences."
"The corrupt have been wiped away by the election victory of the terrorist Islamic movement Hamas."
"The EU’s responsibility in this respect is crushing."
"Madam President, although the recent results of the Palestinian elections hardly inspire optimism, I believe that one of the greatest mistakes the European Union, in general, and this Parliament, in particular, could make, would be to rush to hasty conclusions."
"What I do believe we can say without any mistake is that the presence of the European Union’s electoral observation mission has been a notable success for the European Commission and that — as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has said — it increases the Union’s visibility and contributes to the consolidation of democracy throughout the world."
"We must therefore congratulate the Commission and also our fellow Members Mr McMillan-Scott and Mrs De Keyser, as well as the other Members of this Parliament who accompanied them."
"Madam President, I believe that it would be premature to draw the conclusion that the spluttering peace process in the Middle East will be buried as a result of these elections or that these elections herald the death of the Oslo agreements."
"I believe that we must allow a little time to pass and see what moves are made."
"In particular, despite the mistakes made, we must treat the President of the Palestinian National Authority as a legitimate interlocutor, wait until the new government is formed, remembering — as Mrs De Keyser said — that 75% of the citizens who have voted for this political formation do not want the destruction of Israel and, finally, Madam President, assess what impact this electoral process will have on the Israeli elections."
"Sooner or later, Commissioner, however, regardless of the urgent short-term issues, the European Union will have to give its opinion on something that is fundamental: whether the immense needs — as you have said — of the Palestinian people are compatible with the existence of Hamas, whose founding convention calls for the liquidation and destruction of the State of Israel, and the fact that it appears on the European Union's list of terrorist organisations."
"In this regard, Madam President, the European Union's action must not show double standards: it must renounce terror and violence as a means of political action or renounce European Union action and aid."
"Madam President, I wish to thank Mr McMillan-Scott and Mrs De Keyser: the elections went smoothly in every way."
"Over and above that, these are historic elections: this is the first democratic change in the Arab world."
"The Palestinian people did not vote in favour of Hamas, it voted against Fatah."
"Hamas won on the basis of a programme centred on the fight against corruption and on the reform of the PLO, the only organisation authorised to negotiate."
"Above all, it won on the basis of a social programme to be implemented specifically within Palestine."
"Those were my specific impressions when, away from our mission, I met the Palestinian mayors and their association, which is dominated by Hamas."
"As for aid, we must continue helping the Palestinian people, make sure that officials are paid and, above all, prevent the State from collapsing, otherwise the Palestinian Authority will fall into the hands of another country."
"It is imperative that we wait, ladies and gentlemen, but let us not become naively optimistic."
"Read the Hamas Charter: it is despicable and disgraceful."
"It must be rendered null and void so that the new government can become a discussion partner."
"We have to set a date – a schedule – so that Hamas faces up to its responsibilities, because it has become a legitimate party in a democratic country."
"Madam President, I will be quick as I only have one minute in which to express my disappointment at seeing that, in this Chamber, our Parliament has chosen carefully to avoid ‘speaking the truth’."
"There are six references, seven recitals and twelve articles in this text on the Palestinian election result, and not once do they manage to mention – even mention – Hamas and the Charter of hate underpinning its ideology and its action."
"Mr Schapira just said how despicable – I think that that was the term used - the Charter is, and Mr Cohn-Bendit spoke of a repugnant charter."
"Clearly, I share these opinions."
"I would say that we deserve a Nobel ‘Cliché’ Prize at a time when, despite the Charter, we have actually heard the Middle East Quartet, Europe’s ministers, the media and Mr Solana, only a few moments ago, asking themselves the crucial question: how can we cooperate with Hamas and continue providing our vital assistance to the Palestinians if Hamas does not renounce terror and does not recognise Israel?"
"Mahmoud Abbas, for his part, does not pull any punches when it comes to setting out his demands faced with the Islamists."
"Yes, the ballot was democratic – at least in terms of the way in which it was carried out."
"Yes, Hamas won."
"Yes, we want to continue helping the Palestinian Authority. Yes, in the end it is up to Hamas today to take the crucial decisions and to change."
"This is what needed to be said no less clearly and directly to the pragmatists on both sides: a democratic ballot has just brought to power an undemocratic ideology."
"That is the persistently difficult equation that we need to resolve today."
"Madam President, the election in Palestine was conducted in an exemplary fashion."
"I should like to congratulate the Palestinians and say a big thank you to my colleagues."
"There are still problems in Israel and Palestine, however. Palestine is occupied."
"The fact is highlighted in a list of UN resolutions, which criticise Israel’s ongoing breaches of international law, as well as the settlements, the dreadful Wall and the attempt to annex East Jerusalem – just to mention the worst problems."
"The difficult situation in Palestine is mentioned in the common motion for a resolution, which contains a number of constructive points."
"The proposal sets out the relevant conditions for Hamas."
"We must keep a careful watch to ensure that Hamas does not again have recourse to terrorism, it now having kept the peace for more than a year."
"Certainly, we must not take away the right they have under the Geneva Convention to armed resistance to the occupation, but we must make determined and carefully considered efforts to ensure that the situation does not get out of control."
"All non-governmental groups should be disarmed both in Palestine and among the Israeli settlers."
"We must discourage any form of radicalisation in both Palestine and Israel."
"The motion for a resolution that is before us might well be read as a unilateral recognition and, if we are to help bring about peace, that would of course be dangerous."
"I would therefore call on Members to vote in favour of the amendments by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, especially the amendment to paragraph 10, which contains a very clear formulation of the Council’s decision not to publish the report on East Jerusalem, prepared by the Heads of Delegation in Palestine."
"Once this report’s criticism of the situation in East Jerusalem, together with the attendant recommendations, have been clearly withdrawn, the motion for a resolution will be a tool well suited to making further progress towards a just peace between Israel and Palestine."
"I would call on us to be consistent now."
"We do not have sufficient credibility among the Palestinians, and it is time we did so."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must say how grateful I am to the Commission, as well as to Mrs De Keyser, Mr McMillan-Scott and our whole delegation, for their sensitivity and intelligence."
"I believe, however, that the failure to publish the report on East Jerusalem – which in actual fact is the focus of the debate – and the failure to adopt appropriate measures effectively gave Hamas a helping hand, because there is no doubt that certain truths should not be left unspoken."
"I think it was on the cards that Hamas would win."
"Much of the responsibility for that lies with the international community, which, after the Oslo agreements were signed, was incapable of ensuring that international law would prevail and be respected."
"Thus it neither implemented the ‘two peoples, two states’ principle, nor guaranteed Mahmoud Abbas sufficient support, since funding alone is not enough – what the Palestinians want is political support."
"Nor did it, at the same time, exert the necessary pressure on Israel to prevent the growth of the settlements and the annexation of land."
"In particular, although the international community had the strength needed to exert pressure, I feel that it did not succeed in ensuring that negotiations would effectively be resumed."
"Nonetheless, the Palestinians managed to respond with a democratic electoral process in which the people did take part, expressing their need for life, justice and peace."
"For me as a woman, the Hamas victory is a terrible outcome;"
"I see it almost certainly, however, as a protest vote against al-Fatah, which held sway over Palestinian society for many years but was unable to keep its promises, and also against corruption, although that is a somewhat demagogical issue."
"In my view, it really is the European Commission’s and the international community’s task to rekindle the dialogue and to keep it alive, thus ensuring that both Hamas and Israel can put a stop to violence and acknowledge the ‘two peoples, two states’ principle in practice."
"Madam President, Hamas is evil: it is responsible for some of the most vile terrorist attacks ever witnessed."
"The fact that it now has attracted a democratic mandate does not alter or dilute its terrorist persona."
"Coming from Northern Ireland, I can speak from an experience of a like terrorist organisation – the IRA – also securing an electoral base."
"There, fundamental mistakes were made in the hope of encouraging them away from the paths of terror."
"The values of democracy were distorted, unwarranted concession after concession was made, but as each was pocketed, new demands appeared."
"That is how terrorist organisations think and work, as they fight their long, multi-faceted war."
"I therefore urge that a firm and resolute stand be taken, with no fudging and no budging from the principle that no aid can flow from the EU to an authority run by the terrorists of Hamas."
"Bend that rule and we and democracy will be the losers."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe must have a basic goal for establishing peace in the Middle East and for combating terrorism, including by political means."
"That goal is to guarantee both the existence and security of Israel and the creation of a Palestinian state."
"Significant steps have recently been made in that direction, thanks to the work of Ariel Sharon and Abu Mazen."
"Is the electoral success of Hamas likely to be a setback for us?"
"Is it likely to turn Palestine into a new theocratic, fundamentalist regime?"
"The words of Mahmoud Zahar, the Hamas spokesman, who promised a new Palestinian Government without secular members because ‘they bring in AIDS and homosexuality’, certainly do not bode well, and nor do other statements about Israel."
"Europe has a duty to make its voice heard, through strong political initiatives to force Hamas to keep to the path that has already been embarked upon."
"Europe will have to make the new government realise that if it were to think of threatening Israel’s existence it would lose the funds intended for Palestine."
"If Hamas chooses the path of intolerance, it will cause its people great harm and have a negative effect on the outcome of the Israeli elections."
"Let us therefore support Abu Mazen and welcome the idea of his visiting the European Parliament."
"Let us also stand up for the rights of Christian Palestinians: they are a minority threatened with extinction in the Middle East, but are an important factor for peace and stability."
"Let us work confidently so that the ideas of Anwar Zaboun, who said that negotiations with Israel are , or forbidden by religion, do not prevail."
"I am certain that the Palestinian people do not see things in that way."
"Madam President, the new Palestinian parliament is one that has emerged from elections that the international community has internationally recognised."
"We respect this result and will support President Abu Mazen as he tries to put together a government that will be strong in its defence of international law and in its opposition to violence."
"It therefore appears perverse that the threat should today be made to turn off the flow of European funding to the Palestinian Authority."
"If that were to happen, there would be a risk of aggressive states and groupings taking the EU’s place and of unemployed Palestinian soldiers and police officers being recruited by Al-Qaeda."
"Let us remind ourselves of the fact that, on 13 June 1980, at the Venice Summit, the EC recognised the PLO."
"It went on, through dialogue, to guide what had once been a terrorist organisation along the path that led to it recognising Israel’s right to exist and participation in the peace process."
"Hamas’ election victory now presents us with a similar challenge."
"It is worthy of note that the USA, before the elections, made it known that there had to be talks with Hamas, despite its being on the list of terrorist organisations."
"The European Parliament must now make its own constructive contribution and, as soon as possible, invite a delegation from the newly-elected Palestinian Assembly to Brussels, for it is now that confidence-building measures – rather than threatening gestures – are urgently called for."
"Madam President, in the past weeks we have seen the cycle of contrasts and contradictions that has come to characterise the EU’s relationship with the Middle East."
"We call for legitimacy and transparency from our partners, yet we suppress the truth when it legally obliges us to act."
"We facilitate democratic elections in Palestine, yet we question the people’s voice when we hear it."
"We aid the corrupt Fatah for years, yet within days we doubt the stated humanitarian intentions of the participants of the coming new Palestinian Authority."
"We doubt the new Palestinian Authority’s wish to build bridges of confidence and cooperation, yet we overlook Israel’s continued construction of the separation barrier."
"We rightly fund democratic institutions in Palestine, yet we impede the right to self determination of the people annexed in East Jerusalem."
"We rightly call on Hamas to renounce violence or face consequences, yet stand by while the Israeli army shoots innocent children in Gaza and Ramallah with no consequence."
"We rightly call for Hamas to recognise Israel, yet stay silent while Israel flouts international laws."
"Fundamentally, Palestinians ask: is the EU about democracy or suppression?"
"Is the EU about bridges or barriers?"
"Is the EU about respect or defiance of international law?"
"Hamas’ decision to swap bullets for ballots potentially marks a strategic shift that could lead to talks with Israel."
"The EU must match that shift and demonstrate the crucial equality and equity required to the creation of a Palestinian state, living in peace with Israel."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, we must stop at once the flow of money to Palestine, where Hamas has taken power."
"This is clearly a terrorist movement, which does not recognise the state of Israel, which does not want to disarm and which lives by Sharia law."
"How will Hamas make use of EU taxpayers’ money?"
"Will it burn out people’s eyes, stone women or cut off people’s hands?"
"How many people will Hamas’s weapons kill?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must admit that the Union has to take its fair share of the blame for the powder keg of the Middle East, having buried its head in the sand and pursued an ambiguous policy."
"I am Czech and my country was one of the first to supply weapons to the new state of Israel in 1948, so that they could defend their territory."
"At the time, the current EU Member States expressed horror at the holocaust and supported the establishment of a Jewish state."
"How have they acted since?"
"Whom has the Union unequivocally supported – Israel or Palestinian terrorists?"
"Please let us put a stop to this double-speak and say loudly and clearly that Hamas, which for a number of years has been receiving money indirectly from the Union, pursues iniquitous policies, and that EU citizens will not pay for them out of their taxes."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, here we are, reacting with astonishment to something that is actually self-explanatory: an election being won by a party that gave people the feeling that it cared about them, while the others could be written off as a crew of corrupt crooks."
"There are conclusions that we have to draw from this."
"We have to work even more to make EU aid visible, for by so doing we will get the message across to the public that peace and democracy are worth supporting."
"I believe it is not just governments that need to hear that."
"This election result is a disaster for the region."
"One can certainly talk in terms of a five-year rhythm here: it was about ten years ago that Rabin died, and terrorist acts meant that Peres was not elected; five years later saw the start of the Intifada, and now here we are again."
"Things keep starting over and over again from square one."
"Even so, I do not believe that we should abandon hope of Hamas playing its part in development, but we do have to spell out the conditions under which that is possible."
"If, on the basis of the seats won in the parliament, Hamas takes over the Palestinian Authority, it must agree to renounce violence, to acknowledge Israel’s right to exist and accept the agreements already reached, or else everything will have to start again from the ground up."
"My hope is that this will happen before the Israeli elections, so that we can avoid the sort of adverse occurrences that would make it harder for us to get back together."
"During this period, the quartet will need to make it clear that, if it works, financial aid will be forthcoming and security will be guaranteed."
"It is for that reason that I am so glad that the quartet responded so quickly at the weekend."
"I would also like to express my gratitude to Mrs De Keyser and her team and also to our parliamentary delegation, led by Mr McMillan-Scott, for their work."
"– Madam President, I too should like to take my turn and start by congratulating my honourable friends Véronique De Keyser and Edward McMillan-Scott on their important contribution to the monitoring of the Palestinian elections."
"The Palestinian people voted in a democratic manner and I believe that all of us today should respect the democratic will of the Palestinian people and formulate the new European strategy based on the new political reality in the Middle East and Palestine."
"Unfortunately Mr Solana is not here today for me to tell him that his statement a week before the Palestinian elections that economic aid to Palestine should be frozen if Hammas won was a very serious mistake."
"This statement by Mr Solana was used by Hammas and basically functioned as a boomerang for the moderate Palestinian progressive forces."
"This being so, I see a serious deficit in the European Union."
"I have seen no statement, no declaration of awareness about the unilateral policy of the Israeli Government, I have seen no statement about the policy and decision by Mr Olmert to freeze the USD 50 million paid back to the Palestinian authority."
"I have one thing to ask of the Commission: to request the prolongation of the truce by Hammas."
"This is an important issue, rather than various conditions which are unilateral towards the Palestinian side."
"Madam President, I had the deepest misgivings about allowing an unreformed Hamas to run candidates for the Palestinian elections."
"Perhaps the calculation of Mr Bush and others was that Hamas would not win, or that it would significantly modify its rhetoric and policies if brought into the electoral process."
"I beg to differ."
"Hamas remains a terrorist organisation with links to the Muslim Brotherhood and Hezbollah."
"It is committed to the extermination of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state with Jerusalem as its capital."
"Indeed, its charter suggests it is committed to global Jihad, including using suicide bombers and establishing a theocracy and an Islamic caliphate everywhere."
"Clearly, if it held these views anywhere in an EU Member State, it would have been banned as a political party."
"I have always criticised the rampant corruption under Chairman Arafat and tried to investigate this in the last Parliament, but regrettably my working group findings were never debated in plenary."
"We now see a massive protest vote by ordinary Palestinians."
"Nevertheless, it is clear that an organisation banned as a terrorist organisation, such as Hamas, cannot be a legitimate interlocutor for the EU, nor receive a penny of our taxpayers’ money until it forswears violence and recognises the state of Israel."
"I have always supported the security fence on the basis that it has saved human lives from the evil of suicide bombers."
"It has, regrettably, truncated communities, but it does not constitute the final border of a future Palestinian state."
"Nevertheless, a Hamas victory will make a land-for-peace deal much more difficult to realise."
"Also, the final settlement of the East Jerusalem question, as well as the right of return questions, will be almost impossible with Hamas in government for the Palestinian Authority."
"Madam President, Hamas’s election victory is certainly not good news for democrats and progressives, nor for people on the left, but that victory has been the result of fair elections, and we must acknowledge that."
"There is therefore one thing we must be pleased about: Hamas is now in the political game, and that is progress."
"And in order to draw it further into the political game, we must be able also to incorporate it fully into the relations between the Palestinian National Authority and the European Union."
"I would like to point out that the first time that a Hamas representative elected at these elections meets with the European Union may well be within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly which will take place on 26 and 27 March."
"And then the new Israeli Members of Parliament following the elections in that country will come there."
"Let us all therefore contribute in that shared forum to dialogue and a democratic modernisation of Hamas which will benefit everybody."
"Madam President, the statistics are clear: one more Hamas seat at national level means many more at district level."
"People trust Hamas locally and we have to respect them in an intelligent, transparent and responsible way."
"Do we have a plan to do so?"
"We have a strategy: non-violence, disarmament and the existence of Israel."
"In relation to non-violence: if on the one day we have a declaration denouncing violence and the next we suffer a terrorist attack, what will we do then?"
"Hamas is a resistance movement."
"If occupation continues, the government will not exclude violent resistance."
"What will we do then?"
"In relation to the existence of the State of Israel: is beginning negotiations after the Israeli election enough?"
"In relation to disarmament: do we want to include Hamas militias in the Palestinian security and police forces?"
"Under which conditions?"
"Do we have any plans?"
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is, of course, no doubt that mistakes were made in the past, but now is the time to look forwards."
"The conclusions we come to must not be premature and the strategy for the next stage must be properly thought through."
"In the course of the debate, it was said – and rightly – that we do still, of course have a partner in the person of President Abbas, who is someone with whom we can still talk and with whom we must continue to negotiate. We can continue counting on him as a partner, for the new government neither will nor can alter the constitution that is coming into force."
"We must not abandon hope; on the contrary, we must look to the future."
"One thing is clear, though – the Council spelled it out on Monday, and so did the Quartet – and that is that there are principles from which we must not deviate, and let there be no doubt that among them are non-violence, recognition of Israel’s right to exist and the continuation of the peace process."
"It has also been said, time and time again, that European policy must be even-handed, and with that I can only agree; indeed, it is a self-evident truth."
"I also made clear in my introductory statement what the position of the Council is as regards our relationship with Israel and our criticisms of it."
"What matters is that Europe should speak with one voice."
"If we want to have any influence, we also need to speak in the same language as our partners in the Quartet, and that is important too."
"I am particularly grateful to the Commission for having developed, with careful consideration and without undue haste, a strategy for helping the Palestinian people."
"As was said by several participants in the debate, the Palestinian people have suffered a great deal and continue to do so, and we cannot let them down."
"I know, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, that the Commission’s policy with regard to them is a very good and very coherent one, and one in which we should give them our support."
". Madam President, Mr Winkler, ladies and gentlemen,"
"First of all let me thank you all for the kind words on the elections and the observations."
"All credit goes to Mrs De Keyser and her team as well as to Mr McMillan-Scott and his team."
"Credit also goes to the Palestinian people, who have shown that they can elect in a free and fair way, even if we are not always satisfied with the result."
"We now have to agree to respect the will of the Palestinian people."
"As we said in the Quartet statement, the Palestinians have now voted for change."
"We know why."
"At the same time, they desire peace."
"Polls show that there is a slight majority in favour of peace with Israel."
"This has to be the way forward."
"We are ready to continue to support the Palestinian people."
"We wish to do so, just as we have done until now."
"There is no other organisation other than the European Union, and particularly the European Commission, that has done so much for the Palestinian people for years."
"However, being elected and taking office is also a matter of political responsibility."
"That is why we ask – and even expect – that a new Palestinian government confirm its commitment to peace through peaceful means, in particular though the three conditions that were mentioned in the Quartet statement: non-violence, the recognition of Israel and the respect of previous obligations, namely the Oslo agreement and the roadmap."
"These clearly show a commitment to peace, to a two-state solution, but also to an ambitious reform agenda for the Palestinian Authority."
"I very much wanted to mention this."
"I would also like to say that the policy of the Quartet – and here we are really working together – is a very balanced one."
"I heard a few Members say that we were one-sided: those who have not yet seen the latest Quartet statement should please look at it."
"I would like to refer to the last paragraph where we say: ‘the Quartet reiterates its commitment to the principles outlined in the roadmap and the previous statement, and reaffirms its commitment to a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict based upon UN Security Council resolutions Nos 242 and 338’."
"I think this, per se, reflects our support for mutual obligations."
"Let me reiterate that our first objective must now be to ensure that Israel transfers Palestinian tax revenues to the Authority."
"More precisely, this is Palestinian money."
"We do not think it would be constructive for Israel to withhold it at such a crucial time."
"I will also speak to the Israeli Authorities about this and I know other colleagues in the Quartet will also do so."
"I very much hope that funds will be transferred soon, because they would cover a good proportion of the salaries of the Palestinian Authority employees and would also provide much-needed income for the families."
"That would be a humanitarian gesture that Israel could make at a crucial time."
"I am also reassured by the President of the World Bank, who is of the same opinion."
"I met Mr Wolfowitz yesterday in London."
"Today he has been quoted as saying that ‘it will help the whole process if the life of the average Palestinian improves; we ought to be the last people to disengage’."
"I very much welcome this statement and hope it will help."
"However, this is also why the members of the Arab League should honour their pledges of support as soon as possible."
"Yesterday, at the London Conference for Afghanistan, Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik and I both took every opportunity to talk to the different Arab representatives, in order to make that possible."
"We therefore have to be very vigilant in this period."
"It is a crucial period because we also have elections in Israel."
"We want the peace process to be able to continue in the future."
"I therefore invite Members to remain engaged with us."
"Despite its difficulties, we would like to make the path to peace less bumpy in the future."
"Six motions for a resolution(1) for the closure of the debate have been submitted pursuant to Rule 103(2)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"– Having overcome its initial shock at the outcome of the Palestinian elections, Europe must now acknowledge the legality of the poll and the legitimacy of the new government and, indeed, welcome the high turnout of Palestinian citizens in the poll."
"Only by showing complete trust and continuing to cooperate can we demand the necessary commitment from the new government to carry out the roadmap."
"We must, of course, be more watchful, precisely because of the serious tensions that have arisen in recent years between the party now in power and so-called Western society, but I am sure that clenching our fists is not the way to eliminate that kind of friction."
"On the contrary, Hamas needs to be given a chance to show that it can respect the commitment made more than once by President Abbas himself to stick to the schedule, to respect existing agreements and obligations and to pursue a negotiated settlement of the conflict with Israel."
"Cutting off funding to the Palestinian Authority is therefore not the solution."
"What is needed – and we must not be moved on this – is for the monitoring system to be enhanced, including through greater international cooperation, so as to ensure that the resources are used exclusively for the economic, political and social development of Palestinian society, and not for the destruction of our own."
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on the EU’s position in relation to the government of Cuba, put by Graham Watson, Cecilia Malmström, Emma Bonino and Marco Pannella on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (O-0112/2005 – B6-0675/2005)."
"Madam President, Mr President-in–Office of the Council, somewhat overshadowed by the dramatic events in the Middle East, there is, in Havana, a bearded dictator who has mocked the world for decades."
"He rules over a country in which human rights are violated, in which the people live in great poverty and in which dissidents are imprisoned and persecuted."
"After China, Cuba is the world’s biggest prison for journalists."
"In the spring of 2003, a wave of oppression swept over the island."
"Leading figures in the democracy movement were arrested and, after farcical trials, 75 of them were sentenced to long prison terms."
"Last year, a large group of young people were arrested as a preventative measure, the idea being that they might cause trouble."
"That shows just how much fear there is on the island."
"When, immediately before Christmas, the European Parliament awarded its Sakharov Prize to the Ladies in White – the wives and daughters of the imprisoned dissidents – representatives of the movement were not allowed to leave the island in order to travel to Strasbourg."
"Cuba is a horrendous dictatorship, and the facts I have just mentioned are well known."
"In recent years, the situation has deteriorated."
"For political prisoners, the situation is very serious."
"My friend Héctor Palacios, who was given a 25-year prison sentence, is very ill, and the doctors fear for his life."
"He is not receiving help for his high blood pressure and the complications surrounding his heart condition."
"To cite another example, Adolfo Fernandez Seinz too – a journalist sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment - is in poor health and has lost 20 kilos in weight since he was imprisoned."
"Outside prison, dissidents too are being persecuted, for example the Sakharov Prize winner Oswaldo José Payá Sardiñas and the blind human rights activist Juan Carlos Gonzalez Leiva, who has been under house arrest since April 2004."
"It is, of course, completely unacceptable that people should still be kept imprisoned in Cuba because of their views."
"It is equally unacceptable that these prisoners should not receive the help they need when they are in a very poor state of health."
"When, a year ago, the Council of Ministers made up its mind to change the common position it had had for many years and, instead, began to talk with the regime, it imagined it could see some kind of opening up in Cuba, with possibilities there."
"A majority in this Chamber criticised that policy and, a year later, it has to be acknowledged that the policy has had no effect."
"It was a wrong decision, and it should be reviewed."
"What does the Council intend to do now in order to support the dissidents in Cuba?"
"How are we constructively to support the democracy movement and the Cuban people?"
"We must increase the pressure on Fidel Castro and, at the same time, find a strategic way of identifying the positive forces of democracy that exist."
"Why is it so difficult to support the forces of democracy in Cuba when it is possible to do so in Belarus?"
"There is still an embarrassing kind of romanticism surrounding Castro."
"I should very much like to have some answers from the Council to these questions."
". Madam President, Mrs Malmström, the Council welcomes Parliament’s ongoing interest in the improvement of the situation in Cuba, and we will be unstinting in our joint efforts at bringing about peaceful change there."
"Let me quote from the common position arrived at in December 1996, which is still applicable, and states, among other things, that ‘The objective of the European Union in its relations with Cuba is to encourage a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people."
"A transition would most likely be peaceful if the present regime were itself to initiate or permit such a process."
"It is not European Union policy to try to bring about change by coercive measures with the effect of increasing the economic hardship of the Cuban people.’"
"With the aim of fostering peaceful change in Cuba, the European Union has entered into dialogue with the Cuban authorities and with all sections of Cuban society, in the course of which the Cuban authorities are regularly reminded of their fundamental responsibility as regards human rights, principally the free expression of opinion and the freedom of association."
"Since there is no point in taking political action if it remains without any effect on people where they live, the Council has altered some practical details of its policy in order to make it really effective, particularly in stepping up dialogue with the peaceful opposition, which has given a very warm welcome to these close contacts."
"Following on from the final conclusions of the Council of 31 January 2005, both the Luxembourg and British Presidencies and, above all, the European Union’s delegation in Havana have reinvigorated relations with the opposition and with independent elements and have, in so doing, focused on essential medium-term issues associated with transition, including, for example, the development of dialogue with important members of the peaceful opposition with particular reference to their practical plans for the future, and on other means whereby independent organisations and those belonging to civil society may be supported."
"At the same time, the Council has forthrightly condemned unacceptable conduct on the part of Cuban officialdom not only in the country itself but also to European politicians and visitors."
"The presidency has raised the issue of access to ministries in Havana and made the Cuban Government aware of the fact that it can expect no dialogue if it refuses such access to embassies from the European Union and refuses to recognise or speak with representatives from the EU."
"The Council has also underlined its willingness to continue with constructive dialogue with the Cuban authorities, on a reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis, concerning, , the grant of visas for visits by representatives of the governments concerned."
"The Presidency of the European Union has given voice, in an official statement, to its regret at the action taken by the Cuban Government to prevent the so-called ‘Ladies in white’ – from travelling to Strasbourg to receive the 2005 Sakharov Prize for intellectual freedom awarded to them by the European Parliament."
"Such occurrences, like also the government’s refusal to allow Osvaldo Payá to travel to take part in an NGOs’ forum on the free expression of opinion in December, make it clear that the Cuban authorities disregard their own citizens’ right to freedom of movement, as set out in Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"The Council also regrets the lack of further progress as regards the release of political detainees, and has denounced the detention, last summer, of more members of the peaceful opposition and the action taken by the Cuban authorities to restrict the free expression of opinion, freedom of assembly, and the freedom of the press."
"The Council continues to demand of Cuba that it release all political detainees."
"The EU has intervened in respect of the situation of those detainees who have protested against the condition under which they are being held by going on hunger strike."
"Furthermore, and in conclusion, let me remind the House of the active and ongoing part played by the EU, with the open assistance of your House, in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, where it was, last year, one of the co-signatories of a resolution tabled on the subject of Cuba."
". Madam President, Cuba is the only country in Latin America that is not linked to the European Union by means of an association or cooperation agreement."
"This is not the fault of the European Union, nor of many Members of this Parliament, who have worked hard to preserve the channels for dialogue with the Cuban authorities and people."
"Regrettable events, such as not allowing the Women in White to come to the European Parliament or the increased repression – as referred to in the text of the resolution that this Parliament will approve tomorrow – suffered by independent journalists and as recently condemned by Reporters without Borders, peaceful militants and human rights activists, demonstrate clearly that the most fundamental rights on that island are being systematically ignored."
"The resolution therefore states that these events are frustrating our aspiration to improve relations between the European Union and Cuba, which is the main objective of the changes to the common position made in January 2005 by the Council, and calls upon the latter, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to act accordingly."
"I would like to remind you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that when you approved the lifting of the measures that accompanied the Council's common position, you called for the immediate and unconditional release of the people who had been detained, and now their situation has worsened."
"Madam President, Andrei Sakharov said that the voices that count most are often those that are not heard."
"And I believe, Madam President, that this Parliament has once again had to speak out in this Chamber, which represents the citizens of Europe, in support of the cause of freedom and in order to defend, and expose the plight of, those people in Cuba who are fighting for their freedom and dignity."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, our group is pleased that the context in which this debate on Cuba is taking place is likely to ensure a broad consensus for a motion for a resolution."
"We have always believed that in this Parliament and in the Union’s institutions there is a broad basis for agreement and for moving relations with Cuba in the right direction."
"As a group, our position is very clear: firstly, in the current context, we can only confirm that the Cuban authorities have not sent out the hoped-for signals with regard to improving human rights in the country."
"Secondly, we are not finding it possible to present the Sakharov Prize to the Women in White and we must therefore urge the Cuban authorities to allow this group to visit Europe in response to the European Parliament’s invitation."
"At the same time, I believe that we must call upon the President of Parliament to do everything in his power to ensure that the Prize is properly presented."
"Nevertheless, our view is that, in the current climate of relations, the prospects for progress are better now than under the Council’s previous policy, which led us up a blind alley, as did, to say the least, the policy which for decades insisted on sanctions and an embargo."
"We believe that the Council's current policy should be maintained, with two objectives: firstly, to continue to call strongly for human rights to be respected in Cuba, the release of prisoners of conscience and of the peaceful opposition and respect for democratic freedoms and, secondly, to maintain and increase relations and dialogue with all of the political and social sectors in Cuba that are involved or interested in relations with Europe and the development of the country and the inevitable changes that we are going to see in Cuba in the near future."
"I agree that there are many alarm signals indicating that the Cuban regime is still implementing a policy of repression of dissident opinion, of arbitrary imprisonment of opposition groups, of constant harassment of anybody expressing opinions contrary to the government line."
"Also of concern is the repression of sectors which have been stigmatised by the regime, such as homosexuals and certain intellectuals."
"In the specific case we are dealing with, the regime’s refusal to allow the Women in White to leave the country to receive the Sakharov Prize is a further example of this worrying situation."
"Nevertheless, as has already been said, the policy of blockade and isolation to which Cuba has been subjected by several western powers for decades has only toughened the position of the hard-line sectors of the regime."
"I am therefore pleased that, in June 2005, the Council of the European Union decided to offer Cuba an opportunity for political dialogue once again."
"The intention here, amongst other things, was to begin to prepare the ground for what many of us hope will be an imminent transition to democracy."
"Those of us who have endured a dictatorship know how difficult it is to create a democracy, especially when those people who should be your allies on the outside turn their backs on you."
"In this regard, the appearance of more and more community, university and scientific groups, both in rural areas and in cities, within churches or in educational or social centres, groups that did not exist before and whose work may make a valuable contribution to political development in Cuba, is a hopeful sign."
"The time has come for the Cuban regime to accept that their future does not lie in maintaining the status quo, but in tackling in a serious and credible way the transition which the Cuban people themselves, above all, are calling for."
"We in the European Union must therefore make it very clear that our intention is simply to help Cuba to enter the modern world via the path of democracy, and we must therefore continue to demand the release of all of the people sentenced to many years in prison for their peaceful opposition to the regime."
"Mr President, I would like to express my opposition to the joint initiative which will be voted on tomorrow."
"This initiative is based - and the text exudes this from every pore - on a position which is exceptional, a position that the European Union has held for some time."
"It is the only country in the world in relation to which the European Union maintains a situation of exception; there are no other cases."
"I believe that this is unjust and that, furthermore, it has no effect whatsoever."
"It is clear that that position will be voted for tomorrow and will have absolutely no effect."
"I would call for an end to this situation of exception."
"The European Union must treat Cuba in the same way as any other country in the world."
"We must maintain a position that allows for an agenda for joint debate, which deals with all of the issues."
"We must, of course, demand firstly that the United Sates lift its blockade of the island of Cuba."
"Naturally, we need to debate the whole issue of the request for the extradition of the terrorist Posada Carriles and, of course, to include in the Ibero-American Summit everything related to what was debated at the Ibero-American Summit between the European Union and Cuba."
"Cuba certainly has many faults, but it is exemplary in terms of South/South cooperation."
"Cuban society is also exemplary with regard to all public services, given that it is a poor country."
"I believe that the European Union must not be governed by the dictates of the US State Department."
"It must not do that."
"I would therefore naturally call for an independent position that puts an end to the situation of exception between the European Union and Cuba."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"This Parliament has often – all too often – debated the lack of respect for human rights in Cuba."
"‘Words, words, words’, while we wait for positive signs from a dying regime that has no intention of changing course."
"In January 2005, the Council made some concessions, in the hope of encouraging a different attitude."
"All its expectations were promptly dashed: freedom of expression is still, unfortunately, just an illusion, as also demonstrated by the refusal to allow the Women in White to come here to receive the 2005 Sakharov prize."
"We can wait no longer."
"In this situation we, the European Union, have an obligation and a duty to do more, and to do it better and more quickly."
"I am a reformist socialist, and therefore I dream of a society based on the values of freedom, participation, democracy and social fairness."
"I am also the youngest Member in this House, and in my heart and mind I share the aspirations of Cubans of my age, who want to be able to look forward with optimism to a country that is at last more open, more modern and more just."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have addressed this House on a number of occasions to warn of the suffering in Cuba, in particular that of people who continue to fight peacefully for democracy and human rights."
"Unfortunately, the sad reality dictates that we must issue fresh condemnations and protests."
"During the last plenary session of last year, we saw the levels of intolerance to which Fidel Castro’s regime had sunk."
"A group of women whose only crime has been to ask for freedom for their husbands and sons, political detainees since the crackdown of March 2003, were prevented from coming to Parliament to receive the Sakharov Prize, along with our suitable tributes and messages of respect from the people of Europe."
"Regrettably, this decision and the attitude giving rise to it comes as no surprise."
"Oswaldo Payá, winner of the Sakharov Prize in 2002, has also repeatedly been banned from coming to Europe to tell us in his own voice what is actually happening in Cuba, and to discuss the situation with us."
"Parliament has therefore kept an open invitation for him to come here as soon as he is allowed to do so."
"We should now extend that invitation to the and campaign for them to be able to come and receive our warm tributes and words of solidarity in person."
"It might be possible to award the prize in Havana, but that should not satisfy us."
"That should be our minimum requirement, but we should always seek more. We must not accept any fleeting or underhand gestures, and nor must we bow to the whims of the dictatorship."
"Oswaldo Payá and the must be given a public forum in which to express the message of their peaceful campaign for freedom and justice. The people of Europe, and especially the young, must be made aware of their story and their exemplary fight for human rights."
"I hope that the outcome of this debate will be that nobody can be in any doubt when condemning a brutal dictatorship."
"Hopefully, the Council will finally acknowledge its mistake and stop deluding itself, which, as we have seen, only leads to tougher repression and greater injustice."
"We will continue to fight for Europe to act more firmly."
"Let nobody say that Parliament has wavered in its unequivocal condemnation of a dictatorial regime."
"This is my appeal, from democrats to democrats."
"I would like to thank my group, which is allowing me to speak despite knowing that I do not agree with their position."
"I am not going to vote for the resolution, which seems to me to be unbalanced, pointless and harmful to the European Union’s image in the developing world."
"Furthermore, the fact that there are just twenty Members in the Chamber demonstrates the degree of priority the Members of this Parliament attach to this debate."
"I preferred the socialist proposal, but then fundamental aspects such as the United States’ blockade and Guantánamo, the most scandalous violation of human rights taking place on the island, have been lost."
"The imbalance is all the greater given that the resolution does not acknowledge some of Cuba’s actions, in particular the work it has been doing in terms of cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean, Latin American, Africa and even Asia."
"Last week, when discussing disability and development, we highlighted the fact that, in 2005, 208 000 blind people from those countries had had operations in Cuba free of charge."
"That does not appear to be important here, but it is very important for the people whose sight has been restored and for their countries."
"The fact that there are more than 20 000 Cuban doctors and almost as many sports instructors and teachers working in this same field of Southern solidarity illustrates something that many people here deny or keep quiet, but their sectarian approach, which leads to resolutions like this one, damages the European Union’s image amongst the countries and peoples of the South who feel respect and gratitude towards Cuba."
"Finally, all this resolution will achieve will be to confirm the Cuban authorities’ conviction that the European Union is not an independent interlocutor, but simply an extension of the interests and strategies of the Bush administration, and it will not persuade it to do a single thing to move in the direction in which many of us would like to see things progress in their country; in other words, in this regard as well, this resolution is essentially pointless except for those people in this House whose aim is simply to discriminate against Cuba and carry on treating it as an exception and in a manner that is different to the way it treats other countries with similar regimes."
"The most regrettable thing is that, by taking this approach, Europe is becoming less and less relevant on a large part of the international stage."
"For all of these reasons, I would repeat that I am not going to vote for the resolution and I hope that my fellow Members will at least listen to my arguments, regardless of how they vote tomorrow."
"If they vote like me, all the better."
"Mr President, to some people, including in Europe, Cuba is paradise, while to others, it is hell."
"Measured against Europe’s current yardstick of a multi-party democracy and individual human rights, that country leaves a great deal to be desired."
"For nearly half a century, the same movement and the same leader have been in power."
"The Cubans are not free to travel abroad, not even to receive a prize that has been awarded to them."
"Oppositions are given little opportunity to organise themselves and if, despite everything, they succeed, they are not given the chance to measure their public following at election time."
"Like its big neighbour, the United States, Cuba still practises capital punishment, and that is something that can, and indeed should, be condemned."
"With all this criticism heaped on Cuba, I do not think that we are dealing with your everyday dictatorship."
"The country makes great claims for itself and has, for years, served as an example to the rest of Latin America in the areas of education, health care and other public services, as well as the protection of the most vulnerable sections of the population."
"In terms of democracy and human rights, it was certainly not worse off than the rest of Latin America used to be."
"It still serves as the source of inspiration for those voters – a majority – who favour modernisation in Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay."
"Europe has never followed North America’s tactic of isolating Cuba, and rightly so, for much of what is wrong in Cuba is being fostered by this very tactic."
"If we want Cuba to improve, we need to work at building an open relationship."
"Mr President, the fact that the human rights situation in that museum of Stalinism, the Communist dictatorship that is Cuba, has deteriorated still further, is of course a disgrace, but I should like to draw Parliament’s attention to our own European Commissioner, the Belgian European Commissioner Louis Michel, who is at least partly to blame for this."
"It was Louis Michel who, not so long ago, following a congenial four-day visit to Havana, advised the European Council, in strong terms, not to consider imposing any diplomatic sanctions."
"It was also Louis Michel who retorted to the human rights organisations that Fidel Castro’s regime should not be provoked."
"Whilst, for example, Human Rights Watch urged the European Union not to normalise its economic relations with Cuba at least until political prisoners had been released and democratic reforms implemented, Mr Michel stated that he was in favour of an unconditional extension of the Cotonou Agreement to include Cuba."
"The fact is, of course, that Louis Michel is on friendly terms with the Adolf Hitlers, the Stalins and the Maos of our time, for that is what Fidel Castro is like."
"The situation in Cuba is very serious."
"People there are increasingly being denied fundamental human rights, and the number of political prisoners is increasing."
"Europe could set a good example."
"As a Member of the European Parliament, who, together with my colleagues, Mrs Pleštinská and Mr Gaľa, has adopted a Cuban political prisoner, I am keen to see greater pressure exerted on Fidel Castro through international public opinion."
"I would like to believe that one of the first decisions made under the pressure of public opinion would be to release political prisoners who are mistreated and exposed to inhumane conditions in prisons."
"This is one of the reasons why I support the draft resolution concerning the European Union position vis-à-vis the Cuban Government, paragraph 9 of which refers to sanctions being re-imposed on Cuba by the European Union Council."
"I do not know why the sanctions were temporarily suspended on 31 January 2005, since paragraph 1 of the draft clearly states that Cuba has not achieved any significant improvement in human rights since 2003."
"Was it a reward for ignorance or were there other interests involved ?"
"I would like to believe that this time the Council will re-impose sanctions more effectively."
"To ensure this, cooperation is required."
"Ideally, this would mean working primarily with the UN and the US Government."
"I understand that reaching a consensus in the UN is almost impossible, but sanctions coordinated with the United States, and perhaps Canada, might bring about the necessary outcome."
"Mr President, the European Union and its institutions cannot, and will never be, indifferent to the destiny of millions living under conditions of repression and to the many people suffering horrific prison conditions."
"Mr President, it was in 2005 that Castro and Mr Roque themselves first raised the subject of post-Castro Cuba."
"Meanwhile, the Cuban people are sick and tired of fighting to keep their heads above water, and the lives of the small groups of Cubans who have the courage to become politically or socially active are made hell."
"Europe must speak with one voice in Havana against the serious human rights violations and in favour of a dialogue with the authorities on political and economic reforms to prevent the achievements in the areas of health care and education in the first years of the revolution from going to waste."
"That dialogue must also, however, put an end to the totalitarian regime and the blockade on economic reforms."
"Only in that way can Cubans, by means of their own initiatives, agriculture and small markets, regain a prospect of the better and violence-free times ahead that will not come from Miami."
"Europe must now give thought to offering post-Castro Cuba a social, economic and democratic perspective."
"Mr Solana, the Commission and the Council must enter into dialogue with it."
"We have to combine all our efforts and focus on human rights and a dialogue that offers plenty of new perspectives."
"It is up to Castro and Roque to show what they are made of and join in it."
"I was in Cuba in January, from where the ‘Damas de Blanco’ send their warmest greetings and are delighted with the prize we awarded them."
"Tyranny is most afraid of those who practice freedom' – the words of José Martín, a hero of the 19th century fight for Cuban independence, are still as relevant today as they were when he uttered them."
"We can also add that apart from its own opposition, a dictatorship is also afraid of those who practice freedom in other countries."
"Therefore we, the representatives of European democracies, must be aware of our especially great responsibility when discussing one of the last Communist regimes."
"As a personal thought, please allow me to add that as a young Hungarian politician, I am extremely aware of this responsibility, because my generation was brought up by our parents and grandparents against the background of a Socialist dictatorship similar to that in Cuba."
"We also owe it to them to stand up firmly for our principles."
"By now it has become clear that last year’s lifting of the coercive measures taken against Cuba failed to bring the desired results, and it only prompted the Cuban Government to step up oppression."
"Arrests have been on-going, and in 2005 approximately 30 members of the opposition were imprisoned, which means that by now the number of those detained for their political views in often inhuman circumstances has exceeded 300."
"Therefore, depictions of a comic-opera dictatorship led by a jovial parlour revolutionary are false."
"In the meantime, foreign observers are not allowed to travel to the country, a fact that I have recently experienced myself."
"Last year, like several other fellow MEPs, I was refused the entry visa to attend a meeting of the opposition."
"In case we have not known it so far, we can now learn the fact that a dictatorship – be it rightist or leftist – does not allow compromises."
"This is another reason why we cannot support the lifting of coercive measures."
"History is an unequivocal witness: the opposition movements of the former Socialist block could not have reached their goals without the stimulation of the Western European democracies."
"Today it falls on the reunited Europe to give strength to all those who are representing the values of democracy in the shadow of dictatorship."
"Mr President, there is a Polish saying that a rich man cannot understand a poor man."
"Nonetheless, those of us who know how it feels to be denied one’s freedom find it easier to understand what is happening in Cuba at the moment."
"Those opposed to adopting a hard line towards Cuba argue that there would be negative consequences for the ordinary people."
"I wonder if they have bothered to find out what the people of Cuba think?"
"Does Castro bother about what Cubans think?"
"In the 1980s the Polish Communists responded to US economic sanctions that were also supposed to have negative consequences for ordinary Poles by announcing, by way of retaliation, that they would send a thousand sleeping bags to the homeless of New York."
"What was the reaction of ordinary people in Poland?"
"Small adverts began to appear in the press, offering to exchange spacious flats in Warsaw for sleeping bags in New York."
"Many Cubans seem to be thinking along the same lines, and Havana is much closer to New York than Warsaw."
"If major revolutionaries like Fidel Castro are treated gently, they interpret it as a sign of weakness."
"Surely the time has come to demonstrate that Europe is not weak?"
"It is time to understand that Cuba cannot be dealt with like an untouchable totalitarian fortress."
"If Castro continues to refuse to allow the recipients of the Sakharov prize to travel to Cuba, then we should not travel to Cuba as if nothing had happened."
"In my view, we ought to persuade Europeans not to make Cuba a holiday destination, in other words, not to go there as tourists."
"Cuba is not an appropriate place for a holiday."
"Nobody goes on holiday to Auschwitz or to a gulag."
"It would be absurd."
"It is just as absurd to contribute to a tourist industry that is helping prop up a regime where violation of human rights is the order of the day."
"Two events dating back to December 2005 characterise the situation in Cuba: the Ladies in White were awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought."
"The Cuban authorities forbade them to leave the country and receive the prize in person."
"Freedom of thought is not rewarded in Cuba."
"This is strong proof that the prize had been given to the right people."
"The Sakharov Prize was awarded to the wives and mothers of Cuban political prisoners who were guilty only of free thought."
"The release of all political prisoners in Cuba remains the central demand of the Ladies in White movement."
"Nowadays, when many parts of the world are shaken by violence, war and terror, it is very encouraging to see a group of unarmed women being able to exert great moral pressure through non-violent means."
"Coming from a region that only a few years ago was ruled by a communist regime which also imprisoned people for thinking freely, I can confirm that support from democratic countries has immense significance."
"Therefore, I would urge democratic European institutions to use all peaceful means at their disposal to bring pressure to bear on the Castro regime and to force it to release people imprisoned only because of independent thinking."
"The policy of prevarications and concessions pursued vis-à-vis one of the least democratic regimes in the world only prolongs the suffering of the people there and the infringements of human rights."
"By supporting the democratic opposition in Cuba and applying constant pressure on the Castro regime, Europe can secure respect for democratic principles in this socialist country."
"If EU efforts to bring about democratic changes are to succeed and be effective, we need to formulate an unambiguous position on how to achieve these changes and how to establish democracy in Cuba."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this debate: I have listened attentively and taken on board a number of points for myself and for the Council."
"It seems to me that we are called upon to continue to defend actively the values that the European Union represents – respect for human rights, and the defence of the fundamental freedoms of expression and assembly."
"I have also noted the House’s desire that we should continue to provide active support to the peaceful opposition and that we should press for the release of prisoners."
"It is nevertheless a fact – and we must acknowledge this – that our options are limited if Cuba does not show at least a minimum level of goodwill."
"And, to be honest, the confrontation and embargo policy that has sometimes been proposed in the past has also not brought the desired results."
"We therefore think that we should continue with our policy of critical dialogue, involvement and encouraging reform."
"To end the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions(1) pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on national management statements – Member States' accountability for the implementation of the European Union's budget, by Szabolcs Fazakas, Terence Wynn and Jan Mulder, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control (O-0102/2005 – B6-0347/2005)."
". Mr President, the oral question includes six specific questions to which I hope the President-in-Office will respond."
"However, there is also an equally important seventh question: it is the old issue about national declarations."
"Will the Council actually sit down and discuss this issue with Parliament, so that we can seek a common objective?"
"That is the one aspect in this old debate that has been missing since we voted on the discharge in this Chamber."
"At the time, we made the recommendations which this oral question refers to."
"We asked the Member States to get their house in order, to give us an assurance that the control systems they were putting in place were adequate and sufficient and that when EU money was being spent, it was being spent correctly."
"The problem we have is that when the Court of Auditors reports every year and cannot give a positive statement of assurance, it is because of problems within the Member States."
"Unless we are going to have a Commission official monitoring just about every item of European expenditure in the Member States, we are never going to solve the problem."
"It is incumbent upon the Member States to help us ensure that European taxpayers’ money is being spent correctly."
"I have to thank Commissioner Kallas in particular for the way he has encouraged Parliament by persuading the Commission to take on board those recommendations and to produce the roadmap towards getting a positive statement of assurance."
"In that process, we had a two-day hearing organised by the Commission and the previous Presidency on how this could or could not be achieved."
"I attended that hearing on both days."
"I was saddened at the negativity of some Member States who just wanted to continue with the status quo."
"They claimed nothing was wrong and nothing needed to be changed."
"Two things were clear from that hearing: there might have been other minor problems, but there were two major problems."
"The first major problem was that the supreme audit institutions of the Member States feared that somehow or other this was a takeover by the European Court of Auditors."
"Hopefully that fear has been allayed."
"I attended the annual gathering of the supreme audit institutions along with the European Court of Auditors in Stockholm, and I am led to believe that there is an acceptance that it was not the intention."
"I am also led to believe that the supreme audit institutions are prepared to play their part in helping us to solve this problem."
"The other major problem that occurred from that two-day hearing, and probably the biggest one, was the fact that we had asked for a political signature from the Member States to actually give these national declarations."
"For some Member States, such as the Netherlands, that is not a problem."
"This task falls on the Minister, and no one else would argue that it should be anybody else."
"However, for a lot of Member States it was a major problem."
"On reflection, I have to say that if we had left out the words ‘political signature’ in our discharge report we may not have scared the Council as much as we did."
"We are now in a situation where we need to come to an agreement with the Council on how to get national declarations that can actually satisfy not only the European Court of Auditors, but the Commission and the Member States themselves, to ensure that we can show European taxpayers that their money is being spent correctly."
"I would hope that the President-in-Office gives us clear answers to the six questions listed within the oral question and that he does not give us the answers that Ecofin gave us on 8 November 2005."
"Quite frankly, that was not leading us forward."
"I should also like him to answer the seventh question, which I shall put orally: will the Council sit down with Parliament to discuss this matter in the hope that we can get a resolution to it?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this opportunity to explain the Council's opinion on this important issue, the statement of assurance (DAS) to be issued by the European Court of Auditors on the management of the Community budget. I would like to begin with the rather obvious comment that the management of the Community budget is very complicated, and is unique in the world."
"It covers many levels of government, from the various Commission services, via central, regional and local government in the Member States, to the individual final beneficiaries."
"It is in the interests of all those involved, including the budgetary and discharge authorities, to contribute to the proper management of budgetary funds."
"As you have in this House, so likewise we in the Council have repeatedly expressed our disappointment at the situation, particularly in connection with the discharge procedure."
"Following detailed discussions in the Council and in the Council bodies, the Council adopted conclusions on the Commission communication on the roadmap on 8 November, and I can assure you that it was not easy."
"This document summarises the discussions held by a group of experts from all the Member States, representing the ministries of finance, the operating authorities and the audit authorities, in a two-day hearing held jointly with the Commission."
"This preparatory work formed a good basis for the detailed discussions in the Council bodies, and proved to be useful in that we reached agreement on the aforementioned Council conclusions."
"I assume you have already had an opportunity to read this document, so I need only mention the most important points here."
"I would like to leave the aspect of the declarations to be made by the individual Member States to the end of my comments."
"I know that this issue is particularly important to you, but I would ask you to be patient."
"The Council emphasises in its conclusions that numerous efforts have already been made to improve sound financial management: the introduction of internal audits, stricter requirements regarding the accountability of the Commission's accounting officer and implementation of the integrated administration and control system, to name just a few."
"In view of the importance of the Structural Funds in the European Union's budget, I would like to draw your attention to the efforts that have been made to set up paying authorities and to further extend the internal and controls of the structural measures."
"One of the first points mentioned in the Council's conclusions is the balanced relationship between the competences of the Commission and the Member States in implementing the European Union's budget in accordance with the Treaty, which must be taken into account when it comes to improving the relevant controls and assurances."
"Furthermore, the Council considers it to be extremely important that these improvements should build on the existing control structures and that we should aim to improve the cost/benefit ratio and to simplify the systems."
"The Council believes that an effective integrated internal control framework based on the principles set out in the Court of Auditors' opinion on the single audit will provide assurances regarding the management of the risk of error in the underlying transactions."
"One of the most important points in the Council's conclusions relates to improving the control systems."
"The Member States and the Commission need to optimise the effectiveness, economy and efficiency of current control systems."
"Despite the differences in administrative arrangements between the various Member States, the Council advocates that general common principles and elements regarding internal controls should be drawn up."
"In the Council's opinion, the Member States should continue to work with the Commission to implement and improve controls in relation to funds for which they have joint responsibility for managing."
"This should take account of the competences pursuant to the Treaty, the Financial Regulation and the relevant provisions of the sectoral regulations."
"For example, some Member States are prepared to take precautions within the framework of the Confidence Pact, as provided for in connection with the Structural Funds programmes."
"As the Member States are in agreement in the Council, I am speaking for all the Member States, not just for the Council itself."
"As you know, the Commission's services have published an initial analysis of the deficiencies of their internal control framework in comparison with the control principles set out in the Court of Auditors' proposal for a Community internal control framework."
"In connection with the shared management, the Council has requested the Commission to assess the implementation of the current regulations concerning sample checks on operations, paying authorities and winding up bodies' activities."
"The Council conclusions propose that the Commission, working with the Member States, should provide an assessment of the present controls at sector and regional level and the value of existing statements and declarations."
"I will now turn to the subject of the audit."
"In setting up the internal control framework we must make a distinction between internal controls and the external audit."
"Any form of cooperation between independent supreme audit institutions can only be based on the Treaty, as these authorities are not part of the internal control framework."
"This is an important point."
"Some audit authorities are willing to discuss with the Court of Auditors how they might strengthen their contribution."
"I can assure you that all the Member States have expressed a willingness to do everything they can to reduce the risk of error and to improve controls."
"The Commission and the Member States should ensure that their approach to the integrated internal control framework is based on common control standards, and to confer with one another on how these standards can most effectively be implemented."
"To that end, the Council encourages the Member States to hold bilateral discussions with the Court of Auditors on the results of their DAS audits, in order to solve systemic problems."
"It requests the Commission to provide it with a report on solutions for problems common to several Member States."
"Finally – and this is particularly important – the Court of Auditors has proposed that the European Parliament and the Council should come to a common understanding regarding the risks to be tolerated in the underlying transactions."
"The Council's conclusions place considerable importance on this common understanding, and the Council eagerly awaits further progress in this regard."
"I now come to a subject that is very important to all of us: simplification."
"There is a need for simplification regarding harmonisation of the control principles, of legislation and of the control requirements in connection with the regulations to be adopted for the programming period 2007-2013."
"In the Council's opinion, simplification must under no circumstances lead to an increase in the current administration and control costs."
"What is more, it should ensure elimination of multiple internal controls by the various parties involved in the control framework."
"Finally, I would like to talk about the extremely important subject of the declarations associated with the decentralised management of EU funds."
"The Council sees the existing declarations at operational level as a means of providing the Commission, and ultimately the Court of Auditors, with assurances."
"They must be useful and cost-efficient and can be taken into account when it comes to achieving a positive statement of assurance."
"It must be ensured that the existing balance between the Commission and the Member States is not threatened."
"I am aware that you expected more in this connection, but I am sure you will agree with me that the text itself can be regarded as a significant and important step forward."
"In order to make further progress in this matter, the Council has agreed, on the occasion of the 2004 discharge process, to examine the Commission's Action Plan to fill the gaps in the present control framework."
"The Council conclusions of 8 November will, of course, be followed by further steps in 2006."
"A positive statement of assurance is, as has already been said, an important and very ambitious goal, which cannot be achieved overnight."
"I think, however, that the Council conclusions are an important step towards reaching this goal."
"They also confirm that the Council continues to support the Commission in its efforts to make an active contribution to financial management at all levels."
"Some of you perhaps take the view that the Council should have gone a step further, and I can well understand that."
"You should bear in mind, though, that on this topic the Presidency was restricted by the need for unanimity."
"Thank you for your attention!"
". Mr President, already during the entire period of the work of this Commission we have a common concern to get a positive DAS."
"It has not been possible."
"This is a very technical issue with a very bad political outcome, which seems to give good reason to whoever wants to say that money in European Union has been spent improperly."
"Of course, this is completely untrue."
"We have worked together to find solutions and ways of joining all our efforts to provide enough evidence for the Court of Auditors to give an assurance that the transactions are reliable."
"We do not deny that Member States are doing a lot of work to secure the proper control systems."
"I have just come from one Member State where I met the national audit authority, and huge work has been done to secure the proper use of national and European money where there is shared management."
"The Commission does not deny its responsibility for implementing the budget, including in shared management."
"But we have a missing link: how to make all the results of the control and audit work readable finally for the highest level, for the Court of Auditors."
"So, the Commission strongly supported the proposal to the Council made by the rapporteur Mr Wynn and the Committee on Budgetary Control to have a political declaration, a signature on the national level, which, in our view, could cover this missing link."
"This proposal was rejected last November and now we have to think about what to do next, because the problem will continue to exist."
"The Commission adopted an action plan on 17 January and has sent it to the Council and Parliament."
"The action plan designates 16 concrete actions at all levels and in all sectors."
"Action 5 specifically addresses the topic for this evening’s debate and reads: ‘Member States should designate a national coordinating body per policy area which can (…) provide all stakeholders with an overview of the assurance available in respect of Community actions under shared and indirect management in their Member State."
"The cooperation of Member States is necessary when ensuring such a provision in forthcoming legislation, and steering its implementation via implementing rules and guidance’."
"Maybe this can be a solution or a least an intermediary solution that can link together the technical levels, the paying agencies and the audits and provide good evidence for overall discharge."
"Mr President, we expected more from you in fact, Mr Winkler."
"We expected more from the Austrian Presidency in this regard."
"This is not the first time that this Parliament has seen the Council fall short with regard to what we ask."
"Now we Europeans have a serious problem: in the financial perspective, this Parliament wanted us to spend 1.14%, but the President-in-Office, Mr Blair, lowered this to 1.04%."
"From this it would appear that Community policies, which are so effective and which have done so much to move Europe forward, are being badly managed by the European Union and that, therefore, the best thing we can do is reduce the budget, because things are not being handled properly."
"In that case, what we should do is see to it that there are no European policies, but national policies: let us renationalise the common agricultural policy, let us spend in the Member States."
"Behind this lies the fact that for 10 years the Court of Auditors has said that it cannot approve the European accounts."
"But what European accounts, if 80% of the Community budget is managed and spent in the Member States; if just a fifth is managed in Brussels."
"What is happening?"
"Some national authorities, which want to pay less and want Community policies to have less fuel, now that we are in a Europe of 25 and are about to be a Europe of 27, are telling us, ‘you are spending badly’."
"What is the Committee on Budgetary Control asking for?"
"We are asking to be told where money is spent badly; if a Member State is spending badly, we want it to be said that that State is spending badly, that it is not Brussels."
"We want to be told whether the problems have arisen here in Brussels or there in the Member State."
"And to this end, it would be helpful for us if the Member States confirmed the way in which Community money is spent."
"I believe that Community money is spent better and more effectively in Brussels than in the average Member State."
"Nevertheless, as a result of the system we have, Brussels is blamed for bad management, rather than the Member States."
"I know that the Council has to defend the good name of the Member States."
"We would ask for co-responsibility, an approval, by whichever authority, whether it be the Finance Minister or the appropriate Court, which confirms that the accounts are managed in each Member State in the way that the European citizens want, so that Vice-President Kallas or Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control are not always to blame; that the blame be shared out and the parties responsible exposed."
"I would therefore ask you to confirm how each Member State spends the European citizens’ money."
". As President of the Committee on Budgetary Control and one of the representatives of the new Member States, I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunity of discussing the issue of national declarations with members of the Commission and Council."
"I very much hope that as a result of this debate, we will not only receive a previously prepared statement from Mr Winkler, State Secretary, but also concrete answers to the questions submitted by Terence Wynn and ourselves."
"We very much hope that we will have the answers, as the European Parliament is politically responsible to assure the citizens of the European Union of the lawful and proper utilisation of European Union funds."
"In view of the fact that the European Court of Auditors is unable to issue a positive declaration of assurance (DAS) in the absence of national assurance declarations, a negative public opinion is beginning to emerge, namely that European Funds are used in a non-transparent manner, not always in compliance with the regulations."
"This is why the report prepared by my colleague Terence Wynn, supported by the great majority of this Parliament and also confirmed by the Böge report on the financial perspective of the European Union, pressed for the introduction of the national assurance declaration in the course of the exemption procedure last year."
"Additionally, we are delighted that this has also been included in the roadmap to an integrated internal control framework, announced by the European Commission, namely by Vice-President Siim Kallas."
"This reform, involving Parliament, the Commission and the European Court of Auditors, is based on mutual trust and close cooperation, but in addition to this, we also need the support of the Council and the Presidency, because some Member States are still resisting the introduction of the national assurance declarations."
"As a representative of Hungary, I would also like to call attention to the fact that new Member States have not only prepared themselves for the acceptance of the and the reception of structural funds, but were also aware that they had to set up their payment and control systems according to the principles of legitimacy, lawfulness and compliance with regulations."
"Therefore it would not cause them any difficulty to comply with the expectations of the European Parliament and Commission, because by doing so they would serve a Europe that works more efficiently, as well as in a more regulated and transparent manner."
". Mr President, the resolution we are discussing this evening is self-explanatory."
"It is a direct result of Mr Wynn’s discharge resolution of 2003."
"It is important that we should gain better control over EU funds."
"We all know that the Court of Auditors has failed to issue a positive statement of assurance during the last 11 years."
"It is to the Commission’s credit that it has adopted Parliament’s recommendations almost in their entirety."
"That is to be welcomed."
"The Member States, unfortunately, take a different view, and a much dimmer one, and that is why this evening is mainly intended as a debate with the Council."
"I have to say that I am not entirely won over by Mr Winkler’s responses and observations this evening."
"In actual fact, what we demand in this resolution is not that different from what is already happening in some cases."
"We would like to refer back to the previous statement in which we ask the highest political authority to sign that statement."
"In that resolution, we go no further than statements at a lower level."
"If we study current practice in agricultural spending, certification bodies are already in place that monitor payment bodies independently and that carry out independent checks."
"It is beyond me why Member States can accept this in the area of agricultural spending, but not in the other areas of budgetary spending, such as structural spending."
"This evening’s discussion does come with some strings attached."
"I assume that the Council is familiar with the Böge resolution on the financial perspectives."
"Not only are we asking for more funds following the Council’s decisions, we are also asking for better financial supervision, which is the very purpose of the resolution that we will – it is to be hoped – be adopting tomorrow."
". Mr President, this is indeed, first and foremost, a debate with the Council."
"I have to say that I found the Minister’s performance a disappointing one; he has not really answered our question, and that at a time when confidence in the European Union is at an all time low."
"Tomorrow, Commissioner Wallström will be presenting a White Paper on communication as a means of boosting confidence in the EU, but, in my view, a thousand white papers, or a thousand measures, will make no difference if the European Union fails to spend its funds wisely."
"That is why I ask you, once again, why you are organising organised irresponsibility here."
"Why are you, the Council, getting Member States to spend 80% of the European funds instead of ensuring that the individual Member States and regions, where they are responsible for doing so, can say that the funds they are spending are being monitored properly and funds are being spent wisely?"
"I cannot fathom why the Council cannot do as Parliament requires in this respect."
"I think that you are creating an enormous difficulty for this House."
". National management declarations!"
"Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Kallas, will these be like the EU’s own accounts, in which the directors-general of the Commission sign off their respective departments with reservations, because they have not got a clue where the money has gone?"
"Because if it is so, it strikes me as a little like trying to repair a severed artery with a band aid: too little too late."
"As everybody knows, I do not believe in the European Union; I regard it as an enemy of democracy, and I approach this from an opposite direction."
"No nation should be pouring taxpayers’ money into a corrupt system."
"After 11 long years in which the EU’s accounts have been rejected by its own auditors, this weak-kneed attempt to change the system seems to me like pouring huge amounts of gold dust through a sieve, thinking ‘oh, perhaps we better try and stuff up a few of the holes’."
"No one thinks about the wisdom of pouring the dust through the sieve in the first place and quite simply the way to stop the dust being lost is to stop pouring."
"Therefore I call on the Members here present to go back to their various countries and make urgent representations to their own governments to pull the plug."
"Simply stop paying this monstrous bureaucratic dictatorship, which has no respect for either the governments or the people of Europe."
"We have a saying in my country: ‘charity begins at home’."
"Save the money you are currently wasting on the EU, a large part of which is lost simply by fraud and corruption anyway."
"Mr Titford, I would call you to order."
"On two occasions you have accused the European institutions of crimes."
"You have said ‘fraud’ and ‘corruption’ twice."
"I would ask that, in the future, you bear in mind that, in this House, accusations against persons or institutions of crimes must be backed up by evidence."
"Otherwise, you are abusing a Member of Parliament’s freedom to speak."
"Mr President, when this House discusses financial matters, it is not very often that I am much less forthright than those who have spoken before me."
"Although this national responsibility is something I dare not even dream of, I have not forgotten, Mr Winkler, what your Chancellor – and mine – said, standing in this Chamber where you are now, regarding the issue of subsidies using EU funds."
"Chancellor Schüssel's words, in his capacity as President of the Council, were: 'It is only right that such information should be published so that people know who has actually benefited'."
"I will repeat that: 'It is only right that such information should be published'."
"So publish it!"
"In some Member States, where they are much more critical about many things, such as the United Kingdom, for example, that goes without saying."
"Let Austria be a shining example to follow, and finally tell us what happens with the 80%!"
"Who gets what, how much and when?"
"My second request, which you might find rather easier: side with your own political group, namely with Mrs Gräßle."
"She is introducing reforms in the new Financial Regulation with which we will really be able to work, and with which you will very easily be able to ward off unjustified criticism – provided, that is, that you become more transparent."
"– I feel that this has been a most worthwhile debate in the context of the EU’s budgetary control procedures."
"The key issue at stake here is legislative clarification."
"I feel that, with both the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy, the regulations make it clear that Member States must carry out an independent audit, both and ."
"These regulations have remained unchanged since the beginning of the current financial programming framework."
"In this context, the main priority, in my view, is to ensure that the Member States comply with the regulations and that the Commission monitors that compliance."
"Anything else will only lead to a lack of clarity as regards responsibilities."
"I should therefore like to call on both institutions to clarify the level of compliance with Community regulations as regards these and audits, so that we can be properly informed when we take action."
"I should lastly like to say a few words about information on who has received Community funds."
"I made this request in a report that I drew up a number of years ago and am pleased that Mr Kallas has followed this initiative."
"I hope that, when you criticise politicians for a lack of transparency, you will recall that Parliament requested such transparency a number of years ago in a report that I drew up."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have paid close attention to your comments and will, of course, pass on to the Council the opinions you have expressed."
"However, I would like to repeat one thing: I am here to represent the Council and the Member States; in other words, the opinions expressed by the Presidency of the Council here are those expressed in a unanimous vote in the Council."
"I am sorry if I have disappointed some of you, but there is nothing more I can say at this stage."
"I can, however, reiterate – and I hope you will be so kind as to accept this – that we have agreed to examine, in connection with the 2004 discharge process, the action plan drafted by the Commission."
"I can also confirm that the Council will continue to support the Commission in its efforts to make an active contribution to financial management at all levels."
"It is a matter of certainty that the Council will take on its share of responsibility, which it has no intention of abdicating."
"We will continue to work with the Commission to find solutions that everybody, including all of you in this House, can accept."
"I am afraid that, at this relatively early stage of the Austrian Presidency, I cannot say any more."
". Mr President, thank you very much for this debate."
"This question seems very technical."
"It is very difficult to explain to the larger public what is actually behind this declaration of assurance."
"However, we must work to find solutions which do not bring the very negative political outcome of having to say that the money is not under control."
"I hope, therefore, that the Council and Member States will consider this new basis for merging their work."
"This is already done at the level of paying agencies and other implementing authorities."
"Let us try to provide a single integrated assurance, which also offers positive evidence to the Court of Auditors."
"Let us try to find solutions."
"As I mentioned earlier, the Commission is fully aware of the areas in the Commission itself in which the Court of Auditors has found a lot of mistakes in internal policies and in research and development."
"The action plan includes 16 actions, only one of which is directly aimed at the Member States."
"However, I hope that this cooperation will bear fruit."
"I would like to make a factual remark concerning the statement that the Court of Auditors has rejected our accounts."
"This is not true."
"During my term of office, the Court of Auditors has never rejected our accounts."
"It cannot always assure the legality and regularity of underlying transactions, as provided in the Treaty."
"This means that it cannot claim that millions of transactions are properly checked."
"This is true."
"It is also very important when we meet journalists to describe the complexity of the picture."
"This is a huge exercise."
"The budget discharge includes millions of details."
"A better understanding of the picture will certainly help."
"Mr President, I should like to make a point of order under Rule 145."
"I am afraid that there seems to be a misunderstanding of exactly what we are here for."
"I thought we were talking about the management directions and the reason we were asking for these directions to come in was because money was going missing."
"As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, my role has always been to look into where the money has been lost or misused and where mistakes have been made – the phrase that Mr Kallas has just used."
"I was working entirely on the assumption that the reason we were calling for these declarations was that the Member States would look into where the waste and fraud had come and, maybe, even corruption."
"It was under those terms that I was asking to express my opinions in my speech."
"Mr President, on a point of order under Rule 108, this was an oral question with six questions;"
"I added a seventh question verbally this evening, and we have not had an answer to a single one of them."
"Could the Presidency at least give us those answers in writing, please?"
"Yes, Mr Wynn, you will have the answers in writing."
"Mr Titford I have full respect for any political opinion in this Chamber."
"That is why I did not interrupt you and let you finish your speech."
"My remark was just to remind you that the language we use in the Chamber should express our opinions and our political positions."
"It was just a friendly remark from me as I chair this sitting that we should try to use language and words that are not unduly offensive or disrespectful."
"Apart from that, you have full freedom of expression here, Mr Titford."
"To end the debate, I have received one motion for a resolution(1) pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on management measures for Mediterranean fishery resources, by Philippe Morillon, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries (O-0095/2005 – B6-0346/2005)."
". Mr President, Mr Winkler, the oral question to which we owe this evening’s debate, together with the proposals that will be submitted to our Parliament for tomorrow’s vote, are based on the observation that the only management measures to have applied to Mediterranean fisheries up to now date back to 1994."
"However, these measures are no longer suited to the resource situation or to the decisions taken on other EU shores. These decisions are aimed at implementing a common fisheries policy allowing the sustainable development of this sector of our economy and the preservation of the resources that the Union must, in order to provide enough food for its fellow citizens in the long-term, carry on being able to utilise by exploiting its own seas."
"Such a time-lag is due, first of all, to the fact that the Mediterranean is recognised as being one of the most diversified and most complex regions, as much from a biological point of view as from ecological, social and economic ones."
"That is why our Parliament had been unable to reach an agreement during the previous legislature and why Mr Lisi’s report had resulted in an admission of failure."
"That is also why this subject was put back on the working agenda of this new legislature as a priority and why it gave rise to a very delicate compromise at the conclusion of the work of our rapporteur, Mrs Carmen Fraga, to whose personal commitment I have a duty to pay tribute in this Chamber."
"This report was adopted – firstly in committee, and then in plenary – back in June."
"Its recommended measures have not, to date, been the subject of any implementing decision by the Council."
"We are aware of some of the reasons for this wait-and-see policy, but I personally had informed my colleagues about the measures in an attempt to push through a number of amendments aimed at preventing the ban on the use of certain types of nets traditionally used by fishermen in the region."
"This matter affected, and continues to affect, 75 boats that ensure the livelihood of 350 families and that generate 80% of the fishermen’s turnover when they use anchored nets, known as The disadvantage of this type of fishing was that dolphins were being accidentally caught."
"That was until the profession finalised a programme permitting an 80% reduction in these accidental catches through the implementation of sound repellents and the systematic presence of observers on board the boats."
"If I am bringing this subject up again, it is because the socio-economic repercussions of the recommended measures certainly deserve more in-depth consideration."
"That is why I support, and why my group will support, the proposal for a resolution tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Article 4 of which demands that the fishermen affected by the new regulation and forced to change their fishing methods be properly compensated."
"During yesterday’s meeting of our committee, the European Commissioner responsible for Fisheries, Dr Joe Borg, was able to gauge just how incensed our Spanish friends had become at the prospect of a ban on the gillnets used for fishing in certain zones close to the Spanish coast. This ban would create an uncertain future for the fleet of 80 boats, which ensure the livelihood of 1 500 people."
"We have here a case altogether similar to that of the small-scale fisheries on the French coasts of the Mediterranean."
"That being said, Mr President, and while I can understand that certain decisions proposed by the Fraga report deserve to be discussed further and perhaps supplemented by an impact study, that would not justify indefinitely suspending the application of the entire content of a report that, as everyone agrees, is in itself a good compromise."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Morillon, you want to know whether the European Community is honouring the obligations it has taken on in international bodies, given that the Council has not yet adopted the proposal for a Council Regulation on management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea."
"In February 2005, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, to which the Community belongs as a contracting party, adopted binding recommendations to improve conservation and management measures for the Mediterranean."
"These recommendations were incorporated in the Presidency's compromise proposal which was put to the 'Agriculture and Fisheries' Council at its meeting on 19 and 20 September last year."
"However, the Presidency realised at that time that, as it was clear during the discussions that there was insufficient support, it was impossible for the Council to reach political agreement on the proposal for a regulation containing technical management measures for the Mediterranean, including the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean's recommendations."
"The Council is continuing its discussions on the proposal regarding management measures for the Mediterranean in close consultation with the Commission, and the Presidency intends to put the subject on the agenda for the Council meeting in April."
"Mr President, as rapporteur for the Committee on Fisheries, I am perfectly aware of the difficulties relating to this proposal."
"Parliament has played an effective and fundamental role in unblocking it following its presentation just over two and a half years ago, even finding a procedure which has made it possible to reach a compromise between the Commission and Parliament to overcome the difficulties of the proposal and which, furthermore, has had the support of the majority of the sector and of the national administrations."
"When there is so much consensus, it is incomprehensible that the Council, since April of last year, has been delaying the approval of what is probably currently the package of technical measures that most urgently needs to be adopted."
"This irresponsibility has many consequences: the Mediterranean is the only Community area which is still far from meeting the minimum requirements of responsible fishing and sustainable development, while in other Community waters much more drastic action is being taken in that regard."
"It is shameful that the huge majority of the Mediterranean fishermen themselves have understood better than the Council the urgent need to regulate these fishing grounds, despite the price that they will have to pay."
"The Council’s credibility is therefore being called very much into question."
"We also run the risk of failing to comply with our international obligations within the two regional fisheries organisations operating in the Mediterranean."
"Mr President, how can we have the nerve to propose more restrictive management measures to third countries again, when we ourselves are not capable of implementing them in our own territory?"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as well as telling us about the timetable in response to the question you have not yet answered, I would therefore ask you to explain to this Parliament why, when there is no blocking minority, the Council is incapable of taking a decision in this regard."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the majority of the Mediterranean's fisheries resources have been considered to be over-exploited for a long time, and there are certain stocks that have a high commercial value; in particular, I am thinking of the bluefin tuna, which is below the minimum level, according to all of the experts, including ecological organisations and the fishermen themselves."
"Although the objectives of the common fisheries policy are the same in the Mediterranean as in other Community waters, it appears that the conservation policy in the Mediterranean Sea has developed in a very different way, and today we are faced with a situation in which the only management measures applicable to this sea can only be described as completely obsolete."
"This lack of regulation suffered by the Mediterranean Sea has led to very clear discrimination between the European fishermen fishing in the Mediterranean and European fishermen fishing in other Community waters."
"I believe, Mr President, and I do not believe I am far wrong, that it is our duty to ensure that the fisheries legislation in the Mediterranean evolves to the point where it is equal to that in other Community regions."
"And in this regard, we are clearly very concerned about the Council’s passive attitude, because this lack of interest in this sea strikes me as completely inexplicable."
"We are talking about a sea and a region of immense importance, with very great complexities, it is true ― including geopolitical complexities ― but I believe that the Council should see this more as an incentive than an obstacle."
"And it is all the more inexplicable in view of what Mrs Fraga has just said: that this report was approved thanks to that close cooperation ― as approved by this Parliament ― that was established between the Committee on Fisheries and the Fisheries Directorate-General."
"For all of these reasons, I would ask you to provide the final impetus and to see what has been achieved as very important; and not to take any backward steps or allow any shortcuts that dilute the content of this report."
". Mr President, I, for my part – and you will see that there really is consensus on this matter – should like to stress the urgent need to break the deadlock in this situation, as the state of the resource in the Mediterranean is truly alarming."
"This is particularly the case with regard to bluefin tuna, but also with regard to other species, as my fellow Member pointed out."
"The wait-and-see policy, the standstills and the prevarications are therefore truly disastrous for the future of the Mediterranean."
"Moreover, we want to preserve small-scale fishing, which is so very important in the regions concerned, where it provides a livelihood for thousands of people, as has been said."
"Yet, it is not by exempting small-scale fishing from a number of sensible measures that we will succeed in doing this, but much rather by helping it first and foremost to adapt and by supporting it so that it can continue its activities in compliance with the regulations, which need to be those mentioned in the report."
"I therefore believe that we must preserve the Mediterranean: this is a crucial issue in terms of the future of fishing and it is also a major issue in terms of culture."
"The Council has to be fully aware of this and to be intent on breaking the deadlock in this situation as soon as possible."
"– Mr President, the Mediterranean represents a very important part of the European Union."
"Mediterranean fisheries represent an important sector of Community fisheries."
"We want a Mediterranean that is alive, not a dead sea."
"For many of us, this sea is our life."
"We want fish stocks to be maintained."
"We do not want overfishing. We want sustainability in this sea."
"The European Parliament and the Commission have approved a plan of management measures for fisheries in the Mediterranean."
"We are urgently calling for the application and implementation of the measures decided."
"I would not want to get carried away but it would not be an exaggeration to say that any delay in this matter would be criminal."
"We are calling for the measures to be extended in future; in other words, for us to put pressure on the third countries of the Mediterranean as well to apply the measures which we are applying."
"This is our duty, in order for us to protect the Mediterranean, which is our life."
"However, above and before everything, today, not tomorrow, we are asking the Council to start applying the measures agreed."
"– Mr President, one year after the approval of the report on the Council proposal for viable fisheries in the Mediterranean, it is obvious that there has never been a Council decision to apply it."
"We were also told to our great surprise in the Committee on Fisheries that the budget for the Fisheries Fund has already been reduced by 20%."
"It is therefore a natural consequence that fisheries issues remain and citizens working in this sector on a professional or amateur basis are anxious, while the situation is becoming more complicated and, to my mind, worse."
"At the same time, the Mediterranean basin is constantly being inhabited by new populaces, resulting in constant aggravation due to industrial, urban and other waste, with a direct and serious adverse impact on fisheries."
"The relevant proposals for regulations and draft reports obviously also need to include studies by the scientific community on the effect of environment pollution, geological changes, population differences and fish consumption requirements before they are applied."
"It is out of the question for the policy decided not to be applied and, at the same time, for issues to remain outstanding in the fisheries sector, relating mainly to fishing methods, reductions in stocks and the continuing gap between professional and amateur fishermen."
"We therefore need to proceed with the political means at our disposal for the promotion of the report by the Council and to start the dialogue with the agencies involved for the improvement of the existing regulation right now."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the resolution on the adoption of management measures for Mediterranean fishery resources, which we shall put to the vote in this Chamber tomorrow, is of great economic, social and environmental importance."
"As has been mentioned, the current regulation dates back to 1994 and was already considered obsolete even then."
"How dare we carry on blaming fishermen for apparently jeopardising the environmental sustainability of the fishing industry if the rules, Mr President, are anachronistic and inadequate in the current context, and if no progress has been made on what the European Parliament voted for a year ago?"
"The fishing industry does not want discrimination."
"Instead, it wants to feel that the European Union is on its side and is aware of its unique features."
"Let us think of the great difference in the form and depth of the seabed off the Adriatic and the Atlantic coasts, the issue of multispecies fishing, and the long-standing problem of fish sizes, when rules on mesh and net sizes are already being obeyed."
"Lastly, but just as importantly, let us remember that different rules are in force for countries that have Mediterranean coastlines but do not belong to the European Union and that, in the absence of balanced bilateral agreements, they result in double standards in the same fishing grounds."
"We should have put an end to these obvious discrepancies a long time ago."
"We therefore hope that this resolution will lead the Council – whom we respect and trust – to send out the long-awaited signal as soon as possible."
"– Thank you, Mr President."
"I am sure that all those who work closely with the fishing sector, and particularly those involved with the Mediterranean Sea, are very much aware of how complex this region is."
"It is a region of highly visible biological and environmental diversity, which has a huge socio-economic impact on the inhabitants of the region."
"Sadly, the Council of Ministers has made no proper commitment to identifying that diversity and taking whatever action is necessary."
"This is a disturbing state of affairs for those of us presenting this resolution because we know that this lack of initiative by the Council has placed us in a position far removed from our goal of sustainable development."
"This is a dead end from which we can only extricate ourselves by adopting more responsible rules in greater accordance with the common fisheries policy, so making our aims that much more attainable."
"It must be remembered that the only existing rules for managing fisheries have been in force for more than ten years, and even those measures are not so good."
"It is very important for us to bear in mind that we are in danger of failing to fulfil our international obligations where fisheries management is concerned, especially with regard to regional fisheries organisations and, in particular, the International Commission for the Conservation of Tuna in the Atlantic and the General Fisheries Commission of the Mediterranean."
"I thus urge the Council to take all the necessary measures without delay so that an ideal balance is achieved in the Mediterranean and so that fishermen’s livelihoods are guaranteed."
"We can then turn our attention to other projects in the Mediterranean - a region that, I repeat, has unfortunately been neglected for a very long time."
"Thank you very much."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I really just wanted to end by saying that the Council is well aware of how important this issue is."
"It is also not true that the Council is inactive or even uninterested in the situation of fish stocks and fisheries in the Mediterranean."
"For reasons on which the Presidency will not comment, it has not yet reached agreement."
"The Austrian Presidency has now taken over this matter and will work actively towards a solution."
"As I said, the intention is to deal with this issue in the Council in April this year."
"To end this debate, I have received three motions for resolutions(1) pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"– Mr President, during the debate on the sustainable exploitation of Mediterranean fishery resources, I said that the compromise reached by Parliament and the Commission may not have filled us with too much enthusiasm, but that it was undoubtedly an improvement over the initial proposal."
"This is not the right moment to bring up the pros and cons of the compromise; let us just say that I regard it – at least, that is my hope – as a step on the way to the rational management of Mediterranean fishery resources, combined with essential support to improve the precarious level of employment in the fishing industry, which involves thousands of families spread around the shores of ."
"The die is cast."
"We cannot turn back."
"I therefore hope that the Council, in making its decisions, does not seek inspiration in the young Saint Augustine’s prayers to the Almighty, as recalled in his ‘Confessions’: ‘Lord, give me chastity, but not yet!’"
"We can certainly wait a few more months for the regulation to be adopted, but please do not take too long: our fishermen are full of expectation."
"We resume our sitting with one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, I would like to bring to the attention of the House a report this week that three of the world’s largest oil companies no longer directly own petrol filling stations in Northern Ireland."
"They left, it seems, as a result of ongoing problems of cross border fuel smuggling and laundering."
"Last year, this Parliament roundly condemned Sinn Féin – the IRA – for its continuing criminal activities."
"Clearly the tens of millions of pounds sterling it is estimated are being taken annually from its illegal trade in laundered fuel is enough to ensure that the political representatives remain indifferent to such criticism."
"The eighth report of the Independent Monitoring Commission published today states that IRA members are still heavily involved in fuel smuggling, and that the level of smuggling has remained more or less constant."
"So much for Sinn Féin’s pretence to be a normal political party."
"It is appalling to think that in 2006, in a European Union which prides itself on its commitment both to freedom of trade and freedom of movement, a Member State can be plagued by an organisation so vicious that even the world’s biggest oil companies cannot survive its menace."
"I trust this Parliament will continue to condemn those who fail to share our commitment to fundamental freedoms."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a Social Democrat from new EU Member State Estonia, I continue to be concerned about the spread and entrenchment of double standards within the European Union."
"Last Monday a directive concerning ‘citizens of third countries’ entered into force."
"This created an absurd situation in which the citizens of the new Member States are not even second-class citizens in the labour market."
"Circumstances have conspired to make possible a situation in which the European Union’s labour market is open to the citizens of certain third countries, but is not open to the citizens of other third countries that meet the same requirements."
"But who are we defending from whom in this European Union of 25 members?"
"I have already demanded an explanation from the Minister of Economics and Labour Martin Bartenstein as to when we may expect to see results from Austria’s work as holder of the presidency of the European Union, as regards the opening of the labour market."
"Last Wednesday the minister was unable to give me a straight answer to my question."
"I would like to emphasise that issues concerning the opening of the labour market will remain among my priorities."
"The free movement of people is one of the four main freedoms of the European Union."
"The prevention of that freedom can only be approved in exceptional cases."
"– The so-called spy scandal in Moscow has demonstrated the Kremlin's true intentions to suppress civil society organisations in Russia and the countries of the former Soviet bloc."
"Taking advantage of the dependence of the European states on Russian energy and using the supply of energy to exert pressure, Russia is increasingly allocating funds to blatant propaganda campaigns."
"In the countries of Eastern Europe, these campaigns are above all directed against non-government organisations, in particular the foundations sponsored by G. Soros."
"The aim is to undermine society's trust in institutions which propagate western values and to keep the society in Russia's sphere of cultural and political influence."
"The EU ought to be more active in promoting democratic processes in the post-Soviet area and in the EU's eastern neighbours."
"It should express its opinion on anti-western propaganda and should not apply double standards vis-à-vis Russia because of a dependence on Russian energy."
"– The organisations representing workers from the electrical and electronic equipment industry in Portugal have reported that in the past three years more than 8 000 people have been laid off by the multinationals operating in the sector, such as Lear, Vishay, Philips, Yazaky Saltano, Alcoa Fujikura and Delphi, leading to serious reductions in employment levels. The situation will become worse if the threats of orders being placed elsewhere and of multinationals relocating are actually carried out, the latter having led to the loss of more than 6 000 jobs."
"In so doing, multinationals have gone as far as to blackmail the workers, by, , devaluing wages, by making working hours more flexible, and by making working conditions more precarious."
"Measures that have long been laid down must be implemented, in order to stop this race for maximum profit and maximum exploitation, with scant regard for the social impact, and sometimes, inexplicably, supported by Community financial resources."
"Mr President, I wish to register a protest about the portrayal of the Polish Government and Prime Minister as comic opera figures by the media across the Union."
"The most recent issue of the has also stooped to this level."
"The forces of liberalism are refusing to accept the will of the nation."
"The nation voted in free elections to entrust power to Catholics for whom God, truth and goodness are more important than the free market."
"Even so, our new leaders are being hounded and criticised by liberals in the media."
"Democracy is also being used as a smokescreen for the media terrorism that is currently being perpetrated with impunity in Poland."
"The target is the priest who heads the radio station which has millions of listeners in the country."
"The liberal press has printed at least 18 thousand offensive articles during the last eight years."
"The question arises as to why the Union’s agencies, whose aim is to defend democracy, human rights and freedoms and to combat intolerance only react to certain types of human rights violations, turning a deaf ear and a blind eye when Catholics are involved."
"Indeed, these agencies even ape the behaviour of those sections of the media that are opposed to traditional values."
"I would like to remind the House that a democracy that is not based on truth will inevitably become a dictatorship based on relativism."
"Mr President, the Polish media have announced that the European Union has decided against awarding a grant from the Cohesion Fund for the construction of the Racibórz Dolny flood prevention reservoir on the river Oder."
"The residents of the Oder river basin have been deeply disappointed by this news, and have lost a good deal of faith in the European institutions."
"In July 1997 there was disastrous flooding in the Oder river basin."
"Fifty-four people died and material damage amounted to almost EUR 5 billion."
"The Polish Government set about rebuilding the damaged areas immediately."
"Although Poland faced enormous financial difficulties, the programme for the construction of flood prevention barriers is being completed consistently and effectively."
"More than one thousand kilometres of flood prevention barriers have been rebuilt, and the flood plain has been increased by over 150 million square metres."
"Throughout the programme my country cooperated closely with its neighbours, namely Germany and the Czech Republic."
"Poland is fulfilling its accession obligations regarding implementation of the provisions of the Water Framework Directive in the cross-border Oder river basin region."
"I should therefore like to enquire about the reasons why Poland was not awarded financial aid for this project and about the possibility of Cohesion Fund money being made available quickly for this purpose."
"I would like to thank you all for offering your sympathy and condolences on the tragic event that shocked Slovakia’s public two weeks ago."
"As you all know, on 19 January a Slovak military plane crashed with 43 soldiers and military personnel on board."
"Unfortunately, only one person survived the disaster."
"The plane was flying from Priština, Kosovo, where Slovak soldiers together with other troops of the international community have been participating in the NATO peace mission."
"For Slovakia, 23 January was a day of national mourning."
"I would like to thank the EP President for his decision on that day to order that the state flag of the Slovak Republic in front of the Parliament building fly at half mast."
"These expressions of sympathy mean a great deal to the Slovak public."
"It was not only the loss of outstanding military professionals, but also of young people at the beginning of their careers and of individual lives, of sons and husbands as well as fathers of 36 bereaved orphans."
"May they rest in peace."
"At the World Economy Forum in Davos, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin blamed the malaise of Europe on enlargement."
"According to the French Prime Minister, decision-making has become more difficult as a result of the accession of the ten new Member States, and the acceptance of Eastern European countries has often been viewed in the Western half of the continent as an excessively heavy financial burden."
"The statement of Prime Minister de Villepin is outrageous and unacceptable."
"It seems that the Prime Minister of France, the founding state of the European Union, is not even aware of basic processes."
"The crisis of the European Union which is indeed in a difficult situation, has not been caused by the new Member States, on the contrary."
"Enlargement costs each citizen of the old Member States 20 euros a year; in light of this, the comment of Prime Minister de Villepin that the financial burden is excessive is incomprehensible."
"Moreover, economic stagnation in France had started in the mid-1990s."
"It is unfortunate that President Borrell, who was present at the time, did not defend the new Member States."
"We should not be scapegoats for France’s current crisis."
"Mr President, there have been reports recently in the British press about a conference held in Salzburg hosted by the Austrian Presidency."
"The purpose apparently was to discuss how Europe might re-engage with its citizens."
"This event happened to coincide more or less with the 250th anniversary of the birth of the immortal and glorious Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart."
"Mozart was presented at this conference as some kind of proto-European federalist, because of nothing more than the fact that in his short career he travelled extensively in Europe."
"However, what were Mozart’s political views, if any?"
"On hearing the news of Britain’s relief of Gibraltar and the victory over the French navy at Trincomalee, he wrote to his father, Leopold: ‘Indeed, I have heard about England’s victories and I am greatly delighted too, for you know that I am out-and-out Englishman’."
"Did the Austrian Presidency know that it was celebrating the birth of a self-proclaimed Englishman?"
"Mr President, last Friday Northern Ireland suffered the double blow of the loss of two factories, both the result of an inability to compete with cheap imports."
"‘Farm-Fed Chickens’, a long-standing poultry factory in Coleraine announced its closure with 350 job losses, and ‘Barber Threads’ in Lisburn was a casualty with 85 job losses in the textile sector."
"Cheap imports are now the scourge of EU manufacturing and processing industries."
"With Commissioner Mandelson’s approach at the WTO, it seems the Commission wants to rush further down this road of destruction."
"In the name of those being driven from employment right across Europe, I call for a root and branch reassessment of our approach to cheap imports, so that the social economic consequences are properly considered."
"We cannot go on haemorrhaging indigenous jobs in the pursuit of what really is an unacceptable dogma."
"Mr President, I am glad the Council eventually reached a compromise on the future Financial Perspective in December."
"Nonetheless, I feel the so-called ‘New Year gifts’ method applied by the British Presidency is irresponsible and does not favour European cohesion policy."
"In addition, the drastic cuts in expenditure on structural funding are certainly not helping to build a Europe of solidarity."
"There are also concerns about the lack of clear criteria for how the future reserve fund of unused Cohesion Fund resources is going to be used."
"I believe the likely outcome to be that, instead of Europe being strengthened, it will become increasingly divided."
"The first month of the Austrian Presidency is over, and by now the new Council ought to be ready to enter into specific discussions with Parliament."
"In the meantime, the absence of a negotiating mandate has certainly made us realise that time is money."
"The longer we have to wait for a compromise the more we are likely to lose out in terms of delays in the implementation of new programmes, especially those related to structural policy in an enlarged Europe."
"– In the last two days, the Lisbon Strategy and the review thereof have been under discussion."
"This is an issue of the highest importance."
"Members of national parliaments have participated in the debate, which has undoubtedly drawn attention to the situation on the ground in the Member States."
"Both the Commission and the Council must now take account of the situation in each of the Member States, where unemployment is growing and high levels of poverty and social exclusion remain, in order that the objectives announced six years ago at the Lisbon summit can be met."
"What is also needed is a complete break from the neoliberal policies of privatisations, liberalisations and the Bolkestein proposal for a directive, so that socio-economic conditions can be improved and greater economic and social cohesion in the EU can be effectively implemented."
"That concludes the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"The next item is the report (A6-0404/2005) by Mrs Maria Carlshamre, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on the current situation in combating violence against women and any future actions (2004/2220(INI)."
". Mr President, the issue of men’s violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society."
"It is everywhere and it affects the whole of society directly and indirectly."
"I am grateful for what I perceive to be a growing understanding of the scope of this problem."
"I want to thank my fellow MEPs in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities for the valuable help and support I received during this work."
"I am also pleased that Commissioner Franco Frattini has shown a strong and honest commitment."
"We now have a serious opportunity to recognise all women who have experienced violence but not justice."
"The cornerstone of my report is that we need correct figures."
"At EU level there are no reliable studies."
"However, three national prevalence studies in Finland in 1999, Sweden in 2001 and Germany in 2004, indicate that previous assessments have vastly underestimated the extent of the problem."
"Using the United Nations’ definition of violence against women, these studies show that 40 to 50% of women in these three countries have, at some point in their lives, been subjected to violence by a man."
"I should like to emphasise that: between 40 and 50% of all women between the age of 16 and 67."
"The corresponding figure for the whole of the EU would be incredibly high, at between 80 and 100 million women."
"Obviously effective measures must be based on correct facts and figures and the need for similar studies in other Member States is urgent."
"The magnitude of the problem in itself indicates that all Member States are repeatedly violating the basic rules of civil liberties and the rule of law on a scale that we have yet to understand."
"You may think this an exaggeration."
"It is not."
"I would like to invoke a classic liberal."
"More than 300 years ago, the British philosopher, John Locke, introduced a fundamental idea: a government should be regarded as a tool for the defence of fundamental rights, the most fundamental civil right being the right to life and physical safety."
"This is the moral, normative basis for the state and its reason for being."
"Citizens agree to obey the laws, but this presupposes that the state fulfils its basic commitment to protect the lives, freedom and property of its citizens."
"Any state which fails in this task has broken the contract."
"When it comes to violence against women, the failure is measurable in all Member States of the Union."
"All violence is a challenge to our civilisation and to the rule of law."
"But men’s violence against women is a specific challenge to the contract of which all common policy is an expression."
"There is a systematic difference in the way crimes of violence are treated, depending on the gender of the victim."
"Violence against men typically happens in public, perpetrated by another man, often a stranger."
"Violence against women typically happens in private, perpetrated by a man known to the woman, very often a man with whom the woman has or has had a relationship."
"The most crucial difference, politically, is that private violence against women is not prosecuted as seriously as public violence against men."
"The issue of men’s violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society, there is also a history."
"Violence in the street from a stranger, primarily affecting men, has been a criminal offence in Europe for centuries, but it is quite recent that violence occurring in the home was made a criminal offence."
"Well into the latter part of the 20th century, Europe had many laws which excused domestic violence by men against women."
"This legacy lives on in our Union."
"We can see it in case law, attitudes and perceptions about the less serious nature of private violence."
"The issue of men’s violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society."
"Men’s violence against women has also been a way of keeping men, in general, in power."
"When the UN General Assembly in 1993 adopted the declaration on the elimination of violence against women, it was the first time a UN document had placed men’s violence against women in a gender-power perspective."
"It explicitly links violence to the superior position of men."
"What we need to do now is to act."
"First get the figures right and then proceed to the proper solutions."
"The issue of men’s violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society, it affects us all."
"I demand zero tolerance of men’s violence against women."
"Mr President, I fully agree with the report and with what the rapporteur has just said."
"Violence against women is certainly today the most widespread instance of the violation of human rights worldwide."
"It is a form of violence that knows no geographical barriers or age limits among the victims, nor does it make any distinction on the basis of class or of cultural or family origins."
"It is truly the most widespread crime in the world, against which the European Commission and the institutions of the European Union have an institutional and moral duty to take a firm stand."
"I particularly welcome the report before us because it addresses the main areas that Europe’s institutions need to tackle. The Commission has launched a number of initiatives to help the Member States adopt strong preventive and reactive policies designed to eradicate violence against women."
"We are developing legal instruments to encourage close cooperation between Member States on policing activities; on the definitions of crimes, which often do not coincide; and, of course, on strengthening those measures designed to target and eradicate such crimes from civil society and to afford more effective protection for the victims of violence."
"Most of the initiatives mentioned in the report come under the Daphne programme, with which we are all familiar: they include victim support and training measures, programmes to reintegrate victims of violence into society, study and research projects, the development of European policies, data gathering, and the definition of indicators, which are unfortunately still lacking."
"The Daphne programme, which the Commission intends to continue and develop further, covers all forms of violence, including domestic violence, which is one of the most serious kinds."
"Unfortunately, these crimes are not represented in legal statistics because, in the vast majority of cases, the victims do not report violent episodes that take place within the family home."
"The measures in question also include a relentless fight against female genital mutilation, an horrendous practice that we must punish severely, and so-called ‘honour crimes’, which we should rename ‘dishonour crimes’: it is best not to term it an ‘honour’ crime when a man beats a woman for that kind of reason."
"The report mentions the need to gather data and draw up statistics, since reliable statistics are one of the basic requirements for making more effective decisions at European level."
"The Commission is working on that and, in collaboration with Eurostat, has set up a European system of statistics on crime and criminal justice: violence against women is, of course, one of the areas on which we shall very soon publish statistics calculated from the measures and the data that the Member States make available to us."
"I believe that by June 2006 we shall for the first time be able to publish a series of European statistics on crimes and the judicial response to crimes, and they will obviously contain a chapter devoted to violence against women."
"On the subject of female genital mutilation, the Commission has financed a large number of projects, all under the Daphne programme, which have produced positive results."
"I can also add that, in the area of European immigration and asylum measures, the directive on minimum standards for granting refugee status defines acts of sexual violence against women as sufficient grounds for granting refugee status."
"I can also assure the rapporteur that, although female genital mutilation is not explicitly included in the text of the directive in question, the Commission does regard it as an act of violence perpetrated for sexual purposes, and it is therefore included among the reasons that, in my view, justify the granting of refugee status."
"I have given this example, Mr President, in order to stress the need to tackle the issue of violence against women at a European level and from every possible angle: from trafficking in human beings, to migration policies, to equal opportunities – hence the need for non-discrimination."
"In more general terms, we need to use the courts, employment policy and social policies as practical enforcement instruments."
"I feel institutionally, politically and also morally bound by these objectives, which will therefore be specific priorities for our work over the coming months."
". Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work and for this opportunity to discuss violence that women face in their daily lives."
"Violence against women is not a marginal problem; women from all social groups can be victims of violence."
"Sometimes high-achieving professional women think they are untouchable."
"Every woman can be abused."
"It cannot be said that this is not a problem for us or for EU women."
"Even though the report focuses on violence by men against women, and especially domestic violence, we should not forget that this is not the only type of violence, despite, undeniably, being the most common."
"Unfortunately, children are also often targets of domestic violence, as are men."
"Even though they are not the focus of our discussion today, we should not forget that these things happen too."
"None of this kind of domestic violence should be allowed to happen."
"The rapporteur mentions the figure of 100 million women in the EU who have suffered from violence from men."
"The Commission estimates that almost 1000 women die in Europe every year due to violence in their partnerships."
"In Finland alone, the police make 80 000 house calls, and 17 000 of them are due to domestic violence – and we are a country which ranks fifth in the world’s gender equality rankings."
"These are horrific figures."
"We need to act."
"So what can we do?"
"First we should ensure that Member States take action in combating domestic violence."
"More efficient legislation and its true implementation are crucial, as well as coordination between all those involved in this field."
"We should also take into account the studies conducted in the United States which showed a clear correlation between animal abuse and domestic violence."
"It has been shown that many domestic violence cases have been preceded by animal abuse."
"This is something from which we in Europe could perhaps learn."
"In addition to more traditional type of violence against women, we have recently witnessed a rise in honour crimes and genital mutilation."
"I was very happy to hear that the Commission is putting more emphasis on this human right."
"Every woman has a right to decide about her own body."
"That is very important."
"Mr President, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for the fact that we have been able to debate this incredibly important issue in the EU this evening."
"As well as being a criminal act and a violation of human rights, men’s violence against women is a serious socio-political problem throughout the world."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament believe that men’s violence against women is linked to the unequal power relations between men and women, and the problem will increase if the Member States do not use legislation in order strongly and clearly to oppose such violence."
"Men’s violence against women naturally has considerable social and human consequences."
"I always maintain that, behind every woman who is beaten, there are, more often than not, a number of children who, in addition to undergoing considerable physical and psychological suffering, believe that this is the way things have to be, a view that, in the long term, may lead to their adopting the same behaviour themselves when they grow up."
"We have to break this vicious circle."
"We often also forget the children in these contexts."
"It is important that children who see their mothers beaten should also be regarded as victims and be entitled to have their cases heard in court."
"It has also been demonstrated that violence against women is an important factor in the lives of women and girls who fall victim to human trafficking and prostitution."
"I would also take this opportunity to point out that we should combat the attitude that prostitution is comparable with the exercise of a profession."
"This form of violence and serious violation of human beings is absolutely unacceptable."
"Prostitution and human trafficking and all forms of violence towards women, including genital mutilation and violence related to notions of honour, fall into the same category."
"The EU must set a good example and take a stand on combating these expressions of discrimination between the sexes and of the unequal distribution of power between them."
"It is also important to do some preventative work in the form of research, information provision and the exchange of knowledge between the Member States."
"More often than not, the focus is, quite naturally, on the victims, but there is also a need for active preventative strategies aimed at the perpetrators of violence and at those in danger of becoming perpetrators."
"Finally, I just want briefly to mention one of my own amendments dealing with the relationship between alcohol and violence."
"Alcohol is often a factor in acts of violence, and it is important that pleas relating to intoxication as an extenuating circumstance not be accepted by the courts where men’s violence towards women is concerned."
"When strategies for reducing alcohol-related harm in society are reviewed, account must definitely be taken, however, of the effect that alcohol has in triggering men’s violence against women."
"Mr President, it saddens me very much that we have to hold this debate on violence against women, since it means that we are talking about an active, live issue."
"The report by Mrs Carlshamre, whom I congratulate on her work, reminds us, amongst other things, that violence against women is a scourge that knows no national, religious, social or economic boundaries; on the contrary, as has been said, it is a universal phenomenon, relating to the inequalities in our societies in terms of the distribution of power and of roles between the sexes."
"It is for this very reason that the response must be firm, here in Europe and in other countries where, as in Mexico or Guatemala, the situation has become so bad that there is even talk of ‘feminicides’."
"The time for rhetoric and condemnation, however, is far behind us."
"Now is the time to act, to adopt measures in support of the victims, to apply proactive and preventive strategies and to establish effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties."
"But in order for those measures to be effective, we must provide them with the necessary human and financial resources."
"A few days ago we celebrated the first anniversary of the law on gender violence in Spain."
"That date gives us the opportunity to insist, as the Carlshamre report does, that violence against women must be seen as a clear breach of the most fundamental human rights and that, as well as reactive measures, we must establish programmes of a holistic nature to deal seriously with the issue of the distribution of roles in our society and, in particular, the perception that persists amongst many men that women are merely objects at their disposal and that they therefore have the right to hit them or mistreat them, and even sometimes to kill them."
"In short, I fear that the real problem exists within the heads of many men, and that is where action must be taken."
". – Violence against women, including the trafficking in human beings, prostitution, violence in the home and the workplace, is an extremely serious issue."
"Of these manifestations, domestic violence is the most common, affecting millions of women in Europe."
"The rapporteur, whom I wish to congratulate on her work, has presented us with some figures, although it is known no studies have been carried out at Community level."
"Commissioner, measures must be taken without delay to ensure that this phenomenon is made more visible."
"After all, it is appalling that victims of violence die every year in the EU, including more than 100 000 women and many children, another area that must be taken into account."
"I therefore hope that, after this debate, things do not simply continue as they have been."
"Hopefully, the instruments will actually be strengthened, as promised, measures will be implemented and the political will for effective change in this area will emerge."
". Mr President, I do not wish to play down the importance of this significant issue."
"Nonetheless, as a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I should like to point out that violence is not just a feature of male behaviour."
"It is an indication of a personality that has failed to develop properly, and it can occur in both males and females."
"Psychological violence perpetrated by women is less immediately obvious but can be equally damaging, as research into cases of violence in male and female same-sex relationships confirms."
"It should be emphasised that social factors play a very significant part in the spread of violence."
"I refer to aggression in the media and to the hedonistic and liberal lifestyle which is currently being promoted and which is subject to no restrictions, rules or prohibitions."
"It is a lifestyle characterised by a relentless tide of pansexualism and pornography and the belief that human beings are objects that can be bought and sold."
"Lastly, the recently advocated war between the sexes, which harks back to the Communist class conflict, has fuelled aggression rather than reduced it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Carlshamre, for her report underlining very important aspects of the fight against violence perpetrated on women."
"I agree with her, and I think that it is very important for all of us to adopt zero tolerance towards all forms of violence."
"A chain is said to be only as strong as its weakest link and our society must be weak if it cannot protect its weakest link, which is to say its children."
"Feminist movements have been exposing violence against women and have always fought for women’s rights."
"As we observe the age of victims getting lower and lower, society must have the courage to protect young girls from violence and abuse."
"However, guilty persons are only occasionally exposed, and usually when it is already too late."
"Sadly, tragic stories make good articles and increase the incomes of tabloid newspapers."
"Unfortunately for the victim, this is a tragic fact."
"Young girls usually do not get a chance to live out their childhoods – as a result of violence they become women and often mothers prematurely."
"It is for this reason that I too raise my voice today, in order to draw attention to this issue, and to help efforts aimed at stopping the violence that we all know exists in society, although we tend to rely on others to fight against it on our behalf."
"I think that it is very important to adopt laws, recommendations and regulations, but we must also support consistent implementation and compliance in our everyday lives."
"Not far from the European Parliament there is a young woman in the street with one or two babies holding out a cup and begging for money."
"As she is a woman from a different ethnic group, we pretend this is of no concern to us, throw her a couple of cents and walk on."
"Allow me first and foremost to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Maria Carlshamre, and to all colleagues who helped develop this report."
"Violence is an abuse of superiority by one party, but it has to be said that the failure to prevent violence is also a form of violence."
"Our basic attitude must be characterised by zero tolerance towards all forms of violence against women."
"Any solution will depend especially on teaching respect for other people and on intensive cooperation between governments, parliaments and non-governmental organisations."
"These bodies should jointly develop procedures for fighting this phenomenon."
"Statistics are necessary, but our success primarily depends on effective preventive measures, all the more so since every instance of violence in families affects children as well, and is passed on to future generations."
"Communities and ethnic minorities with different cultures, and their own specific forms of violence, must also be the focus of our attention."
"Every state of the European Union must enact comprehensive and effective legislation in respect of domestic violence, which will criminalise certain forms of violence."
"Neither customary practices nor alcohol should be considered as mitigating factors."
"We must clearly demonstrate that violence is simply unacceptable in society."
"Mr President, I firmly believe that domestic violence casts shame on the democratic and highly-developed society we live in, as it constitutes violence committed against human dignity."
"The prevention of violence against women must be a mission for all of us."
"Mr President, this report that we are debating today gives us the opportunity to make a strong appeal to the European institutions and the Member States to combat something that is a reality: violence against women for the sole reason that they are women."
"We cannot remain on the sidelines in a situation like this; it is our obligation to implement every instrument necessary to put an end to this social scourge."
"Violence against women is a breach of human rights, of fundamental rights, such as freedom, equality, life and non-discrimination."
"We must call upon the Member States to stiffen penalties and to implement complete legislation to respond to this reality."
"In this regard, Spain offers a clear example to the whole of Europe, with the law that it adopted last year to combat violence against women."
"Although such violence will clearly not come to an end overnight, this law represents a clear commitment to fight it decisively by means of all the necessary instruments."
"We cannot deny that there is greater awareness of this problem today, thanks to the efforts of women’s organisations in their fight against all forms of violence against women."
"We can now say that it is no longer an invisible crime, but rather it is one that is collectively rejected."
"Such important aspects as the protection of victims must be accompanied by other measures, such as specific programmes on access to work or to social housing, so that this reality can be dealt with in a complete way, taking account of aspects relating to education, legal assistance and health and without forgetting that these violent situations often also affect minors within their families."
"There can be no excuse not to tackle violence against women in a decisive and committed manner, because a society cannot progress while the rights of such a significant section of it – women – are being breached."
"We are talking about a serious social problem, and every possible effort will be required on our part if we are to put an end to it."
"The step we are taking today is a further step towards the ultimate objective."
"We must do everything possible, and more, to reach that objective."
"Violence against women has existed throughout human history."
"In order to create effective strategies for eliminating this serious social problem, it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of this phenomenon and the features of it that are specific to different nations."
"Post-communist countries, including Slovakia, have long ignored this topic."
"Strong traditions have always kept domestic violence hidden behind closed doors."
"Another contributing factor has been the fact that some types of violence concerned very delicate matters."
"For that reason, the victim would often not report an assault, especially out of fear of the perpetrator, fear for the children or loyalty to the family."
"These countries, in particular, typically had low levels of reporting sexual assaults."
"It is estimated that the real number of cases is five to ten times higher than the number of cases reported."
"Very often, women find it difficult to talk about violence, either because of the shock they have been through or out of shame, and do not believe that anyone can help them."
"Others do not even recognise the experience as violence."
"For these reasons, I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Carlshamre, who emphasised in her report that priority should be given to increasing the level of awareness about this problem in society as a whole."
"The report challenges the governments and parliaments of the member countries to take steps aimed at eliminating the silence surrounding violence against women."
"Violence cannot be a private matter."
"It must become a public issue, an issue for all of us."
"The accurate gathering of data is the only way to get to the essence of this serious problem and help to focus the efforts aimed at eliminating it."
"It is not only non-government organisations, media, research and educational institutions that can contribute to this, but also all of us who refuse to tolerate such a serious social problem, one that has become an obstacle to the development of a democratic society."
"In conclusion, allow me to express my thanks to the rapporteur for her work."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately I am not a man either, but a woman in this discussion, and I would like to thank rapporteur Maria Carlshamret for her well-timed report."
"The report claims justifiably that violence against women is connected with male supremacy in society."
"The report devotes great attention to the worrying spread of honour killings and genital mutilation in the European Union."
"These are traditions that immigrants bring from countries where the balance of power between the sexes is even more skewed than it is in Europe."
"The Member States of the European Union cannot overlook such a violation of human rights just because that violence is perpetrated within the family."
"We need strong measures and proportional, balanced penalties which act as a deterrent, as indicated in the report."
"Direct punishment should be supported by measures aiming to improve the balance of power between the sexes."
"I would like to emphasise yet another type of violence that represents and symbolises the unequal division of power better than anything else."
"I am talking about the selling of women’s bodies."
"The purchasing of sex constitutes violence and the perpetuation of violence."
"The seedbed of prostitution is most closely related to unemployment among women and the low wages paid to women."
"Continuing violence and the social problems connected with it make it very difficult to integrate women into the labour market."
"I concur with my colleague Figueiredo, who said: ‘Prostitution does not mean equal participation in the labour market’."
"In my home country, I am trying to make the purchasing of sex a criminal offence."
"I do not want violence against women and inequality between the sexes to continue."
"I do not want the deterioration of the living environment that accompanies the bordello industry to continue to threaten our cities."
"The European Parliament should seriously discuss making the purchasing of sex punishable throughout the European Union."
"That would be a step towards equality between the sexes and a great contribution towards the abolition of violence against women."
"Thank you for your attention!"
"Things are not going so badly: we have been discussing this issue for almost a decade, and that things are improving is demonstrated by the fact that we are here today, that we are still talking and that women now report the violence they suffer."
"This form of violence has been going on for a long time, and women have suffered in silence, and not just their own personal silence, but also the complicit silence of their families, neighbours and the whole of society."
"As has been said here today, this scourge affects all sectors of society: the rich, the poor, the educated, the less educated ..."
"Every single one of us knows of someone who has suffered from this violence."
"But not only should studies be carried out on the nature of domestic violence itself, but it is also worth investigating whether, when there is violence in the home, the person indulging in it also indulges in violence in the workplace, whether they also indulge in what is known as ‘mobbing’ and try to destroy the people around them physically and psychologically, because, when it comes down to it, people who do that are ill and they know of no way to express themselves other than through this kind of violence."
"We must also therefore consider what measures the European Union must put into practice."
"It is all very well to legislate, but it is also important to provide temporary aid, to provide education and to implement programmes such as Daphne, because all of these help gradually to put an end to this scourge and this persistent blot on our society."
"It is also the case, of course, that we must produce statistics and watch how they evolve, because if we are to provide real resources, if we are truly committed and provide the money needed to implement these essential programmes, we need to be able to see how they evolve so that we can put things right in time and be as effective as possible."
"We are dealing with public money and that money must be properly justified and, above all, it must be used for its intended purpose, which is no more and no less than to put an end to violence against any woman, not just here in the European Union, but also in third countries, which we help, but without demanding that the laws we apply here be complied with there as well."
"Mr President, violence against women is often played down or simply not mentioned."
"Nonetheless, it is a problem affecting one in three women the world over."
"Violence perpetrated by men against women is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights such as the right to life, safety, dignity and physical inviolability."
"As a rule, it is prohibited by law, but sadly it remains tolerated by society and statistics suggest that a billion women in the world continue to be beaten, forced to engage in sexual relations against their will and abused in other ways."
"This is not exclusively a developing world problem."
"Even in the Member States of the European Union on average three women die every day as a result of domestic violence."
"This means that victims of domestic murders were living in our midst, not in some distant location."
"Violence within the family is a major social problem resulting from unequal gender power distribution throughout the course of history."
"In our times every state should safeguard the rights of all its citizens, and consequently combat discrimination and violence against women by drafting and implementing appropriate legal provisions."
"– Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Carlshamre on the report which she has drafted with passion, ensuring that one problem of civilised human society remains topical."
"It is clear from the methodical report drafted by the relevant directorate of the European Commission and published in December 2005 and from research by the Council of Europe that violence against women is the main cause of death of women between the ages of 16 and 44."
"Even though, as the Commissioner said, there is no global definition of violence against women, this phenomenon crosses borders and is not prevented by social position."
"Any woman may fall victim to violence and any form of violence constitutes an infringement of human rights and infringement of the rights to life, safety, dignity and physical and mental integrity."
"It is an obstacle to the development of a democratic society."
"It isolates woman from social life and the labour market."
"It may result in marginalisation and poverty."
"This social problem must be wiped out in view of efforts to integrate more women into the labour market."
"Psychological violence – humiliation, threats and insults – is one form of violence which destabilises a woman's personality and upsets her behaviour, to the point at which she is unable to contribute to her environment."
"However, in order for there to be results, violence must be expressed and that is why confidence in the authorities, in the departments responsible, in the courts, needs to be increased."
"The measures to be taken must be coordinated and I congratulate you, Commissioner, for having shown that you are prepared to take these measures by finding the appropriate legal bases and keeping the programme to combat violence separate from other issues."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0401/2005) by Mrs Edite Estrela, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on equality between women and men in the European Union (2004/2159(INI)."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first to congratulate Mrs Estrela on her report and on the motion calling for a resolution on gender equality in the European Union."
"Gender equality is not only a cornerstone of the European Union, but is also an area in which Europe has blazed a trail and has always been one step ahead of social developments."
"The position of women in Europe has changed considerably thanks to Community-level action, first via legislation, and then via the structural funds and Community-wide inclusion of gender issues in all areas of policy."
"The Member States made it clear on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the platform for action on women in Beijing, which was celebrated exactly a year ago, that the issue of gender equality receives their wholehearted support."
"Although progress has undoubtedly been made in the area of gender equality, important tasks lie ahead for us."
"The Commission points this out in the report on gender equality, which is tabled every year at the spring summit of Heads of State or Government leaders."
"We must persevere and strengthen the legal bases."
"The motion for a resolution clearly refers to this and emphatically points out that the promotion of equality rests on three pillars, which are as follows:"
"1. legislation ensuring equal treatment for men and women and the fundamental rights of all people, whilst safeguarding the effective implementation of such legislation;"
"2. incorporating gender equality questions into our policies, especially the Lisbon Strategy and policies aimed at social inclusion, backed up by the principles of good governance and political commitment at the highest level;"
"3. the implementation of special measures to support specific groups and objectives, such as access for women to decision-making positions and the integration of female immigrants and women from ethnic minorities."
"The Commission has pursued this approach in the past and will continue to pursue it in the future."
"Its commitment in the area of gender equality will be reaffirmed in the roadmap on gender equality, of which President Barroso and I gave notice a number of months ago and which the Commission intends to table in March."
"This roadmap will set out tasks and measures intended to support equality between men and women for the period 2006 to 2010, and will detail how the Union intends to address these issues with its policies."
"Most of the measures referred to in the motion for a resolution will be flagged as priorities in the roadmap, along with support for the economic independence of men and women, equal access to decision-making positions, compliance with the principle of equal treatment and the fight against domestic violence and human trafficking."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s report on equality between men and women in the EU sets out the progress that has been made on gender equality, but concludes that much remains to be done if we are to end all forms of discrimination and if women are to enjoy a level playing field with men in both public and private life."
"To this end, there needs to be reconciliation between family life and work life, enhancement of the status of women in the labour market, more facilities for looking after children and other dependents and gender mainstreaming in the areas of immigration and integration."
"There are two major challenges at the root of any gender equality policy."
"One is to close the gender pay gap, and the other is to facilitate the reconciliation of work and family life for both men and women."
"It is unacceptable that women are the last to have access to jobs and the first to be made redundant, even though they are efficient and dedicated workers."
"The gap between men and women in employment stands at 15.8%, whilst the percentage of women in part-time work stands at 30.4%, compared to 6.6% for men."
"The employment rate among women with small children is 13.6% below the figure for women without children, whereas men with small children enjoy employment rates 10% higher than men without children."
"Women do the lion’s share of work in the home and therefore have less time for paid work."
"In couples with children up to the age of six, men do less than 40% of domestic chores and are responsible for 25% to 35% of childcare."
"The provision of suitable childcare facilities remains a key instrument in enabling women to enter the labour market and to stay there."
"There is a lack of women in all areas of work, especially in those areas traditionally considered male."
"It has been proven that women are good managers, and their creative and innovative abilities in urban planning and construction are widely acknowledged."
"As one successful female Italian architect once said, it is because men do not wear high heels, or walk with prams, that they do not design properly proportioned walkways or concern themselves with architectural obstacles."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take this opportunity to share some concerns that are worthy of further reflection."
"It is the responsibility of politicians to be able to read the signs so that they can stop the situation from becoming any worse."
"Mention was just made, as it was in the latest report, of domestic violence, and I should like to draw attention to youth violence and to the fact that it is on the rise."
"The images of the recent events in France seen around the world raised the question of what leads hundreds of young people to use violence to draw attention to their problems."
"Families, political decision-makers and societies as a whole must talk to one another to ascertain where they went wrong and why."
"This problem is not confined to France."
"There is a high level of violence among young people everywhere, and this is a very serious problem."
"What leads young people between 13 and 17 years of age to attack and even kill defenceless individuals as a form of entertainment?"
"The facts that have come to light are shocking."
"A group of youths robbed beggars and immigrants simply for kicks and recorded everything on their mobile telephones in order to show off to their school friends afterwards."
"Another group threw petrol over a homeless woman and set fire to her."
"The woman died of her burns."
"We cannot turn a blind eye to such cruelty."
"It is not sufficient simply to condemn; what is needed is action, so that we do not come to feel a sense of regret later, and say, as the father of one of these youths said, I feel a failure as a father."
"The principal cause, according to the experts, is the absence of parents."
"There are thousands of young people in the EU who have been consigned to the television, the Internet and the street since they were children."
"Parents spend over 12 hours outside the home, leaving the children unattended and at the mercy of all manner of negative influences, leading to academic failure, children leaving school early, indolence, drugs and exclusion."
"The second cause is idleness."
"With nothing to do, no school or no job, young people become irresponsible."
"Add to this a permissive culture in which people have few or no duties and all the rights they want; there is no discipline, no demands are made and no value is placed on work or merit."
"I should like the Commission, the Council and Parliament to look into this problem and to take appropriate measures while there is still time."
"I hope that the Commission’s next report is able to talk about more progress in the area of equality. I should like to express my gratitude to those Members and the secretariat of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for their help in drawing up this report."
". It often seems that there is nothing new to be said about the equality between men and women."
"Very often we just repeat the same things all over again."
"Unfortunately this does not mean that there is nothing left to be said about this issue."
"What it actually means is that we are talking about the same concerns over and over again, because in practical terms progress is relatively slow, and one step forward is sometimes followed by one step back."
"The best proof of this situation is that in spite of the countless directives and proposals concerning equal opportunities for men and women, created since the Rome Agreement, the situation has not been changing very fast."
"The report (for which I congratulate the author) repeatedly points out that Directive 75/117/EC, enacted exactly 30 years ago, prohibits different levels of remuneration for men and women, but also mentions that according to the latest figures, the difference between remuneration levels of men and women is still on average 15% (between 4% and 25%)."
"Another question is, how many countries have actually implemented and executed the latest Directive 113/2004?"
"Or let us take a look at the fate of the undertakings adopted by the Council in Barcelona in 2002, to facilitate reconciliation between family life and a professional career."
"These are relevant to the higher employment rate of women, but could also represent a turning point in the demographic crisis."
"The legislation of the European Union is becoming unreliable."
"Regulations may be breached continuously, without any consequences."
"The authority of European Union institutions is damaged if its undertakings exist on paper only."
"I trust that in the future the Commission will inspect the implementation and execution of the acquis more seriously."
". Mr President, until now the majority of voices that have been heard on this important question – and on the previous report – has been those of women."
"Hence, it is my honour to bring this discrepancy into balance to some extent and to emphasise that gender equality can be achieved only with the support and energetic participation of men."
"I hope this point and the report in general will be applauded by an absolute majority of all men of the European Union."
"A very important pledge of this report is to close the gender pay gap and to create pension schemes which are not discriminatory against women."
"The experience of the Nordic states shows that the highest living standards and quality of life can be achieved in those countries where women are by no means less successful than men in occupying the highest political posts."
"We should concentrate more on the revolting and alarming rate of trafficking in women, which is, in a way, comparable to the drug trade and for which, unfortunately, there is a huge demand in the new and old Member States."
"Such crimes deserve stronger punishment across all the Member States of the EU."
"Gender equality has always been one of the most important indications of European values for the new Member States."
"I am pleased to underline that today these states, including Lithuania, have in many cases surpassed the ‘old’ members."
"Together with my colleagues, I am happy that the European Institute for Gender Equality is being created."
"The new Member States have a strong argument for establishing this institute on their territory."
"Lithuania, which in many cases, has a leading position in the implementation of gender equality policies, is more than ready to establish this institution in Vilnius."
"Once again, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Estrela."
"Mr President, I am once again pleased to congratulate Mrs Estrela on having produced a report that is essential to the fight for equality between men and women in the European Union, since, regrettably, the way the different genders are treated is still entirely unjust, particularly in terms of wages, recognition and opportunities."
"Nevertheless, the degree of this injustice varies according to the Member State."
"The Commission must therefore monitor seriously the application by the States of the Community legislation relating to equal opportunities and take the necessary measures in cases where it is not respected."
"Furthermore, since I will become a father in two months’ time, I am also concerned about the lack of attention generally still paid to the reconciliation of work and family life and, in particular, the difficulty many men still have in many countries in playing a responsible paternal role, which means that women have to take more responsibility within the family at the expense of their own professional careers."
"In short, we must support measures to guarantee equality in employment and in access to goods and services and to their provision."
". – Ladies and gentlemen, as both the Lisbon Strategy and Mrs Estrela’s report make clear, an integrated community is based on freedom, solidarity and equality, yet there continues to be inequality between men and women in a number of areas."
"I wholeheartedly endorse calls for a narrowing of the pay gap between men and women and for European legislation to be implemented."
"I must warn, however, that women are disadvantaged not only in terms of salary, but are also often the victims of discrimination; employers are often insensitive towards pregnant women, for example."
"In the Czech Republic women have suffered what is referred to as silent discrimination."
"Employers often assume that pregnant women are weak and defenceless."
"Anti-discrimination laws intended to protect women have yet to be introduced in the Czech Republic."
"In some countries there is silent discrimination against employees particularly on the grounds of age, maternity, health and disability."
"The time has come for change."
". Mr President, I am a woman who was brought up in Poland, where Christian values are universally recognised."
"I can assure the House that I have never been discriminated against in the home, at school, in higher education or at work."
"Sadly though, women are in danger of being discriminated against as a result of European Union policies."
"I cannot therefore understand the concern expressed by the author of the report on equality between women and men in the European Union at the fact that the employment rate for women aged between 15 and 24 has not increased."
"That is the time when young women ought to be in education or perhaps starting families."
"2007 has been designated ‘European Year of Equal opportunities for All’."
"With this in mind, I would like to call for equal opportunities for children too."
"Children should at least be able to enjoy the same opportunity as we had to bond with our mothers."
"Children must not be separated from their mothers soon after birth by sending the mother off to work and the children to a childcare centre."
"From a medical point of view, plans to grant maternity leave to men instead of to women seem rather odd."
"After all, women really need that time to recover from the birth."
"For babies, it is a period of adjustment to life outside the womb."
"It is particularly important that the first few months of life are spent in close proximity to a loving mother, whose care is vital to the proper development of newborns babies and toddlers."
"Rather than granting time off to fathers, it would be more appropriate to increase family benefits and to recognise the time spent bringing up children when calculating pension entitlements."
"Men do not have a maternal instinct and their sense of paternal responsibility develops rather later."
"Once again, I appeal for responsibility, for women to be treated with dignity and respect, and for children not to be subjected to social experiments."
". – I would like to draw your attention to several points."
"I believe that an appropriate solution to the problem of gender equality will be found."
"Firstly, when gender education is incorporated into school and university curricula."
"Secondly, when we no longer confine ourselves to formal governmental and ministerial reports and the governments are requested to show concrete results regarding the implementation of gender equality policies."
"Thirdly, when the European Institute for Gender Equality, which is currently being established, does not confine itself to the collection of statistical data, but appoints impartial observers, capable of assessing the situation in every country of the European Union."
"Of course, we would argue in favour of a proposal that such an institution be established in Lithuania."
"Fourthly, when the comment made by the European Commission is taken into account, that not one project application has been received from the Baltic countries’ non-governmental organisations, which are concerned with the implementation of gender equality policies, simply because these organisations do not have the funds for cofinancing."
"Thus they are also denied access to structural funds."
"Mr President, men and women enjoy absolutely equal rights under Union legislation."
"Indeed, the Union perceives this as one of its key tasks in connection with the practical implementation of human rights."
"I am sure none of us feels that it should be otherwise."
"Of course we are in favour of making progress in those areas where men and women are still not treated equally."
"Of course women should not endure violence at the hands of men, though these days there are also many cases of battered men."
"Of course women should receive equal pay for work of equal value."
"In my country there are more women that men continuing their studies and gaining higher education qualifications."
"In my view, the reason why these women do not then pursue their studies still further or take up important positions in business or politics is not because they are subject to discrimination."
"It is simply that women have other priorities in life."
"They have much more significant and urgent goals to attain than men."
"It is important to bear in mind that the factor of time operates rather differently in the course of the life of a man and a woman."
"Women have to bear their children at a specific stage in their lives."
"They live longer than men to make up for that."
"There is nothing to prevent constituents from voting for women to represent them in the European Parliament, for example."
"It is not our fault that women themselves prefer to vote for men."
"Personally, I voted for the best candidate in our constituency, and that candidate happened to be a woman."
"Our whole world order is based on the fact that there are two versions of the human being, the male and the female."
"The Creator, or Nature if you prefer, ladies and gentlemen, has determined that although they are equal, men and women are not the same."
"They are physically different and have different roles to play in society."
"Unfortunately, their financial circumstances differ too, and this should be remedied."
"There are also some psychological differences between the sexes."
"I urge women to recognise the positive aspects of being a woman and to understand that having exactly the same as men does not always mean having the same things."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the subject of the Estrela report lies at the heart of our concerns about the quality of European democracy and is also directly liked to our development objectives and, specifically, the Lisbon Strategy, which was the subject of the meeting between our Parliament and the national parliaments over recent days."
"The report by Mrs Estrela is especially important and that is why I thank her for her initiative in drafting it, because it is the first report which refers to the gender equality situation in the Europe of the 25."
"Despite its descriptive approach, it gives us useful information on this situation and the need to address inequalities."
"We note that, despite the economic slowdown, employment among women is increasing."
"The present average of 55.1% is an optimistic message that we can achieve the Lisbon objectives of 60% by 2010."
"However, a deeper and more careful analysis gives us to understand that the position of women in the labour market is precarious, because unemployment is increasing at the expense of women, the share of part-time work is much greater among women than among men, wage differentials continue to exist in all sectors and certain categories, such as immigrants, are victims of particular forms of discrimination in the labour market."
"Reconciling family life and work continues to constitute a major challenge, especially for women with small children."
"The proposals in the Estrela report were, I believe, the subject of unanimity in our committee and I too maintain that a national strategy is needed with well coordinated objectives in the Member States which, on the one hand, promote mainstreaming in all policies and, on the other hand, apply the measures for the abolition of discrimination where it exists."
"However, very good cooperation is also required between government agencies and social partners and non-governmental organisations, especially women's organisations and, on the part of the Commission, monitoring is needed of the application of the and a deeper approach to the issue, with a higher standard of analysis."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this very comprehensive report."
"Unlike some other speakers, I consider it necessary and timely."
"I will highlight just three issues."
"The gender pay gap remains unacceptably high across Europe at 16%."
"In Ireland, it is approximately 15% and this has major implications for women’s standard of living, for their families and their quality of life."
"This issue must be addressed at national and EU level."
"Secondly, I support the rapporteur’s call to all Member States to ensure that women have equal access to social insurance schemes."
"In Ireland, spouses of self-employed people or farmers are often not covered by social insurance in their own right, even though they work on the farm or in the business."
"They therefore lose out on many benefits and entitlements."
"This is discriminatory and needs to change."
"Finally, there is an absolute need for positive discrimination towards women in the political system by political parties at all levels, particularly at candidate selection level."
"I suggest a level of 50% of women."
"To those who would say we do not always get the best people in that way, I would say rubbish; 51% of the population are women."
"You will get as much quality from there as from the other 49%."
"And why do I insist on that?"
"Because issues such as caring in the home, violence in the home, trafficking of women and many other issues that are seen as women’s issues are not just women’s issues, they are societal issues."
"Until we have sufficient numbers of women at decision-making level, they will not be mainstreamed in policy responses and will not be adequately addressed."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for this interesting debate, in which a relatively large number of men took part."
"I take this as a sign that we have made progress in the area of equal opportunities."
"Gender equality is not only a social question, but also an economic one, and our policies will be all the more effective if they take this issue on board."
"Equality should be based on a broad approach, involving specific measures and reaching across all of our policies."
"The policy of gender equality must be fostered through political commitment at the highest level, involving compliance with legislation and good governance at all levels of power."
"We are making strenuous efforts in this direction and I feel sure that our roadmap on equality issues, which we shall be tabling in March, will make a significant contribution."
"I should like, if I may, to respond to one of the questions that was asked."
"Directive 73/2002 came into force on 5 October 2005, and most countries have transposed it. The Commission is currently analysing the situation and, where applicable, will initiate the appropriate procedures."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The initiation reported by Mrs Estrela on equality between men and women in the EU has a crucial role in the horizontal way of handling equality matters."
"The aim was common to present the second annual report on equality and the first to cover the enlarged EU of 25 Member States."
"I am strongly convinced that measurable results could be worked out only with systematic work."
"An important message of the initiation is that each year an annual report will be presented."
"The report mentions the strategic guidelines of the equality policy."
"I would like to emphasise two of the most relevant fields that should be ensured for all: decent work and equal pay for equal job."
"My opinion is women hold the key to achieving the Lisbon Strategy’s overarching goal of creating more growth and jobs in the European Union."
"The primary task an increase in affordable childcare, following the good example set by Sweden and Denmark."
"It is focused by the PSE Group’s growth and investment strategy, agreed by social democratic governments across Europe."
"Last but not least we could achieve the above-mentioned results only with the active participation of men in gender equality."
"The next item is the report (A6-0390/2005) by Mr Markus Ferber, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the application of the Postal Directive (Directive 97/67/EC) as amended by Directive 2002/39/EC (2005/2086(INI))."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would very much like to thank the Commission for having produced a very ambitious report on the application of the Postal Directive, which forms the basis for today's debate and tomorrow's vote here in the European Parliament."
"It has become very clear – and this is also expressed in the resolution we adopted in the Committee on Transport and Tourism – that the journey we started in 1992 with the Green Paper on the development of postal services in the European Union has continued successfully to today."
"We have succeeded in reaching a compromise between comprehensive, high-quality provision of postal services and ever increasing competition in the sector, two essentially contradictory aims."
"That, of course, is the specific aim in 2006, if the obligations in the current Postal Directive also have to be met."
"I am delighted, Commissioner, that the Commission has put forward a very ambitious timetable, that the prospective study laid down in the directive has now been commissioned, and that, on the basis of this prospective study, we will then be in a position to take further decisions."
"Obviously, we cannot be satisfied with what we have achieved so far; we must ensure that we complete the internal market in this field too."
"But the postal market is not telecommunications, it is not electricity, and it is not gas."
"We therefore need to take a closer look at how we can achieve further developments here."
"In our report we have tried to raise a series of questions to which, of course, we would very much like answers, Commissioner, when you present the studies that you have planned for this year."
"This will give us the materials we need to be able to reach decisions."
"The question is: how can we ensure that postal services work throughout the European Union – not just in the big cities, in Greater London, in the Ruhr valley, in Berlin, in Madrid or in Rome, but in all regions of the EU?"
"How can we permanently guarantee the high quality that we now enjoy even in cross-border regions, and how can we do this in a sector that – as the Commission's communication also says – is continuing to grow?"
"I can still remember the debates in this Chamber when the opinion was that postal services would die out anyway, because we could use faxes and e-mail."
"Postal services are a growth sector."
"So, how can we mobilise market forces to develop new products and thus to create more jobs in the sector?"
"These are questions to which we in the committee expect answers from the Commission over the course of this year."
"They are questions that we have included in this report."
"If we can work together very intensively this year – the Commission and the European Parliament, and the Council, which is not very involved at the moment, will join in at some point – then we can enable further developments in this sector that, at the end of the day, will live up to all of these conditions."
"I am very grateful to all my fellow Members who worked with such commitment on this topic."
"Postal services affect all of us: in every one of our electoral districts there are many postal customers, many post offices and sorting offices, in some cases run by several postal service providers."
"There are therefore always very lively discussions both in committee and here in Parliament."
"Many thanks to all those who helped me produce this report."
"I would also like to be quite clear: a rapporteur is always pleased when only a few amendments are tabled."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has tabled an amendment that certainly helps to improve the wording of a point that had not come out of the voting in committee very well."
"I hope that it will meet with broad approval."
"We will then have produced, on the whole, a thorough report which puts the European Parliament in a good position to complete its further legislative tasks successfully."
". Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity to briefly inform the House on the state of play of the Community’s postal policy from the perspective of the Commission and to share with you my thoughts on how I see that policy developing in 2006."
"But first of all, I should like to thank Mr Ferber for his report, which is very timely, constructive, balanced and well informed."
"In fact, the findings of the report correspond with our own thinking."
"Like the report, we are convinced that postal reform in the European Union has brought about positive results for all players and has significantly contributed to the European Union’s competitiveness."
"This directive has already paved the way forward by asking the Commission to submit this year three initiatives: a third report on the application of the Postal Directive, a prospective study about the impact of competitive postal markets on universal postal services, and a proposal on the future of EU postal policy."
"The shape of this proposal will be influenced by a number of factors."
"One of these, and perhaps the most important, is the impact of Community rules on the postal sector."
"The Postal Directive, as amended, establishes balanced principles to allow a gradual phasing-in of competition while maintaining the necessary safeguards for the provision of a universal service."
"I must say in this context that developments to date provide no evidence supporting the need for a change to the deadlines set out in the Postal Directive."
"The year 2009 thus remains the reference date for our work."
"The Commission will ensure that the enforcement of the Treaty provisions on competition will accompany the process of liberalisation."
"As far as the state aid rules are concerned, in July 2005 the Commission adopted a package of measures providing guidance on the principles under which it assesses public service compensation for services of general economic interest."
"Furthermore, the Commission is fully aware of the social relevance of postal services and will pay particular attention to the situation of every Member State so as to be able to reach common ground."
"The results of the prospective study will help us in doing so and will contribute to the analysis of the conditions for a successful postal internal market."
"Additional elements will be provided through the results of our recently conducted public online consultation on the future of European postal services."
"The Commission will continue its preparatory work in full transparency, and pursue its dialogue with all those involved."
"This own-initiative report of the European Parliament represents a very good basis for further discussions."
"I very much welcome this initiative and I warmly thank Mr Ferber and his colleagues from the Committee on Transport and Tourism for the excellent work."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats fully supports the substance of the rapporteur Mr Ferber's opinion on the European Commission's progress report."
"By means of the opinion presented by the rapporteur, we want to ensure that the Commission uses the measures announced up to 31 December this year to examine closely all the economic, technological, social and geographic aspects of the increasing openness of the postal market and to inform us of its consequences."
"To date – I would like to remind you of this, Commissioner, and I am keen to hear your response – not all Member States have, to our knowledge and that of the rapporteur, correctly implemented the Postal Directive on time."
"I think that it is the Commission's duty to monitor the implementation of the measures taken so far very carefully in each Member State, to hold the Member to their obligations and, if necessary, to refer them to the European Court of Justice."
"Community law must be applied in all Member States."
"By way of conciliation, though, I will say that, following the generally positive developments in the postal market for the benefit of the consumers so far, in my opinion the Commission should stick to the joint decision to complete the opening up of postal services in 2009."
"I would also ask you to really go into the issue of universal service in detail once more."
"If I may summarise, universal service should mean that we can expect high-quality services at affordable prices in all Member States."
"That is our goal, but we should take a careful look at that."
"I will give you an example: If even Germany now deviates from the principle that the postage charge for a standard letter should be the same both internally and to all 24 other Member States, then we have to consider what that means."
"A standard letter in Germany now costs 55 cent, but the same letter to any other EU country costs 70 cent, the first time there has been a difference."
"If that means that the postage charged depends on the costs – the distance and the type of delivery – then what is the justification for a universal service?"
"What is left to justify the restriction of competition by a regulated reserved sector?"
"We need to examine carefully the question of what the universal area is, what we want it to guarantee, and whether we need a reserved sector to do that."
"I am therefore awaiting your assessment and your opinion with great interest."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
". Mr President, it is obviously important we are having this debate today, because on 1 January, the latest step down to 50 grams for the reserve sector took place, and we are awaiting the Commission’s study – hopefully to be published in the summer – on accomplishing the internal market by 2009."
"There are great challenges facing the postal sector, but also great opportunities."
"Post has to keep up with developments elsewhere, not least the switch from consumer-to-consumer business to business and consumer, but also as regards the single market."
"It is a condemnation of the European Union that 13 years after the completion of the single market, there are huge obstacles to cross-border postal activity, the work of the expanding home-shopping market and indeed for newspaper and magazine publishers."
"In order for this process to work properly, we have to have transparency, clarity, certainty and the clear involvement of postal customers and consumers."
"We recognise of course that each postal market is unique, but that cannot excuse serious regulatory asymmetry leading to serious market distortions."
"We have to have a structure whereby national regulatory authorities must work together."
"We have to have greater clarity and transparency in the authorisation process and this is one area on which the Commission must focus."
"We need Member States to adopt and implement the quality of service standards devised by CEN so that we can compare like with like."
"We must ensure that postal customers, small as well as large, are involved in this whole process."
"Ultimately the success or failure of this venture will depend on us being able to satisfy people that our little old mothers living in isolated places are still going to get a universal service."
"Answer that and this process will be successful."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like straightaway to join others in thanking our fellow Member, Mr Ferber, for his own-initiative report."
"Allow me to present my point of view from two angles."
"Firstly, together with my Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am delighted that this report will henceforth give us the opportunity to debate the legal framework that our Union should implement by 2009 with a view to regulating the opening up of postal services."
"Secondly, I support the method proposed, which offers us an approach to the process of modernising this sector that is both controlled and balanced."
"Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, while the aim of opening up postal services is, as has just been explained, one of modernising the sector of activity in question and of improving the services provided to customers, no one is oblivious to what is at stake in the reform or to our fellow citizens’ legitimate fears that a high-quality service will no longer be maintained and that the service will no longer cover all territories, including the remotest ones."
"It is therefore with a great deal of interest that I await the economic impact study due to be presented by the European Commission some time this year."
"It should be based on reliable economic data and on the results of consultations with all the interested parties, from the trade unions to the chambers of commerce and industry, via all the social partners concerned."
"I also draw the Commission’s, as well as the Council’s, attention to the need to combat distortion of competition in all its guises."
"I am thinking, in particular, of VAT liability and tax harmonisation."
"To conclude, I am counting on the Commission to propose relevant and fair schemes for funding the universal service, without second guessing choices that Parliament will have to make because, in the last resort, ladies and gentlemen, it is undoubtedly up to Parliament, as our democratic arm, to explain to the 450 million Europeans that the strong Europe that we want to build together belongs to them."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about the future of postal services, we should start by considering what we are trying to achieve."
"The completion of the internal market cannot be an end in itself, but should – as it says in all the declarations of intent – bring positive results for the citizens of Europe."
"However, it can already be seen that several states where services have been diluted have recorded a huge impact on remote regions and areas with low population densities."
"People in poorly accessible areas must also not be cut off from services."
"The idea that opening up the market would, as the rapporteur stated in committee, automatically guarantee that services would be provided to the proverbial old lady in the mountains has since been proved wrong by some classic examples."
"For that reason, a study like the one that has been prepared should not pose the questions in a way that practically presupposes the desired answer, as has been done in point 13, for example."
"This point clearly shows the author's desire to get a certain answer – so clearly, in fact, that it almost makes the study superfluous."
"If we commission a study, we must be prepared to face up to the whole truth."
". – Mr President, the liberalisation of postal services is a piece of the puzzle of the general liberalisation of services and the privatisation of public utility companies and harms all the workers."
"The social need for reliable, modern postal services is becoming the subject of exploitation in order to secure greater profits for big business."
"On the pretext of the new operational programmes, redundancies and changes to postal workers' contracts of employment are taking on mass proportions."
"On the pretext, again, of changing communication conduct, the report paves the way for the definition of the universal service to be re-examined."
"It endeavours to abolish the obligation which this service provider has to provide ready access to the postal network to all users at adequate fixed collection and distribution access points which cover national and cross-border services."
"These amendments, as part of the liberalisation of postal services and the completion of the internal market in postal services in 2009, as referred to in the report, objectively give private post offices the facility to wrest the lion's share of the postal market from public post offices, with painful consequences for users and workers in general."
"That is why we are opposed to and voted against the report."
". Mr President, we have seen the proposed Constitution for Europe rejected by the French and Dutch people."
"The computer-implemented inventions and port services directives were also rejected."
"Despite these rejections, the drive towards harmonisation goes relentlessly onwards, even when it has nothing to do with trade or EU efficiency and is bad for citizens."
"So here it is, another second-class act, the Postal Directive."
"This is none of the EU’s business, and I advise the EU to stay out of it."
"The Postal Directive seeks to impose value added tax on postage at a time when letter writing is under great competition from e-mail."
"The UK does not want it!"
"The British Post Office is now 371 years old, and it was the British in 1840 who brought out the first postage stamp, bearing the head of Queen Victoria."
"Now the EU wants to stamp its dead hand of inefficiency on it."
"A high watermark of philatelic interference, perforated only by ignorance of British tradition and a wish to kill letter writing stone dead."
"From Penny Black to EU attack in 166 years!"
"Is this progress?"
"In 2004 the Postmaster General stated categorically that the British Government did not want VAT on stamps."
"The Royal Mail told me this very week that it does not want it, as it would be bad for small businesses, charities and customers."
"The British people do not want it."
"They are already paying for the cost of the EU’s common agricultural policy."
"What would Stanley Gibbons have said from the Strand in London if he had still been alive?"
"I suggest he would have published a book with pictures of MEPs who monkey with British postal traditions entitled ‘Stanley Stamps Gibbon Catalogue’."
"When UKIP vote on this report, it will vote in accordance with the wishes of UK citizens."
"I hope British MEPs stick up for Britain."
"The people will watch as Europhiles submit their nations to another excessive stamp of EU authority."
"Thank you, Mr President, and good luck to the interpreters!"
"Mr Nattrass, for your information, your group may speak today for five minutes, divided up as follows: one minute for Mrs Krupa, one minute for Mr Bloom, a further one and a half minutes for Mrs Krupa and one and a half minutes for yourself, and not two and a half minutes."
"If Mr Farage has ‘sold’ you five minutes, then he has sold you something that did not belong to him."
". Mr President, the postal directive should serve all consumers and particularly the needs of rural dwellers."
"The liberalisation of services very often benefits those in areas of dense population at the expense of consumers in less-populated areas."
"As a Member of the European Parliament for the West and North-West of Ireland, I represent a predominantly rural constituency."
"In my experience, many directives over the years have had a negative impact on rural areas and rural development because they inadvertently or advertently benefited areas of high population where liberal policies were easier to follow."
"The local post office in rural communities is a vital economic, social and cultural institution and the rights of rural dwellers to postal services cannot be ignored when framing liberalisation plans for those services in the EU."
"The provision of and access to such services is the essence of what sustainable rural development is all about."
"It has to be highlighted that the opening-up of postal services does not always bring benefits in terms of an increased level of employment and I would ask the Commission to address this in a detailed study that will be given equality, efficiency and customer-orientation in the postal sector, particularly as regards those peripheral areas."
"The intention behind the postal directive was good but, like all good intentions, the application was not so good."
"I would ask the Commission and the rapporteur to try and put in place a system of postal services that will be fair to all, a universal service."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the process of gradual liberalisation in the postal sector that has begun in recent years has produced a positive change, in that it has encouraged operators to improve the quality and efficiency of the service and of their production processes."
"Mr Ferber’s report on the implementation of the postal directive is well-balanced: it underlines the positive effects of the liberalisation undertaken so far, but it also points out the need to assess the social and employment consequences of a further stage in the completion of the internal market, taking account of the particular situations in individual countries."
"This further stage will depend entirely on the results of the Commission’s study, the purpose of which is to assess the impact that completing the market will have on the universal service in each Member State."
"It is therefore inappropriate to make any predictions about this study."
"Parliament’s role at this stage is to emphasise that the effect of liberalisation on the universal postal service must be assessed in relation to national differences and particular geographical, social and economic situations, and that political decisions on liberalisation must be made wholly in accordance with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity."
"The postal service is a vital link for our citizens in certain areas."
"To maintain current universal service levels requires a gradual approach."
"That is why the Italian delegation cannot support the amendment proposed by Mr Ferber, because it implicitly casts doubt on the need for a universal service, which, in my view, remains a right and an inescapable duty for Europe’s postal services."
"Mr President, I will be very brief when I say that postal services are not like other services."
"They have a human dimension, as has been pointed out, but they also have a social and territorial dimension, which means that the services provided vary greatly from one country to the next."
"There is a big difference between serving a very dense population, like that of the Netherlands, which is concentrated on very flat territory, and serving, on the same terms, the same population spread over thousands of islands, as in Greece, or over a very diverse territory, as in France."
"Consequently, I hope that the assessment planned by the Commission is objective and that it is not based on the belief shared by some in this Assembly, namely that there is no need for a framework because the market, and nothing but the market as a whole, is equal to the job of regulating postal services."
"I also hope that this assessment helps ensure that the opening up of the postal market - which is something Europe needs – is carried out in such a way as to respect what the postal service represents: a universal service whose territorial and social dimension is irreplaceable."
"The goal of liberalising the postal sector by 2009 is real and achievable."
"Results in the Member States where postal reform has been more rapid demonstrate this fact."
"It is difficult to understand why the report stresses that as a result of competition in the postal sector former employment levels have not always been preserved."
"The goal of postal reform is not preserving jobs, nor of course reducing them."
"Jobs can also be lost without liberalisation – as a result of technological modernisation, for instance."
"We should not look at industry reform from the viewpoint of the postal sector as a business."
"The development of the postal business and its adjustment to new market conditions are business management issues."
"The fundamental goal of the restructuring of the postal sector is to better meet consumers’ interests, by giving inhabitants of the European Union the opportunity to receive a universal service."
"At the same time, however, the post should not remain simply an industry for the maintenance of the universal service."
"We should not forget that the majority of postal services customers – in fact over 90 per cent – are business customers, whose requirements of the postal sector may be different."
"A broad spectrum of high-quality postal services needs to be developed, in order for the industry not only to survive but also to develop."
"The range of postal services increasingly interacts with other sectors such as financial services, advertising and commerce."
"The future of postal services will be dependent on such successful interactivity."
"Postal sector development is one of the engines for the European Union’s economic development, productivity and competitiveness."
"Unfortunately, progress in the direction of a common European Union postal market remains slow."
"We are once again holding a debate which affects one of European society’s most emblematic public services, which is of great symbolic value and inspires great confidence; hence its diversity and strong roots."
"Furthermore, postal services are essential given their importance in terms of an intensive workforce: a workforce with a level of training and sense of belonging to the service which deserve immense respect and recognition."
"Furthermore, the postal services’ capacity to enhance social and territorial cohesion is fundamental in an enlarged and increasingly individualist Europe."
"In this new phase that is opening up – and at this point I would like to acknowledge Mr Simpson as well, whom I wish had also been present, and I hope that he is here later – I would therefore like to say to the Commission that it is essential that the new process have true and acceptable justification and that it be fully credible, because we are being told that the service will be better afterwards, but what we are seeing today is that what is being proposed to us is greater insecurity in terms of jobs, with a large number of question marks being placed over the service."
"We must therefore argue that it is essential fully to guarantee the universal service with all of its quality of service and price conditions and also argue that account be taken of social and territorial cohesion and of the diversity of the current systems in terms of what is good about them – they cannot all be homogenised."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, on his excellent report, which clarifies the social and economic importance of the postal services, in the face of indications of unemployment and concentration."
"It is necessary in my view to prevent this public service, with the advent of liberalisation, from becoming merely an economic service, in which only the wealthier sections of society will be able to enjoy the basic right to send a letter, with the universal provision of service denied to the least privileged members of society and to those living in outlying regions."
"I should therefore like to call on the Commission, in future analyses of the sector, to differentiate on the basis of costs associated with funding the universal service, particularly in view of geographic and demographic constraints, in order to guarantee access for all to this service of general interest."
"In common with the rapporteur, I feel that postal services are fundamental to the EU, and that they have a positive influence on various sectors of society, such as trade, services and jobs, by modernising investments capable of increasing competitiveness, quality and efficiency, which in turn make it possible to charge less to the citizens and to businesses."
"In so doing, a decisive contribution is made to achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, as a sector capable of generating jobs and growth."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"I am sympathetic to the fact that the report emphasises that the principle of subsidiarity must be applied to the authorisation procedure."
"I also welcome the fact that the European Parliament points out that the Commission should devote special attention to the consequences that liberalisation of the postal market will have for the inhabitants of sparsely inhabited regions (paragraph 9)."
"What, however, I should like to have seen are stringent wordings that made it clear that a worse service for the populations of isolated regions of Europe is unacceptable."
"The Commission has not adopted a position on modifications to rules governing how often post is to be distributed (see oral question H-1135/05)."
"Nor is the European Parliament clear about this issue."
"One basic condition for enabling postal services to be used in the future by people living in sparsely populated regions is that services be priced at a level comparable with that applicable in the rest of the country."
"The European Parliament does not adopt a position on this issue in the report. Nor has the Commission done so."
"I am also unsympathetic to the European Parliament’s criticism of national value added tax on the postal market (paragraph 18) and to the proposal that the European Commission should investigate how the pension liabilities of the public postal operators are being dealt with (paragraph 17)."
"These are issues that should be dealt with at national level."
"I shall vote against this report."
"The next item is the report (A6-0412/2005) by Mr Toubon, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on nominal quantities for pre-packed products, repealing Council Directives 75/106/EEC and 80/232/EEC, and amending Council Directive 76/211/EEC (COM(2004)0708 – C6 0160/2004 – 2004/0248(COD))."
". Mr President, the proposed directive on pre-packaging seems to be a very technical dossier."
"However, in reality, it is part of the major policy initiative strongly supported by our institutions on better regulation and simplification."
"There is Community legislation on pre-packaging, but the current legal situation is neither satisfactory nor clear."
"In the European Union, we have a stable legal framework for wine and spirits, where, throughout the Community, products are sold in agreed quantities."
"For around 70 other products, current legislation has introduced voluntary harmonisation to which Member States have adopted different approaches."
"Member States such as Belgium or the Netherlands have deregulated package sizes altogether."
"In other countries, for instance Sweden, Community legislation on package sizes has been made optional for manufacturers."
"Other Member States have made regulation mandatory but only for home producers."
"Some national rules are entirely based on the existing optional Community directives, but in other countries, such as Germany, national rules are different from Community provisions."
"From a legal point of view, the situation is therefore quite confusing, to put it mildly."
"At the same time, products freely move from one country to another and consumers find a wealth of products on the market."
"Until now, no consumer has ever complained that there was an excess of choice."
"The proposal of the Commission intends to simplify the legal situation whilst leaving the benefit of free choice to consumers."
"The Commission is proposing a single legal framework to be implemented throughout the Union by all Member States."
"In substance, the Commission proposes to leave the free choice that consumers currently enjoy and to regulate package sizes only for a very limited number of sectors, in particular wines and spirits."
"The Commission notes that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection endorses this approach in principle."
"However, we have different views on the number of sectors that should become subject to the Community regulation fixing nominal quantities."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, and based on a wide consultation of consumers in all Member States and European Trade Federations, only the wine and spirits sectors should be regulated."
"However, on the basis of a prior commitment to Parliament, the Commission has also included in its proposal the regulation for soluble coffee and white sugar."
"Whilst supporting the overall approach, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection suggests that additional sectors should become subject to regulation, including drinking milk, butter, roasted coffee, dried pasta, rice and brown sugar."
"The Commission questions the justification for regulation in these sectors."
"European industry, with the exception of the coffee sector, is not in favour and consumers have not requested regulation that limits their choice."
"The proposed amendment would imply that a number of products that are placed on the market today would disappear."
"Furthermore, it would also mean that Member States that never had regulation or had abolished it would have to re-introduce regulation on package sizes."
"This is contrary to the political aims of better regulation and simplification and does not protect consumers."
"The Commission appreciates that the Parliament has carried out an impact assessment of these amendments."
"This initiative reflects the Commission’s common concern for better regulation and simplification."
"To conclude, in the Commission’s opinion, consumer protection today should not be based on limiting consumer choice, but should concentrate on providing correct information to consumers and on the prohibition of misleading practices, allowing consumers to make a well-informed and deliberate choice."
"It is fair to say that the Commission, as well as the European Court of Justice, takes as the benchmark the average consumer, reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant and circumspect."
"Vulnerable consumers do not become less vulnerable with rules on nominal quantities, but by better implemented existing Community law on consumer protection, such as labelling and the prohibition of deceptive packaging."
"The Commission is working with national authorities towards the better implementation of these Community rules in order to effectively improve the protection of vulnerable consumers."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report I am presenting on behalf on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has substantially changed the Commission proposal."
"It was adopted by 28 votes in favour, with one abstention."
"I propose accepting the deregulation of sizes, which is the Commission’s chosen solution in taking account of the case-law in the case."
"The Commission also proposes retaining mandatory ranges in some specific sectors: wines, spirits, soluble coffee and white sugar."
"The Commission calls for this derogation to be restricted to a period of 20 years."
"The members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection immediately questioned the relevance of the proposal and the quality of the impact study on which it is based."
"I was therefore led to propose that other basic products be subject to mandatory ranges. They are coffee, butter, rice, pasta and drinking milk."
"The ranges I propose are quite extensive in terms of intervals, not to mention the fact that, below the smallest size and above the largest, there are no restrictions whatsoever."
"I also propose that it be possible to review the arrangement in eight years’ time, and not in 20 years’ time as the Commission proposes."
"Why is the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection presenting you with this proposal?"
"Firstly, to protect the consumers, particularly those most vulnerable, such as the elderly and the partially sighted, who have far from fully understood the unit pricing laid down in 1998."
"Next, to take account of the independent impact study commissioned by our committee and confirming that deregulation would carry risks for the consumer and that it would not lead to greater competition between producers and distributors."
"Finally, because better lawmaking does not mean no lawmaking at all."
"As Lacordaire said in the 1830s: between the strong and the weak, it is liberty that oppresses and the law that sets free."
"You will see that this apparently insignificant and technical text enables us to ask important questions."
"To conclude, I will highlight three factors: an impact study that is funded by Parliament itself and that depends neither on the Commission nor on pressure groups, which is a first; a concept of ‘better lawmaking’ inspired only by the interests of our fellow citizens and not by an ideological attitude; and a concern to retain our national cultures, because our nations are very attached to their food traditions and to their consumption patterns."
". Mr President, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy applauds the Commission’s initiative to deregulate and liberalise package sizes."
"My committee considers that a free market works in the best interests of the consumer."
"We were persuaded to accept the Commission’s proposal to make exceptions for alcoholic beverages, soluble coffee, white sugar – we added brown sugar for consistency – and for aerosols."
"In the interests of consistency, we also proposed a regulated size for spirits bottles of 750 cl, which was the widely accepted size of wine bottles."
"It verges on the misleading to have 750 cl the standard bottle for wine and 700 cl the standard bottle for spirits."
"Therefore, we regret that this proposal was rejected by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"We appreciate that the Committee on the Internal Market and its very conscientious rapporteur, my good friend Mr Toubon, have considered these matters very thoroughly."
"However, we in the Committee on Industry are disappointed to see proposals from that committee to introduce fixed, harmonised, mandatory sizes on a whole range of staple products which have not previously been so harmonised."
"We have labelling requirements."
"We prohibit misleading advertising."
"EU legislation requires unit pricing so that the price for a standard amount must be displayed, and this helps consumers to compare prices fairly."
"The ability to decide freely on package sizes is in the interests of the smaller business, the new entrant, the innovative enterprise and, therefore, also in the interests of the consumer."
"There is nothing to stop marketing of traditional sizes; there is nothing to stop the use of traditional measures such as pints and pounds."
"The Commission proposal did not even mention milk."
"Nothing needed to change from the status quo."
"The Committee on Industry suggests that Parliament support the Commission’s praiseworthy attempt to reduce unnecessary regulation and vote against the Committee on the Internal Market’s proposed extension of mandatory sizes to all these extra products."
". Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Toubon on the work he has done and particularly to commend his approach, which has made the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection the first committee in Parliament to commission an impact assessment where we have chosen – in this case in the interests of consumers – to add to the burden of regulation that the Commission has proposed."
"That report is available to colleagues."
"It indicated that despite the fact that there would be more complexity, the economic analysis demonstrated that the competitive effects were comparatively small and accepted the view of the rapporteur that there were consumer benefits to offset it."
"There will be further discussions about it, but nevertheless I would not want this to go by without congratulating the Commission overall for the direction in which it is trying to take this."
"There is a vast range of other products apart from the exemptions that are included in this praiseworthy proposal, and we should not forget that when talking about some of the specific issues."
"As the Commissioner is well aware, in my own country, the United Kingdom, there has been a certain amount of entirely misleading controversy caused in the press about this proposal."
"I shall confine myself to commenting on that for the record this evening."
"First of all, on the assumption that we agree that drinking milk should be included, it is obviously extremely important that the traditional bottle sizes in which milk is delivered in the UK are fully protected."
"I am sure colleagues will accept that fully and thus deal with any issues about the loss of the traditional British ‘pinta’."
"Secondly, but more fundamentally, bread is a commodity that is regulated nationally under many specific regulations."
"In the UK, we consume very large amounts of pre-packed sliced bread and I think there is a very strong argument for exempting that from the regulation altogether and allowing Britain to sustain its current regulated pack sizes for this very important consumer commodity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Toubon, many thanks for the excellent report that you have just presented."
"To Mr Harbour, I would say that it is very important that we respect the cultures and traditions of the Member States."
"We should always do that in our legislation."
"I think my group will also support these amendments – that will not be a problem."
"Commissioner Verheugen, you have just said that we need better regulation and, above all, better implementation of Community law."
"I absolutely agree with you there, but I would also remind you that it is up to the Commission to ensure that Community law is actually implemented."
"I would ask you to be very strict on these issues, because I, as a European, want the decisions we make in Europe actually to be implemented."
"On the other hand, you also said that you take as the benchmark the average consumer, as does the European Court of Justice."
"That is understandable: we all need a point of reference to work from."
"As a social democrat, however, my benchmark in such cases is precisely those people who are not average, because they are disabled, because they are elderly, or because, for whatever reason, they are taking the various opportunities that are available in the Member States and are provided by companies."
"It is in these cases in particular that reliability when purchasing basic foodstuffs like bread and milk is especially important."
"That is why we must ensure that this reliability is maintained in our shops, and why we will agree to the rapporteur's proposals."
". Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Toubon for his commitment and the way he went about things, but also, and all, to express my gratitude to the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen for the proposal they have made for the drafting of better legislation and deregulation."
"It therefore strikes us as a little odd that Parliament should now respond with a host of exceptions."
"We in the Netherlands, a country that rejected the Constitutional Treaty, consider it unnecessary for Europe to get involved in matters such as the measure of coffee or milk, for that is what the internal market is for and measurements and products are subject to mutual recognition."
"We are therefore very unhappy about the additional exceptions or additional products that are now being included to qualify for harmonisation."
"We will therefore vote against those exceptions and if we cannot throw them out and cannot stick to the Commission proposal, we as Liberals will vote against the proposal as a whole, which we would regret, for this could ultimately set an example."
"I hope that we will not have to deal with this now and I hope that I will not, when I return to my own country, have to admit at some future referendum on the Constitutional Treaty that we in this Parliament do get involved in details, which should be left to the man and woman in the street."
"Legislation already clearly provides for the price per unit of litre or kilogramme for the benefit of the consumer."
"Since that is already incorporated in the price, I think we should not underestimate the European public, or patronise them and treat them like children or second-class citizens."
"I think we should have faith in the individuals who can make their own choices, and it is up to us to give them those choices."
"Similarly, it would be unfortunate, in my view, if we were to travel to other countries in Europe, as tourists or otherwise, and if we would no longer be able to enjoy the weights and measures that apply there, like, for example, the pint in the United Kingdom."
"It is unfortunate to my mind that we have not opted for better legislation and deregulation as the Commission proposed, and we regret the proposals for exceptions."
"Mr President, it is, in truth, not often that I am able to agree with the Commission concerning liberalisation projects, but this is a sensible form of liberalisation."
"I see that Mr Toubon has done some serious work and carried out an impact assessment, but that is not sufficient reason for issuing regulations at EU level."
"If a country wishes to regulate sizes of loaves and pasta, it can do so, but not at EU level."
"There is a danger of matters becoming rather ridiculous when the EU goes in for such things."
"What consumers expect is, of course, protection against dangerous additives and an overhaul of those additives that we do use."
"They also expect clear labelling, big enough to be read and in their own language, so that they understand which ingredients are included in the products concerned."
"The rules to combat misleading marketing cover those problems that consumers could come up against because of confusing pack sizes."
"It is that type of legislation that has a real impact on consumers’ needs."
"When it comes to alcohol, I agree with the Commission that that is another issue."
"In that area, it is a question of monitoring consumption in another way, and the existing rules and those proposed by the Commission are appropriate for doing so."
"There are reasons for having regulations in this sphere."
"I think that the proposal produced by the Commission, namely not to increase EU legislation, is a well-balanced one."
"Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, Mr Toubon, I wish to welcome the Commission’s proposal for deregulating packaging."
"I hope that continued debate will bring our own approach closer to that of the Commission, so that it is the consumer and not the politicians who choose."
"The rapporteur, Mr Toubon, has shown that he is ready and willing to accept my amendment rescuing Swedish milk packs, so that people can still have milk for their coffee at work."
"There are still things to be done in terms of deregulating butter and pasta and of having less detailed regulation generally."
"It would be bad for competition and for consumers if we were to make matters worse for small and medium-sized enterprises and to use political measures to give market shares to the big conglomerates."
"Those of us who come from a small country cannot accept the report in that form."
"We have had enough of debates about cucumbers and strawberries."
"Let us avoid a debate about ‘milk-snatching’ and go on negotiating with a view to obtaining greater freedom for the consumer."
"A lot remains to be done before this matter has been satisfactorily concluded."
"Mr President, for many countries, Mr Toubon’s changes to the Commission’s proposal mean new rules being laid down at EU level for an already functioning market."
"We Swedish Social Democrats do not believe that the rapporteur’s amendments involve any benefit for consumers."
"On the contrary. If the rapporteur’s approach were to meet with sympathy, it would involve major conversion costs for many European companies, and this without the groups we say we represent even needing or necessarily even desiring the changes."
"For example, the Swedish Consumers’ Association, which works actively with quite a few cooperation groups and associations on precisely these issues to do with packaging, has, on the basis of our contacts with the Association, never heard any wishes expressed concerning fixed pack sizes."
"Moreover, the EU’s institutions would not be complying with their ambition to improve the quality of legislation by avoiding detailed regulation."
"We Swedish Social Democrats have nothing against making stringent demands of businesses with a view to their achieving better consumer protection. On the contrary."
"As has been pointed out, however, the regulations are, in this case, unnecessary, and we shall therefore vote against the report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"I welcome this report on rules of nominal quantities for pre-packaged products."
"I am in favour of retaining specific quantities for staple foods as I believe it is important to maintain nominal quantities in the interest of the British consumer."
"The report preserves essential parts of existing legislation and, in particular, removes the unjustified attempt by the Commission to abolish fixed sizes within 20 years."
"Given the complexity of ‘unit pricing’, such protection laws will ensure that the current sale of the British pint of milk is not put at risk."
"Contrary to inaccurate Eurosceptic scare-stories that have caused much controversy amongst consumers, British consumer choice is protected."
"The next item is the debate on the Commission communication on the European Communication Strategy – White Paper."
". Mr President, I should like to thank you and the honourable Members for being here this early morning."
"Thank you for giving me the opportunity to present to you the White Paper on a European communication policy adopted by the Commission at its meeting yesterday."
"This is not the first time I have spoken about the White Paper in this House."
"I first announced it during the debate on the Herrero report, which has been an important reference for my subsequent work."
"During the preparation stages for the White Paper I regularly informed the European Parliament about my ideas, meeting with the different political groups, committees etc., and I am sure that several of you will find the key concepts and messages of the White Paper quite familiar."
"The feedback and encouragement I have received make me believe that I will continue to find, in this House, the most committed and precious ally when it comes to communication."
"Communication is first and foremost a matter of democracy."
"People have a right to know what the European Union does and what it stands for, and as citizens they have a right to fully participate in the European project."
"This is the key message of the White Paper."
"There is a worrying gap between the European Union and its citizens."
"Seven out of ten interviewed in Eurobarometer polls say that they know little or nothing about the European Union."
"More than half feel that their voice does not count when it comes to European issues."
"Trust in the European institutions is falling and so is the number of those who believe that Europe brings benefits to them or their countries."
"The perception of a communication gap between the European Union and its citizens is not new."
"It has been a subject of discussion in EU circles at least since the referendums that preceded the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992."
"In this respect recent referendums on the constitutional treaty have been a harsh wake-up call."
"Bridging the gap between the European Union and its citizens has become more urgent than ever."
"To move forward, the European project needs to be anchored in people’s wishes and expectations."
"It must belong to citizens, not just to a small elite based in Brussels, or in a couple of big European capitals."
"The White Paper is the Commission’s proposal to respond to this challenge and to lay the foundation of a European Union communication policy."
"What should the main purpose of a European communication policy be?"
"The White Paper argues for developing a working European public sphere, where the European debate can unfold and citizens can participate."
"This is a concept that the European Parliament embraced some time ago, and it is now central to the Commission’s vision of a communication policy."
"The White Paper underlines the importance of developing a true European political culture, with pan-European political groups, pan-European media and fora or meeting places where citizens can meet and discuss issues of common interest."
"However, I shall clarify immediately that all of this is not to replace or diminish the role of national, regional or local levels of political structures and media activity; to the contrary, it complements them."
"Probably the most urgent thing that is needed to bring about a European political culture is to make sure that European issues are reflected in national, regional and local debates."
"The development of a European public sphere is of course a very far-reaching project and it will take time."
"It goes well beyond the remit of the Commission."
"The role of the European Parliament will be crucial in this respect, but we know that we will only succeed if all those involved – and Member States, in the first place – are ready to commit and take responsibility."
"Therefore, the White Paper is a call to action by all EU institutions, by the European Union governments and political parties, by civil society and the media in all EU countries."
"It proposes that we start work in five main areas: first by defining common principles."
"An EU communication policy must be based on the fundamental recognition that all EU citizens have certain rights, for example, the right to fair and full information about the European Union; the right to hear the full range of views about the EU; and the right to have their voices heard by policy makers."
"The White Paper proposes that these principles be enshrined in a framework document – a charter or perhaps a code of conduct – to which all the key players would commit themselves on a voluntary basis to agree on the principles for communication."
"We need those common principles to guide our common action and to give credibility and legitimacy to our communication activities; to make clear that EU communication is not about selling Europe or producing propaganda, it is about enhancing our democracy."
"It is a tool for citizens to assess whether or not their rights are respected."
"The second work area the White Paper proposes is empowering citizens."
"How can an EU communication policy contribute to that?"
"The White Paper identifies three ways forward: to work more together on civic education, to connect citizens with each other and to connect the citizens with the institutions."
"Civic education is a national or regional responsibility, but there is a European added value."
"The EU can help to ensure exchange of best practice and facilitate the development of common educational tools, so that the European dimension is better addressed."
"I meet this all the time when I travel to Member States. Teachers and all those involved in these activities say ‘do we really have to reinvent the wheel?"
"Could we not have a better exchange of practices or material or experience?’"
"New forums for public discussion on European issues are essential for building mutual trust, respect and willingness to work together towards common objectives."
"Also, good two-way communication between the citizens and public institutions is essential in a healthy democracy."
"The present drive to make the EU institutions more responsive, open and accessible needs to continue to be strengthened."
"The third area in which the paper proposes working concerns the media and new technologies."
"The media are key players in communication policy and it is vital that public institutions at all levels of governance find innovative ways of working with the national, regional and local media."
"We also need to discuss together how to ensure that all views are fairly represented in these debates and how we can provide citizens with full, fair and factual information through a wide range of channels, not only the press, radio and television but also the internet."
"One of the proposals is also, as you have seen from the media coverage already, is that we should upgrade our existing Europe by Satellite – an interinstitutional service – and, for example, regional TV, which belongs to the users of the EBS service."
"The fourth working area is understanding public opinion."
"That is a challenge for policy makers."
"They need to stay in tune with European public opinion as citizens’ views on any issue can vary quite dramatically from one country or region to another."
"The European Commission has been a front-runner in developing modern tools, such as the Eurobarometer surveys, for analysing public opinion."
"Our White Paper encourages debate on how we could improve our use of these tools to make more in-depth analysis and use that more efficiently to feed into the policy-making process."
"The fifth area for joint discussion is how to make the partnership work: we call it ‘how to do the job together’."
"How can EU governments cooperate more closely with one another and with Brussels on informing and consulting citizens?"
"How can the European Union institutions work together more effectively and do more to decentralise their efforts?"
"Local and regional authorities are well placed to engage in a real dialogue with citizens."
"How best can they channel the view of local communities to the Brussels policy makers?"
"What more can political parties and NGOs do to raise public awareness on European issues and stimulate public debate?"
"The Commission does not have ready-made answers to all these questions and we would not presume to lecture others involved as to what they should do."
"The White Paper therefore launches a wide consultation process and invites all those involved to think hard about these questions and come forward with their own ideas."
"We have never had a public consultation on communicating Europe."
"It is high time to do so if we are serious about putting citizens at the centre of our activities."
"I would like the European Parliament to be our closest ally and supporter in this process."
"The structures for this cooperation already exist and we can build on them to better structure and coordinate our work."
"To conclude, I should like to quote the philosopher John Dewey. He wrote ‘there is more than a verbal tie between the words common, community, and communication."
"Try the experiment of communicating, with fullness and accuracy, some experience to another, especially if it be somewhat complicated, and you will find your own attitude towards your experience changing’."
"Communication helps understanding, builds common values and creates communities."
"That is what the European Union needs more than anything."
"Thank you for your attention."
"I am looking forward to hearing your views."
". Commissioner Wallström, I thank you for your very interesting and well-communicated White Paper this morning."
"On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I very much welcome your White Paper on a European communication policy."
"It comes at a time when the gap between Europe and its citizens is widening."
"A sense of alienation from Brussels pervades our electorate: alienation from its institutions and from politics in general."
"The poor electoral turnout in 2004 was sadly a clear reminder of the need for the EU to learn to communicate more with its citizens."
"However, it is not only a question of having communication in Europe: we need communication."
"And in order to communicate better, Europe also needs to listen more."
"European leaders have lost contact with their public and I agree with you, Commissioner, when you say in your communication that citizens expect Europe to offer them guarantees of prosperity, solidarity and security in the face of globalisation."
"Our citizens are not worried about the nitty gritty details of institutional reform, they are worried about their jobs, they are worried about Europe’s 20 million unemployed, so I certainly very much support your new approach which moves away from one-way communication to reinforced dialogue, from a Brussels-based to a more decentralised approach, from – as you say in your communication – institution-centred to citizen-centred communication."
"I have certainly tried to do this in Scotland, in my own constituency."
"I started an essay competition amongst schools to try to inspire interest amongst school pupils in European affairs."
"Indeed tomorrow I am going to Aberdeen to address council leaders on the financial perspective, and that is European communication in action."
"However, you must ensure that this White Paper does not merely remain a consultation exercise, inconsequential and detached from the very same people whom it is trying to reach."
"We in Europe tend to be very good at debating, and less good at delivering."
"Our ideas must be followed by action."
"I wondered, when you mentioned the importance of the Erasmus and Citizens for Europe programmes as a way of bridging the gap between the EU and its citizens, whether this is not slightly contradictory, given the fact that these programmes have actually suffered significant cuts in the 2006 budget."
"We may need better understanding and more details on how exactly you intend to finance this massive public relations strategy."
"Communication, transparency, open access to documents and involvement in policy-making are not even fully developed amongst ourselves, the MEPs, the EU’s representatives."
"This House represents the very people we are trying to communicate with, but sadly this Parliament is not consulted enough, or often when it is too late."
"It is often not listened to, it is often contradicted by the unaccountable and impenetrable workings of the Council."
"That is why, Commissioner, while welcoming very much your objectives and your efforts I urge you to consider adding another ‘D’ to your Dialogue, Debate and Democracy plan."
"That would be ‘D’ for Decision: a decision to act."
". Mr President, we are right to be concerned about the European Union’s communication problems and we are right, as the title of this White Paper puts it, to be debating Europe and to be involving people."
"The diagnosis is clear and the White Paper is detailed in its prescriptions for dealing with the problem."
"I wish to thank the Commissioner warmly for the efforts she has invested in taking us this far in addressing this crucial problem."
"We will be discussing many of the group proposals in detail later."
"I would like to use this opportunity to make some general remarks about communications in general."
"In communications less is more."
"The essence of good communication is to put a strong message in simple language."
"We need to explain to the people what we are doing and why it matters to them."
"Once they know that their interests are affected by our decisions, they will take care of the public sphere themselves."
"The White Paper seeks investment in mechanisms, procedures and new technology to facilitate the channels of communication."
"That is a good thing, but it does not address the quality of what is to be sent down those channels of communication."
"It talks about connecting the citizens and about public-sphere debating."
"That is acceptable to us."
"However, before people do any of this, they have to care."
"Only then can they be empowered."
"We have to show them why they should care about what the European Union is doing."
"The responsibility in dealing with those problems lies with us all – all the institutions – and not only with the press room downstairs."
"Partnership is, therefore, also an important concept put forward in the White Paper."
"As I said, it would be good to invest in new websites and our own TV channels, but we already have the world’s largest group of accredited correspondents on our doorstep: 1300 journalists who are hungry to report good-quality stories to audiences all over the world."
"If we produced timely and newsworthy stories for journalists, then the headlines, websites, new TV channels and public-sphere debates will follow."
"However, the reality is that most of our communication efforts are foundering because the EU fails on the basic issues."
"The EU offers one-size-fits-all news announcements instead of making more strenuous efforts to find new messages to capture the interest of specific media groups in our different countries and regions."
"Quite rightly, the White Paper places some emphasis on opinion polling and the need to understand European public opinion."
"But if it uses this resource correctly, why does the Commission persist in coming forward with such deeply unpopular proposals like the port services directive that we dealt with a month ago?"
"The White Paper talks about the need to listen to the people, and rightly so."
"Here was a case of the Commission not even listening to its own Parliament, never mind the people."
"On that point, it is not enough to say that Europe needs to listen to the people: it also needs to act on what they say."
"What is the incentive for people to talk to us in Brussels if they have no assurance that what they say will matter or change what we are thinking of doing?"
"I welcome this White Paper because it is kick-starting a much-needed debate."
"This House should welcome the Commissioner’s important contribution."
"We in the European Parliament must play our part in ensuring that the European Union develops with the support of its citizens and that it serves their interests in the best possible way."
". Your communication on the White Paper started off very well, Mrs Wallström, inasmuch as I read on the first page that communication goes hand-in-hand with its content."
"I therefore expected to find a political analysis of what is causing the breakdown in relations that everyone – you, us, everybody – can see taking place between Europeans and the European institutions."
"In that regard, I admit to being very disappointed because the self-criticism goes no further than the sentence I just uttered."
"In your opinion, we just need to speak more positively about Europe and that will quite obviously restore Europeans’ erstwhile confidence in their institutions and the Community project."
"Can one seriously claim, however, that the liberal objectives fully embraced by Mr Barroso’s team do not have some bearing on everything that is – rightly – worrying EU citizens?"
"It is true that you point out certain lines to pursue in your document."
"It contains some attractive formulas: decentralisation, participation and culture."
"Over and above those terms, though, what is there of any substance in it?"
"I get the impression that you mistake communication for dialogue."
"Democracy is not just about communication; above all it is about the genuine involvement of nations via their institutions."
"When Mr Barroso says to us at the end of summer: ‘I have got the message, I am withdrawing the texts on which there is no consensus’, and withdraws dozens of them but retains the Services Directive, I feel as though I did not campaign for the same thing as him in the referendum, and that is something I cannot countenance."
"For my part, I did not feel that the Directive on the Protection of Workers posed a problem, unlike the Services Directive, which poses some problems in practice."
"It is not enough to dress up the policies; they perhaps need changing."
"I have the impression that your approach is quite technocratic and elitist."
"Erasmus is a fantastic programme but, as the previous speaker said, it does not have a huge bearing on the nations because we do not have the resources for it to do so."
"Saying that we are relying on new technologies, which are seemingly the answer to everything, is perhaps tantamount to believing that multiplying the number of websites will be sufficient to deal with the problems arising from people’s opinion of the EU - problems that we are, moreover, aware of."
"Do we really need to relaunch a whole series of Eurobarometer surveys to know that our citizens’ concerns are to do with relocations, social precarity, uncertainty, the health crisis and environmental upheaval?"
"I am almost certain that Eurobarometer is going to reveal to you what I have just told you in a single sentence."
"What resources are you putting in place in the face of these anxieties?"
"When I was draftsman for the Prince Programme in the framework of the 2005 budget, I recall that the Commission had proposed splitting the funds for this programme in half, and that was after the shock of the double ‘No’ vote on the draft Constitution."
"It was Parliament, in this Chamber, that subsequently multiplied the funds by six."
"Commissioner, your intentions are laudable but, once again, so long as you do not specify what you want to gain support for at political level, there will be no point in working on the packaging, on the little bow that you are going to wrap around it: reviewing one’s communication is a good idea, but reviewing one’s policy is a better idea."
"Mr President, my dear Margot, underlying your fine words is the fact that the EU’s propaganda department would like to have more money for additional propaganda."
"More journalists are to be employed to tout their own virtues, and a fresh news agency is to be set up so that you can decide what the media are to write about the EU and so that you can provide each new item of news with an easily understood message, extolling the EU."
"The Commission does not need a communication policy. What it needs is transparency and democracy."
"It should start by opening the accounts to parliamentary scrutiny."
"Give the EU’s auditors access to all expenditure so that they can monitor this."
"Publish the names of those who are paid to give good advice in the Commission’s secret working parties."
"Open the drawer containing letters of formal notice, so that voters and elected representatives can see which aspects of our laws the Commission does not like."
"Tell us who in the Commission is voting for what. Are there, for example, Commissioners who have opposed Mrs Wallström’s communication plan or Mr Kallas’s Transparency Initiative."
"It is better to have transparency, democracy and proximity to the people than to have more money for public relations."
". Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for your valuable views on the White Paper."
"First of all, action must follow."
"If we talk about reaching out to citizens we cannot cut down on the programmes where we actually do just that."
"On this point, we have exactly the same position as the European Parliament as far as I understand."
"We want a budget which hopefully is increased and definitely not reduced."
"This is also our position in the ongoing budget negotiations."
"We will make our views absolutely clear on that."
"We certainly hold the same position on that issue."
"Mr Wiersma, I think you made a very valid point, because this is also about the participation of citizens."
"I have repeated that democracy is not just a spectator sport."
"It requires an engagement from citizens, but they also have to be able to acquire the basic knowledge about what is going on and how to exert influence."
"There is therefore also an obligation on us to make sure that there is access, for example, to civic education, where one can learn how it all works and how one can have a voice in this process."
"I think the services directive is a very good example of how simply telling the story does not help if the basis is not there, if the consultation has not been carried out."
"In the end we will have nobody advocating the proposal."
"I think that this is an example of where we really have to do the repair work."
"This is about engaging citizens."
"Yesterday, one of my colleagues at a Commission meeting said that when the Commission consulted children about a proposal on children’s rights, the proposal which came back had been completely turned around."
"Children have another order of priorities."
"We learned a lot from that consultation process."
"This is what it is all about."
"It is about the ethics of communication."
"It cannot be disconnected from the policy because communication can only be as good as its content."
"It has to be about the policy content, what we want to do to change the reality of things."
"However, we also have to clarify which rules and attitudes towards democracy and democratic procedure we adopt."
"We must also clarify how communication and the ethics of communication are an essential tool in helping us."
"That is what we are establishing here: the tools, framework and procedures that enable us to communicate, to have a two-way dialogue with citizens."
"That is what we are trying to build here."
"You are correct to ask about the budget."
"We are only asking for a few more staff to help during the whole consultation period."
"It is too early to say what we need for the concrete proposals because we are carrying out consultations about that."
"We have to come back on the specific proposals and action plans with proper impact assessments, budgets and concrete figures."
"For the moment, we are only setting the consultation period and putting that in place."
"When I heard Mr Bonde’s description, I wondered whether we had been reading the same document."
"I have to respond to the whole issue of a press agency and this is partly a language issue."
"We have never had any other idea than to upgrade the service that exists today within the Directorate-General for Communications."
"It is called ‘Europe by Satellite’."
"We have very few people to carry out the service that provides pictures and sound for radio and television all over Europe."
"We do it in 20 languages."
"If we want to have better quality and more facts and figures and to better cover what happens in the Council, Parliament and the Commission, then we will need more staff and equipment."
"As I said earlier, this is how we help regional television or radio stations that cannot afford to send correspondents to Brussels."
"If we are serious about providing that inside, interinstitutional information, then we need the people to do it."
"In the end, we will need a highly professional person to decide what is most interesting from a journalistic point of view: should we send out a team to Parliament today, or should it be in another place covering a different story?"
"We already do that, but with very few resources."
"This does not conflict with the web-TV that Parliament has already decided to invest in, which covers what happens inside the institution, but complements efforts to better communicate with citizens."
"This has been the idea from the outset."
"The Brussels-based journalists are not happy."
"They see a risk of competition."
"I see very little competition in covering press conferences in 20 languages."
"I do not think this is a problem."
"However, everybody is trying to cover their territory."
"We have to be realistic."
"If we want the stories out there, at local and regional level and on radio and TV – which are the sources that most of our citizens use today to get information about what happens in the EU – then we need to invest in radio and TV. We are the only ones who can provide these pictures and sounds from inside the institutions."
"Nobody will be competing with us on that."
"This is what we want to do with our proposal in the White Paper."
"There was no vote on this."
"We have discussions and very rarely vote in the Commission."
"During the whole five years of the Prodi Commission we held votes only about five or ten times."
"So there was no vote, but strong support for my White Paper."
"I am glad to be able to tell you that."
"This is not only about voting."
"You are right in saying that we must tell the citizens that this is another political arena and that political discussion is crucial."
"We need to debate."
"We will have different ideological viewpoints on issues and the discussion will go on in the European arena."
"We have to help citizens to be able to follow and understand what goes on and to have a say."
"You will find some ideas on how to do that in our White Paper."
"Finally, I agree with Mr Hammerstein Mintz."
"I hope we will see a pilot project where Council meetings will become open."
"This is also a way to end the blame game, where the institutions blame each other."
"In the end it is the citizens who lose out, because they are unable to follow or judge what is going on and what their ministers say in the Council."
"I agree that Council meetings should be open and citizens should be able to follow them."
"We will contribute whatever we can to make that possible."
"It is also the Commission’s position that openness and transparency are absolutely crucial in the context of improving communications."
"The debate is closed."
"While listening to this debate yet again I am struck by the extent to which it is the wrong question we are asking, and hence coming up with the wrong answer."
"The Commission’s communication strategy is worthy enough in aim, but I doubt it will in fact achieve much because the reality of the EU as a whole, not just the workings of the Commission itself, are very far from ideal."
"The people are accordingly sceptical, it is not that they misunderstand the EU, they understand it only too well."
"We have an old saying in Scotland that you cannot polish a turnip and no amount of presentation will disguise the fact that the EU has a structural problem which we are not addressing."
"The institutional mechanisms of, and subject matter dealt with by the various parts of the EU must be addressed in the light of enlargement, or risk continued stagnation."
"Only real reform will bring the EU closer to the citizen and it is upon that reform we should concentrate."
"The next item is the joint debate on the reports by Mr Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism,"
"- on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on minimum conditions for the implementation of Council Regulations (EEC) Nos 3820/85 and 3821/85 concerning social legislation relating to road transport activities and repealing Directive 88/599/EEC (PE-CONS 3672/2/2005 – C6 0417/2005 – 2003/0255(COD)) (A6-0005/2006), and"
"- on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport and amending Council Regulations (EEC) No 3821/85 and (EC) No 2135/98 and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85 (PE-CONS 3671/3/2005 – C6 0416/2005 – 2001/0241(COD)) (A6-0006/2006)"
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was in September 2001 that the Commission adopted the new White Paper entitled ‘European Transport Policy for 2010 – Time to Decide’, in which the prospects for development until that date were sketched out, and in which the Commission proposed some 60 different measures and an action programme with the main aim of making transport safer."
"Its presentation of the dossier we are debating today – on driving times and drivers’ rest periods and the associated directive on the monitoring of compliance with the conditions imposed by the first directive – did, of course, offer a good opportunity to turn good intentions into practical policies."
"It follows that the main question to ask when assessing what came out of the committee for conciliation between the Council and Parliament is whether the goals we have set ourselves have been achieved, the first of those being the improvement and harmonisation of professional drivers’ working conditions, the second being improved road safety and the third the creation of fair conditions under which all interested parties compete."
"I will now proceed to set out the most important consequences of this compromise."
"The first is that the time driven must not exceed nine hours in any given day, the second that it must not exceed 56 hours in a week and must not result in the maximum working time specified in the Working Time Directive being exceeded."
"Thirdly, total driving time over a period of two weeks must not exceed 90 hours."
"Fourthly, the regular daily rest period is equivalent to eleven hours, either consecutively or divided into two periods of three and nine hours respectively."
"This is in response to the desire for more flexibility expressed by the drivers, who will be able to use the rest periods in very different ways in the different climate conditions that prevail in winter and summer respectively."
"The fifth point is that the regulated rest time in a given week is fixed at a minimum of 45 hours, and the sixth that the report introduces the digital tachograph, thereby making possible extended and improved monitoring of compliance with the regulations."
"Seventhly, there are clear rules on the hauliers’ liability."
"Eighthly, the prescribed checking sample has been increased to 2% starting in 2008 and to 3% from 2010 onwards."
"The ninth point I want to make is that the checks must be carried out not only on the road but also on the company’s premises."
"One can readily observe, from a comparison between the documents under consideration and those that formerly applied, that in no respect whatever have conditions been made worse."
"If, however, one weighs in the balance the results achieved with our initial conception of how things would turn out, one does come to a different conclusion in respect of certain of them."
"Let me give you a few examples, the first being that the regulation does not apply to vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes in weight, even though such vehicles are used to carry goods on more and more journeys, and are involved in more and more accidents."
"The second is that there are only two references to the Working Time Directive, yet compliance with its provisions is not monitored at the same time as compliance with the rules on driving times and rest periods."
"I do not believe that this goes anything like far enough to guarantee that drivers will be less likely to become over-tired or that it will be less likely that the maximum times will be exceeded, or that these things will not happen at all."
"Thirdly, although the annex to the monitoring directive includes a definition of what is meant by an offence against the regulation, this is not harmonised in any legally binding way."
"Fourthly, no provision is made for harmonised sanctions, with the consequence that the Member States can still impose different penalties for the same offence."
"All these things considered, it can certainly be said that we have, together, come up with plenty of flexible solutions, and we do of course hope that this legislation will, during the planned period of two years, find its way into the new AETR and thus become applicable to those states that are not members of the European Union, but whose vehicles do use the EU’s roads, so that equality of competition may be established across the board."
"As most of you know, I, in the conciliation committee, voted against the compromise we had achieved, and I did so out of the conviction that this House could have achieved more and that our majority on the committee was too hasty in calling a halt to negotiations with the Council."
"That being so, I can very definitely understand that there will be those taking part in today’s vote who are not among the advocates of this compromise."
"Although most of those affected by the regulation and the directive are not exactly jumping for joy, an absolute majority of them have expressed their support for the adoption of these two dossiers, and my vote will reflect that."
"Finally, I would ask the Commission to do three things: firstly, to commission a study on the traffic patterns of goods vehicles under 3.5 tonnes, for I live in hope of a different kind of lobbyism and of our being able to incorporate these categories, too, in the directive at a later date."
"Secondly, I would ask them to help coordinate the various bodies that monitor driving times, rest times and working times, and, thirdly, to organise, together with the Member States and the social partners, seminars on this new legislation in order to get it implemented as soon as possible."
"I would like to conclude by extending the warmest thanks to all those who worked with me on this dossier over many years – from the Committee, primarily Mr Hauck and Mr Darmis – and also the shadow rapporteurs."
"We all worked together very well in a way that was rather unusual, but did turn out to be worth it."
"I would also like to thank our Vice-President Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, who conducted the conciliation proceedings with a firm hand, and Mr Tziorkas, the official responsible for our case."
"I hope that the digital tachograph will soon be introduced and that the Member States will make the driver cards available, so that we will then have made some progress in bringing a bit more social justice, safety and fair competition onto the European Union’s roads."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the substantial development of road transport during the last twenty years has led the Commission to present two texts."
"The first is a proposal for a regulation drafted in 2001 aimed at simplifying, clarifying and updating a regulation well-known among drivers – number 3820/85 – which stipulates driving times, rest periods and breaks for the latter."
"The second is a proposal for a directive drafted in 2003 aimed at replacing a directive dating from 1988."
"This proposal for a directive guarantees a minimum level of checks with regard to driving times and rest periods in the road transport sector."
"We all worked with the aim of finalising this package on 6 December 2005, following a long and difficult negotiating process that will have lasted over two years."
"The conciliation committee finally reached an agreement."
"Parliament did a great deal to help move this matter forward, and I should like to congratulate the chairman of your delegation, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, to whom Mr Markov was keen to pay tribute."
"I should also like to pay special tribute to the work of Mr Markov, Mr Grosch and Mr Piecyk and of the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, who paid a great deal of attention to the issues and who obtained real progress with regard to the text of the Council’s common position."
"A compromise was reached on two-thirds of Parliament’s amendments concerning the regulation and on more than half of Parliament’s amendments concerning the directive."
"I will take the example of the introduction of a Community system designed to establish a common and precise classification of offences according to their seriousness."
"Harmonisation of this kind will enable us to clarify the obligations imposed by the rules, from the point of view both of industry and of inspectors throughout the whole of Europe."
"I stress ‘the whole of Europe’ and not just the European Union."
"Thanks to Parliament’s insistence, the Council and the Commission committed themselves to ensuring that the AETR Agreement can be ratified by the other European countries, including Russia, and this within two years."
"It is true that we did not manage to include control of working time in the scope of the new directive."
"I can, however, assure you that the Commission will do everything in its power to ensure that the working time directive is applied in full."
"On 19 December, the Commission also sent ten reasoned opinions to the Member States that had not yet notified full transposition of this directive."
"Moreover, the conciliation procedure has enabled further progress to be made."
"This legislative package is going to bring about a number of benefits and advances with regard to the current situation."
"I am certain of that."
"I will mention a few examples: clear and simple limits in relation to weekly driving times, which make the text easier to understand and, of course, enable us more effectively to monitor whether it is being complied with; a clear and explicit commitment in favour of harmonising the information systems, the technical features of the equipment, the classification of risks and the interpretation of rules; and finally, of course, the increase in controls, the extraterritoriality of penalties and accountability throughout the transport chain."
"I should again like to stress, Mr President, that this progress has for the most part been obtained thanks to Parliament’s interventions."
"On the ground, the checks will be more coordinated and more effective."
"It is not only a question of increasing them, but also of making them more effective."
"One final word on the digital tachograph."
"I should like to tell Parliament, in this Chamber this morning, just how useful it would be if the texts in question were approved because they are going to enable us to bring into effect the use of the digital tachograph."
"Parliament has agreed with the Council on a cut-off date for its introduction. Parliament and the Council have concluded a joint declaration on this matter."
"In anticipation of your agreement on the legislative package, I pointed out to the Transport Ministers from all the Member States, on 12 January 2006, that I, for my part, accepted extending the grace period until the cut-off date."
"I made this gesture in order to prevent any misunderstandings."
"However, it is clear that, over and above the date desired by the legislator – that is to say, by Parliament – any new lorry not equipped with the digital tachograph will risk incurring immediate penalties imposed by the national authorities, such as the vehicle being taken off the road."
"Mr Markov, you questioned me on three points."
"I should like to make it clear to you that the Commission immediately got down to work in order to provide you with the answers you are awaiting."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I dare to hope that you will be able to endorse the outcome of this conciliation procedure and that, together, we will finally be able to close this matter more than two years after the Commission put forward its proposal."
"It would be a great pity if we were to hold up the progress contained in these texts, progress that will therefore be able, thanks to your vote, to be applied in the European Union."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been through the conciliation procedure, the very name of which indicates that its purpose is to seek out compromises."
"It would be going too far for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – or anyone else, for that matter – to claim that the result is all that we would have hoped for."
"The essential question as regards the work that has been done on this at every level is whether this dossier is going in the right direction, whether certain goals we had set ourselves have been achieved."
"The answer I can give to that, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, is very definitely in the affirmative."
"We regard driving times and drivers’ rest periods as a safety issue, and anything that highlights or improves safety as a step in the right direction, and it is for that reason that I would like to thank the rapporteur, the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and also the Commission, for I do believe that all of them – different though their expectations may have been – were working together with one end in mind."
"In that respect, we have done a good job."
"This is an important forward step in that it has involved us analysing the vital measures to be taken at European level in relation to those countries whose vehicles also travel on European roads."
"We had, of course, expected rather more of that, but we have to bear in mind what is possible, and if we have got so far as to get, tomorrow, 42 countries – 25 EU Member States plus the other European states – to accept such things through the AETR agreement, then we have sent a clear message to the outside world where safety is concerned, for safety is what driving times and rest periods are all about, and that means the safety not just of drivers, but of all other road users too."
"We have also simplified and clarified certain terms."
"It was a curious experience to discover that, even though we were talking about driving times and rest periods in road transport, nobody had ever defined what is meant by ‘driving time’."
"We also, though, did more important things than that, in that we made it quite plain that the whole time spent either driving or resting must be capable of being monitored."
"More might, of course, have been expected, but the stipulation that sleeping time adds up to 9 hours plus 3, or 9 hours as such, then that is by far preferable to the 8 + 1 + 1 + 1 that applied before."
"I think that the proposals that the Council made in this respect were quire right too."
"A driver knows how much of a break he has to take after four and a half hours, whether it be 15 or 30 minutes, without all the rules that applied hitherto."
"Speaking as one who comes from a border area, I can say that you only have to imagine the thousands of people who are using the roads, speaking different languages, with different ways of expressing themselves, and so there have to be people to keep tabs on them all."
"Where the journey recorders are concerned, we still have the old model of oral contact, with someone having to ask: what is actually meant by what the recorder says?"
"Making these things capable of being checked – so that both the driver and the person doing the checking know what is coming to them – is, as I see it, a really important advance."
"I think we have made a few things in this connection abundantly clear."
"There is a whole lengthy story behind the tachograph itself."
"We had already asked a few questions on behalf of the Commission, but we would have preferred to have wrapped up the whole business with the digital journey recorder as long ago as August 2004."
"I have to say, though, Commissioner, that your clear statements over the past weeks sent a clear message to the outside world."
"It matters not so much whether this is done one year earlier or later; what matters is that the Commission should make it clear that those who have not got it fixed by a given date, those who have not fitted these new journey recorders into new vehicles, will have problems in their own country and problems with their business operations."
"I take it as read that you too will do the work you have announced and say that there will be no more indulgence."
"It would be not only a pity but would also send the wrong message if the countries that have done what needs to be done were to end up indirectly penalising their businesses as a result of the countries that have failed to do so getting away with it – and we know which countries have not done their preparatory work."
"I am much obliged to the Commissioner for, as I see it, sending a clear signal that our primary concern, where driving times and rest periods are concerned, is with safety followed in second place by unfair competition."
"It is because of these two dimensions that the whole transport sector is united in backing initiatives of this kind, for it is not acceptable that, tomorrow, it should be those, in this industry, who do not abide by the law who earn the most money."
"With the backing of the majority, all countries will eventually take the same approach."
"That brings me to the second point I want to make, which is that we, in this House, can draft – and, indeed, adopt – the best of directives, but that is pointless if there is no willingness or desire in the Member States to monitor them in a systematic manner."
"I would go so far as to say that I am convinced that there are many areas in which we have no need of lots of new legislation; what we need is simplification, along with, in some cases, a certain tightening up of the scope for interpretation, so that the people in the various countries know what to expect."
"Even the best of directives will be futile without the possibility of monitoring and equally applied sanctions."
"That being so, I would also like to thank the Commission, which will take the initiative in dealing with serious misdemeanours."
"We will do this on a consensus basis."
"I would, in any case, ask that those who are not members of the PPE-DE Group should also acknowledge this result as being what I believe it to be – a step forwards."
". Mr President, our adoption today of the regulation on driving and rest times will without doubt be a step forward in that the daily minimum will be increased, the maximum permitted driving time reduced, the digital tachograph introduced with the intention that manipulations be prevented and it be made possible to check the past 28 days, and, not least, the length of the journey – in terms both of distance and the time taken on it – to the place of assignment will now be counted as working time."
"All these things count as progress, and that is to the credit not least of our rapporteur, Mr Markov, who, right up to the very end of the process, has endeavoured splendidly to represent this House’s views, and it is for that reason that most of my group will be voting in favour."
"It has to be said, though, that there is one serious reason why I shall not be voting in favour of the conciliation result, and that is the Council’s refusal to allow it to be coupled with the Working Time Directive."
"Despite many offers of compromise on the part of Parliament, the Council has not found it possible to make concessions on this front."
"The driver’s working time does, however, include all his other duties, such as loading and unloading, repairs, filling in forms, all of which are tiring and therefore have a direct effect on safety on the road."
"It is for that reason that compliance with the working time directive must be monitored as well as driving and rest times checked up on."
"That is why it has to be possible for offences against the working time directive to be prosecuted and to incur sanctions."
"The Council was not able to do that, and it also owes us an explanation for that."
"It took a week for the reason for the Council’s refusal to become clear, when it turned out that ten Member States have not, to date, transposed the Working Time Directive at all, even though the deadline for them to do so expired in March 2005."
"The ten Member States in question are Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain."
"It is no wonder that the Council refused to allow it to be coupled with another piece of legislation."
"I wish the Commission had supplied us with this information earlier on in these proceedings, for then, I believe, the fact that this directive had not even been transposed in ten Member States might well have caused our debate on this subject to take a slightly different course."
"Driving and resting times, working time and monitoring belong together."
"The Council has chosen to stand in the way of that, and that is why, today, this result gets a ‘no’ vote from me."
"Mr President, Commissioner, throughout the work on these two directives, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has been an adherent of more stringent monitoring of compliance with the rules on driving and resting times, and we welcome the digital tachograph, for there is a need for more uniform and consistent enforcement of the rules."
"We need this with a view to road safety, and we need it in order to ensure fair conditions of competition for those haulage contractors and drivers who observe the rules."
"Infringements of the legislation must be detected, and the culprits punished."
"We have, however, been more sceptical about significant changes to the rules themselves, where driving and resting times are concerned."
"It is a fact that the rules are complicated, but they are well established and they are known by the drivers."
"If we change them, we must change them for the better."
"With the conciliation now arrived at between Parliament and the Council, I believe, however, that we have found a sensible balance, and we in the ALDE Group are able to support the conciliation."
"The rules are being simplified, which, in certain cases, also means that they are becoming less flexible."
"In future, it will not be possible to divide the daily resting time into several shorter rest periods."
"The rules will require a daily rest period divided into periods of nine and three hours. In return, however, the rules will be relaxed at other points, granting, for example, more flexible rules in connection with ferry services."
"What is also important is that the rules are now also to cover lorries from third countries, which do not come within the AETR agreement."
"It is important for lorry drivers to be fully rested, irrespective of whether they come from Denmark or Ukraine."
"The issue of monitoring drivers’ working time has been important in the negotiations."
"The ALDE Group was opposed to the police being handed responsibility for monitoring compliance with the rules governing drivers’ working time."
"Such monitoring is organised very differently from one country to another, and that is something we have to accept."
"That does not mean that we do not want to see the Working Time Directive for drivers enforced, and I would indeed call on the Commission to monitor implementation of the Working Time Directive and ensure that all countries monitor and enforce it in a uniform manner, so that there is no distortion of competition in this area, either."
"Bus and coach owners will not be satisfied with the result of the conciliation. It will become more difficult to organise bus and coach journeys in the same way as at present, when drivers may make themselves available for more than six days in a row."
"I regret that we were unable to obtain a more flexible solution in this case. Otherwise, I am satisfied with the overall result, and I thank Mr Markov and the shadow rapporteur for their efforts."
"The fact is, the legislation surrounding digital tachographs has been called a farce because it has for so long been uncertain when it would be introduced. Faced with changing announcements about the rules, haulage contractors have found themselves in a legal vacuum."
"I think that the farce now needs to come to an end, and I would therefore conclude by putting the following question to Commissioner Barrot: will you guarantee that when, in a year’s time, the new legislation on driving and resting times is brought into force, account will be taken of the problems involved in converting the digital tachographs from the present rules to the new ones?"
"Are you able to guarantee that, Commissioner?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the members of our team – rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs alike – are deserving of warm thanks for their outstanding cooperation in a common cause. That common cause was one and the same as the original intention of the directive: to do away, in Europe, with the accidents in heavy traffic and impairments to road safety caused by drivers suddenly succumbing to cumulative driving fatigue, as well as with the scandalous social dumping in the transport industry, which results in unfair competition not only between European countries but also between them and third countries, with all those who act fairly and properly – not least towards their employees – losing out."
"During the conciliation process on this matter, though, it has to be said that we came up against a concrete wall – a concrete wall in the Council, which made it impossible for us to go as far as really would have been necessary and useful."
"The fact is that the need for checks on driving times to take into account also the other periods of time when the driver was working is actually pretty much self-evident and ought really to be blindingly obvious."
"If, though, this situation is to be improved overall, one thing is especially important, and it is to be found in the second part of the regulation – I refer to efficient monitoring."
"That is now an obligation incumbent on the Member States, who must now carry out more frequent checks, so that the sort of scandals in the haulage industry with which we used to be familiar, and the serious accidents caused by cumulative driving fatigue, will at last be consigned to the past."
"What eventually persuade me to support the directive after all was the need for this monitoring to be tightened up, for that is indispensable."
"I believe that we need these rules if we are to achieve certain improvements, even if we do not yet have the coherence with the Working Time Directive that is needed."
"Other points of criticism include, for example, the fact that some of the rules are so complex that those who are not initiated into their mysteries cannot understand them, or the excessively lengthy times allowed for the checks to be adapted."
"I did, however, find it a rather bitter experience to discover that, right up to the end, the Council was not willing to be persuaded of the indispensability of measures aimed at making our roads safer and dealing with social dumping."
"We did, nevertheless, manage to move forward, but we now have to ensure that the Member States actually do end up transposing the regulations and doing something in this area."
". Mr President, in the past, it was possible for Member States to regulate safety on the roads and the safety of workers in road transport, each in their own different way."
"In their fight to constantly improve this protection, interest groups were knocking on national legislators’ doors."
"These days, there is far more international freight traffic, covering hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of miles."
"This turns the differences between national regulations into a nuisance factor in the competitive struggle."
"Companies that get their workers to work long shifts appear to be in a strong position."
"In many cases, they do not take into consideration the fact that this advantage is cancelled out by accidents whereby human lives, vehicles and cargo are destroyed or lost altogether."
"In many cases, centralised decision-making does not benefit organisations that want to protect these jobs, the environment and safety."
"Above all, it strengthens the position of those who, despite public opinion, want to emphasise corporate interests, entrepreneurial freedom and unbridled economic growth."
"That is also evident in driving and resting times."
"Workers can be forced to work in excess of their driving hours."
"Smaller lorries for express services are exempt, which means that instead of a 12-hour break, they are only entitled to an 11-hour break."
"Compliance is still not monitored adequately."
"Better legislation could have already been in place and will need to be put on the agenda once again in the near future."
"Serious consideration will also need to be given to the new problem of companies in some Member States not compensating their staff for compulsory resting times or reimburse them for essential expenses incurred for accommodation."
"In the short term, this compromise represents a minor improvement, especially since it will also apply to lorries from countries outside of the European Union, and also in view of the fact that the digital tachograph is easier to monitor."
"That is a reason, despite serious objections, to give a positive verdict."
". Mr President, the EU is charging vehicles again for roads already paid for by national taxes."
"The EU will maintain nothing, so this is a scam."
"Lorries and coaches will pay: scam 1, a daily charge of EUR 8; plus scam 2, an annual charge of up to EUR 1 400; plus scam 3, tolls based on distance travelled; plus scam 4, an urban mark-up of 25% under the Euro-vignette; plus scam 5, an estimated EUR 1 500 to change to a digital tachograph; plus scam 6, driver-specific photo licences – in short, ID cards; and scam 7, EUR 3.5 billion paid by EU citizens because each vehicle will be tracked by Galileo, described as the biggest, whitest elephant ever to become weightless."
"But will this reduce congestion and emissions?"
"Should buses and coaches be the first category to be charged?"
"The answer is no."
"500 million Europeans travelled by coach in 2005, many of them elderly people."
"This legislation encourages smaller vehicles, creating greater congestion, emissions and expense."
"But emission-sensitive charging already exists: it is called fuel duty."
"Is that too simple for the EU?"
"However, the cost of all this is really about EU taxation for a centralised Europe and funding a satellite, is it not?"
"It has nothing to do with roads."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr Markov because I believe that he has done an excellent job, including in terms of mediation."
"I do not agree with the previous speaker, because I believe that harmonising social safeguards and road safety is an important task of this Parliament and our institutions."
"It is a task on which I do not always agree, even though I believe that, when it comes to increasing safety in the interest of Europeans, we need to be able to reach a compromise."
"I should like simply to point out that, while on the one hand the balance struck by the directive is a reasonably acceptable one, and is therefore a balance that I generally support, on the other hand there are some inflexible aspects to the directive that could perhaps have been toned down: I am referring in particular to those aspects regarding working time and rest breaks."
"Although I can agree on them, they could have been toned down more in terms of applying the directive."
"I have further doubts – and on this point I address Mr Barrot – about the digital tachograph."
"I know, for instance, that in my country, Italy, we are having difficulties finding workshops capable of initialising these instruments."
"I wonder whether other EU countries are experiencing the same difficulties."
"The Italian Ministry of Production Activities has granted a derogation to the road hauliers with regard to the certification of times and speeds, precisely because the instrument is not yet enabled."
"If the problem exists in other countries too, then I wonder what can be done about it."
"If no action is taken, then we are in danger of starting a process that in the end cannot be carried through."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, it will come as no surprise to Mr Piecyk that I regard the argument with which he urges rejection as false."
"We, too, would have liked to see a connection made with the monitoring of working times, but, if you had had your way late on the evening of 6 December, we would have ended up with nothing at all."
"We would have had nothing to show for the two years we had spent in negotiations, and that is something we regard as unacceptable."
"In line with the majority opinion as expressed this morning, I am all in favour of updating, modernising and simplifying social security regulations for the benefit of all concerned, and that is why we have to bring that about."
"That is why I am appealing to all Members of this House to support the compromise when we vote at noon today."
"All this can be summed up under three headings: improved road safety, better working conditions for drivers and, above all else, helping law-abiding haulage companies to be more competitive rather than sitting back and watching those that sit lighter to the law getting away scot-free with forcing their drivers to work longer hours than are permitted, simply because they are not checked up on."
"Let all, then, vote to endorse the result we have got, which helps everyone – most of all the people who use roads."
"There are, though, Commissioner, two points that I would like to make."
"Thank goodness we have now sorted out this issue with the final date for the introduction of the digital tachograph."
"Following on from what Mr Romagnoli saidI beg you to have more serious talks with the Member States and get them to guarantee that the state infrastructure will be in place and the driver cards made available, for the present state of affairs is unacceptable; the digital tachograph was originally meant to be introduced in August 2004, and we deferred it to May of this year on the sensible grounds that that would be more practicable for industry."
"Now, though, it turns out that some Member States have still not got this organised, so perhaps you might consider hauling them before the courts."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by apologising to the House for the considerable embarrassment of my countryman, Mr Nattrass, who clearly lacks the intellectual capacity to discuss the correct report."
"He obviously thought we were talking about the Eurovignette."
"It is very embarrassing."
"We know UKIP is 20 years out of date, and it shows in this Chamber."
"Firstly, tiredness kills."
"If we look at the demands on drivers these days with congestion and the just-in-time culture, we realise what strain there is on drivers."
"That is why this measure is a very important step forward for road safety."
"Key to it are digital tachographs, and key to the success of that was having a much more realistic deadline than the original one."
"That allows us to have proper monitoring, and this is a much simpler regulation than previous ones."
"That has to be the key to success."
"I am delighted that Parliament has been able to increase the number of checks, but it is all about monitoring, implementation and enforcement."
"We must ensure that all Member States carry out those checks and we need coordination between the enforcement authorities in all Member States."
"I hope the Commission will be vigorous in monitoring progress there."
"Member States could do more than simply apply laws."
"There are insufficient rest areas for drivers; there are insufficient incentives for training."
"I compliment the work done by Scania through its Driver of the Year competition to encourage training."
"Working time is clearly part and parcel of this process and needs to be monitored."
"I am horrified to learn that ten Member States have not yet implemented that."
"We hope the Commission will take greater action."
"Let us emphasise constantly the importance of consistent implementation."
"It is the Commission’s job to ensure that Member States are doing their job."
"Mr President, we have come a long way."
"Mrs Jensen has said what needed to be said."
"The aim was to update, clarify, and, above all, simplify, the existing rules in the area of driving times and resting times, with a view to establishing fair competition among road hauliers, traffic safety and guaranteeing the social interests of the people who work in the road transport sector."
"Previous documents appeared to overshoot this target completely."
"Not enough consideration was given to the fact that what really mattered was not so much the rules on driving times and resting times as their enforcement and the different ways in which they were interpreted."
"All credit to the rapporteur, Mr Markov."
"His commitment and involvement were phenomenal and I should like to thank him for that."
"Something which you will not hear me say often, but the fact that the agreement on which we are voting today can be seen as reasonably acceptable, even by Liberal standards, is mainly thanks to the Council’s persistence during the negotiations, and so I strongly disagree with what Mr Piecyk had to say."
"In fact, the purpose and necessity of a number of provisions in the present agreement can still be called into question."
"For example, the splitting up of the daily rest period into three hours and then nine strikes me as extremely restrictive. Similarly, the weekend rest rule of 45 hours every two weeks certainly does not contribute to the flexibility that is so desperately needed in road transport."
"It completely escapes me how such rigid provisions could in any way contribute to road safety or better working conditions."
"The present agreement may, then be far from perfect, but, as I said earlier, it is acceptable."
"At least the industry now knows where it stands."
"Thank God, the daily rest period remained restricted to 11 hours."
"The direct link with working times inspection has been removed."
"The shorter weekly resting times can now simply be taken in the vehicle. Very importantly, there is now finally clarity about when the digital tachograph is to be introduced."
"In a nutshell, the proposal is not perfect, but acceptable, and I will be giving it the thumbs up."
"– Mr President, I should like to congratulate my eminent honourable friend Helmuth Markov on the effort he made in drafting this report."
"Having said which, I would highlight two important points: firstly, the improvement to the working conditions and rights of drivers and, secondly, the assumption of responsibility by the Member States towards employers on safety matters, with the result that it will be possible to improve insurance even more in the immediate future."
"However, it must be said that, despite the positive steps, the environment which prevails in European transport does not, unfortunately, allow the value of human life to be placed beyond question; in other words, for there to be consistent monitoring at all times of the application of humane working times for drivers and monitoring of the application of safety rules at the source, at the root of the matter we are debating, by which I mean at the company head offices."
"That is why the Council too rejected the proposal, which would allow the Member States' controlling authorities to carry out inspections and ascertain the extent to which the working time limits laid down in the Working Time Directive are being applied and to take account of drivers' fatigue as a result of loading and unloading the vehicle and other factors."
"Mr President, after more than 20 years, the legislation we have on social conditions in road transport is due an overhaul."
"In those 20 years, legislation has acquired a status in its own right as a basis for corporate transport patterns."
"That is why adverse effects in the event of changes, should, where possible, be restricted."
"During the negotiations, a good outcome hung in the balance for a long time, but the agreement we now have is, I think, a tenable one."
"The main elements of progress are, in my view, on the one hand, the fact that a number of elements have remained intact."
"I would particularly refer to the 11 hours of daily rest time and Directive 2002/15/EC that has been left out of the equation."
"We have also gained a definitive date for the introduction of the digital tachograph."
"This will remove much of the uncertainty about the use of this instrument and will hopefully help put more effective monitoring measures in place."
"The more stringent monitoring rules will contribute to this regulation’s effectiveness."
"An identical explanation and application of the rules across all the countries is essential for the internal market to work well."
"The status quo has been improved by, among other things, the adequate powers given to the inspectors and clear agreements on criteria for inspections and reports."
"In general, a stricter regime will be put in place, which, by definition, means that flexibility will suffer during implementation."
"I am convinced, however, that the present agreements will contribute in a positive way to a healthy and stable sector; after all, all parties involved stand to benefit from them."
"Finally, I am indebted to all those involved, particularly the rapporteur, for their commitment and perseverance."
"Mr President, when I first heard that the European Union wanted to tell me how long I could work each week, I finally realised it had lost its collective mind."
"And here we go again!"
"These proposed restrictions on the good management of transport businesses make several huge and utterly unjustified assumptions."
"They assume that business managers do not know how best to organise their businesses and balance customer needs with staff resources."
"They assume they think it is worth taking risks – criminal risks at that – in overworking tired drivers, and publicity risks if they are found guilty."
"It assumes that owner-drivers do not know what is in their own best interests."
"Over the last half-century, social engineering of this kind has proved beyond doubt that it simply does not work."
"When will it dawn on you that the European economic mess is precisely because of this kind of interference?"
"This proposal is a sledgehammer to crack a nut and, just like the port services directive, it should be disposed of into the waste bin."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wonder how familiar the people of Thuringia are with the European regulation on driving times and rest periods."
"It is, no doubt, the most important law on the basis of which Europe’s hauliers and bus companies have to operate, and it has developed over the course of twenty years."
"The only thing is that it is out of date and bureaucratic; the monitoring devices are easily manipulated, and the checks are not free of discrimination."
"It is because Lisbon requires improved framework conditions in terms of road safety, protection at work, opportunities for competition and reduced bureaucracy that I warmly welcome the compromise that has now, at last, been put together."
"It may well be that not everyone will rejoice in it, but the fact is that there is nothing whatever about it that makes matters worse than they are under the present legal regime."
"We have even managed to agree on how often checks should be carried out and on a range of sanctions to be imposed."
"If, today, we vote to adopt that, we will be confirming that Europe really has entered the digital age."
"Not least the introduction of the digital tachograph makes for clarity; with effect from May 2006, it will be required to be fitted to new HGVs and buses, and vehicles without one may be taken out of service."
"What the Member States have to do is to guarantee the smooth transition from the analogue system to the digital one."
"Will they achieve this ambitious target?"
"If not, there will be great upheavals, for example when a vehicle equipped, as the regulation requires, with a digital tachograph is checked in an EU Member State where the officials have not yet been issued with the proper reading device."
"There will also be problems where agreements with neighbouring Member States have not yet been concluded."
"What are we going to do about the Ukrainian lorry driver who is checked in Brussels, but has never heard of a digital tachograph?"
"And how can we expect Europeans to be checked in Turkey?"
"I urge you to join with me in calling for the AETR regulations to be adapted to the digital age."
"Mr President, the procedure advances far more quickly for texts relating to competition than for those relating to social standards – we are used to that."
"The text submitted to us today has been around since 2001."
"This is therefore the outcome of a long legislative procedure that ended with a difficult and improbable conciliation procedure, such was the resistance shown by the Member States."
"I will vote in favour of this text, which puts in place minimum standards."
"It must be pointed out that these standards constitute a significant step forward given that, in certain Member States, road transport workers were driving for as many as 70 or 74 hours and that driving times will from now on be limited to 56 hours; given that this is a text relating to social convergence, which does not prevent matters from being dealt with more satisfactorily in each of the Member States; and given that this is a text that I hope is ripe for improvement."
"Nevertheless, I very much regret what Mr Jarzembowski said about Mr Piecyk."
"He wanted to put a very unpleasant ideological slant on the matter."
"I regret it because Mr Piecyk put his finger on a problem: the absence of simultaneous checks of driving time and working time."
"Thus, a heavy goods vehicle could be kept moving non-stop by three underpaid drivers: the first drives, the second takes his rest break on the adjacent seat in the cab and the third takes his weekly rest break on the back seat, behind the driver."
"That is the reality of the matter, and I believe that we have let a great social text slip by."
"I regret that somewhat, but I will nevertheless be voting in favour."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like straight away to join with others in thanking Mr Markov for having seen through this long and difficult legislative saga."
"Like the majority of my fellow Members, I am delighted that the European Union should have taken up the issue of the harmonisation of social legislation in the area of road transport, even if there is still a great deal to be done."
"As you are aware, although the European Union has tentatively – too tentatively – instituted policies aimed at transferring the movement of freight from road transport to other modes of transport, an outcome that our fellow citizens hope and pray for, it must be said that road haulage is constantly on the increase, and this throughout the entire Community."
"In this context, contrary to what Mr Mote said, all of the European transit countries, with France being one of them, are particularly aware of the need not only to improve road safety and working conditions for road hauliers, but also to eliminate distortions of competition and to fight against social dumping."
"I would mention, by way of example, the serious difficulties that the Alsace region is encountering in terms of reducing the catastrophic effects of transit traffic by road."
"To come back to the subject being dealt with today, there is an urgent need – and on this point I agree with Mr Savary – to harmonise the working conditions for road hauliers and the rules to be applied in relation to rest periods and driving times. The aim of these measures is to cut the number of road accidents caused by driver fatigue, even if there is still much to be done, and to improve the safety of everyone in Europe."
"Even though, on this point, the agreement concluded is still insufficient, which is undoubtedly due to the fact that we are talking here about a compromise, the Markov reports resulting from the readings in Parliament and the conciliation procedures constitute a significant step forward in terms of fighting against social dumping and of simplifying, and at the same time clarifying, the road transport sector."
"That is why, in the end, we will adopt this text."
"To conclude, I hope that the European Commission regularly carries out impact studies in order to ascertain that the measures we are taking today are not only sufficient but, also and above all, that they are applied and monitored, thanks mainly to the effective use of digital tachographs."
"Mr President, we are finally making progress – at an absolute snail’s pace, but we are making progress."
"If there is one area in which social and fiscal dumping wreaks havoc and in which it is imperative that the legislator steps in, it is road transport."
"With employees forced to work at a furious pace due to the just-in-time phenomenon, one can rightly talk about a wage of fear. A wage of fear that is all too often an hourly starvation wage, one that compels people to calculate driving times on the basis of distances travelled, without giving a single thought to safety or their health or that of others."
"I am also thinking of the small businessmen in this sector who live in daily fear of going bankrupt, victims of the criminal dogma of free and undistorted competition, who are very far removed today from the ideals that first led them to become self-employed."
"There is only one law, that of transporting a commodity from one point to another, as quickly and as cheaply as possible."
"The risks do not matter; after all, there is insurance."
"This law has a name: the law of the jungle."
"It is high time we acted so that our roads are no longer like the Wild West."
"Despite the courageous and tenacious efforts of our fellow Member, Mr Markov, I regret the timidity of the final texts. Nevertheless, they do constitute a first step in the right direction."
"Some of our fellow Members rant on about big-brother-style surveillance when the use of electronic techniques for the purposes of monitoring compliance with the regulation is mentioned."
"They call this an attack on individual freedoms."
"However, it is a question here of protecting lives."
"Cannot they see that it is the big bosses of European businesses that are the main terrorists, the ones that breach social laws and encourage fiscal and social dumping among our nations, those employers who are directly responsible, on a daily basis, for dozens of fatal accidents on our roads?"
"So yes, let us use all the resources available to us in order to guarantee safety and to enable the European Union to live peacefully."
"Mr President, digital technology is being used in more and more fields, and so we can hope that the digital journey recorder, too, will do ‘just what it says on the tin’."
"I regard the new system as being very much to be welcomed – after all, it is intended, in combination with information and communications systems, to be a simple fleet management tool and to be indispensable in enforcing professional drivers driving times and rest periods."
"In doing that, the intention is that it should enhance road safety and prevent social dumping."
"We should, however, be under no illusions about the fact that the conversion to digital will achieve its object only if what has been announced – the more frequent checks, including on the vehicle’s roadworthiness – actually happen."
"It is frequently the case that vehicles – those from Eastern Europe, for example – are not actually roadworthy."
"When one considers the many and various ways in which analogue monitoring devices can be manipulated, digital technology really does seem to bring improvements in its wake, but I do believe that new ways of interfering with it will soon be found."
"It is indeed the case that newly-registered HGVs without working tachographs can be decommissioned after May 2006, but, in the absence of any requirement that older vehicles be upgraded, crafty hauliers will probably find a way of using this to their own benefit."
"The question also arises of to what extent recourse will be had to vehicles licensed in other countries or preferential treatment given to firms based in them."
"It is to be hoped that this will not turn out to be another example of a good idea being turned to EU businesses’ competitive disadvantage."
"Mr President, while we regard the agreement on driving times and resting times that was concluded by the Council and Parliament last December as an acceptable one, it is not the most attractive solution."
"The outcome of the conciliation was, at first, unacceptable to the rapporteur, but I did, in fact, regard it as an improvement on the outcome of the vote in this House’s plenary meeting."
"It contains a readily workable break regulation – 11 hours instead of 12 hours of rest – and allows drivers to decide for themselves where to sleep rather than having Parliament deciding the matter for them."
"Overall, I think the proposal is acceptable, even though it does contain elements about which I am unhappy. It is far too detailed in places, and particularly the options for coach travel spread over several days are too restrictive."
"I should like to ask Commissioner Barrot for his opinion on this, because this will really cause practical problems."
"We finally have certainty about when the digital tachograph will be introduced, and I am pleased to see Commissioner Barrot again taking a very firm line on this."
"Commissioner, you said there would be no period of grace after May 2006, and we will hold you to that, for we will not accept a situation in which those who have dutifully introduced the new digital tachograph will be monitored more strictly than lorry combinations that are not fitted with one."
"I therefore hope that you will really take action."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Markov for doing such a good job."
"What we need are safer and more secure roads in Europe."
"At present, 43 000 people die each year on our roads, and we know that whenever large vehicles are involved in accidents, the consequences are disastrous."
"We must do everything in order to obtain safer and more secure roads."
"The fact is that the decision we have to take concerns a genuinely European issue."
"Haulage contractors and professional drivers often operate in more than one European country."
"Their day-to-day work consists in moving goods and passengers across the whole of our continent."
"Competition is at European level, and it is at European level that we therefore also need to have fairly similar conditions of competition, as well as the ability properly to monitor compliance with the rules."
"We must also obtain better conditions for professional drivers, conditions that make driving safer and more secure for them."
"That is something about which we have the opportunity to decide today."
"We shall not obtain everything, but we shall make a little progress."
"We are also concerned here with the introduction of digital tachographs, and that, I think, is a very important issue."
"At present, we have tachographs that can be, and are, manipulated. It is important for us to obtain more secure tachographs that help make driving safer and more secure for us all, including those who drive for a living."
"I therefore propose that we vote in favour of this conciliation proposal."
"Mr President, I have protested in this Chamber on every available occasion about this unnecessary piece of legislation."
"I stick by my previous words describing these proposals as impractical, untenable and unenforceable."
"Following the long, drawn-out conciliation process, we have before us something which is still blind to the realities of the haulage, distribution and public transport sectors."
"We are told that this is a road safety measure."
"It is nothing of the sort!"
"Bus services in rural areas – where many people are elderly and rely on public transport – will be jeopardised due to the inflexibility of this proposal."
"Either that, or the costs to local taxpayers will rise significantly as public authorities strive to pile on even greater subsidies, let alone the fact that UK industry tells me that it will be at least five years before there is a sufficient number of trained drivers to meet the requirements of this regulation."
"In the commercial sector, just-in-time delivery systems – the backbone of modern industrial supply – will also be jeopardised due to the lack of drivers."
"All of which is not speculation, as an independent survey of over 500 haulage companies from my constituency indicates."
"Some haulage companies are planning to shut down altogether due to EU over-regulation."
"I can guarantee to every Member in this House that the negative effects will be mirrored in other Member States as well."
"We keep hearing the Commission state that it will be repealing over-regulatory legislation and not proceeding with other damaging proposals."
"Here we have another opportunity for the Commission to prove exactly that."
"Today gives us an opportunity to let business run itself without the heavy hand of Brussels always at its shoulder."
"I urge that this proposal be rejected so that companies, whether in haulage or public transport, can prosper."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Markov on his excellent work and congratulate all of us on having reached the best possible agreement in an urgent and difficult area, since it involves improving road safety and the working conditions for drivers, guaranteeing legal certainty and fair competition and finally giving the go-ahead for digital tachographs."
"I believe that it is also an agreement that achieved the social convergence of 25 Member States and that is a very good political sign in terms of gradually removing the disturbing risk of social dumping."
"I understand Mr Markov's frustration, however, because it has not been possible to use this legislation as a lever to make progress on working time."
"Nevertheless, I believe that it will be useful, and we will see that in the future."
"As in all good agreements, therefore, the particular interests of the parties have been partially frustrated for the sake of the general interest, but the truth is that significant progress has been made in the area of breaks, daily and weekly breaks and weekly hours, as well as the establishment of more and stricter controls and penalties that are trans-national."
"Furthermore, it obliges the Member States, and commits the Commission, to internationalising this progress in the AETR Agreement and, of course, there is no excuse to delay the introduction of tachographs."
"We have therefore managed to balance rigour and flexibility, harmonisation and subsidiarity; in other words, it is a miracle, though a secular one of course."
"I shall end by supporting Mr Markov’s demands that the Commission study the impact of smaller lorries on road safety, promote cooperation amongst controlling authorities and hold seminars with social partners."
"Finally, I shall add a request: could there please be a study of the impact of this legislation on the conditions for drivers and on the guarantee of equal competition conditions for the outlying countries, such as my own."
"Mr President, we have already today heard a great deal about the essential objectives of these two pieces of legislation, which we will shortly be voting on: more safety on Europe’s main traffic arteries, observance of rules on working and rest periods – with the consequent improvement in protection for drivers and in their social rights – and fairer competition across the board."
"We will, in essence, be giving tangible form, in Community law, to the objectives of both these legal documents."
"Over the coming years, then, our main concern will have to be with compliance with these new standards and we will, in particular, have to concentrate on how that compliance is monitored."
"Although that will be a matter primarily for the Member States and their administrative structures to deal with, the Commission would be well advised to lead back to the path of virtue those offenders in certain Member States – and there will certainly be some – who neglect to do so."
"The directive also envisages the regulation having another purpose, one that has not yet been really addressed today, but one that we should consider nonetheless, and that is that the new rules should be simplified."
"I am not sure whether our great gamble in this has paid off;"
"I am already hearing the same old weeping and wailing about what a bureaucratic monster Europe is, and I know that we may well, where the future benefits of this legislation are concerned, be obliged to say nothing or far too little on the subject."
"It follows, then, that we must ensure that the haulage firms and the drivers who work for them do not see the rules and the monitoring of them as some sort of bureaucratic harassment, and that we must, rather than allowing people to talk only about the evils of Europe, always turn the conversation round to the added value that will accrue to it through improved road safety."
"Mr President, this directive is partly about driver health and safety, partly about road safety and partly about fair competition."
"I myself was responsible for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and I wish to thank Mr Markov for his constructive cooperation."
"I now think that we can feel satisfied."
"We did not perhaps completely resolve every issue, but the proposal we now have on driving and resting times is a good one."
"It is a good proposal that the digital tachograph be introduced to improve monitoring."
"There is, of course, a problem with the Working Time Directive, but that is not something we can blame on these regulations."
"The problem is that it is not applied widely enough, and I want to say to the Commission and the Council that the Council too must agree to the proposal we have put forward here in Parliament concerning a new Working Time Directive."
"Therein lies the problem."
"It would therefore be a mistake to vote against the proposal."
"Instead, we must see it as a way of bringing pressure to bear."
"In this Chamber, we have agreed on a constructive regulation covering drivers, and now it is time to obtain a Working Time Directive that also meets Europeans’ expectations."
"I will continue with the same argument as Mr Andersen, because, like him, I work in the Committee on Employment, and I am going to vote yes, because the approval is also going to help another dossier about which we are very concerned, which is the general Directive on working time, for which I am rapporteur."
"It is clear that Mr Markov’s work makes progress on the social conditions for persons performing mobile road transport activities and increases road safety, but it also has a very important connection with the general debate we are involved in against those who want to empty European laws of all content."
"We and yourselves can be pleased today that this work provides legislation for the whole of Europe, legislation which does not allow for exclusions or exemptions or opting out; and while you are here, Commissioner, I would like to say that you will just have heard what the eurosceptics and the extreme right have to say, but be careful, because in relation to the other dossier, working time, we have people in the Council and in the Commission who use the same arguments, talking about the workers' freedom to remain outside of the legislation and about the States’ freedom to exclude themselves from common rules which are fair competition rules."
"I shall therefore vote yes, because this is going to be of great help to the whole of the debate on the European working time legislation, which is essential to Europe’s future."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, experience has shown that safety in road transport is usually linked to the human factor."
"How many times following a tragic incident on the motorways of Europe has the accident proven to be due to human error?"
"And how many times, in truth, has the error been made by professional lorry and bus drivers often forced to work under exhausting conditions?"
"Consequently, we need to give these people the possibility of having fewer hours' driving on a daily and weekly basis and longer rest periods."
"This will result in a reduction in road traffic accidents, especially where buses are involved in collisions, causing multiple fatalities."
"In my country, as elsewhere in Europe, we unfortunately have numerous such incidents, especially recently."
"It is therefore a very good thing for there to be harmonisation of these matters at European level, given that road transport by definition goes beyond the borders of one Member State."
"We have made a huge effort to persuade the Council that our positions are correct."
"Unfortunately, we have been unable to get all our positions across."
"However, I believe that we should honour the results of our efforts and should, in future, exhaust and examine all issues, such as the total working time of professional drivers and, more importantly, compliance with the rules and supervision of safety."
". Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Parliament for its excellent work and by once again thanking Mr Markov."
"I should like to oppose what some MEPs have said and point out that our objective is to act in the interests of drivers and of industry by adopting social standards that will make our roads safer."
"It is true that heavy goods vehicles are involved in only 6% of accidents, but 16% of these accidents are fatal."
"Finally, we are going to allow the harmonisation of conditions of competition."
"We therefore have here evidence of real progress."
"I fully understood some speakers, such as Mr Piecyk, when they said they regretted the absence of a direct link with the Working Time Directive."
"That is nonetheless what the Commission had proposed."
"The Council unanimously rejected our proposal, I am afraid to say, but we are responding."
"Thus, I have sent ten reasoned opinions for non-transposition, and we are in fact, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, going to monitor the application of these texts very carefully; we are going to see to it that the various instruments are as fully coordinated as possible."
"I would point out that, among the Member States that received a reasoned opinion, Ireland has already put its situation in order."
"If the other Member States do not do so, then the Commission will still have the option of bringing them before the Court."
"I will now provide some more specific answers."
"In response to Mr Markov and to Mrs Ayala, I will state that the study on the use of small lorries is under way, that we envisage a meeting taking place this year with all of the interested parties and, once again, that we are going to increase the coordination between these texts and the directive on drivers’ working time."
"Mr Koch pointed out the problem of applying the legislation outside the Union’s borders."
"We have committed ourselves to negotiating with a view to bringing the AETR in line with our legislation."
"We also intend to protect the Union against social dumping and we intend also to apply the digital tachograph to AETR drivers and drivers from Russia, Turkey and the Balkans."
"Mrs Griesbeck pointed out the rerouting of traffic via the Alsace region."
"The new Eurovignette Directive, adopted by Parliament and the Council, will make it possible for the Member States to install tolls on these alternative routes."
"– I will request that fellow Members keep their noise down when entering the Chamber so that we may hear the interesting replies from Mr Barrot."
"Therefore, please return to your seats in silence."
".Mrs Jensen and Mrs Wortmann-Kool mentioned the problems of buses."
"Parliament was more open to the demands of industry; the Council was not; the Commission was open to both solutions, but the conciliation procedure went in the Council’s favour."
"We can, all the same, acknowledge that safety will win out here."
"I now come to the use of the tachograph."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you will at some point hear the digital tachograph mentioned."
"The Commission is working with officials from the Member States to ensure that the introduction of the digital tachograph is coherent and harmonised, both on the roads and in businesses."
"Mr Romagnoli, I know that the Italian workshops have fallen behind, like those in some other Member States."
"That is a regrettable situation, and we have demonstrated our understanding."
"Nevertheless, the tachograph is a crucial element in terms of road safety and compliance with the regulation, and if a Member State is not ready on the date set by Parliament, in agreement with the Council, then I can tell you straight away that there will be no further delay."
"This is a question of coherence, and we will quite simply take infringement action."
"Ladies and gentlemen, while apologising for not answering all the questions posed, I should like to point out the many advantages of the legislative package."
"A clear limit on weekly driving times, the impossibility of bypassing rest breaks, a simplified daily rest period, regular weekly rest periods, a standard policy in relation to interpreting and applying the regulation, the extraterritoriality of penalties and greater accountability throughout the transport chain: these are the main breakthroughs in the regulation."
"As for the directive, it enables us to increase the number of checks, both on site – at the roadside in this case – and also on the premises of the businesses, where the checks will be mainly carried out."
"All of this should enable us to improve the checks, make them effective and guarantee greater cooperation."
"I hope that the commotion accompanying my speech is only the expression of widespread approval, even if Parliament may have some regrets about not having been fully supported by the Council."
"In any event, I thank Parliament for its excellent work on these two texts."
"– Thank you for your courage, Mr Barrot."
"You have, I might add, been warmly applauded on all sides of the Chamber."
"Mr President, I have no idea which Rule, but it is unacceptable in my view that I am unable to listen to the Commission at the end of a debate."
"I had great difficulty in making out the Commissioner’s concluding remarks."
"The President has been asked before that something be done about this."
"I would ask you again to ensure we have a normal debate with a normal ending before we start the voting procedure."
"I entirely agree with you."
"I believe that this has to do with the self-discipline of Members, who ought to have the courtesy and, I will add, intelligence, to listen right up to the end of the debates, especially when the Commission makes a point of replying in detail, as Mr Barrot just did."
"I therefore share your regrets."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"I should like to welcome to the official gallery Mr Norbert Lammert, who is the President of the Bundestag."
"Mr Lammert has made his first visit this morning to the European Parliament since the last election of the Bundestag."
"On behalf of this entire Chamber, I wish him a very warm welcome."
"The next item is voting time."
". Mr President, I should like simply to point out that the Commission proposal that consists of retaining mandatory packaging ranges for a number of staple goods, in the interest of consumers, is a coherent one."
"On the other hand, the position that consists of accepting the Commission’s plan to retain certain mandatory sectors, while rejecting the Commission proposal, is not coherent."
"In the interest of consumers, and in accordance with the independent study commissioned by the European Parliament for the first time in its history, I therefore recommend voting in favour of the entire set of amendments tabled by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which adopted them by 28 votes with one abstention."
"Mr President, quite simply, in the second sentence we propose that ‘strategy’ be replaced by ‘policies’."
"Mr President, there is also a written version of this amendment, and with the consent of its author, I would ask that, for the sake of clarification, only the two words ‘in order’ be added, giving ‘in order to lay down the conditions for a representative democracy’."
"Mr President, the rapporteur for this report, Mr Brok, who could not attend the vote today, has asked me to propose adding a new paragraph, paragraph 28."
"I believe that it has been agreed with the other political groups."
"In any event, Mr President, I shall read the English version:"
"‘Acknowledges that the United Nations has asked the European Union to contribute to the security of the upcoming elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo by means of a military mission; asks the Council to carefully examine the existing possibilities;’"
"Mr President, the information that had been communicated to me with regard to the previous amendment came in fact from Mr Brok."
"In this specific case, it is a simple adjustment of the information appearing in paragraph 38, which would remove:"
"‘and to prepare for the general elections due to take place on 15 December 2005’ and replace it with ‘in the wake of the general elections held on 15 December 2005’."
"It is simply an adjustment, because the report was out of date."
"Mr President, a word of explanation."
"Victims of violent acts, especially when these are in the form of sexual assaults, often find themselves with injuries that are more psychological than physical."
"In order to ensure that appropriate assistance is provided by the staff concerned, I am tabling an amendment that meets this requirement."
"In the text, I quote in English,"
"‘4(b) providing proper training, including a child’s perspective, to the staff of competent bodies dealing with men’s violence against women, such as police officers, judicial personnel, health personnel, educators, youth and social workers and prison staff;’"
"I propose the following change: ‘providing proper training, specifically psychological, including a child’s perspective (…)’."
"The rapporteur has agreed to this wording."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like simply to highlight some formal and substantive errors with regard to the translation of the Italian text."
"For example, in the fourth line of paragraph 3, the Italian text reads ‘clearly recognise the State of Israel’, whereas the English text refers to the ‘State of Israel’s right to exist’."
"I therefore call for this correction to be made, as I believe it is crucial."
"The same goes for paragraph 10, in which ‘concrete and positive recommendations’ are mentioned, whereas the English text only mentions ‘concrete’, and not positive, recommendations."
"The English version is deemed authentic."
"We are going to verify all the other versions and rectify any errors."
"Mr President, I would like to suggest a minimum amendment – it affects one word – with maximum content."
"Line 3 reads: ‘the urge for Hamas to be consistent’."
"This could be misunderstood and read as a call to destroy Israel consistently."
"It would be much better for it to be replaced by the word ‘cooperative’."
"We should urge Hamas to be ‘cooperative’."
"When the negotiation was organised amongst the different political groups, it was agreed that no amendments would be tabled; two political groups have tabled amendments."
"I would like to say, Mr President, that the oral amendment that we have voted on, which was proposed by Mr Landsbergis and which makes a lot of sense, should not in my view have been put to the vote before a vote on the amendment from the Greens."
"I believe, Mr President, that we must firstly vote on the amendments as presented and then see whether an oral amendment by Mr Landsbergis is appropriate."
"With regard to the previous vote, we had accepted the oral amendment, but it was rejected."
"Mr President, in the joint resolution to which there are no amendments, there is a mistake of which the other political groups are aware, because point 3 states that the Council’s common position has been modified, but the Council’s common position has not been modified: the supplementary measures accompanying the Council’s common position have been modified."
"In paragraph 3, therefore, rather than ‘the main objective of the changes made by the Council in January 2005’, it should say ‘the changes to the supplementary measures accompanying the Council's common position’."
"These are technical corrections that will be made."
"Mr President, I rise under Rule 108."
"We are about to vote on a resolution which is in response to an oral question tabled to the Council last night."
"This is an extremely important issue for Parliament to try to ensure that taxpayers’ money is managed and supervised correctly within the Member States."
"Within the oral question there were six specific questions and there was also an additional verbal question which was: will the Council discuss this with Parliament?"
"We had a ten-minute statement from the Presidency which answered none of the seven questions."
"Whilst I would ask Members to support this text in its entirety, could I ask the President to ask the Council if we could have the answers in writing, please."
"That goes without saying, Mr Wynn."
"The Presidency’s role consists of making sure, as far as possible, that Parliament’s decisions are enforced and respected by the Council."
"The request will therefore be sent to the Council."
"That concludes the vote."
"I was extremely pleased to vote for the legislation concerning working conditions of drivers engaged in road transport activities."
"I am delighted that drivers are granted guaranteed rest periods, and I believe that checking their implementation is also important."
"However, I must emphasise that the increase in the volume of road transport contradicts the fundamental principle of sustainable development."
"Wasteful energy consumption, severe air pollution and the deterioration of roads and the environment are all direct consequences of increasing lorry traffic."
"Therefore, the European Union should endeavour to develop alternative methods of transportation."
"Apart from the improvement of the working conditions of drivers, we should also address the situation of those living in towns and villages where lorries are rattling through, day and night."
". I welcome the new regulation which is primarily designed to strengthen and improve social legislation for drivers engaged in road transport activities."
"The regulation lays down four main elements."
"It establishes that all new vehicles should be fitted with digital tachographs and it defines a ‘regular daily rest period’ as any uninterrupted period of rest of at least 11 hours, which alternatively may be taken in two periods."
"In addition, a new definition on ‘driving time’ has been agreed upon, as well as the provisions of the European agreement concerning the work of crews of vehicles engaged in international road transport, which are now being aligned with those of the regulation."
"Finally, it acknowledges that the maximum weekly working time of 60 hours per week must be respected."
"All in all, I agree that the regulation contributes significantly to greater road safety in Europe."
"The Markov reports on which Parliament voted today raise a number of questions for countries on the geographical periphery of Europe, such as Portugal, Spain and Greece."
"I am aware of all the efforts that have been made throughout the period of negotiations. I must also say that this matter ought to be resolved in such a way as to contribute towards not only improving road safety on Europe’s motorways but also ensuring economic equity as regards development and growth in the transport sector throughout the Member States."
"Reading these texts led me to the conclusion that, in spite of the efforts made by the negotiators, these proposals were drawn up with Central European transport operators in mind, whose journeys tend to be over shorter distances."
"As an elected representative from Portugal, I must therefore vote against these arrangements and must point out that the completion of the internal market involves taking into account those countries in which this activity takes place over longer distances, and should reflect the interests of all Member States, without exception."
". MEPs from the Portuguese Communist Party, in conjunction with representative organisations of motorway and urban transport workers, have long campaigned to improve the labour rights of professional drivers, in order to ensure that legal working hours and rest periods for drivers are adhered to, and that the sacred cow of competition, in its exploitative voracity, does not undermine those rights."
"As the Unions have pointed out, although the regulation that has just been adopted may improve working conditions in some countries, it falls short of the collective working regulation in force in Portugal concerning the organisation of working time, the determination of minimum daily and weekly rest periods, and the monitoring thereof."
"Among other aspects, the regulation calls for the retention of two different concepts, namely ‘driving time’ and ‘working time’, which penalises the workers."
"What is more, the ‘new’ concepts of reduced rest periods make the task of monitoring compliance with minimum rest periods more difficult and make it more likely that drivers’ working days and weeks will be overloaded."
"We therefore hope that the adoption of the regulation will not act as a (false) pretext for (wrongly) justifying fresh attacks on workers’ rights."
". The regulation on the harmonisation of social legislation relating to road transport was intended to introduce into the road transport sector uniform rules on working conditions and road safety that had been needed for a long time."
"It remains to be seen whether the social position of the drivers concerned will actually be improved as a result of this agreement."
"We may at last have achieved standardised driving times and rest periods in the road transport sector, but the final version does not incorporate, among other features that are of importance to me, comprehensive references to the Working Time Directive."
"I find it deeply regrettable that the regulation we have adopted today will include no ban on drivers being paid according to the distances travelled and the quantities carried, something for which I have argued passionately as a means towards improving lorry-drivers’ social conditions."
"Fixed rates of pay really do protect every worker’s livelihood and I believe that workers in the road transport industry are entitled to that."
"The decision to bring about uniform social standards in European road transport is, in general terms, the right one to take, but, when I consider the improvements I initially hoped to see to the conditions of lorry drivers, this result really does bring us down to earth."
"I can therefore do no other than vote against both these dossiers."
". Although it is generally very desirable that social standards in the European transport sector should be harmonised, the social conditions of the vehicles’ drivers must also be improved."
"Since this has not happened on this occasion, I have voted against both these dossiers."
"The regulation on the harmonisation of social legislation relating to road transport was intended to introduce into the road transport sector uniform rules on working conditions and safety on the road that had been needed for a long time."
"We may at last have achieved standardised driving times and rest periods in the road transport sector, but the final version does not incorporate, among other important features, comprehensive references to the Working Time Directive."
"It is to be regretted that the regulation we have adopted today will include no ban on drivers being paid according to the distances travelled and the quantities carried, even though fixed rates of pay really do protect every worker’s livelihood and workers in the road transport industry are, of course, entitled to that."
". Today I voted against a Commission proposal for uniformity and metrification of food products, including bread and milk."
"The effect would have been to end the British measuring of bottled milk in pints and would change the size of our standard loaf."
"In addition to imposing meaningless uniformity, both proposals would have imposed immense cost on UK bread-makers and milk processors, because of the re-tooling which would have been required."
"I had met representatives of the bread industry in Northern Ireland and was in doubt as to the intolerable and costly imposition which was involved."
"I am therefore delighted that the European Parliament rejected this aspect of Brussels’ latest crazed proposal."
"If we are to have a functioning European market for goods, it is important for the consumer’s interests too to be safeguarded."
"The changes made by the European Parliament’s Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection to the Commission’s draft legislation laying down rules on nominal quantities for pre-packed products would not, however, bring about such a situation."
"The rapporteur has proposed rules for the packaging of, for example, butter, milk, pasta and rice."
"I want European consumers to be able to choose between many products, and there is no intrinsic value in using regulations to dispense with today’s Swedish milk packs containing, for example, 300 ml of milk."
"Consumers are at present able to decide for themselves what they wish to purchase by comparing prices."
"We must legislate to improve basic conditions of competition and to increase consumer protection."
"However, we must, in accordance with the Commission’s ambition, do away with unnecessary rules."
"I voted therefore in favour of a slimmer but more focused EU, with no place for unnecessary regulation involving unnecessary costs for the food industry."
". In general terms, the proposal for a directive voted on today in plenary at first reading forms part of the drive, backed by the Commission, to simplify internal market legislation."
"The purpose of this proposal is to consolidate the existing legislation in a single act and to repeal (or deregulate) all existing pack sizes."
"Certain sectors will continue, however, to be subject to the existing regulation based on total harmonisation."
"According to the proposal, mandatory ranges could be justified in very specific sectors, such as wines, spirits, soluble coffee, aerosols and white sugar, where Community rules had already fixed harmonised mandatory sizes."
"Parliament has also specified that the directive will not apply to pre-packed bread, spreadable fats, or tea, for which national rules on nominal quantities will continue to apply."
"All sectors may manufacture, and consumers may purchase, products within a potentially infinite range of sizes."
"The report also considers that some other staple foods, namely coffee, butter, salt, rice, pasta and drinking milk, should continue to be subject to mandatory ranges, as a derogation to liberalisation."
"The report discusses a proposal for deregulation but, at the same time, harmonisation of the permitted size of food packaging."
"On the one hand, it may, from the point of view of the internal market, be good to have standards that ultimately benefit the consumer."
"On the other hand, the report includes a proposal for far-reaching detailed regulation at EU level."
"Among the amendments voted through by Parliament’s committee is one stating that studies carried out by the Commission show that unit prices are, in general, neither used nor understood by consumers."
"These statements in some degree declare people in the Member States incapable of managing their own affairs and are thus evidence of an unpleasant attitude towards the population."
"I have today voted against the report because it involves regulation of an area about which decisions should really be made not at EU level but by each Member State."
". I welcome the Commission’s drive to simplify legislation."
"One of the most significant barriers to economic efficiency in EU Member States is excessive legislation and confusing regulations – in other words, what is referred to in English as red tape."
"I am in favour of this proposal to simplify and liberalise, which has been somewhat watered down by the precautionary nature of the amendments tabled by Parliament. Where liberalisation has been proved beyond doubt to serve no useful purpose or even to act against the consumers’ interests, it has been scaled back."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". The implications of some of the Commission proposals on a number of EU industries, in particular the whisky industry in Scotland, would have been negative, so I was glad that the IMCO Committee made a number of changes, which I am pleased to support."
"The internal market has been a massive advantage for EU producers, and we in this house must ensure that those advantages remain to the fore."
"Mr President, there are at the moment two crisis hotspots that demand our complete attention and plenty of sensitivity, and the sort of fine words that we currently hear from the present Austrian Presidency of the Council will not make them go away."
"For a start, we have to handle Hamas’ victory in the Palestinian elections, which, it is clear, must be accepted as an expression of the democratic will."
"Hamas is, however, a movement that has not yet renounced violence, while the Palestinian people need help from Europe – including financial aid – more than ever."
"We will of course, in the event of Hamas forming a government, have to demand of it that it renounces violence."
"Turning to Iran, it is to be hoped that it is not yet too late for what we would prefer to see, that being a diplomatic solution, which would of course have to be agreed with Russia and China."
"Since Iran appears to be amenable to talks with Russia on uranium enrichment, that is the first line of approach we should attempt, but it is also important to express our opposition to nuclear cooperation between the USA and India, which seems to confirm Teheran’s negative estimate of the USA as a ‘self-appointed global policeman’ and as a hypocritical one at that."
". I will be voting in favour of the Brok report on common foreign and security policy."
"We have seen the successive development in Europe of Industrial, Social and Economic and Monetary Union."
"We now have a Union bigger than the US with 451 million citizens and an economy more powerful than that of the US. Yet we still lack a single voice in the world."
"What Europe is missing is a common foreign and security policy that would give us that voice."
"Mr Brok’s report moves us in the right direction."
"We will have many battles over the details of such a policy."
"But need one we do and have one we must."
"Once again, a report on the EU’s common foreign and security policy, or CFSP, has appeared on the agenda."
"It is the June List’s firm conviction that issues relating to foreign and security policy should be dealt with not by the EU but at the level of the Member States."
"The report also states that the European Parliament must be consulted when common foreign and security policy guidelines are devised at the beginning of each year."
"In that way, Parliament is trying to appropriate more power for itself, something to which the June List is opposed."
"For the above-mentioned reasons, I have voted against the report in today’s vote."
". The European Parliamentary Labour Party commends Mr Brok's report for its commitment to a strong CFSP, with an emphasis on conflict resolution, the fight against poverty and upholding human rights."
"We thank the Rapporteur for his condolences in respect of the London bombings."
"However, I also want to place on record our support for the trade and aid regulations for northern Cyprus, rather that the wording of Amendment 1, together with our longstanding opposition to military spending falling under the Community budget."
". I welcome this report, which stipulates that Parliament asserts the right to be consulted more effectively and to play a more active role in the EU’s common foreign and security policy and European Security and Defence Policy."
"The AFET Committee’s report sets out priorities needed to prevent conflicts and build international cooperation founded on respect for human rights and international law."
". I voted in favour of the report before us, because I identify with its broad thrust, both in terms of what are – and should be – the main grounds for concern at international level, and in terms of what the EU’s priorities should be in this regard."
"Although I do not subscribe entirely to some of the points that it makes, especially on institutional matters, I feel that the general worldview that emerges here is the right one."
"I also believe that the EU’s international role depends more on practical action and on our ability to understand common concerns than on any discussion of theoretical models."
"When it comes to external policy, reality is, as a rule, more powerful than any theoretical consideration."
"Lastly, I am happy to note that the tone of agreement between the transatlantic partners is on the rise, which strikes me as a vital element on the road to peace, democracy and prosperity in the world."
". Conservatives can support certain provisions in this Report, such as the recommendations to maintain the arms embargo on China, revive negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and make African governments fulfil their commitments to democracy and the rule of law."
"However, it also contains many proposals to which we are firmly opposed."
"In general it seeks to extend the reach of CFSP into every area of national foreign policy."
"Paragraph 4 brazenly lists the measures taken ""to anticipate the application of some of the provisions of the new Constitutional Treaty"" despite the welcome rejection of the Constitution."
"Paragraph 10 mistakenly considers ""home defence as a vital part of the European Union's security strategy"", whereas it is the preserve of national governments."
"NATO, the cornerstone of European defence for over half a century and the key organisation for international crisis management missions involving military forces, barely warrants a mention in this report, with paragraph 12 misleadingly subsuming NATO to a role ""within Europe's foreign and security policy."""
"We also object to the idea of an EU military mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo and for an EU defence budget."
"We therefore abstained in the final vote."
"We voted in favour of the report."
"We interpret the concept of a ‘minimum income’, which appears in paragraph 4 f), as signifying a guaranteed reasonable standard of living, as we are well disposed towards a guaranteed reasonable standard of living but opposed to the introduction of state-regulated minimum wages."
"The Swedish Conservative delegation has today chosen to abstain from voting in a vote on the current situation in combating violence against women and any future action."
"We have not been able to support the report because it to an unduly large degree seeks to make national areas of competence subject to EU decision-making."
"We are firmly convinced that issues concerning gender equality and policy on crime should be decided on by the Member States, which are best placed to make decisions in these areas."
"The Conservatives have set the pace at national level when it comes to many of the measures discussed in the report."
"We believe that the state must fulfil its primary task, namely that of protecting people from criminal attacks, irrespective of the victim’s and the perpetrator’s genders."
"We should place the emphasis on the responsibility of the individual perpetrator of violence instead of proceeding on the basis of a view of society that reduces the responsibility of the individual."
". Parliament must express its concern regarding violence against women."
"This is a phenomenon that affects women of all ages, levels of education and social backgrounds, although there are some forms of violence that are strongly linked to poverty and social exclusion."
"We support the recommendation that the Member States adopt a zero tolerance approach to all forms of violence against women, which entails implementing effective methods of prevention and punishment, and measures aimed at raising awareness of the problem and at combating it."
"It should not be forgotten that violence by men against women is a phenomenon associated with the unequal distribution of power between the sexes, which in itself is a further reason why this type of crime has not been sufficiently reported and condemned."
"I welcome the adoption – albeit only partial – of some of the proposals that we tabled, especially the acknowledgement that poverty and marginalisation are underlying causes of the rise in the trafficking of women and that prostitution is not tantamount to a job."
"I regret, however, the rejection of the proposal aimed at setting up the resources required to develop effective programmes for integrating women involved in prostitution, with the aim of gradually reducing and ultimately eliminating prostitution."
"I share many of the rapporteur’s views on this subject."
"It is extremely important that public awareness of these issues be raised in the Member States."
"I have voted in favour of the report because it does not expressly recommend legislation at EU level."
"A number of recommendations are presented to both the Commission and the Member States with a view to combating violence against women."
"I believe that this issue is ultimately one regarding which the national parliaments should take any legislative measures that may be necessary."
". Violence against women is a traumatic experience, not only for the women themselves, but also for their children, their relatives and even for those who try and help the victims."
"I have personal experience of this."
"I once drove a woman who had been beaten up by her husband to hospital and to the police station."
"On that occasion I was seized by an emotion that is probably often felt by women."
"It was a powerless rage."
"One feels this same rage on hearing that the police have taken a drunken man convicted of ill-treating his family back to his former wife’s home and hear the police justify their action on the grounds that the man’s last registered domicile was at his former wife’s home."
"A few years ago a tragedy occurred in my own home town."
"A man got out of one of the centres where drunkards are taken to sober up."
"These centres are not prisons."
"The man managed to walk a couple of kilometres, killed his wife and threw her body out of the window."
"I do not want anything like that to happen again."
"Violence is not a domestic matter."
"It can never be justified or perceived in relative terms."
"The whole of society must make a stand against violence."
"We cannot allow this problem to be sidelined or understate its importance for society."
"We must not play down the scale of the phenomenon either."
"I supported Mrs Carlshamre’s report because we are bound to do all in our power to eliminate violence against women."
"The zero tolerance principle is not always necessary, but on this occasion it really is essential."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues deplore all violence against women."
"Indeed, we deplore violence against both sexes being perpetrated by both sexes, or by anyone against anyone."
"We also believe that women must be protected from violent acts and those responsible for such acts should face the full force of the law."
"However, we have abstained on this report as it is a missed opportunity to address a serious problem."
"The intemperate language detracts from the important message the report is trying to send out."
". I welcome this report, which reaffirms that men’s violence against women is a violation of human rights and that perpetrators of such violence should be prosecuted as vigorously as in those cases where violence is directed at men."
"There is a discrepancy between how crimes of violence are treated and punished depending on the gender of the victim."
"Whether such violence occurs in a public environment or in a private environment should not be relevant in tackling such violence as a criminal offence."
"Whilst recognising that the declaration on the elimination of violence against women adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1993 was an important milestone in the recognition of the problem of domestic violence against women, this report rightly stresses that, in the EU context, more can be done."
"I especially support its calls for a fundamental analysis of the extent of the problem following studies carried out in three EU countries showing that 40-50% of women had, at some point in their lives, been subjected to violence by a man."
"In the EU we have a duty to recognise and ensure the rights of women to life and physical safety under the rule of law."
". Issues in connection with women’s rights were among the problems resulting from the massive influx of other cultures to which, for decades, a blind eye was turned through misconceived tolerance."
"It is clear from the facts, not least that one in every four women in the EU suffers violence at the hands of a male family member, that half of all murders are committed within the family and that genital mutilation is carried out on some 500 000 women, that it is high time that we started to clamp down on this once and for all."
"It can therefore be seen as nothing other than a disgrace that it appears to be possible, in this EU of ours, to enact regulations on the curvature of cucumbers and bananas, but not to devise across-the-board rules on how violence against women is to be punished."
"It is no less pathetic when state offices turn a blind eye to instances of polygamy or even take a supportive attitude towards it and thereby further encourage the abuse of human rights."
"Laudable though it is for the Presidency of the Council to respond to this state of affairs by declaring its intention to do more to defend women’s rights, getting doctors, teachers and the police to provide a modicum more information will not be enough."
"The main problem has to do with the role models presented to men; those in our own Western society are competitive in nature, which is not absolutely ideal, but those in Muslim ideology go as far as to exemplify hatred of women."
"That is where we must start."
".At least a third of women will at some point in their lives have been victims of a physical or sexual assault."
"That is the alarming figure taken from the excellent report by my colleague from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mrs Maria Carlshamre."
"Faced with the escalation of violence against women and the way in which it is becoming an everyday phenomenon, there is only one firm, appropriate answer: zero tolerance whether the violence takes place in, or outside, the marriage."
"Europe has, moreover, faced up to its responsibilities in order to combat this form of violence affecting women from every social group."
"Under the Daphne II Programme, EUR 50 million are being dedicated between 2004-2008 to protecting those women among us who are most at risk."
"This is a symbolic amount because we are well aware that, if the prevention and victim support policies are to be effective, then they have to be carried out on a national basis."
"It is therefore alarming to learn that, each year, between five and ten million children see and hear inhuman acts of this kind take place."
"It is therefore crucial that the 25 national criminal sets of legislation from now on consider children, like their mothers, to be victims."
"Our society has for too long underestimated the seriousness of violent acts against women."
"We must put a stop to this cowardice."
". My reasons for supporting this report are many and deep."
"For most people in society violence against women is abhorrent, but we know it exists."
"Violence between people who know each other, such as partners, needs to be treated extremely seriously by the authorities."
"I support the actions proposed to facilitate changes, especially in the area of trafficking and domestic violence."
".I voted in favour of the excellent report by my fellow Member, Mrs Edite Estrela, on equality between women and men in the European Union, and I am delighted that it should have been adopted almost unanimously by the European Parliament."
"Equal opportunities form part of France’s great republican principles, and I argue for them to be respected at European level in accordance, for example, with the Treaty of Rome instituting the European Community and with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Any inequality based on a person’s gender is a source of injustice, social violence and incomprehension among our fellow citizens."
"The European Union has a duty to ensure the equal treatment of human beings, which is a source of harmony, peace and progress."
"By doing this, the EU will set a clear example to the whole world in favour of the human values that we champion and that together constitute one of the pillars of European integration."
"The Swedish Conservative delegation has today chosen to abstain from voting in a vote on equality between women and men in the EU."
"We Conservatives wish to combat the lack of freedom entailed by inequality and prejudices."
"It is not, however, the EU’s task to define which measures should be taken in the Member States or by other actors in society."
"We cannot, therefore, support the report, which makes numerous proposals that encroach on the Member States’ areas of competence, for example proposals concerning the provision of child care, where the Member States’ traditions and distinctive cultural features are so widely different from one another."
"What is more, the report strays into areas that not even the Member States should regulate, for example that of whether political parties are examining strategies for getting more women into their party structures."
"There are, however, other important matters discussed in the report, for example the need to gather comparable statistics concerning, respectively, men’s and women’s wages and concerning the fight against discrimination."
". We voted in favour of this report because we endorse its content."
"We are aware, however, that it is merely another statement of intent on Parliament’s part, at variance with the policies already put in place, which, in some cases, are undermining equal rights and exacerbating discrimination, for example in the labour market."
"We welcome the adoption of a proposal urging the Commission to notify Parliament of the progress made in the various Member States with regard to the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, not least in the area of reproductive and sexual health, and to disclose statistical data on all Member States."
"We also hope that the European Institute for Equality Between Men and Women will be given the necessary resources whereby it can make a positive contribution towards the promotion of equal rights and towards ensuring that women are treated with the dignity that they deserve."
". I welcome the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality’s own-initiative report on the future of the Lisbon Strategy with regard to the gender perspective."
"I agree that measures must be taken to promote employment for women as well as reduce the continuing inequalities between women and men."
"The report stresses the disparities that still exist in underlying factors such as employment, the wage gap, lifelong education and training."
"It also assesses the ways in which professional, family and private life can be successfully combined."
".Dealing with equality between men and women means above all being aware of just how far things have come in over a century and since the initial struggles for female emancipation, but it also means keeping in mind how much still needs to be done if gender equality is to become an integral part of everyday life."
"That is why I welcome the adoption this lunchtime of Mrs Estrela’s report, which points out various forms of discrimination that are suffered by members of the female sex and that therefore constitute so many challenges to be taken up."
"To mention only two of them: a pay gap estimated at 16% and an employment rate of females aged between 15 and 24 that is stagnant, despite women in this age group being educated to a higher level."
"Removing the obstacles to women entering the job market obviously means putting in place a sufficient number of public or private amenities for young children, and this at least until the latter reach compulsory school age."
"It also means applying in practice equal parental rights."
"In order to ensure all of these improvements to people’s everyday lives, the European Union must champion the best standards and raise their sights and aspire to the success of the Scandinavian countries where gender equality measures are concerned."
". – The Communist Party of Greece voted against the report, because it uses social problems of the working classes to speed up and extend capitalist restructurings which affect both sexes."
"In order to combat female unemployment, it is proposed to extend 'flexible forms of employment'."
"For the lack of state welfare structures, it is proposed to shift the burden to the family, but equally."
"In other words, for men too to take recourse to part-time employment in order to replace the lack of state care in reproduction and care of the elderly and disabled, meaning that working class families will ultimately be unable to meet fundamental needs."
"The so-called abolition of sexual discrimination at work has been used as an alibi for removing rights derived from the specific needs of women due to their reproductive function."
"We condemn as disorientating the talk about changing the gender composition of power."
"Policy is not determined by gender."
"The power of the plutocracy will not change with more women in the institutions that serve it."
"Women's problems are rooted in the capitalist system which exploits women and men, using gender and age to spread the capitalist policy to both sexes."
"The basis for equality can only be laid within the framework of grass-roots power, in which grass-roots wealth comes through production and the goods produced."
"– As regards the vote on the postal directive, I feel it is extremely important to mention the need to maintain guaranteed universal service."
"The completion of the internal market in postal services needs to take account not only of the sector’s economic importance, but also its irreplaceable territorial and social dimension."
"The local services provided by the post office in each Member State play a considerable social role that we must not dispense with."
"We must therefore pay particular attention to the territorial and social dimension of postal networks when we are called on to make decisions on the reforms in the sector, in light of the far-reaching impact that those decisions may have when the postal services are entirely opened up to competition."
"I therefore feel it is crucial that the planned study analyse whether the provisions of the postal directive are sufficiently clear as regards the obligation to provide a universal service and whether an adequate framework is established for the Member States."
"We must not jeopardise the directive’s key objective, which is to guarantee minimum Community-level territorial and social postal services, at a certain quality and at affordable prices."
"The liberalisation of postal services forms part of the so-called ‘Lisbon Strategy’, and is aimed at opening up the sector to private capital. The ultimate aim is to privatise this public sector, starting with the most profitable sections, and ‘obviously’ continuing to be supported by public funding (the model applied to hospital management being a case in point)."
"The struggle of the workers in the sector, and that of the people – I refer in particular to the numerous demonstrations against post office closures and in favour of ensuring postal delivery – has succeeded in delaying and in some cases actually blocking this process, in some of its most detrimental aspects."
"The purpose of this report by Parliament is to assess the impact thus far of the liberalisation in the EU Member States, ahead of new initiatives by the Commission aimed at deepening it."
"The report fails to criticise the current process of liberalisation, or to expose the detrimental consequences thereof, such as the closure of outlets, the cuts to daily home delivery and the reduction in employment levels; it does quite the opposite, in fact."
"It also fails to call into question the liberalisation of the sector in 2009, promoting instead the opening up of the sector and the primacy of competition in this regard."
"Hence our vote against."
". The year 1997 saw the beginning of the liberalisation process in the European postal market, the intention of which was to create an open market accessible to every service provider in what are now 25 Member States."
"The national postal services responded to the pressure from this liberalisation process by starting to change their structures and to reposition themselves."
"All this progress notwithstanding, the transposition of the directive at national level needs to be closely observed."
"It is, for example, unacceptable that Austrian postal legislation should impose disproportionately high sanctions on those who omit to fit new letterboxes on their houses."
"That is not something for which the EU’s 2002 Post Directive can be blamed, for it prescribed no such sanctions at national level."
"Implementing directives in this way further encourages the public in their sceptical attitude towards the EU, and in their belief that the responsibility for this state of affairs lies with Brussels and nowhere else."
"I call on the Commission to monitor the transposition of the Postal Directive with a particular view to ensuring that the penalties planned at national level are not disproportionate and do not imperil the functioning of the postal market."
"This should be given priority as a matter for examination in the forthcoming prospective study."
"Since this own-initiative report makes the same demand as I do, I welcome it."
". The situation is extremely complicated but the election results should not be used to undermine the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to freedom, to an independent sovereign state, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and to resist the occupation."
"Nor should they be used to jeopardise financial aid to the Palestinian Authority, which meets the most basic needs of the Palestinian people, or to fuel the USA’s increasing military involvement throughout the Middle East."
"It is as vital as ever to show solidarity with the heroic struggle of the Palestinian people and with the Palestinian national movement."
"Lastly I wish to express my disappointment that the majority in Parliament rejected the amendments tabled by our group, which called on Israel to abide by United Nations resolutions and the recommendations made by the International Court of Justice, and which sought to bring to the top of our list of priorities the need to put an end to the impasse in the peace process, to military occupation, to the settlements, to the wall, to assassinations, to detentions, to refusals to release prisoners, to the violence to which the Palestinian people are subjected and to the dramatic fall in their living conditions."
". I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Palestine."
"While we are right to call on Hamas to recognise Israel and end terrorism, we should not bring into question the outcome of fair and free democratic elections."
"The EU must continue to give aid to the Palestinian people and remain fully engaged as a member of the Quartet pushing the ‘roadmap for peace’."
". When democracy engenders an unwanted result, there is a temptation to condemn the idea that such an outcome can happen."
"This is understandable, but of little value."
"What democracy must strive to do is to act effectively to stop people from joining such movements."
"What is far from certain is that there is democracy in Palestine, regardless of the regular elections that have taken place, and this is where our concerns should lie."
"Democracy and the rule of law, which imply, , peaceful coexistence with other countries, not wishing to destroy one’s neighbours and, obviously, eliminating terrorism, must be the cornerstone of our policy in relation to this part of the world."
"Irrespective of the current nature of the movement that has won the Palestinian election, the important thing now is to demand that the government-elect of the Palestinian Authority respect international agreements and uphold the principles required for the peaceful coexistence of the two countries, without which it will be impossible to help the Palestinians."
"Despite the fact that this result reflects the will of the people, the potential consequences remain very serious."
". The election of Hamas was the democratic will of the Palestinian people, and while I have grave misgivings about the policies of that organisation, there is no question that they form the legitimate government."
"The aid the EU gives to the peace process can, and indeed must, be conditional upon continued moves towards peace."
"To shut off the aid now would risk alienating an organisation the EU must remain engaged with. I believe continued application of EU pressure will help to deliver a long-term solution."
"We cannot disengage now because of distaste for individual partners we are obliged to work with."
". Today I voted for the joint resolution on Cuba, though I would have preferred it to have expressly regretted the 2005 abandonment of sanctions."
"As a society built on the imperative of Marxist domination, it is no surprise that Cuba is a bastion of repression, where dissent is crushed and freedom denied."
"It is a telling insight into the totalitarian and Marxist reality, which lurks behind its democratic facade, that Sinn Fein/IRA maintains representation in Cuba."
"It was most notoriously exposed when, in 2001, that representative, Niall Connolly, infamously organised for himself and others to train FARC guerrillas in Columbia."
"The EU’s abandonment of sanctions in 2005 has been an utter failure."
"Human rights abuses have increased, not diminished."
"As ever with Marxist extremists, be they Castro or Sinn Fein, they simply pocket the concessions and carry on regardless."
"I say it is time we learnt the lesson and put some steel back into our stand against this hideous regime."
"."
"Cuba leaves a great deal to be desired in terms of fundamental freedoms, as is evident from both the oral question and the present, otherwise adequate, resolution."
"There is one issue which I would like to highlight, and that is the position of house churches."
"New legislation contained in Directive 43 and Resolution 46 requires all operational house communities to register with the authorities."
"It is a regular occurrence that applications for registration result in extremely complicated negotiations with the authorities."
"These involve detailed information about the community members and their pastors."
"This new legislation has already resulted in the closure of several house churches."
"In 1992, the Cuban authorities changed the constitution, the effect being to change the country from an atheist state to a secular one."
"That was a first step in the right direction."
"New legislation, however, appears to reflect a trend towards new restrictions."
"While the Cuban constitution recognises the right of the citizens to freedom of religion, restrictions are increasingly being imposed."
"Why are Christian churches, including those that are registered, so closely scrutinised, checked out and even infiltrated?"
"This hardly amounts to real freedom of religion in Cuba."
"I would ask the Council and Commission to broach these issues in talks with the Cuban authorities."
". I voted against the resolution, because I object to its content, which takes absolutely no account of the context in which Cuba has been forced to live for many years, namely the US embargo and all of the attacks that Cuba has suffered."
"The resolution also omits any reference to the existence of the US base at Guantanamo, where the Bush Administration is holding prisoners without trial and is riding roughshod over human rights and the Geneva Convention."
"It also makes no reference to the five Cuban citizens still being held in the USA, some of whom are not allowed to receive family visits, this despite the court in Atlanta overturning the ruling that had led to their initial detention."
"This position held by the majority in Parliament is very much one of double standards, and toes the US line, which is one of continuous pressure on people and governments failing to follow its guidelines and resisting subjugation."
"It is similarly disappointing that there is not one word about the important contribution that Cuba is making to the social development of the people of Latin America and Africa. Young people from these areas go to Cuba to receive training and education, and Cuba sends thousands of doctors and other professionals to other countries."
". I will vote with reluctance for this resolution."
"The situation of human rights in Cuba is by no means perfect and on some occasions the Cuban authorities have been their own worst enemies in refusing permission for representatives of the to travel to Strasbourg to receive their share of the Sakharov Prize recently."
"Yet there is, in my opinion, no climate of fear in Havana, such as that I have witnessed in Kashmir or, until recently, Aceh."
"There is an issue of proportionality."
"Yes, Cuba violates human rights but not to the extent of Colombia with its death squads or Haiti with the anarchy of criminal gangs and violent politics which have seen more than 1000 deaths."
"Hopefully next week’s elections there might start to bring that to an end."
"Where is Parliament’s constant concern on these and other human rights in the region outside of Cuba?"
"Where are our concerns about ‘occupied’ Cuba in Guantanamo Bay, where reports indicate that the situation is far worse than Cuba’s worst jails?"
"Of course I believe that Cuba should be a parliamentary democracy."
"I also believe, however, that foreign policy is a national matter and that multilateral channels, such as the UN, are the only acceptable alternative for influencing countries not in the immediate vicinity of the EU."
"For the above-mentioned reasons, I have voted against the resolution."
". Two hundred words will never be enough to undo yet another manoeuvre that forms part of the EU’s policy of isolation and discrimination against Cuba, which panders to the demands of the USA."
"This is the same EU that, lest we forget, called for a change to the political system in Cuba in its 1996 common position, thereby interfering in an issue that is exclusively the responsibility of the Cuban people."
"The majority in this very Parliament, in a cynical move, criticised the US embargo on Cuba, yet also called for continued sanctions imposed on Cuba by the EU. Furthermore, it does not manage one single word of solidarity with the five Cuban patriots held in the USA for defending their country against terrorism."
"Though it pains the majority in the House, Cuba means hope for, and confidence in, a decent life for millions of men and women."
"This is a country that, in spite of the embargo, achieved the highest economic growth in the past 45 years in 2005, a country that is set to take on the presidency of the non-aligned movement and to host its 2006 summit, and a country that sends thousands of doctors, teachers and sports coaches to other countries, rather than armies to occupy, exploit and oppress."
". Cuba is proof that in the western world not all of the walls of shame have come down."
"Between the absurd idealism of some and the shameless pragmatism of others, there have been those who seem determined to forget that in Cuba there is no democracy, no human rights, no freedom, nothing that we would consider to be the essential building blocks of our societies."
"No unfathomable romanticism, nor pragmatism, can justify any change to the essential position: consistent condemnation of Cuba and calls for democratisation, without which it will not be possible to maintain close ties with this tyrannical government."
". I have voted for the joint motion for a resolution on Cuba, but it is missing several important facts in the political context."
"The main problem in the Cuban situation is caused by the US-led blockade and the aggressive US threats against Cuba."
"Putting an end to the blockade and stopping the aggressive threats by the US would be the most important step in creating an atmosphere in which there would be better possibilities to create true democracy in Cuba."
"But the aggressive US policy is not the only reason for the severe restrictions on freedom of expression and democracy in Cuba."
"The Cuban Government has also its own individual responsibility to bear."
"One example, among others, is the decision not to let the Sakharov Prize winners, the leave the country to receive the prize in Strasbourg."
"I have voted for the resolution, but I protest against the Cuban Government’s travel ban on the ."
". I have voted in favour of the proposed resolution on Cuba, even though it is missing several important facts in the political context."
"The main problem in the Cuban situation is caused by the US-lead blockade and the aggressive US threats against Cuba."
"Putting an end to the blockade and stopping the aggressive threats by the US would be the most important step in creating an atmosphere in which there would be better possibilities to create a true democracy in Cuba."
"But the aggressive US policy is not the only reason for the severe restrictions on freedom of expression and democracy in Cuba."
"The Cuban government also has its own individual responsibility to bear."
"One example, among others, is the decision not to let the Sakharov prize-winners, the , leave the country to receive the prize in Strasbourg."
"I am voting in favour of the resolution, despite its imperfections, since I want to protest against the Cuban government’s travel ban on the ."
". I reject this resolution on Cuba, which is one-sided and does no justice whatsoever to the complexities of real life in that country."
"If we condemn Cuba,"
"– we are treating as of no account that country’s efforts at developing in another way, which it is doing in the teeth of resistance from many quarters;"
"– we are ignoring Cuba’s exemplary achievement in making provision for its people’s welfare, which it continues to do despite the American embargo and serious economic problems;"
"– we are denying that the continued existence of the Cuban system offers a glimmer of hope to those in the so-called Third World who are on the losing side in a globalised world in which markets and profits matter more than anything else."
"This resolution takes a reductivist view of the concept of human rights, and the way it makes use of them betrays an intolerable dual morality."
"This resolution is not aimed at defending human rights, but rather at condemning the Cuban system and contributing to its downfall."
"I will have no part in it."
". The implementation of the Community budget, that is, ensuring that political decisions are actually implemented, is an extremely important issue."
"Unfortunately the budgetary process is increasingly less transparent and more scattered, making it difficult to ascertain the final destination of funds."
"The budget savings imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact and by the major contributing countries has meant that, following adoption of the annual Community budget, many priority areas are underfunded, which has led to a policy of redistribution and cuts across the budgetary headings and countless amending budgets."
"In other words, non-execution is encouraged in certain areas to finance others, regardless of the adopted budget."
"There are also policies and instruments such as the Stability and Growth Pact, that are factors in non-implementation."
"In this regard, the Commission and the Council cannot wash their hands of their responsibilities, in view of the constant reduction in payments in respect of authorisations."
"National implementation must go hand in hand with the definition of national priorities on the ground, especially when it comes to the Structural Funds."
"Irrespective of the instruments that have just been proposed, we do not think that the negotiations on the new financial perspective should be contingent on the proposals being adopted."
". The motion for a resolution on which we have just voted highlights the need for new management measures to be taken for the Mediterranean."
"Care must always be taken to uphold the principle that the sustainability of fishery resources must be guaranteed in order to ensure that fisheries activities are viable, that fleets can continue to operate, that jobs can be maintained and that fishing communities can be developed."
"We therefore feel that the Council must adopt the management regulation on which Parliament has now given its opinion."
"Given that the current situation may result in discrimination among fishermen operating in other waters, however, we believe that there must be effective decentralisation and that the main stakeholders, namely the fishermen and their representative bodies, must be involved in management decisions, given that practical measures must reflect the specific realities of each fishing area or region."
"We also feel that the management regulation should be accompanied by the necessary measures to compensate for the social and economic impact caused by the regulation itself, with Community funding. All measures must be based on scientific fisheries research."
". There are many instances where an EU of 25 states does not make sense, and one-size-fits-all does not work any more – if it ever did."
"There is no reason why I as a Scottish Member of this house should have a say over the Mediterranean, and I have accordingly abstained on this vote."
"The EU needs to find new ways of working to ensure legitimacy of our decisions."
"Continuing the notion that everyone is equally interested in everything is untenable and discredits the EU itself."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 2 February 2006."
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 9 February 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"The secretariat has just received three requests for amendments to the agenda presented by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Strictly speaking, according to the Rules of Procedure, these requests have not been presented on time and they should therefore not be taken into consideration."
"Nevertheless, the President believes that, since the time difference was very small and also in view of the political importance of the matter, they should be taken into account."
"I would insist that this is being done in spite of the fact that they have not been presented on time and only if no political group objects."
"I believe that there have been consultations in this regard."
"We shall listen firstly to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck who will present the request that in the debate on the right to freedom of expression and respect for religious beliefs, there should not be just one speaker per political group, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents, but that there should be a list of speakers according to the normal procedure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the opportunity I am being given to say a few words in connection with the order of business on Wednesday morning, in respect of which I should like to make a suggestion on behalf of my group."
"First of all, I suggest the speaking time on Wednesday morning be divided up evenly over the various groups and individuals, thus ensuring that more time can be devoted to the crucial debate under item 1."
"Secondly, we suggest that, should it prove necessary to move one of the items of debate to a later session, that this be the item concerning Bosnia and Herzegovina, not because we see it as unimportant, but because it is less urgent, and it will be equally useful to discuss it during a future session."
"Thirdly and lastly, we would like to round off the first item on the order of business with a resolution."
"I would like to thank the President once again for his understanding."
"I would ask the Members and other groups to support this proposal."
"We shall examine the proposals one by one, because there is not just one, but several."
"The first is that the list of speakers should not be restricted to the Presidents or spokespeople of the political groups; the second, as Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck has explained, asks that the item conclude with a resolution; and the third, which only makes sense in the event that either of the first two proposals are approved, asks for another item, the statements on Bosnia-Herzegovina, to be postponed."
"We shall take them one by one: firstly we shall debate and vote on whether or not there should be a list of speakers."
"If we want to be logical, then we have to voice our opinions about the three requests at the same time."
"It would not make sense to accept one of the requests and to reject the others."
"I therefore call on you to open the debate by dealing with the three requests at the same time, because they are linked."
"Personally speaking, I will come out against the three requests because there is a logic in all of this that needs to be respected."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, excuse me but I believe that they are two completely different things: whether or not there is a resolution is one thing."
"The number of people speaking in the debate is quite another."
"Mr President, the point made by Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck is one that we, in the Conference of Presidents, have discussed in a wider context, and what I said there I shall also say here on behalf of my group."
"We do believe that the adoption of a resolution at the present time is not advisable, whereas, by contrast, it is advisable to limit the speaking time in such a very important debate to one speaker from each group."
"We therefore take the view that what was decided by the Conference of Presidents, what is set out here in the order of business, should stay the way it is."
"Mr President, we always listen to you, not only out of respect for your office but also out of regard for you personally."
"We must, of course, vote on these points one by one, but they are interconnected, and so I have to say something about how and why that is so."
"Let me say at the outset, though, that this is something that we could have sorted out on Thursday in the Conference of Presidents."
"I was the only one to demand, on behalf of my group, not only a resolution but also a debate."
"As the Liberals were very definitely opposed to the idea, I am astonished that they have now put forward this motion, but that is their right."
"We have just now – while in a meeting of our group – been informed that the Liberals were making this request."
"To one part of it, we say ‘yes’; to another, we say ‘no’."
"We say ‘no’ to a general debate right now, since that would require us to remove an item from the order of business, and that we do not want to do."
"We therefore recommend that this House should, in March or at some appropriate time, have a wide-ranging debate on this issue, but, as far as a resolution is concerned, our group did – as in the past – take the view that we need one."
"That being so, Mr President, you are quite right to have us vote on the individual points separately."
"Mr President, now that the two big groups have realised that everything is connected, we too can depict everything in its proper context."
"For a start, Mr Poettering is right to say that the Liberals, in the Conference of Presidents, said that they were not in favour of a broader debate and not in favour of a resolution either."
"It was we who, in the Conference of Presidents, expressed the desire for a resolution."
"We do not think that the number of speakers matters, but we certainly do think it right that more speakers should be given the floor if the groups feel the need for it."
"We are always, as a matter of principle, in favour of resolutions, and we see it as important that this House should adopt one."
"We are, however, dead against the idea that the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be taken out of the debate, for the issue of the constitution is a live one in Bosnia at the moment, and it is of the utmost importance that this House should deliver a position in the aftermath of so many American initiatives."
"It would therefore be absurd to defer discussion of it, and we are against that."
"If we do not manage to adopt a resolution now, then we can go down the third way and have a debate now and leave dealing with the resolution to the next part-session."
"We shall now vote on the proposal of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that there should be more than one speaker per group."
"We shall now vote on whether to accept or reject the proposal of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that the debate should conclude with a resolution."
"Mr President, that is something of which we have to take note."
"The question arises of whether we can come back to Mr Cohn-Bendit’s proposal that, in view of the current situation and Mr Solana’s visit to these countries, we could adopt the resolution at the next part-session."
"I see that as a reasonable compromise on which we might agree."
"The time for negotiations has passed, Mr Swoboda."
"We have voted."
"– Mr President, please excuse me."
"It is true that the time for compromises has already passed, but the request by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe arrived after the deadline."
"Therefore, we are debating a compromise now only because we were unable to do so previously."
"Mrs Frassoni, I asked earlier whether anybody had any objection to the proposals being debated despite the fact that they had arrived late, and nobody expressed any opposition."
"The vote cannot be invalidated."
"Mr President, I would never take the liberty of invalidating a vote."
"I merely asked that Mr Swoboda’s request to postpone this resolution until the next part-session be put to the vote."
"Mr President, a member of the Liberal Group has put several motions to the House."
"The Rules of Procedure provide for a decision for or against them."
"We in this plenary, rather than discussing whether to vote for or against a motion intended to correct a decision by the Conference of Presidents, are staging a rerun of it."
"The only speakers in this debate are group chairmen arguing against their decision being corrected, and the reference to Mr Solana is obviously meant to indicate that the House is willing to refrain from exerting its influence, but the fact is that, if we wait until he has got back, this House will scarcely be able to have any influence on his policy."
"I propose that we stick to the Rules of Procedure and call speakers to speak for or against, rather than having the House repeat what has been said in the Conference of Presidents."
"We have already voted, Mr Voggenhuber."
"We now have to see whether there is another proposal that can be put to the vote."
"Mr President, I regret having to say this as much as I regret our being in the situation we are in, but we have just voted on whether there is to be a resolution."
"We said yes to one, and if there is to be one, it has to be voted on this week and not in March or at some even later date."
"I can tell Mr Poettering that I am opposed, and I also want to explain why."
"This week, this whole House is going to have its hands full of this Services Directive, and I see no chance of a proper resolution and compromise in these three days."
"That, after all, is why we proposed it last week!"
"That is why I think Mr Swoboda’s suggestion is a sensible one."
"This House does indeed need a resolution on this issue, but it also needs to be given the chance to put a proper resolution together, and that is why we should start the debate now and then follow it up by voting on this resolution at the next part-session."
"That would be the sensible thing to do."
"All you will be able to adopt in these three days is banalities, and I believe that this issue deserves better than that."
"Mr President, I am in absolute agreement with what Mr Cohn-Bendit has said, but I would also like to say that I am rather irritated about much of what has been going on here."
"I had, quite properly, spoken to a motion on the order of business, on which one can speak in favour or against;"
"I spoke in favour of the motion and you reprimanded me for it, saying that we had asked for a debate, and I still cannot follow your reasoning."
"We are now having a debate, and Mr Voggenhuber is complaining that that is not right either, on the grounds that only group chairmen are speaking."
"Somehow or other, then, we have to get some structure behind what we are doing, and so I will now put it to you that if the motion from the Liberal Group was called for debate despite being received outside the specified timeframe, then there is no less justification for my colleague Mr Swoboda’s motion that, it having been decided that a resolution is to be drafted, we ask that the vote on it be deferred until the next mini-plenary in Brussels, which is the first possible opportunity to do so."
"I would ask that we now have a vote, as the rules of procedure require, following one speaker in favour and one against."
"Very good, now we have the proposal of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, on which the Presidency will allow a vote, that the vote on this resolution take place at the next part-session in Brussels."
"Mr President, I would just like to point out that there is – thank heavens – to be no mini-plenary in Brussels; instead the next proper plenary session is here in Strasbourg."
"Very good, thank you for your observation."
"Mr President, this conflict is being discussed not only throughout Europe, not just in all the newspapers, not just by the man and woman in the street day in and day out; it is a conflict with profound implications and is being talked about around the world."
"It surely cannot be the case that one institution alone does not discuss it, does not adopt a resolution on it, that the European Parliament, which the people elected to represent them, should choose to keep silent about one of the greatest conflicts Europe has seen."
"It just cannot be true!"
"We shall proceed to the vote on the proposal of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament that the vote on the resolution should take place during the next part-session."
"We still have to vote on the third proposal from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that an item on the agenda be postponed, namely the Outlook for Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"I believe that there has been enormous confusion in the debate and in the vote that has taken place."
"Since the House has accepted that there should be just one speaker per group, there is no reason to alter the agenda and the debate will remain as scheduled and approved by the Conference of Presidents."
"The only thing that is changing, Mr President, is that there will be a resolution, nothing more."
"We will all have to be disciplined in our use of speaking time so that we can deal with all of the subjects and none is left out."
"If you promise to do that, we will not have to alter the agenda."
"(1)"
"– I should like to welcome the 30th anniversary, on 27 February, of the proclamation of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, and in so doing to pay tribute to the Sahrawi people’s just struggle for freedom and for the right to self-determination and independence."
"I should like to point out that, in its resolution of 27 October of last year, Parliament declared its support for a fair and lasting solution in Western Sahara, based on the rule of law and on international law, and in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions."
"In spite of the major efforts, unilateral concessions and good will gestures on the part of the Polisario Front, the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people, the process continues to be stymied by the intransigent attitude, to put it mildly, of the Moroccan Government, which refuses to recognise the Sahrawi people’s fundamental rights."
"It is therefore of pressing importance to implement immediate effective measures with the clearly stated aim of decolonising Western Sahara."
"Mr President, has launched a hostile TOB for , threatening nearly 50 000 jobs in Europe. , which was born out of the ECSC, enabled the iron and steel industry to be adapted to the new world order at the cost of unprecedented financial and human efforts, which are liable to be written off as a loss."
"Over and above the national positions, however, it is undoubtedly from Europe that the steel workers are awaiting some action. This action will hinge on the implementation of an ambitious European industrial policy endowed with sufficient financial resources and based on a budget priority that is clearly focused on research and development and on innovation."
"This case shows that, in the EU’s key economic areas, we must provide long-term answers and, more specifically, act as the driving force behind international regulation. European integration began with steel, and this is truly symbolic: it must be possible for European integration to continue without abandoning and its employees."
"– Mr President, two months ago we voted here on Mr Alavanos's thoughts on telephone tapping."
"I have something disturbing to report: for one year, the Prime Minister of Greece, the Minister of National Defence, the Minister of Public Order, the Chief Commissioner of Police, the Head of the Secret Services and the Head of the Anti-Terrorist Squad have been bugged."
"For one year they have been bugged, for one year they have been unable to discover by whom and no one knows exactly how many plans or what highly secret talks with the Members of the European Union were leaked."
"I therefore wish, through Parliament, to find out the extent to which the European Union has been informed about this telephone tapping, in this instance of Vodafone mobile telephones."
"Secondly, as it is so easy to tap telephones, and I refer here to the telephone of the Prime Minister of Greece, I refer here to the telephone of the Hellenic Minister of Public Health, I refer here to the telephone of the Hellenic Minister of Foreign Affairs, how sure can we be that the telephones are not being tapped here, in the European Parliament?"
"That will be a crucial test of whether the EU is taking the Lisbon agenda at its face value, because the services sector is a main reservoir for rapid economic growth. However, today the giant of the enlarged EU is like Gulliver in Lilliput, his immense potential tied up by innumerable cords of protectionist regulations."
"Our challenge is to dismantle the complex network of anti-competitive practices, which is undermining confidence in genuine European integration."
"Our responsibility this week is to open up the services sector to free and fair competition."
"The new Member States are not a threat to the EU internal market, but an asset."
"Therefore, compromises on the Services Directive should not serve to block the dynamics of this important change."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is truly at a crossroads."
"The improvement to our decision-making process has come to a halt. The most recent countries to have joined the EU are discovering a Union that is less united than it was in their predecessors’ day, as demonstrated by the stingy draft budget."
"The nations of Europe are worried – and rightly so – in the face of the wayward path taken by the Commission and most of the Member States’ governments, which want to introduce rules of unbridled competition among themselves. I am thinking in particular of the taxation dossier."
"If we value a Europe founded on solidarity and reject one that is founded on self-interest, then, ladies and gentlemen, let us seize the opportunity to stand side by side tomorrow with the demonstrators in response to the call of the ETUC and, if possible, let us go equipped with our scarves."
"I call on you to do this in order to show the citizens from throughout Europe that a large number of their representatives are behind them and understand their more than legitimate concerns."
"( The citizens of the new Member States greatly appreciated the courage of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden in opening their labour markets immediately following EU enlargement in May 2004. The report submitted by Commissioner Špidla confirms that these three countries have not been harmed by opening their labour markets and, on the contrary, that people coming from the new Member States have been taking on jobs unattractive to local workers."
"By doing so, they have contributed to the economic growth of these countries."
"On the basis of the positive report from the European Commission, I trust that the remaining twelve Member States will follow the example set by these three countries and will lift the temporary restrictions on the free movement of workers in the labour market that apply to the new members."
"I am convinced that Austria and Germany will also understand that removing the existing obstacles to the free movement of labour from the eastern countries is better than having to face the delocalisation of German and Austrian companies to the East."
"I am pleased that the Commission has received significant support from European social partners."
"Both the umbrella employers’ organisation, UNICE, and, surprisingly, the European Trade Union Confederation have spoken in favour of terminating the transitional period. Only German and Austrian trade unionists were opposed to the idea."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no goal to which Europe’s political forces commit themselves with greater determination than that of making our continent more competitive and thereby reducing mass unemployment."
"It follows that doing something for those people who have no work is a credible and respectable thing for us to do."
"This week will see us voting on the Services Directive, which may well, when transposed, bring 600 000 new jobs, 100 000 of them in Germany, my own country, providing that it is adopted in the form that has emerged from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"There is now no more than an infinitesimal prospect of this actually happening, since the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has caved in and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has got its way right down the line."
"That has had no impact on the trade unions, who are continuing to spread untruths and panic. We expect, tomorrow, the arrival of 30 000 well-organised, well-fed and well-clothed people, who will be demonstrating against the creation of 600 000 jobs."
"Those who have work are fighting to keep it for themselves; that is immoral and unacceptable. It is for us to do something for those people who do not have work, for they have no leaders to bring them to Strasbourg by the busload."
"Mr President, there are currently 84 Lisbon directives that the European Parliament has adopted; 63 of them should have been fully implemented by all Member States; so far, only 12 have been fully implemented."
"According to the latest figures published by the Commission, the directive on the common rules for the internal market in natural gas should have been implemented by 1 July 2004."
"The following countries have yet to notify the Commission of their legislation implementing that directive: Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Spain, Ireland, Latvia and Luxembourg."
"Mr President, would you write to the Commission and ask them what they are doing to speed up legislation on the Gas Directive in particular?"
"– Mr President, the tragic shipwreck of the obsolete, over-maintained, 35-year-old passenger car ferry , which dragged thousands of passengers and seafarers to a watery grave in the Red Sea, is yet another link in the long chain of maritime crimes committed for the sake of profit."
"We express our heartfelt condolences to the families of the passengers and seafarers who lost their lives for nothing."
"We would take this opportunity to point out that, with the reasoned opinion/ultimatum sent by the European Commission in December 2005 to the Greek Government on the application of Regulation No 3577/92, adopting the demands of the shipowners on the pretext of alleged unfair competition, basic seaworthiness and safety criteria of passenger car ferries are being abolished, such as the horsepower and registered tonnage of ships and the 30-year age limit for the withdrawal of ships, which has been adopted in our country."
"We are calling on the European Commission to stop this procedure."
"There is an immediate need, through the International Maritime Organisation ..."
"Mr President, the European Commission has tabled a report regarding the operation of restrictions on access by citizens of the new Member States to the labour market in the countries of the Fifteen."
"This report proves conclusively that concerns about opening up the labour market were unfounded."
"The scale of the influx of workers to the old countries is fairly small, and the countries that opened up their labour markets have benefited in many ways as a result."
"Unfortunately, despite these clear conclusions most of the remaining Member States still wish to retain the current restrictions for several years."
"Why, in the light of the findings of its own report and in its role as the guardian of the Treaties, is the Commission not taking a much stronger line in pressing for discriminating restrictions on access to the labour market in the remaining Member States to be lifted?"
"I would also like to enquire why the retention of these restrictions is condoned."
"Not only do they run counter to the provisions of the Treaties and the spirit of European integration, but they are also slowing down the Union’s economic growth, making it less competitive and creating the conditions for aberrations such as undeclared labour and fictitious self-employment."
"I trust the Commission will make a determined effort to ensure these harmful restrictions are lifted."
"That concludes the one-minute speeches."
". – Madam President, the rapporteur wrote, in his explanatory statement, that ‘all good farmers respect their animals’. It goes without saying that there must be some who have not yet got that far, or else we would not need to prescribe it by law."
"I think the problem also lies in the fact that many of those engaged in fattening up chickens are no longer farmers, but rather industrialists, for whom respect for life is irrelevant to the business of getting a return on capital. I can tell Mr Berman that the only conclusion we can come to from seeing the way breeding was approached is that the primary concern was not the animals’ well-being, but rather the use to which they could be put in obtaining the maximum possible profit."
"I do think, though, that we have to take care that this directive and this regulation do not end up leading us to aid and abet this sort of industrial production. One problem is, in fact, that these stalls are often outwardly healthy, but that is only because they are protected by prophylactic inoculations and medication, which, while preventing an outbreak, allow the germination of the variants that are currently troubling us or that make bird flu particularly to be feared."
"This makes the preventive measures currently being adopted for free-range animals especially problematic, for it is the good conditions under which these animals are kept that enables them to develop the strongest resistance to diseases."
"We need to take good care that we do not end up catching the wrong people, and we must also ensure that the specialised markets for which these animals are supplied, which people accept along with the higher prices charged on them, are not run into the ground in such a way that farmers lose out."
"."
"Madam President, although all things considered, Mr Berman’s report strikes a good balance between the importance of animal welfare and the interests of the agricultural sector, I would like to argue that the interests of chickens should count for more where stocking densities are concerned."
"I would therefore ask all my fellow Members, when you go down to vote tomorrow and are crowded, uncomfortable and pressed up against each other in the lift, you should imagine that an additional ten people are squeezed in and have this feeling for one minute, to spare a thought for an industrial broiler chicken that has to put up with this for all of its miserable life."
"I would encourage you take that image with you when you press your voting buttons tomorrow."
"Tomorrow, we have the opportunity to take an important step towards a more animal-friendly Europe."
"Let us seize that opportunity, not only for the sake of animal welfare, but also for the sake of our own humanity."
". ) Madam President, the regulation we are debating today lays down high standards for the rearing of broiler chickens and their welfare."
"These standards are needed. Within the European Union we should be striving to ensure that animals are treated as humanely as possible."
"This applies especially to animals raised for meat production, such as broiler chickens."
"We should spare animals unnecessary suffering to ensure humane treatment and out of regard for the standards of our civilisation."
"We should do so in the interests of our own health too."
"There is a large body of research showing that meat from animals raised in poor conditions and subjected to constant stress is simply less healthy."
"However, a problem of a rather different nature has arisen. The regulation imposes high standards on European Union broiler producers, but it does not apply to importers."
"Maintaining high standards is expensive, which means that our producers’ meat cannot compete with meat from producers outside the Union."
"They are exporting to the European market meat from poultry raised in countries where such high standards are not guaranteed."
"Many European broiler producers are threatened with bankruptcy, because they have become less competitive due to the fact that they have to meet high European Union standards."
"The same standards should be imposed on imports as on meat produced within the Union, not only for the sake of the broiler chickens but also for the benefit of their producers and especially for the good of the consumers."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted an amendment tabled by the Union for the Europe of the Nations Group calling on the European Commission to ensure that these high standards are also met in the case of imported meat."
"I believe this should be a general principle that should apply not only to poultry but to all agricultural products."
"Union producers and importers must be required to meet the same standards."
"– Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Berman on his report."
"I wish to clearly state from the outset that I am in favour of a decent life for animals, for all animals in general and for chickens in particular."
"To look at the bigger picture, I say that this demonstrates our humanity towards all our fellow inhabitants of this planet."
"However, we must accept that, as has already been said, all this increases the cost of production in the European Union."
"On the other hand, of course, we allow chickens to come in from third countries; we allow everything to come in except weapons. In this way, we are causing European poultry farmers to close their poultry farms."
"This is unfortunate on two counts: both for the poultry farmers, a class for which we should show solidarity, and for the chickens, because we shall arrive at the point, in a few years' time, where chicken products will be imported from third countries which are produced without any protection as regards a decent life for the animals."
"Unless we want to be hypocrites, we must find a way of controlling the living conditions of chickens in third countries; otherwise we should not permit imports."
"Labelling, which Mr Kyprianou, referred to, is a very good idea, we think it is an excellent idea and we want to proceed towards this sector, but we also need to think about subsidising poultry farmers for the costs relating solely to the measures we impose on them. Otherwise, we shall also wipe out poultry farmers and the poultry we bring in from abroad will have been raised under much worse conditions."
"Mr President, I also very much welcome Mr Berman’s report and thank him for the work he has put into it."
"I believe that high standards for animal welfare are good not only for chickens but also for farmers and consumers."
"What we have to do is get the balance right and I believe he has moved in that direction."
"It is not just about the number of chickens per square metre; it is also about the atmospheric conditions in the houses and whether there is straw or anything in them, so that the chickens have slightly better conditions during their very short lives."
"When consumers go to the supermarket to buy chicken, it has to be clearly labelled."
"One of the problems is that you can often go into a supermarket now anywhere in the European Union and buy a chicken without being absolutely sure where it has come from and to what standards it has been produced."
"The Commissioner said that consumers like to buy high-welfare-standard chickens. Yes, they do, but these need to be clearly labelled."
"Also, the Commissioner must be aware that a lot of the imported chicken meat that comes into Europe arrives in a partially cooked state. That way it gets around some of the EU tariffs."
"It then goes straight into processed food, so that when we go to buy our chicken sandwich at a motorway service station, it will probably be made from imported chicken meat and we have no idea what sort of standards it has met."
"Amendment 17 to Article 5 asks the Commission to bring in a clear labelling system for meat that is imported into the European Union after the legislation has been in place for six months."
"I urge the Commission to do that. When Europe introduces higher standards – as I believe it must – we have to be sure that everything else entering Europe meets the same high standards."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon"
". Mr President, the roadmap for State aid reform from the Commission is a good and an important document."
"I hope that this report will contribute to the improvement of the State aid policy."
"Therefore, I should like to thank colleagues and shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this improvement by the amendments and discussions we have had in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I hope there will be, as there was in the committee, broad support for this new policy, which I hope will make an impact on the future guidelines on State aid policy that the Commission will be responsible for."
"Mr President, Europe needs a competitive economy."
"As we say over and over again, we need new businesses, new jobs, new products and new markets."
"It is, therefore, also important to follow these matters up by ensuring that new, small companies operate under basic conditions as good as those under which old, large companies operate."
"Experience of various kinds teaches us that State aid always tends to safeguard old, existing companies at the expense of new and growing companies."
"If we look around at the European economy, as well as at the international economy, we see very clearly that the new companies and the new products have emerged not through State aid but through the existence of sound basic conditions for businesses and individual entrepreneurs."
"Each type of State aid that distorts competition always tends to distort it at the expense of what is new and growing and to the advantage of what is old. This is therefore an issue that, to the highest degree, is about how we are to obtain new jobs and new businesses."
"A policy of State aid whereby we preserve businesses that are not very competitive, together with old products and low wages, will contribute to Europe lagging behind. However, a policy that aims for less State aid and at removing such State aid as distorts competition and that, moreover, invests resources in innovation and research will be able to produce a different outcome."
"In European history, we have a lot to learn from a whole range of different experiences where State aid is concerned."
"In my report, I write that the Commission needs carefully to monitor and analyse these experiences, as well as the good experiences there are, because the objective of State aid is often popular and generally approved of. The problem is simply that the results of it are rarely what one had imagined they would be."
"As a consequence, we end up with old structures and with a dependency on subsidies, and we do not produce new jobs. We have seen this within the shipbuilding and steel industries and within a great many other sectors."
"Where State aid is introduced, renewal and transformation go out of the window. We must ensure that the opposite situation comes about."
"An overarching objective of the report is to follow up the general aim not only of reducing State aid but also, as stated clearly in the report and still more clearly in the Commission’s document, of removing such State aid as distorts competition."
"A further objective is to ensure that those rules that exist are made clearer, for the aim must be to follow up the demand for less State aid. What is required is that State aid be predictable."
"It must not be possible for it to be used for relocations. The rules governing State aid must be generally applicable."
"The aid must not have a specific focus, but be directed across the board and not favour one company at the expense of another."
"That is extremely important when we debate innovation, for innovation policy must not be an excuse for increased State aid but be designed to create better basic conditions for innovation."
"The same applies to companies in the public interest. We must not have State aid that funds that type of activity excessively, but must give new companies opportunities to develop."
"The same may be said of regional or environmental aid. It must be directed across the board and so made open and accessible to all."
"Mr President, I can follow on directly from what Mrs in’t Veld had to say just now. It is true to say that Europe is competitive only if it is also innovative in the ways in which it protects the environment."
"I think it would be a good thing if there were a bonus not only for innovation, but also, and primarily, for environmental information, and I think it regrettable that this is absent from the Commissioner’s draft."
"We know that these businesses are needed in rural areas if they are to enjoy the most basic economic development, just as we know that the regions affected by population change need businesses to settle in them, and if they are to do that they will need State aid. There is no other way in which we can counteract such effects, and so I think it is important that there should be a marked increase in this area."
"Finally, let me turn to the rules for businesses providing services of general interest."
"It is not acceptable that such rules should qualify the Altmark ruling, for the risk then arises of the Commission using competition rules as a means of defining what general interest actually means – the very same thing that you are trying to do by means of the services directive, that controversial document in which you sacrifice general interest on the altar of the free market."
"What we need, then – and urgently, too – is a framework directive, even if you do not see yourself as having that responsibility, and we need one in this instance because we want the social Europe to stand on secure foundations, one of the most fundamental of which is services of general interest, and the public will turn their backs on Europe if these become the victim of rules on competition."
"Mr President, it would be very nice if we were able to throw endless amounts of money at our relatively poor East European neighbours, but history has shown that by doing that you do not make the poor rich, you simply make the rich poor. At an exhibition in Brussels put on by the Dutch Presidency, it was predicted that another ten poor European countries will be joining the EU by 2022: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and Ukraine."
"West Germany’s experience in pouring almost a thousand billion euro into East Germany shows what it costs to try to create a level playing field for a poor neighbour. The cost of giving State aid to all of these new Member States will be astronomical."
"Currently the EU is spending over half its budget on State aid."
"Britain is far from rich as it is. We are being told that our government cannot afford to pay us a decent pension unless we work until we are 70."
"Our health service is seriously under funded and our navy, which is a fraction of the size it once was, can hardly afford to pay for the fuel it needs to go to sea."
"Let us stop this crazy idea now before the so-called rich Member States end up totally impoverished. Instead, why do we not help to improve the economies of our European neighbours and of Third World countries by opening up free trade opportunities to them?"
"If this enriches us all, as I think it will, individual Member States might then be in a position to help their neighbours financially; but charity should begin at home."
"Mr President, it seems to me that on occasions the Commission’s policy on State aid has proved to be a blunt, inflexible and at times inappropriately directed instrument, which has often discouraged rather than facilitated economic development."
"I therefore question whether a further assault on State aid is justified in pursuit of the failing Lisbon Agenda."
"However, the specific issue I wish to focus on is regional aid."
"I welcome the fact that the present regional aid guidelines, as they affect my constituency of Northern Ireland, are a marked improvement from earlier drafts, and that the Commission has listened to representations from myself and others."
"The new draft guidelines provide for continued distinctive treatment of Northern Ireland as an economic development region and therefore allow ongoing aid to attract inward foreign investment on a reducing scale through to 2011."
"Having to compete with a 12.5% corporation tax south of the border in Ireland, the capacity for Northern Ireland to give aid to attract foreign investment is absolutely indispensable."
"It is exactly such local realities that the Commission needs to reflect more and more on the implementation of what is too often rigid dogma on State aid and indeed on other policies affecting the European Union."
"Mr President, State aid is a legitimate instrument for public action."
"Since it provides a particular advantage and differentiated treatment, its establishment required stricter justification than other alternatives and it needed to be drawn up in a careful manner in order to guarantee that it is effective and consistent with the Union’s policies and objectives, as well as its international commitments."
"The reform of State aid for the period 2005-2009 must bear in mind that, even when regional aid contributes to true convergence, there are great internal differences in income and opportunities amongst the regions of Europe."
"The result of the Hökmark report is well balanced."
"I am pleased that it reflects the need to link the reform of regional structural aid to the reform of the regulations on the Structural Funds until 2013, stressing its complementary nature, and that it advocates the maintenance of adequate support measures for regions affected by the statistical effect without any discrimination."
"I take a positive view of the proposal to increase the threshold for de minimis aid, which will eliminate bureaucracy and above all benefit SMEs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too agree with the rapporteur, with the Commissioner and with many of my fellow Members that we should reform State aid by adapting it to the current challenges."
"The problem is finding the right methods to do so."
"I believe that the key strategy is one of reducing the amount of State aid, rewarding some sectors that have been mentioned, such as innovation, research, the environment and businesses, and ensuring greater transparency."
"As my colleague, Mr Sánchez Presedo, just mentioned, it is also advisable to link State aid to the cohesion policy. In this area, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has rightly added a paragraph on advantageous tax conditions."
"We are talking here about an instrument that can tie in with the cohesion measures and release entrepreneurial potential in some particularly disadvantaged areas."
"I hope that the Commission and Commissioner Kroes intend to take account of this important statement by Parliament."
"Mr President, State aid policy must be consistent with the EU’s proclaimed political goals."
"State aid should accelerate sustainable growth and sustainable competitiveness, and reduce regional disparities."
"Aid must not be given where it would work against these principles."
"Properly targeted State aid encourages enterprise and creates jobs, even in regions that suffer from permanent natural disadvantages or are a long way from the big markets."
"Those regions that suffer from permanent natural disadvantages, such as those in the north, should be in the same category as the Objective 1 zones."
"Aid needs to be targeted more precisely, and should especially be allocated to bottlenecks in business, such as risk financing to create new technology and put it to use. Special attention needs to be paid to environmental technologies and their potential for job creation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have six ideas that I would like to put forward on this subject."
"In the first place, although we are all aware that globalisation is going on, I do believe, in contrast to Mr Mölzer, who spoke just now, that we have to seize it as an opportunity if we want to take the right action. Secondly, we have to observe what the World Trade Organisation does about it, and strengthen the UN as the world’s ethics organisation alongside it."
"My third point is that the Euro was our greatest contribution to this."
"Economic and monetary union is a response to globalisation, and that is why the Stability and Growth Pact must be adhered to if we are to carve out the scope for more of the kind."
"Fourthly, population change is a headache for us; we need to sort out our social security and pensions systems, and, if we fail do so with a sufficiently lasting effect, we will certainly lose out to globalisation. A few days ago, Jean-Claude Juncker told a gathering of the European People’s Party that ‘the globalisers’ young people are in Asia, and demographic changes mean that the globalisers’ senior citizens are in the West’."
"Fifthly, we make the internal market into a domestic market and make the four freedoms a reality for employers and workers. The services directive is part of that."
"Lastly, I will point out that education and research and small and medium-sized businesses need the right sort of financial backup if we are to seize the opportunities in our own back yard and not shrink back from the risks involved."
"Mr President, I very much welcome this question. I would also like to welcome my friend and colleague, Mrs McCarthy, who is here for the first time as chairwoman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection: this is the first of many future occasions when we will grapple with the issues."
"I want to declare a special interest in SOLVIT."
"My office was privileged to be one of the pilot users of the system, and my staff have been trained on it."
"We have referred quite a number of complaints to it."
"We have been extremely gratified by the results, and the people we have helped have also been pleased."
"I would like to associate myself very fully indeed with the tone of this question, but I think that there are a number of points that flow from it, because the resources that it needs are not just at Commission level as you, Commissioner, pointed out."
"We also have to get the Member States to put the resources in and gear up their activities."
"I want to take this opportunity to thank publicly the very hard-working UK staff of SOLVIT in the Department of Trade and Industry who have been extremely helpful to my staff in pursuing a very wide range of complaints."
"I am sure that other countries have had the same experience."
"But, Commissioner, you need to put pressure on the Member States as well."
"As you said, it is the change of culture that is going to be absolutely vital in this respect."
"I am increasingly certain that we will improve this with a substantial majority this week, but we want to get on with that. There are new cooperative provisions in there, there will be new small businesses accessing the single market and all of them will need access to SOLVIT if we really are going to get the economic benefits that the single market promises."
". When we talk about consumer protection, assistance granted to enterprises or any aspects of the expansion and enforcement of European Union law, we always mention efficiency and pragmatism as important endeavours."
"SOLVIT is the system that could be a textbook example of the achievement of such objectives. SOLVIT shows European citizens a Europe with a human face."
"This is obviously a high number, if we take into account that five senior staff work at SOLVIT, and they found solutions to six difficulties each week. But if we remember that the European Union has a population of 450 million, 300 complaints do not seem to be so many after all."
"If the citizens visiting the offices of the 732 Members of Parliament would each contact SOLVIT with at least one complaint, this would already cause an insolvable problem. The reason for the relatively few complaints could be that there are few cases causing complaints, but a more likely reason is that few people are aware of this system, and we must expect that in the coming years, as the good reputation of the institution spreads, there will be more and more citizens intending to enforce their consumer protection rights within the SOLVIT system."
"This means that as the system becomes more and more popular, the workload of SOLVIT will increase, it will become more difficult due to the increasing integration of the internal market, and it will expand with the expansion of consumer culture."
"This means that it would already be worth considering ways in which we could prepare the system to handle 500, 1 000 or even more requests efficiently, rapidly and pragmatically in five to ten years."
"This process will need appropriate human and financial resources. We must develop the framework and means of an administrative cooperation that works as efficiently as possible."
"And we must also think of how this extremely efficient, user friendly European service could be transformed into an equally efficient ingrained habit of Europe, consumers, entrepreneurs and citizens. We must consider the fact that, whichever way we vote on Thursday on the Services Directive, it is absolutely certain that the SOLVIT system will also be required in the area of services."
"Therefore we would like to encourage you, Commissioner, to support the reinforcement of the SOLVIT system and do everything in your power to make the system work."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three years ago the European Commission introduced the SOLVIT network, dedicated to solving infringements of Internal Market law without legal proceedings. EU companies and citizens can use SOLVIT to solve problems related to the movement of goods, social security, migration, recognition of qualifications, etc."
"This is particularly relevant for citizens and small, and medium businesses. One of the advantages of SOLVIT is the fact that any periods of prescription applied by courts are suspended."
"Around 800 cases have been registered with the EU's SOLVIT, and of these 80% have been resolved."
"In the first year of SOLVIT being operational, Lithuania dealt with 10 complaints."
"Seven of these complaints were directed against Lithuania and three were directed by Lithuania against other states."
"Citizens made 90% of complaints; the majority about freedom of movement for persons."
"Lithuania is among those countries where all complaints are resolved on time, on average within 43 days."
"This is despite the fact that there is only one member of staff working at SOLVIT in Lithuania."
"However, there are areas of SOLVIT's activities, which may still be improved both in Lithuania and other countries."
"The small number of SOLVIT cases being processed shows that not only citizens but even some state institutions know little about this system."
"This is the main obstacle to solving internal market problems through SOLVIT."
"We must let the public know about the opportunities SOLVIT offers and organise publicity campaigns for citizens and businesses."
"I urge the European Commission to encourage national governments to strengthen SOLVIT's power with more human resources, and urge the Commission itself to support SOLVIT's work financially."
"The debate is closed."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, the Cashman report was not drafted in order to defend the ."
"It is based in essence on fewer than a dozen petitions prior to 2004, the authors of which have either reached a compromise with the Greek authorities or are in court and need support."
"I shall refer to three issues: as far as the relationship of the report to the functioning of the Committee on Petitions is concerned, I wish to comment that it is scandalous that, even though one was requested officially, the written opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs of the European Parliament was never given on the extent to which, while proceedings are pending both before the Court of Justice of the European Communities and before the national courts, it is possible for a report to be drafted and to be put to the vote before the European Parliament."
"Is this not discriminatory treatment of citizens for whose petitions a report was not drafted precisely because proceedings were pending?"
"As to the content, petitions from just one Member State, Greece, were selected, even though there is also confusion about the use of private cars with foreign number plates in the other 24 Member States. That is precisely why the Commission proposed a new proposal for a directive, as you said, and took Greece to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for infringement on the basis of the 1983 directive."
"As a result, Greek legislation was amended, both by the socialist government of Greece in 2001 and more recently by the New Democracy government in 2005, which is something the report ignores."
"So why was the report drafted? The few specific petitions which resulted in the drafting of this report are not representative, but their authors give the impression that they have personal relations of goodwill with Parliament."
"The Committee on Petitions does not have the right to play the role of judge and to construe as true, without proof, information such as the place of normal residence, on which the courts are called to rule."
"The report started with an assumed number of petitions of 40 and it transpired that there were few petitions, of which some have been closed with a compromise and others are pending before the courts."
"I call on my honourable friends in all the groups to vote against the report and to give the Committee on Petitions the authority it deserves, with respect for the rule of law and without intervention in the work of justice."
"I trust, Commissioner, that the proposed new 2005 directive will have a favourable and speedy outcome."
"– Mr President, I wanted to ask if we will have a second chance to speak, as you gave the floor to Mr Cashman."
"If that is the case, we too have something to say."
"We want to ask the Commissioner why he is taking such a negative attitude."
"."
"Mr President, after all the discussion of the technical details associated with this directive, I would like to make a general comment."
"In principle, any initiative that reduces health risks and thereby affords people better protection deserves support, and, as people spend a considerable part of their lives at work, it is logical that the various dangers there should be precisely analysed and all of them, along with all hazards to health at work, reduced to the minimum possible."
"I see it as an extremely good thing that the attempt should be made to lay down, across the EU, uniform minimum standards of health and safety protection."
"What I found really scandalous about the debate on this directive was the attempt that was made to prevent anything that might cost money."
"There is also something dubious about this compromise’s statement in one of its recitals that, and I quote, ‘This directive must avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings.’"
"I do not understand why health protection is not supposed to cost anything if the same rules apply to all, so that there is no unfair competition. By all means let services and products involving a greater health risk cost slightly more."
"Why should people in general cough up for the costs that business imposes on public health services simply because of the negligent attitude taken towards certain risks? Real competition exists only when rules apply equally and if the real costs are reflected as a matter of principle."
"Anything else is a short-term subsidy for individual businesses or sectors at the expense of the general public and to the detriment of workers who do dangerous jobs. What I want to see is more economic probity."
"The next item is the report by Mr Vittorio Agnoletto on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the human rights and democracy clause in European Union agreements (2005/2057(INI)) (A6-0004/2006)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the human rights and democracy clause has a long history within Parliament and is based on the assumption that civil and political rights and, in a broader sense, economic, social and cultural rights as well need to be at the heart of European Union policy."
"The clause began in the early 1990s with the Lomé Agreement and in 1990 itself was also applied to Argentina."
"Every year, in its annual report, the European Parliament calls for this clause to be given greater weight and urges the Council to grant Parliament a more important role in overseeing its implementation."
"Parliament’s requests have so far not been met with a satisfactory response."
"The clause has now been included in over 50 agreements and applies to over 120 countries."
"In that respect, I must stress the importance of the Cotonou Agreement signed with the ACP countries in June 2000, which enhanced the role of this clause."
"The first point that I should like to address concerns the European Parliament."
"It has to give its assent before an agreement comes into force, but it is not called upon to give its opinion on initiating consultation or partly suspending an agreement."
"That lessens its institutional and, more generally, its political role."
"That is why I consider it important to emphasise that Parliament is no longer prepared to give its assent to new international agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause."
"Parliament maintains that it has to play a part in defining the negotiating mandate for new agreements with third countries and, above all, in drafting their political and human rights objectives."
"In addition, Parliament asks to be involved in the decision-making process for initiating consultation or suspending an agreement, or indeed for suspending any appropriate negative measures that have already been imposed on a country."
"Lastly, Parliament asks to be associated with the Association Councils and their subcommittees on human rights and hopes that its interparliamentary delegations can play an enhanced role in that respect, by regularly including debates on the democracy clause on their meeting agendas."
"Another point that I should like to address concerns the reciprocity between the European Union and third countries, which so far has not been fully exploited."
"I also believe that the clause should be applied in relation to the violation under discussion and not in relation to the country under discussion."
"It is also necessary to extend the clause to all new agreements between the European Union and third countries, both industrialised and developing, including sectoral agreements and commercial, technical or financial aid, along the lines of what has been done for the ACP countries."
"Human rights issues need to be systematically included on Association Council agendas."
"To that end, we consider that the heads of the Commission’s external delegations in third countries must play an enhanced role and we call for country-by-country multiannual strategy documents to be drawn up and to be debated on a regular basis."
"A structured dialogue must be established between the Association Council and its subcommittee on human rights."
"We call for the general establishment of subcommittees on human rights, with a mandate to review compliance with and the application and implementation of the democracy clause, and to propose specific positive actions to improve democracy and human rights."
"It is important to underline that we call for these subcommittees to include and to consult representatives of parliaments and of organisations representing civil society."
"Then there is a further extremely important aspect."
"This resolution recognises that the need for unanimity within the Council in order to initiate a consultation procedure has made it more difficult to apply the clause."
"We therefore call for the abolition of this unanimity requirement and, in that respect, for the revision of Article 300(2) of the EC Treaty, which limits the role of the European Parliament in such cases."
"Lastly, while we believe that the clause should be applied to all countries and all agreements, we also think that, in the case of countries covered by the new neighbourhood policy, one might consider signing agreements that go beyond the democracy clause, based on the sharing of common institutions for promoting democratic principles and human rights, on the example of the Council of Europe and regional agreements."
". Mr President, I welcome this report on the human rights and democracy clause in European Union agreements prepared by the honourable Members of this House, and especially by Mr Agnoletto, and the resolution before Parliament today."
"Human rights clauses have been inserted systematically into external agreements since 1995 and, ten years on, it is timely to take stock of what has been achieved."
"All EU institutions need to work together to this end, and I emphasise my commitment to an ongoing, but also very practical, dialogue with the Council and Parliament, for which this report provides a good basis."
"I shall begin by underlining how much has already been achieved: it must be said that the glass is more than half full."
"After often difficult discussions and very difficult negotiations, the Commission has secured the inclusion of a human rights and democracy clause in, as you said, more than 50 agreements, covering over 120 countries."
"A notable example is, indeed, that of Articles 9 and 96 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"In the field of trade policy, the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, known as ‘GSP+’, provides additional benefits for countries that implement, , certain international standards in human and social rights; so it is a positive incentive."
"The impact of human rights clauses is already evident, and many of our human rights activities are supported by their mere existence."
"Human rights feature prominently in every political dialogue with our partners."
"Human rights subcommittees are being established with a growing number of partners, and, indeed, the European Union Neighbourhood Policy Action Plans contain highly detailed sections on human rights."
"The Commission, as part of the troika, makes numerous démarches on human rights issues every year, and the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights funds human rights projects throughout the world."
"The Commission is also funding numerous technical assistance projects with an impact on human rights, ranging from, for instance, improving police training to modernising the judicial system in partner countries."
"The rule of law is one of the most important areas where I think we can really make a difference."
"I would also like to mention how active both Member State embassies and Commission delegations are in this regard."
"EU Heads of Mission collectively draw up human rights fact sheets periodically, report on the implementation of the various EU human rights guidelines and make detailed analyses of developments in particular countries concerning human rights and democracy."
"More and more frequently, political reporting from the Commission delegations is covering human rights issues."
"Assessing the effectiveness of the human rights clause to date needs to be done in a comprehensive manner."
"The human rights and democracy clause is, in itself, an important way of demonstrating the shared commitment of the European Union and its partners to upholding, and also to promoting, human rights."
"The human rights clause opens the door to developing a deeper and more intensive dialogue on human rights issues."
"Moreover, the existence of these clauses may, in some cases, even help deter potential human rights violations."
"As far as sanctions are concerned, I would like to underline that the frequency of imposition clearly depends less on the wording of the human rights clause than on the political will of the Member States, as well as of the other states."
"I agree that, when sanctions are not implemented in response to serious breaches of human rights, the credibility of the EU’s human rights policy could be damaged."
"For its part, the Commission would sometimes like to see a more robust use of these clauses but the solution is not, however, to include more clauses in the agreement."
"Instead, we need to build up awareness and the consensus throughout the European Union on the importance of human rights issues relative to other priorities."
"This report therefore makes a valuable contribution in this regard."
"As regards Parliament’s involvement in negotiating or suspending an agreement, you will be well aware that these procedures are clearly established by the Treaty and reflect the interinstitutional structure of the European Union."
"Parliament already plays an invaluable role in focusing attention on human rights issues, through the extremely active work of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, through its annual report on human rights in the world and through the many resolutions and debates on particular human rights issues."
"Moreover, I very much welcome the suggestion that interparliamentary delegations should take up human rights issues much more systematically."
"I think that there, too, you have a great role to play."
"I also favour revising the format of the current EU Annual Report on Human Rights in order to make it a fully interinstitutional report and to include an analysis of the application of human rights clauses."
"In conclusion, let me reiterate that the success of human rights clauses should be measured by the progress made in engaging partners in a genuine dialogue and in consultations on human rights, and the resulting improvements in human rights."
"Over the last ten years, human rights clauses have provided an indispensable foundation for developing a truly effective human rights dialogue with our partners because it is in this way that these countries slowly change their behaviour."
"That does not mean, of course, that there is no room for improvement: there is always room for improvement, and I look forward to this debate today and to an ongoing and active debate with Parliament."
"We are in a listening mood, but we would also like to contribute to improving human rights in the world."
". Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, the inclusion of a human rights clause in our international agreements is one of the European Union’s distinguishing features."
"Its content has been evolving over time and in accordance with the nature of successive agreements: currently more than 50 with more than 120 countries, as the Commissioner has just pointed out."
"Unfortunately, this has not prevented us from occasionally having to suspend our agreements because of human rights violations."
"With regard to the report that we are debating today, the Committee on Development wishes to stress the following points:"
"Firstly, we would state that human rights are universal and indivisible and that human rights, democracy and development are highly interdependent."
"Secondly, we wish to stress that the fight against poverty is our priority and that we will not be successful without a global approach to processes of democratisation and development."
"Thirdly, we would insist on a twin approach in terms of conditionality: positive discrimination for countries that achieve greater progress and negative discrimination in cases of serious and persistent violations."
"Fourthly, we would stress the exemplary values of the Cotonou Agreement, given its extensive application to 77 countries and the effectiveness and flexibility of the suspensory clause laid down in Article 96, thereby making it the only agreement that has led to sanctions and that has functioned relatively well."
"Fifthly, we would insist that transparency is one of our governing principles."
"Sixthly, we support all measures aimed at achieving the Millennium Objectives and, in this regard, we welcome the G8’s decision to cancel the debt of the 18 poorest countries on this planet."
"Seventhly, we would appeal for greater commitment from the countries with which we cooperate in the achievement of those Objectives."
"Eighthly, we regret certain Commission decisions with which we do not agree, such as the lifting of sanctions on Sudan, given the serious events in Darfur."
". Mr President, my committee welcomes Mr Agnoletto’s report which, with very few reservations, we fully support."
"In fact, we adopted our opinion, which echoes what Mr Agnoletto was saying, by 20 votes to 1."
"As the Commissioner said, 14 years on from the start of these human rights agreements being included, it is time for a fresh look."
"Since 1995 the human rights clause has been invoked on 12 occasions."
"We have invoked it against Niger, Guinea-Bissau, the Central African Republic, Togo, Haiti – from which I have just returned from an election-observation mission, Comoros, the Ivory Coast, Fiji, Liberia and Zimbabwe."
"The human rights clause has also prevented the conclusion of agreements with Australia and New Zealand and with Belarus, following the increasingly authoritarian rule of Mr Lukashenko."
"We welcome the inclusion of the clause and would like it extended to sectoral trade agreements as well."
"We believe there should be specific benchmarks and possibly a more nuanced set of benchmarks for responding to human rights violations."
"We ask that the Commission establish a monitoring mechanism that links the implementation and temporary suspension of trade agreements and autonomous trade measures to beneficiary countries’ compliance with basic democratic standards and respect for human and minority rights, as set out in the European Parliament’s annual report on human rights in the world."
"I take the Commissioner’s point that, if our involvement is included in terms of the adoption of the clause in trade and other agreements, it is not formally included in terms of the implementation of the clause."
"However, we ask the Commission, by its own initiative, to involve the European Parliament more systematically in the assessment of the implementation of the human rights clauses and similar requirements in the future."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Agnoletto, on the excellent work he has presented."
"It is important, I think, that Mr Agnoletto refers in his report to the new role which needs to be given to the European Parliament, not only with respect to negotiating agreements with third countries, but also with respect to application and control."
"This would change significantly the institutional framework within which these agreements are concluded."
"Mr Agnoletto is right to recommend the extension of the human rights clause to all sectors and to all countries and the precedent which he uses to support this opinion is interesting."
"Mr Agnoletto is right to call for better control and a better monitoring procedure to establish if the parties are adhering to what they have signed, because often, as you all know, signature is easy, but adherence is hard."
"Mr Agnoletto is right to mention the need for a mechanism on the application of agreements, among other things."
"He is right to insist that the human rights dimension should be highly visible in this mechanism."
"Finally, he is right in his final conclusion that the time has come, at long last, for us to look at a new clause with a content which reflects everything we are debating and everything that we commend on many occasions or that, on other occasions, we criticise through the European process."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has, as you know, tabled an amendment which, as far as I understand, Mr Agnoletto accepts and, consequently, it supports his report."
". Mr President, respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, inspires the internal and external policies of the parties and constitutes an essential element of the European Union’s international agreements."
"The cumbersome and vague wording of the democratic clause to which I have just referred has many limitations and lacks the mechanisms required to ensure that it functions properly."
"The result is that the clause is often used as an alibi or rhetorical example, without having any real consequences."
"The report we are debating today is intended to put an end to this situation, increasing the effectiveness of the clause from a legal point of view."
"To this end, we Socialists have made several proposals that have been taken up in this report, something about which we are very pleased. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Agnoletto and thank him for his work and understanding."
"We do not want to be under any illusions, though."
"This initiative report will once again come face to face with reality when we come to applying the clause."
"The European Union must promote the introduction of the clause in line with the recommendations of this report, and that is what we are calling for today in this House."
"We shall continue to need great political will on the part of the Union so that respect for human rights genuinely provides added value in international agreements and in the promotion of dignity and so that the introduction of the clause is not a dead letter and so that it is not used in a hypocritical fashion and only applied when it suits our interests."
"For this, we need Europe to have a genuine commitment to human rights; an effective, credible and coherent commitment."
"We can implement a warning system to identify human rights violations which allows us to act appropriately and react in time."
"Europe must maintain reciprocity in the application of the human rights clause, because we must be able to maintain a frank and open dialogue with the countries with which we have reached agreements, and we must also be able to listen to the criticisms of partner countries, in relation to how we Europeans treat their nationals, for example, and react accordingly."
"Europe must maintain a credible position."
"Human rights cannot be used as a bargaining chip."
"We cannot stop defending them for the sake of other topical interests."
"Europe must act in an honest and clear fashion."
"We must call for an end to the death penalty in India, China, Japan and the United States."
"We must demand an end to torture wherever it takes place, whether in Guantánamo, in Iraq or in Syria."
"In a world obsessed by short-term benefits and security, we cannot lower our guard when it comes to defending our universal rights."
". Mr President, in May 1995 the Council decided that, to promote fundamental rights and the EU’s democratic ideals, a clause insisting upon human rights observation should be included as an essential element of all bilateral agreements."
"In the ten years since the clause was introduced it has stood up to rigorous examination by the European Court of Justice and has been introduced into more than 50 of the EU’s agreements."
"However, in those ten years the EU has been criticised for failing to put its human rights tools in the field of external relations into practice and it has become increasingly apparent that when dealing with key countries, strategic partnerships and double standards of still eclipse the fundamental human rights which this clause seeks to protect."
"By way of illustration, I make reference to the fact that, despite what we demand on paper, the debate sparked by the election of the new Palestinian Authority clearly spelled out that implementation depends primarily on the political will of the EU to assign priority to human rights issues over economic and political interests."
"Before the democratically elected Authority had the chance to organise itself, the EU-Palestine Agreement was up for review on the basis of human rights in a way that has been dismissed by both the Council and the Commission as unhelpful because it would remove leverage."
"However, when probed about the EU-Israel Association Agreement, despite Israel’s catalogue of defiance of Security Council resolutions and blatant disregard of the International Court of Justice, as she continues to annex East Jerusalem and deny the Palestinian people the right to self-determination, what is the EU’s response?"
"I have been a harsh critic of the handling of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, scrutinising the precise application of the human rights clause on numerous occasions on the floor of this House."
"Yet I hear nothing other than euphemisms, such as that we must maintain our influence and continue our dialogue."
"If the Council and the Commission cannot spell out to this House how it uses the human rights clause coherently, effectively and transparently, then how can it expect this House to be prepared to give its assent to new international agreements?"
"The vague criterion and inadequate procedures contained in this instrument have not helped me to penetrate the logic behind some EU decisions, nor does it help the EU to defend itself against accusations of ambivalence and discrimination in the face of serious human rights violations."
"A revised text must provide a concrete, step-by-step implemented mechanism, from dialogue to warning signals, and a spectrum of tools from smart sanctions to suspension, to add influence and authority to our interventions with persistent violators."
"Moreover, the instrument should be based on the principle of reciprocity with regard to abuses that take place on EU soil as well as those abroad."
"If anything has become clear from the controversy over unlawful CIA operations in Europe, it is that when it comes to human rights, the EU has failed to keep its own house in order."
"The significance of this latest twist in the war on terror cannot be exaggerated, effectively shattering EU complacency about its own human rights record, with enquiries launched by the Council of Europe and this House with warnings that the sanctioning mechanism of Article 7 may be used."
"It is time for the EU to engage in a thorough and comprehensive review and to connect and balance the external and internal dimensions of its policy on human rights."
"Whilst the EU has struggled to consistently and systematically promote a coherent view of human rights, this Parliament has been praised by NGOs for the positive impact of the revival of the Subcommittee on Human Rights."
"Under the chairmanship of Mrs Flautre the subcommittee has gone from strength to strength and, coupled with the appointment of Mr Michael Matheson, we have made inroads into the implementation of human rights guidelines."
"I finish by saying that as human rights feature more prominently in a range of foreign and security policy domains, and as cross-cutting issues demand more consistent participation, our knowledge and proficiency must be drawn on as joint decision-maker when it comes to initiating consultations and suspending agreements on the basis of human rights."
". Mr President, the clause we are debating today constitutes the basis for and legitimises the European Union's actions towards third countries with regard to respect for human rights."
"Mr Agnoletto's report puts forward some important proposals that, as you can see, have garnered extremely broad consensus here in Parliament."
"This clause does suffer from some deficiencies."
"First of all, there is a lack of uniformity: the wording of the clause may vary from one type of agreement to another."
"I, and the rapporteur, would advocate a better clause, in order to increase its political and legal impact."
"It must, for example, be clearly established that the parties to these agreements are required to comply with the international standards and obligations incumbent on them."
"Secondly, in most cases, as has already been stressed, this clause suffers from a lack of concrete enforcement methods."
"In order to be consistent, the European Union must establish such methods."
"We cannot expect to retain our credibility in the eyes of our partners if, on the one hand, we claim to want respect for human rights to be an essential part of our policy but, on the other, we do not take the necessary measures if these countries systematically violate those rights."
"At the moment, the ACP agreements probably form the most advanced model, which should be our inspiration."
"The mechanisms for enforcing the clause must also be graduated."
"We must not see them just as reprimands for human rights violations, but also as ways of helping to strengthen human rights in third countries."
"That is why the positive approach of the human rights clause is so important."
"With regard to Parliament's role, in order to guarantee that our policy is consistent, credible and transparent, it is absolutely vital for us to be involved at all the stages of enforcing the clause."
"When Parliament's resolutions refer to the clause, or call for appropriate measures to be taken, the Council should take heed of these calls and assess whether they are appropriate."
"The second vital point is the link between the clause and the structures for political dialogue."
"The link between this clause and the creation of 'human rights' subcommittees must be clear, and these committees should also be strengthened."
"I also find it regrettable in this connection that the European Union's requirements have been relaxed, particularly for certain of our neighbours."
"If we want to implement this clause effectively, we must create the forums needed for a frank and constructive exchange of views on human rights."
"With regard to the reciprocity principle, this dialogue must also be reciprocal, particularly at a time when some of our Member States are having fingers pointed at them because of their anti-terrorism policy, for example, or because of inhumane prison conditions."
"We must be able to listen to any criticisms our partners may make."
"Finally, it is important that human rights must not be a matter just for our ministers of foreign affairs, but for all government bodies."
"That is why I, like the rapporteur, am advocating that the clause be an 'essential element' in all agreements and, finally, that Parliament should no longer give its assent to new agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause."
"() Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on an outstanding piece of work."
"In my view it is well-balanced and objective, and above all it gives us an excellent summary not only of what has been achieved in the area of human rights, but also of the important aspects that we must focus on in the future."
"I should like to mention the following key areas."
"Firstly, I endorse the view that human rights should not be understood only as civil and political rights, but that it is absolutely necessary to focus on economic, social and cultural rights as well, and not only within the context of achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals."
"Secondly, we should draw on the positive experiences that have emerged so far from the Cotonou Agreement, and ensure that clauses on upholding human rights and democratic principles are included in all sectoral agreements or all agreements with developed states, in order to achieve a level playing field for all parties to the Agreement."
"Thirdly, it is necessary to place greater emphasis on implementing so-called positive measures to motivate states, and to use negative measures only where absolutely necessary, where other options have been exhausted."
"When weighing up such options it is clearly necessary to consider the impact of the measures on ordinary citizens."
"In my view, one of the key factors from the standpoint of ensuring transparency is for the European Parliament and civil society to play a greater role in the implementation of clauses relating to human rights and democratic principles."
"The work of the Commission and Council has so far had little transparency, and has often been misleading, giving rise to concerns that political, strategic and commercial interests are over-ruling the consistent implementation of clearly defined standards."
"It is absolutely necessary, if we are to increase transparency and democratisation in decision-making processes, for the European Commission to inform Parliament and interested parties in the public sphere regularly, ideally on an annual basis, about the implementation of clauses dealing with the upholding of human rights and democratic principles, including studies of individual cases and of the approach taken by the Council over a given period, the success of given measures and suggested approaches for the future, in case a situation does not improve."
"An objective methodology and a clear procedure for implementing the aforementioned clause will of course be essential."
". Mr President, this clause was drafted ten years ago and applied in certain agreements."
"This report wants new criteria which must apply between EU Member States and third countries."
"Suspension of agreements with those countries would follow if the clause was contravened."
"This report criticises the fact that the clause does not exist in three big areas, namely agriculture, fisheries and textiles."
"Of course democracy and human rights should be encouraged in all the states of the world which are unfortunate enough not to enjoy them already."
"All decent democratic states should use their relations with other countries – diplomatic and trading, cultural, etc. – to encourage the growth of democracy and human rights, something that my country, Britain, has done for many years."
"However, this report says that the clause must apply in all countries equally."
"Has this been properly thought out?"
"If so, it will apply to China and other developing economies in the Far East and other parts of the world."
"Many jobs depend on trading relations with China and the number will increase in the future."
"Are we really saying that we are going to turn the tide of history by telling China to turn into a democratic country with full human rights overnight, just on the basis of one report from the European Parliament?"
"I think not."
"Today the United Nations has called for Guantanámo Bay to be closed and there are many human rights questions hanging over what the Americans are doing in Guantanámo Bay."
"If this agreement is to apply equally to all countries, are we going to suspend relations with the US if we think that it is contravening human rights in Guantanámo Bay?"
"I was also struck by the arrogance of the Commissioner in demanding that other countries, such as China and Japan, abolish the death penalty if they want to have relations with the EU."
"I think that is an unbelievable intrusion into the democratic and sovereign right of other countries to have a penal system that suits them and their citizens rather than the European Union."
"The European Union itself is undermining democracy in all its Member States."
"I know at first hand how democracy in Britain has been undermined by our relationship with the European Union and our increasing political integration into a United States of Europe."
"So I think perhaps the European Union should put its own House in order first, as far as democracy is concerned."
"Perhaps it could make a start by paying attention to the results in the Dutch and French referendums on the Constitution."
"I suggest that this report is not properly thought out."
"Yes, we want democracy and human rights in all the countries of the world."
"But let us try to do it by setting an example in friendship, rather than setting criteria and conditions that will not be met."
"Mr President, if our successors attempt to assess the principal values and advantages of the European Union in a hundred years’ time, they will note that one of the main reasons why the Union came into being was to defend and promote human rights the world over."
"We should be flying the flag for human rights at all times and not lowering it in unfavourable circumstances, as unfortunately sometimes happens."
"I am concerned about our notorious double standards."
"We are quite prepared to demand that human rights be respected and to condemn certain countries that fail to do so."
"However, when it comes to the largest countries or countries that are particularly important in economic terms for businesses in the Member States of the Union, we are just as prepared to remain silent on the subject of human rights or we speak about them in whispers."
"The curse of these double standards is a stain on the Union’s honour."
"It is a stain on our fine blue flag with its gold stars."
"Human rights must also be understood in an economic context."
"That is why we support the granting of debt relief to developing countries, as Mr Martin mentioned."
"However, we are also in favour of monitoring the implementation of Union aid to ensure it is not used to prop up dictatorships in Africa and Asia."
"I believe it is worth emphasising the need to include clauses on human rights and democracy in the sectoral agreements we enter into concerning agriculture, fisheries and textiles for example."
"In conclusion, we must always bear in mind that where human rights are concerned, it is never possible to say that everything that should be done has been done."
"Mr President, I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this own-initiative report by Mr Agnoletto on the human rights and democracy clause in EU agreements."
"I believe this is an ambitious and serious initiative by the rapporteur."
"He has produced a report that the Subcommittee on Human Rights of the Committee on Foreign Affairs has described as one of the most important reports for some time."
"Human rights clauses have been included in EU international or trade agreements for more than 50 years."
"As the Commissioner has said, they involve over 120 different countries."
"This report assesses the effectiveness of such human rights clauses as regards implementation and adherence and proposes new ways to strengthen the clause to make it more effective and better monitored."
"Human rights clauses have had some success in the past."
"If the truth be told, however, in many cases human rights clauses in EU agreements with third countries have not been worth the paper they were written on."
"Therefore a trade and cooperation relationship develops as a result of an agreement, yet basic and clear breaches of human rights continue; human rights clauses are ignored or not taken seriously, but there are no consequences."
"This is a regrettable situation; not only is it a missed opportunity for the EU to use its considerable influence better in order to raise human rights standards, it also undermines the credibility of the EU in a key policy area."
"This report goes into a lot of detail about what a new human rights clause could or should look like, how it could be monitored and enforced to make it more effective and what the consequences of breaching the clause might be in different cases."
"In essence, however, the report aims to do two things."
"Firstly, to ensure that a new and improved human rights and democracy clause, based on a respect for international law and accepted EU conventions, is included in all new international agreements entered into by the EU."
"Secondly, a mechanism must be put in place that better monitors adherence to the human rights clause, so that breaches of the clause have a range of real consequences for the overall agreement."
"This would ensure that human rights are given the kind of political priority the Commissioner has spoken of today."
"Mr President, once again over the past year the EU has been accused of failing in its commitment to human rights by refusing to effectively use human rights clauses in trade and cooperation agreements."
"An important precedent was set in Uzbekistan following the Andijan massacre, but the fact that the reaction took four months is a sad commentary on the lack of seriousness given to the clauses in the past."
"Despite huge human rights concerns and EU influence in the Middle East, human rights clauses have never been invoked in relations with Egypt, Israel or Tunisia, in the latter case despite strong EU statements last year on curbs on freedom of expression and the blocking of NGO funding."
"With the ACP countries, I acknowledge that so-called Article 96 consultations have taken place with 15 countries over the last eight years, in 11 cases leading to appropriate measures."
"However, the EU maintains close relations with Angola, Ethiopia and Rwanda despite condemning abuses there and without any real pressure or action to follow up those condemnations."
"In Eritrea there has been little response to the démarche so far: forced military conscription, arbitrary detention, harassment of refugees and the use of torture continue."
"How do we ensure the success of consultations on the human rights clauses?"
"It needs commitment on the side of the third country."
"Too much today this seems dependent on how far there is dependence on EU funding."
"It needs coordination between donors, for example as took place after the coup in the Central African Republic in 2003."
"It needs identification of the violations and the steps that need to be taken to rectify them, as in the case of Guinea-Bissau, when free and fair elections were held within the timescale set; and it needs the maintenance of close political dialogue, something that can be blocked and – as was seen today – was sadly lacking in the case of Iran."
"We agree with the Commissioner that political reasons too often block action by Member States."
"I do not think she is arrogant;"
"I think she is noble when she upholds the EU’s unswerving commitment to ending the death penalty."
"I find it breathtaking that the UK Independence Party this morning said that we could turn a blind eye to human rights violations with China simply because we trade effectively with it."
"I congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur."
"Mr President, I am genuinely pleased with the high degree of consensus in this House with regard to the idea that the development and consolidation of democracy and the Rule of Law, as well as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, are — though they should be more so — an overall objective of the common foreign and security policy and must be an integral part of the European Union’s foreign policy."
"I say that they should be more so because, as has been said, there are many, too many, examples of these principles being toned down, or even over-ridden, in favour of certain particular economic, commercial or political interests."
"It is true that what is known as the human rights and democracy clause has been incorporated into more than 50 agreements and that this affects 120 countries, but it is also the case that the degree to which it is complied with or the degree to which we demand that it be complied with varies considerably."
"After ten years of applying this system, therefore, we must take stock and take certain corrective measures, and I would therefore congratulate Mr Agnoletto on his work, on his report and on his conclusions, with which we agree, naturally."
"Firstly, I would like to stress that we must remember that many agreements with developed countries and sectoral agreements, such as those relating to textile products, agriculture and fisheries, do not yet contain such a clause, and that is clearly a deficiency."
"Secondly, although the clause applies both to the European Union and to the third country, full use has not yet been made of its reciprocal dimension and, as Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco has said, I believe that the European Union must begin by offering an example."
"Thirdly, one of the factors that have compromised its application is the generic nature of its wording, since it does not provide for precise methods for positive or negative intervention in cooperation between the European Union and third countries, leading to the Council’s demands and the national demands of the Member States taking precedence over more general human rights demands."
"For all of these reasons, we support the drawing up of a new text for a model clause to improve the current wording of the so-called Article 2, with a view to guaranteeing a more coherent, effective and transparent approach to European human rights policy in the agreements with third countries."
"Mr President, we are discussing the clauses on respect for human rights that the EU imposes on the countries with which it deals."
"So be it, but before we go looking for the speck in our neighbour's eye, should we not remove the plank from our own?"
"For example, in my country, France, as in the rest of the EU, the tyranny of political correctness is becoming completely intolerable."
"In theory, you can say what you like about mass immigration, but if you oppose it, you are condemned for incitement to racial hatred."
"If, as happened recently, you mention the islamisation of Alsace, even as an elected representative, you become the target of disgraceful condemnations that only reflect badly on those who made them."
"In theory, you can say what you like about contemporary history, but, in practice, you can only do that provided you comply with a Communist-inspired law, otherwise you risk being imprisoned."
"For having contested this law during a political press conference, I myself have lost, at least temporarily, my post at the University of Lyon."
"If you say you prefer natural families to homosexual partnerships, you risk being condemned once again, as a member of the French parliament from the majority party found out recently."
"A mayor does not have the right to give a fellow countryman preference over a foreigner when allocating social housing, nor can an individual give this sort of preference in any field."
"I could give you more examples."
"Every group, every lobby, every minority and every deviancy has developed its own methods of pressurising, intimidating and persecuting the majority, with the active or passive complicity of the authorities."
"In these circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, before we impose on our partners a clause that you seem to interpret completely unilaterally, we would do well to start by putting our own house in order."
"– Mr President, the democratic principle in the Union's foreign relations, which we are debating today in the wake of the report by Mr Agnoletto, whom I congratulate, raises a series of crucial questions."
"I shall confine myself, for reasons of time, to five of them."
"First question: will the Union continue to confine itself to the more or less declaratory character of the human rights and democracy clause or will it try – and this is my proposal – to raise the democracy principle to an appropriate legal means, into a for the smooth functioning of agreements with third countries?"
"Second question: are the selective discounts of the democracy clause permissible?"
"Is the differentiated intensity in the formulation of the principle in question permissible?"
"The answer is obvious."
"The credibility of the invocation of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms must obey the rule of uniform standards."
"Third question: do the elements of electoral competition and free elections alone suffice in order to characterise a system as democratic?"
"Modern democratic life makes demands intertwined with the quality of democracy."
"It makes the demand of participatory civil rights, of horizontal political accountability."
"It makes the demand of honest governance, of institutional security and of social cohesion."
"Fourth question: does the Union intend – do we the democratically legitimised Chamber intend – to adopt qualitative indicators for measuring and evaluating the democratic conduct of our private economic and commercial partners and, more importantly, of third European countries which are being called on, or will be called on, to satisfy the so-called Copenhagen criteria?"
"Fifth and last question: in European external relations, the democratic principle and the market economy are cited along side each other or in the same breath, but in practice the market economy claims priority."
"If nothing else, are we going to restore this balance?"
"– Mr President, I in turn should like to start by congratulating my honourable friend Mr Agnoletto on the important report which he has presented to us."
"The incorporation of a human rights clause in the agreements of the European Union, since the beginning of the 1990s, has been a politically and institutionally cutting edge."
"However, in taking stock today, we must be honest and say that the results are not particularly positive."
"This is due mainly to the lack of political will on the part of the Member States, as the Commissioner so honestly and boldly said, to selective sensitivity to the application of the clause, to the prevalence of double standards and, finally, to the supremacy of national interests and expediencies over the common and decisive stand of the European Union."
"Τhere are numerous examples and this situation is creating a serious problem of credibility of the European institutions among European citizens."
"On the one hand, the European Union can freeze relations and agreements – Mr Ford spoke and gave examples – and, on the other hand, it does nothing about infringements of human rights in Tunisia, Egypt, Israel or Turkey."
"Strategic interests take precedence in relations with Russia, China and the United States over respect for human rights and minority rights."
"The provision of unanimity for the taking of measures and the suspension of an agreement will continue to cancel in practice any serious effort."
"The European Union will not be able to engage in a dynamic foreign policy with the unanimity procedure."
"This dimension needs to be retabled in the debate on the future of Europe."
"I agree with all the proposals made by my honourable friend, Mr Agnoletto."
"However, we must understand that the serious deficit in foreign policy and in human rights policy is due to and connected with the transnational character and unanimity provision, behind which hide national interests and various political expediencies and priorities."
"Otherwise, however strong the clauses are, they will, unfortunately, remain inactive."
"Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, Commissioner Frattini, I too would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for this report."
"It is evident from the responses to it that it enjoys very widespread approval."
"We have already heard from various quarters how much easier we find it to criticise small states such as Myanmar and impose sanctions on them to do the same with large ones, where economic interests come into play."
"This is where we have a problem, a dilemma, and it is one that we should address frankly instead of beating about the bush."
"The European Union has a credibility problem, a problem with double standards, and this is something we have to consider in the present situation with these caricatures and what is claimed to be a clash of civilisations."
"We very much agree with many of the points made in this report."
"I would like to point out, though, that we will be addressing a similar issue – that of the Fundamental Rights Agency – in a forthcoming debate in this House."
"That Agency will deal with many of the issues with which we are concerning ourselves today."
"I would like to raise Members’ awareness of the fact that we will be able to use this Fundamental Rights Agency not only to improve the protection of human rights within the European Union’s Member States, but also as a sort of early warning system to inform us what is going on in the states around us and how things stand as regards human rights in them."
"This presents us with a unique opportunity to improve Europe’s policy on human rights."
"This House will be taking a decision on this very soon, and I ask you all to support this."
"Mr President, I should like to make three observations with regard to the human rights clause."
"First of all, it has to be noted that this clause is very rarely invoked: only 12 times since 1995."
"If we compare this with the number of non-democratic states with which the European Union concludes treaties, the clause must, in most cases, be regarded as redundant for all practical purposes."
"My second remark concerns the Member States’ immigration and asylum policies, which the rapporteur wishes to bracket together with the human rights clause."
"That strikes me as not very realistic and in any case not very desirable, certainly when developing countries would be invited to criticise the reception of their own nationals who apply for asylum in Europe."
"We should, in fact, make a point of encouraging such states to take back those of their nationals who do not qualify for political asylum over here."
"Often, though, experience has shown that the exact opposite is true."
"Finally, it is undesirable to involve non-governmental organisations in the assessment of the application of the human rights clause with regard to third countries."
"Such organisations have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever, and should not be given political responsibility of this kind."
"If anything, Europe should be able to give more account of what happens with taxpayers’ money."
"Mr President, proper respect for the human rights clauses depends, above all, on the political will of the Member States."
"Sadly, their efforts to further their own interests often prevent the Union from taking effective action."
"The task before us today is to ensure that human rights clauses are introduced in a way that will make it possible for us to exert effective pressure on third countries."
"It is no longer enough to simply make a statement of principles and requirements."
"They need to be implemented, and that calls for a great deal of courage and determination."
"I have been saddened to note that the behaviour of the Union’s leaders tends to be governed by fear and opportunism."
"All too often economic and political interests outweigh the need for a swift response to notorious cases where individuals are humiliated and their freedom restricted."
"The principle of solidarity must not be treated as if it were a ballast to be jettisoned at any time."
"It needs to become a crucial instrument of the European Union’s policy."
"The human rights clauses must therefore be equipped with appropriate means of persuasion and of exerting political pressure."
"That, in turn, requires a change in the approach to the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"A permanent feature of this policy should be an ongoing struggle to defend the principles of freedom and democracy."
"We urgently need European institutions modelled on American government-funded foundations and which are able to effectively support human rights defenders the world over."
"No such institutions exist at present, but the planned EU Fundamental Rights Agency should help to fill this gap."
"Indeed, the Human Rights Agency would be a more appropriate title for this body."
"In its annual report, the human rights organisation Human Rights Watch concluded that during 2005 the European Union’s main interests had been in the fields of business, politics and energy."
"Mere verbal criticism of totalitarian and dictatorial regimes is no longer enough."
"The European Union must demonstrate the will to implement fundamental rights the world over."
"Is there anyone in the European Union currently dealing with the restrictions on freedom of expression and the activities of non-governmental organisations in Russia?"
"Is anyone prepared to sacrifice trade contracts with China in exchange for the release of Tibetan monks imprisoned for alleged subversive activities?"
"Will we eventually be able to bring ourselves to stand up to the Cuban regime?"
"In conclusion, I should like to express my support for the protest action against the search engine."
"I do not intend to use it today. has set up a special version of its search engine for Chinese pages, controlled by the Chinese Government."
"This is a way of censoring material that runs counter to the official Chinese line."
"Mr President, human rights and democracy are the foundations on which the European Union was built."
"The human rights policy of the European Community and indeed of the wider international community played an important part in the fall of the undemocratic regimes in Southern Europe in the 1970s and in Central and Eastern Europe after 1989."
"At present, human rights and democracy form the axis around which the European Union’s external and security policy is being constructed."
"The Union’s foreign policy is aimed at creating a global world order based on peace, democracy, human rights, the rule of law, sustainable development and stable growth."
"The human rights and democracy clause should now be applied more widely and included in all agreements entered into by the European Union with third countries, regardless of whether they are industrialised or developing countries."
"The aforementioned clause should also feature in sectoral agreements, trade exchanges, and technical and financial aid."
"Pursuant to this clause, the relevant European Union institutions, including the European Parliament, should have the authority to effectively monitor respect for human rights and democratic principles by parties to agreements with the European Union."
"In this respect, it is important to bear in mind the relationship between respect for human rights, democracy and development."
"General principles encompassing the protection of human rights, the rule of law and respect for democratic values are a for the eradication of poverty."
"A good way of dealing with this issue would be to include in such agreements a recommendation that the EU and the country party to the agreement should exchange reports on human rights on an annual basis."
"It would also be desirable to set up a mechanism for consultation with non-governmental organisations."
"Election monitoring missions play a vital part in protecting and supporting human rights and democracy beyond the Union’s borders, as does the aid the Union should provide to civil society in third countries."
"Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Agnoletto, that Parliament must not only give an opinion but must also have a role in human rights, democracy and respect for diversity in agreements with external countries."
"Economic development, social peace and a growing economy are clearly related to democracy and human rights."
"Cooperation for development can only be assured in the context of democratic societies."
"If we analyse the efficacy of our cooperation for development, we will confirm that in those countries where democracy and respect for human rights are improved, everything works better."
"In cases of dictatorships, non-transparent regimes or corrupted governments, our work can be completely distorted."
"I wish to point out that we must fully understand democracy and human rights."
"Democracy means respect for diversity; human rights are not complete without respect for diversity, plurality and cultural differences."
"We have seen how minorities in countries close to joining the European Union rely on us in order to achieve this respect for their rights."
"A chance for plurality and respect for cultural and national rights can come from the European institutions, irrespective of the fact that many European countries do not respect it."
"We have to enhance the role of our Parliament, because it is the house of our European representatives."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his determination to lend more transparency and consistency to the expansion and consolidation of human rights."
"In the report it seems as if a magnifying glass is being held over the principle of clarity and transparency."
"Various interpretations of the concept of ‘human rights’ prevent the European Union from taking appropriate actions when there are gross violations."
"When the Council is debating the human rights situation in a state where there is cause for concern, usually one EU country or another insists on acting in its own national interest and vetoes the decision."
"The unanimity principle ought to be made more flexible."
"When debating the possibility of sanctions, inevitably the political and economic power of the target country, along with its size and the likelihood of retaliation, is considered."
"Such a state of affairs should be avoided where possible and certain states, which blatantly violate human rights, should not feel more equal than others."
"The sanctions instrument, directed against one regime or another or a government, which has behaved inappropriately, must be employed with extreme precision."
"The stick of sanctions should not hit people, who often live in particularly harsh conditions and do not have the opportunity to oppose the regime."
"In a few months the EU will begin negotiations with a state, which still has difficulty applying policies of gender equality and women's rights; a state, which has yet to rid itself of the shackles of ethnic discrimination."
"Human rights will form an important part of these negotiations, so the procedure for defining this negotiation process should also be more transparent."
"() Ladies and gentlemen, the development and strengthening of democracy and the rule of law, along with the upholding of human rights and freedoms, has become an integral part of the running of the European Union and of foreign policy."
"The human rights and democracy clause in EU agreements constitutes one of the instruments of this policy."
"The clause, as has already been stated, has so far been incorporated into more than 50 agreements and applies to more than 120 countries."
"Despite the frequent positive experiences, however, I feel it is necessary to consider how we might improve or perfect the clause."
"In this context, the Agnoletto report provides many important and interesting suggestions."
"It points out, for example, that the concept of human and civil rights and freedoms also includes economic, social and cultural rights."
"It also emphasises that the EU, in its support for human rights, should focus on implementing policies in the area of gender equality and women’s rights and should oppose any form of discrimination on the grounds, for example, of sexual orientation, or of the rights of disabled people."
"I should like to lend my support to the idea that the European Parliament should play a greater role in the preparation process for implementing and assessing the democracy clause, and I should like to add that both civil society and the international network of non-governmental organisations involved in human rights should play a much greater role in this process."
"– I am amazed at how, in this Parliament, we often detect small shortcomings in Europe, when everybody knows that this continent is actually a standard-bearer trying to export these fundamental and noble rights to other parts of the world."
"It should be pointed out that there has always been a discussion as to whether human rights can be administered internally by the State or government or whether they are universal."
"It is clear beyond doubt that human rights are universal rights and that no dictator or State is entitled to deny human beings the smallest aspect of their fundamental rights."
"The problem is that of how Europe is to make use of its resources to try to export these noble aims."
"In this area, we sometimes criticise Europe for not employing its rights and its power, including economic power, and, at the same time, we criticise the administration or the institutions for closing their eyes to certain shortcomings."
"There is a decision to be made."
"We have to decide whether it is by using persuasion or economic power that Europe can best export its aims."
"I would conclude by saying that we have to give our institutions all the resources to ensure that our values are made sufficiently coherent to be exported by the Community."
"Thank you."
"– I support all of the recommendations made by Mr Agnoletto in this report. I especially welcome the inclusion of a reciprocity clause in all agreements with third countries."
"It is regrettable that the implementation of the human rights clause has until now been contingent on geo-political and geo-economic considerations which have nothing to do with the Union as a whole, but which often depend on the narrow strategies of some Member States and some Commission services."
"The most glaring example of the lack of substantive implementation of this clause is Ethiopia, despite the fact that Parliament has repeatedly asked the Commission and the Council to open consultations, under the terms of Article 96, following the massacres and serious violations of human rights that took place in the wake of the elections."
"I am appalled by the Council’s silence and inaction on this matter."
"Only the Commission and one Member State – the United Kingdom – have suspended direct aid to the budget of the Ethiopian Government, the minimum they could do in the circumstances."
"Given, however, that they did not clarify the terms and conditions, this had no impact whatsoever on the Ethiopian Government, and sent out a disastrous message not only to the Ethiopian people as a whole, but also to all Africans – the headquarters of the Organisation for African Unity is in the Ethiopian capital – as well as to the EU Member States and to all countries with which the EU maintains relations."
"Mr President, there can be no doubt that promoting respect for human rights and democracy in third countries is one of the main aims of the European Union’s foreign policy."
"This aim will not be achieved, however, if international agreements continue to focus exclusively on economic and political issues."
"The inclusion of clauses on human rights and democracy in trade agreements and technical and financial aid would also be a vital step in the right direction."
"The European Union will be able to act more quickly and effectively to defend human rights if it has the option of suspending economic cooperation in the event of serious infringements of fundamental rights in third countries."
"In parallel with this process, the European Parliament should become more involved in consultations concerning the content of agreements and clauses as well as their implementation and enforcement."
"Once we have an effective system of monitoring fundamental freedoms in place, backed up by the option of imposing economic sanctions, we shall at last progress from words to deeds."
"To date, it has frequently been the case that fine words of European Parliament resolutions on the defence of human rights have simply remained on paper."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this ambitious work, and I thank him for it."
"The protection of democracy, human rights and the rule of law and good governance are fundamental elements of the European Union; they must also be an integral part of the EU’s external policy."
"I would like to lay special emphasis on the promotion of equal opportunities and on the fight against discrimination based on sexual orientation."
"These questions are still serious problems in every country today."
"Women’s and children’s rights, and the rights of those with different sexual orientations, are being violated every day."
"In order to improve implementation of these aims, the European Union must prepare new procedures and new criteria for applying human rights and democracy clauses."
"I agree that, in order to ensure a more coherent, effective and transparent approach to European human rights policy, a revision of the current text is indispensable."
"I support the establishment of human rights subcommittees under EU third country agreements, to be responsible for reviewing compliance with the clause, monitoring its application and implementation, and proposing actions to address democracy and human rights problems."
". Mr President, this has been a very valuable discussion on the human rights clause and on human rights and democracy in general."
"Let us not forget that human rights issues are already being raised systematically with partners in political dialogues."
"We have established dedicated human rights dialogue and consultations with certain countries, and human rights subcommittees have also been established."
"In other cases, human rights may be raised at association councils and at association committee meetings."
"The purpose of the human rights clause is not simply to make it possible to impose sanctions, but also to create a basis for human rights dialogue and for the setting-up of institutions concerned with it, because we need to give such institutions a chance and encourage them to develop."
"Institution building is as important as the clause, and the existence of the human rights clause in the association agreement, or in partnership and cooperation agreements, creates the basis for this."
"Therefore there is no need to replicate this in sectoral agreements."
"I also want to recall that our agreements have a wide range of policy goals."
"We want to contribute to stability and to the increase of welfare for all the populations concerned."
"It is not a lack of courage if we do not always have the same human rights clause or if we do not apply sanctions."
"We also have to contribute to the development of a population – look at the African, and some Asian, populations, as some of you mentioned."
"There is also freedom from want and freedom from fear, which are closely related to human rights and to the human security concept."
"That means we cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater."
"There are many other clauses to defend, such as the clause against terrorism, the clause against weapons of mass destruction and the clause for democracy."
"It is all interlinked and we cannot focus only on human rights; we have to see the whole picture, which includes poverty eradication."
"This is the difficult balance that we have to strike sometimes."
"It is not easy to harmonise this clause, because we are negotiating with every partner and we have to find solutions in the end."
"Not every partner accepts exactly the same wording."
"However, it is not so much about wording but about application and the way we can encourage the partners to come up with their own solutions, because, as we have always made clear, we do not want to impose everything on the others: we want to encourage their societies to build and to change."
"As I have already said, institution building is just as important, as are legal, judicial and police reform, because that is where human rights are applied."
"Finally, I should like to say that, with all due respect, in many individual cases we have been able to get people out of prison and to talk about them."
"We speak about the death penalty with each and every partner, we speak against torture, and slowly these things come through."
"Maybe sometimes the issue is speed – not everything is being done at the same time."
"But let us be realistic: we cannot change the world in a day."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0406/2005) by Mr Mihael Brejc, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States and amending the Schengen Convention and the Common Consular Instructions [COM(2005)0056 C6-0049/2005 2005/0006(COD)]."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for the very good work done on this proposal."
"I am very pleased to note that once again the three institutions – the Council, the Commission and Parliament – have been able to work together very effectively and very quickly within the framework of the codecision procedure."
"A very good precedent for interinstitutional cooperation was set last year by the agreement reached on the Schengen border code, to which this regulation represents the necessary complement."
"We can therefore say that with the adoption of this regulation the legislative component of our integrated border management strategy is fully completed; and, if I may say so, I very much hope that we will continue to work together effectively in the future, for instance on the decision-making process and on other very sensitive issues such as the legal basis for the VIS and SIS."
"The adoption of this proposal will be a very important and balanced step forward, as it will provide the necessary flexibility at our external borders to facilitate crossings by bone fide people residing in a border area without, however, creating any security loopholes."
"This is particularly important for the new Member States, especially in view of their forthcoming integration into the Schengen area, where they will become responsible for the control of the Schengen external borders and will thus carry out checks on behalf of all Schengen states."
"In this context I wish to recall that the adoption of Community rules on local border traffic is included in the much broader European neighbourhood strategy."
"It is thus one of the measures aimed at strengthening cross-border cooperation with the EU neighbours and people-to-people contact."
"Finally I conclude by stressing again that the text that is under examination today is a very balanced and important proposal."
". The purpose of this regulation is to lay down common rules on the criteria and conditions for establishing a local border traffic regime on the external land borders of the Member States."
"Given that the original material – the Commission’s proposal – placed serious demands on the people who live along the European Union’s external borders, in this report I have highlighted the following:"
"We need to make crossing the border easier for local residents who have good reasons for making frequent crossings of a Member State’s external border, and we need to prevent illegal migration and the potential security threat posed by criminal activities."
"The proposed regulation seeks to regulate the issue of local border traffic, which involves frequent, sometimes daily, crossing of the border for the reasons of attending school, work, or family ties, and we therefore need to take into account that these daily migrants return each day to their homes."
"Owing in part to historical, geographical and social circumstances, the external borders differ, and life along the border should not be allowed to deteriorate."
"We need to consider the actual circumstances on the external borders and enable Member States to the greatest possible extent to maintain the good practices that they have established to date through bilateral agreements."
"The essence of the amendments which I propose and which are in the text:"
"Instead of the special ‘L visa’, local border residents will be issued a so-called , which will incorporate all the security standards, and most importantly, will not be stamped upon every crossing of the border."
"A differentiation between the various external land borders will not be necessary, since in the coming years Member States will sooner or later enter into the Schengen area."
"The local border area – this definition has triggered considerable debate."
"We have agreed that it should not exceed 30 km, and possibly 50 km in exceptional cases."
"Indeed by increasing the border area, we could find that it would no longer be possible to meet security standards."
"In no way, however, is it possible to equate local border areas with ethnic boundaries."
"A local border resident is a citizen of a third country who has resided for at least one year in the border area, while in the debate we have harmonised the proposal containing a whole range of exceptions involving marriage, inheritance and so forth."
"In bilateral agreements Member States lay down the longest permitted period of residence, which may not exceed three months in total."
"In other words, this is a decision whereby an individual from a third country may reside in that border zone for three months in total."
"Where special circumstances are involved, certain privileges need to be permitted with regard to crossing the border outside established border crossings."
"There are, for instance, farmers that have half of the property they own in their own country and half in another country, and of course they cannot take their implements with them every time they cross the border."
"The adoption of this regulation will show that the European Union is not closing its borders, and is not setting up inhuman conditions along its external borders."
"The European Union wishes to ensure adherence to the relevant security standards, but in no way to make life harder along the border."
"The coexistence of people on both sides of the border and their cooperation are important elements of stability and security along the external borders."
"For this reason another extremely important achievement of this regulation is that through bilateral agreements with neighbouring countries, in other words third countries, Member States will create the conditions for the development of border areas, which are for the most part less well developed."
"This regulation provides a basis for the strengthening of economic, cultural and other ties on both sides of the border, so it is important for the border countries as well as for the European Union as a whole."
"May I also point out that we had several rounds of harmonisation with the Commission and the Council."
"Although this took some time, the negotiations were successful, such that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs unanimously adopted this regulation in its debate and in voting."
"Permit me, Mr President, to close by thanking all those that cooperated in this process, in other words the Commission, the Council, and particularly Mr Cashman and Mr Lax, who made especially active contributions to this report."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by opening up the borders between the European Communities’ Member States and by establishing the four freedoms of the European Union, we, in Europe, have brought into being one of the freest societies in the world, but freedom without security is nothing, and that is why especial significance attaches to the security of the external borders that are thus created to the East, to the Balkans, and across the Mediterranean, the latter with its own uniquely serious problems."
"These borders must be as secure as possible, and that will require the use of the most modern technologies."
"At the same time, they must also be as flexible as possible, in order not to impose needless restrictions on businesses in the border regions and on the people who live there."
"For that to happen, two things are required."
"One is integrated administration of the border, an administration shared by the customs authorities and the border police, something that cannot, unfortunately, always be guaranteed, but this integrated administration must also be shared with the neighbouring countries."
"The fact is that a border is truly secure and flexible only when those on both sides of it work as closely as possible together, and it is certainly one of the tasks of our new neighbourhood policy to get this aspect of bilateral security addressed by both sides jointly."
"The other thing we need to do is to create a ‘frontier worker’s card’ – ‘local border traffic permit’ is a splendid term, but a very long and bureaucratic-sounding one – for those people who live on the border and have to cross it frequently."
"Only if we do both these things will we prevent the people living in the new border regions sustaining any unnecessary disadvantages."
". Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, what is termed local border traffic is a single stone in the big mosaic picture of the protection of the external borders."
"On the one hand, we are securing the external borders against illegal crossings and the phenomena often occurring at them, such as the smuggling of drugs, the trafficking of human beings, prostitution and other forms of organised crime."
"We can also, on the other hand, make daily life easier for those who live on opposite sides of the external borders, but do so nonetheless as good neighbours."
"It is only reasonable to secure our borders against the entry of unwelcome persons in so far as possible, but it is equally reasonable to want to make it easier for the people at the borders to live together, for – as many Members have already said – we do not want Europe to be a fortress, but rather a community that coexists amicably with its neighbours."
"It is for that reason that I believe the rapporteur is right to suggest that the Commission proposal be amended so as not to introduce new arrangements for existing borders within Europe."
"We are, after all, working on the assumption that the Member States will by then have transposed the Schengen , that SIS II will be successfully up and running, and so Europe will no longer need additional internal rules of this kind."
"This report by Mr Brejc is a good example of successful cooperation between Members of this House across party boundaries, and a model to follow as regards successful cooperation with the Council under our codecision arrangements."
"All of us, together, have managed to put together well thought-out and practical solutions for the day-to-day coexistence of our fellow citizens and their neighbours, and for that I would like most warmly to thank the rapporteur and his shadow opposite numbers as well."
". Mr President, I would like to thank Vice-President Frattini for his comments."
"As the rapporteur on the Schengen border code, I believe that we did set the precedent for close and effective cooperation."
"We all know the substance of this report."
"It is about making people’s lives easier and improving the daily lives of our citizens."
"Arguably, that is what we should focus on more and more."
"It reinforces the Schengen border code."
"We know that, once we have secure external borders, freedom of movement within the EU will be much simpler and more easily controlled."
"Equally, we must remember that we need to be sensible."
"Like Mr Brejc, Mr Lax, and others, I myself have adopted that approach."
"If what comes from the Commission is sensible, we only need to amend it to improve, simplify or clarify."
"That must be our approach."
"We will then bring forward effective and well-understood regulation that is easy to implement at our borders."
"As the shadow rapporteur on the Visa Information System, that is also the approach I want to take."
"I know the rapporteur for the Schengen Information System is here today and I believe that, by cooperating in order to secure our borders and make sure that the information we have is used effectively, we will enhance the single biggest benefit of being a member of the EU, which is freedom of movement."
"Congratulations to all concerned."
"Mr President, I too wish to thank the rapporteur for his very constructive work."
"The regulation on local border traffic that we now have before us has proved to be very important to the EU’s external border regions, especially in the east."
"Traditionally, such border districts are often viewed as peripheral and as being marked by slow development."
"Believing that to be the case can easily bring that very situation about."
"It is therefore a question of giving clear signals to the border area populations to the effect that they must be allowed to have contacts in all directions and that their horizons are not to be bounded by their countries’ borders."
"Being able to move smoothly across borders is the basis for contacts, friendship, trade and creative innovation."
"There are no doubt many people living on, for example, the Russian-Estonian border or the Slovenian-Croatian border who will be grateful for the very flexible solution now being proposed."
"When it comes to promoting contacts between people, consistency is required."
"It is not consistent to begin, as now, by taking positive steps regarding local border traffic and similarly positive steps in the form of the bilateral visa agreement with Russia reached in October of last year, and then almost to double the visa charge from EUR 35 to EUR 65, something that the Council of Ministers is in actual fact in a quandary about taking a decision on next week in response to a proposal by France."
"If that decision is taken, it will not of course be long before the Russian side too increases the charge to approximately the same amount."
"It goes without saying that this would deal a heavy blow to tourism on the borders."
"For example, anyone in Eastern Finland wanting to cross by boat to the Russian side of the Saima Canal would be forced to pay more in visa charges than for the crossing itself."
"Doubling the charge would be wholly contrary to our objective where visa policy is concerned."
"There is no more effective way of putting a stop to natural contacts between people than by implementing such a shock increase in the cost of a visa."
"The fact is that the trend should be in the opposite direction."
"I therefore call on all my fellow Members to put this period to good use and, at the eleventh hour, to contact their governments in order to forestall this decision."
"The right hand needs to know what the left hand is doing."
"We must live up to our values."
"As Mrs Klamt too emphasised recently, we must not give sustenance to the idea that the EU is constructing walls around itself."
". – () Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the previous speaker that if we adopt this text we will have to do all we can to prevent governments from torpedoing it."
"In 1957, when the six Member States of the European Community accepted the Treaties of Rome, it seemed that the achievement of the so-called four freedoms, which is to say the free movement of goods, capital, services and persons, was only a distant prospect."
"After the introduction of the so-called Schengen system, the removal of customs barriers between the Member States of the EU and the implementation of a series of measures to regulate relations between states in the area in question, the realisation of this goal came a lot closer."
"The issue today is not whether it will be possible in the near future to secure the free movement of persons between the Member States of the EU, but rather to determine a realistic and rapid timetable for the implementation of this freedom."
"In the interim, it would be appropriate to come to an arrangement at least over what is referred to as local border traffic."
"Such an arrangement would in the meantime improve the outlook for bilateral relations between states that are not in the Schengen system but which do belong to the EU or to the European Economic Area."
"The authors of the measures under discussion are aware that the EU covers only one half of Europe’s geographical area."
"It is in our own interests to ensure that we are as open as possible towards our neighbours."
"These measures create the possibility for setting up local border traffic with non-Member States."
"Let us not forget that, from 1 January 2007, this will entail land borders with Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldavia, Macedonia, Serbia, Albania, Croatia and Turkey, and that such measures will be taken as a positive signal by neighbouring states."
"They will open the door to mutual cooperation in the border regions, provided of course that we reject the measures to which Mr Lax alluded."
"The introduction of special kinds of visa and other conditions contained in the measures will make it possible, on the basis of assessments, to make use of this special regime to strengthen cooperation with all of our neighbouring states."
"This would also be very valuable for the future development of relations especially with larger partners such as Russia, Turkey and Ukraine."
"In my view, there are a number of proposed amendments aimed at improving the chances of these measures working, with only a minority seeking to amend the rules to make them less workable."
"I should therefore like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to draw a careful distinction between these two categories when voting on the proposed amendments."
"Do not forget that the Directive represents a model of neighbourly relations and thereby gives a signal of whether or not the EU wants to be an open society or to erect barriers against neighbouring states along its borders."
"Mr President, there are many people living on our borders for whom the eastward enlargement changed little, since the people in many border regions had stolen a march on the politicians and local border traffic had long been part of daily life."
"That makes it all the more important that we, while agreeing on common rules for local border traffic, should, as is provided for, allow the Member States to conclude bilateral agreements relating to their implementation."
"The loss of the internal borders does, of course, make it all the more important that the external border of the Schengen zone be monitored."
"Exchange of information across borders, with joint coordination and controls, have made it possible to reduce criminal activity in some frontier regions."
"While we must of course make matters simpler and easier for cross-border residents, the option of imposing strict sanctions must be in place to ensure that the concessions made are not abused."
"There must also be guarantees that these persons constitute no danger to public safety and order, and it is for these reasons that I endorse, in particular, the Committee’s proposal for thorough and recurrent checks to be carried out at irregular intervals."
"– Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to commend Mr Brejc on his outstanding report."
"This is a well-balanced proposal which will not only facilitate traditional population movements at border crossings, but will also guarantee appropriate security levels at the EU’s external borders."
"Illegal immigration and potential threats to security posed by criminal activities must be thwarted. There is also a need to facilitate local border traffic, that is, to facilitate crossing for border residents with legitimate reasons to cross the border frequently."
"Our efforts to increase security at our external borders, not least by means of the adoption of the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS), sends out a positive political message."
"Borders must not act as a barrier to commercial, social and cultural interaction or to regional cooperation."
"People living in border regions should be able to sustain traditional contact without having to face excessive administrative obstacles."
"Mr President, I welcome the fact that simplification of local border traffic has taken the form of a regulation."
"This means that the provisions in question will not have to be transposed into national law."
"Instead, they will be applied directly by all Member States across the entire Union."
"This is a very important regulation for the Union as a whole, but especially for the countries responsible for security at its external borders."
"My country, Poland, has the longest external land border of the Union, which is why we welcome the simplification the regulation implies."
"Clearly, the way people living in a country’s heartland and central areas perceive border issues differs from how they are perceived by people living in border regions."
"For the latter, the border is part of their daily lives."
"They have constant practical experience of it, and are obliged to live with the consequences of its existence."
"That is why I do not want there to be any difficulties or administrative hold-ups, because borders must not be an impediment to cultural and social exchange or to regional cooperation."
"What do the contents of the regulation mean for us?"
"This regulation ensures equality within the Union, and solidarity with its closest neighbours."
"It also generates a sense of unity and does away with artificial divisions."
"In addition, it will stimulate cooperation between regions."
"On a practical level, however, I am convinced it will bring an end to queues at consulates in countries that issued visas."
"Consequently, it will also mean an end to the corruption associated with granting documents of that nature."
"To conclude, I should like to say that if this regulation is adopted, we shall be sending out a signal that the European Union is not an inaccessible stronghold, and that there is no such thing as Fortress Europe."
"The Union will be seen to be lifting internal borders whilst also opening up to the outside world."
"To end on a poetic note, our closest neighbours will be able to enter the Union, albeit for a short time, with their heads held high, instead of on their knees as has been the case to date."
"The new Member States would like to join the Schengen area as soon as possible."
"However, the positive expectations are mixed with a fair amount of anxiety and worry."
"New Member States fear that a new Iron Curtain may fall into place, this time not on the Western, but on the Eastern borders."
"They fear that joining the Schengen area may create difficulties in keeping in touch with relatives, that it may prevent the maintenance or development of relationships in the areas of economy, education and culture."
"A great merit of the report and of the cooperation created between the Commission and Parliament is that they give a reassuring answer to the anxieties."
"This report and this text is now more favourable in every respect than the original proposal of the Commission."
"It addresses three important issues."
"Firstly, it establishes the border area at 30 kilometres, but it allows the possibility of extending it to 50 kilometres."
"Secondly, at least one year of residency is required, but it allows the possibility of extending this to several years by bilateral agreement; this addresses the worries of mass relocations to border areas, which may interfere with the ethnic balance of these regions."
"Thirdly: it extends the duration of stay in neighbouring countries from the originally proposed seven days to three months."
"These provisions make it possible to conduct freely all the activities related to cross-border cooperation."
"Therefore this is a very good proposal."
"However, it is worthless on its own, as it proposes the introduction of local border traffic permits."
"However, this requires the amendment of the Council Regulation concerning Schengen, and the introduction of such a local border traffic permit must be made possible."
"Mr Frattini’s words are very positive;"
"I hope that the Council will have the same constructive attitude as the Commission, and they will amend the Schengen Agreement and the Regulation as soon as possible, to enable this excellent text to finally come into force."
"Mr President, the simplification of procedures for local border traffic at external borders is a step in the right direction."
"A great deal will depend on how the Member States themselves implement the provisions of this regulation, however."
"Other factors to take into account will be the size of the target group of beneficiaries of these movements, and whether the reasons for which the new regime is introduced reflect those highlighted in the proposal for a regulation."
"I refer to social, family and cultural cohesion and to economic cooperation."
"Neighbouring countries will also be challenged to ensure full reciprocity of the effective implementation of readmission agreements."
"During the introduction of the local border traffic regime, it will be incumbent on the Member States to act very responsibly so as to ensure that the new BIS system does not benefit cross-border crime, smuggling or the organisation of illegal immigration."
"Clearly, therefore, the document we are debating is simply paving the way for the regulation of local border traffic across our external borders."
"Its implementation in the field must be constantly monitored."
"It will be necessary to establish whether it is actually worthwhile in terms of real benefits for communities living in border areas, whilst also complying with security requirements."
"The outcome of this assessment may vary in the various Member States located on the Union’s external borders."
"In conclusion, if we really want to engage in a serious discussion on integrated solutions to make our external borders more user-friendly to travellers who are third country nationals, whilst retaining essential security requirements, we ought to ensure that all the institutions and Member States are working together to ensure full implementation of the Schengen by the 10 new Member States as soon as possible."
"The latter’s visa policy towards their neighbours should become much more transparent once they are able to issue short-term Schengen visas."
"In addition, there should be joint discussion of the possibility of wider use of national multiple entry long-term visas in cases where the implementation of the proposed local border movement provisions is not viable or attractive to the border community."
"I have in mind cases in which the community is seeking access to the entire territory of the neighbouring country, not just to a small, clearly defined area."
"I welcome the draft regulation to be accepted today, and congratulate the rapporteur for contributing to the preparation of a better text that really serves the purpose for which it has been created."
"This regulation is particularly important to us, Hungarians, as it ensures a further form of contact for Hungarians living in the border areas in neighbouring countries, and it makes their everyday life easier."
"The draft takes into account the particularities and differences of border regions, and it is capable of having a positive effect on border regions without violating any guarantees."
"We hope that it will not affect the current, traditional particularities of border regions."
"It is now the responsibility and opportunity of the governments to use the conditions provided by the Regulation when they conclude their bilateral agreements."
"We feel that this will ensure contact between those on the two sides of the border, and at the same time, it will filter out any abuse."
". Mr President, I would like again to thank the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and all the speakers."
"Thanks to the contribution of each institution, the balance between facilitation on the one hand and security on the other has been maintained and this regulation, as was rightly said, will also be very helpful in strengthening the local development of important European regions near to the external borders."
"The introduction of a specific local border traffic permit for border residents will help in identifying those people who have the right to benefit from the facilitated border crossing regime."
"Member States will have the right to scrutinise carefully people requesting this permit."
"However, I think that is fully justified by the advantages deriving from such a permit."
"First of all, holders of the permit will no longer need to be in possession of a visa, and a visa exemption for the holders of a local border traffic permit will be included very soon in the forthcoming Commission proposal revising the relevant visa regulation which I will put forward by the end of March."
"Later in the spring I will also present the new document on the common consular instruction for issuing a visa."
"On the basis of this regulation, Member States will be able to provide some practical facilitation such as specific border crossing points reserved for border residents and give them the possibility in very exceptional cases to cross the border outside authorised border crossing points."
"To counterbalance that, Member States will have to ensure regular surveillance of border areas in order to avoid the misuse of the local border traffic regime and provide for specific sanctions."
"Finally, the Commission will report on the implementation of the local border traffic regime two years after the entry into force of the regulation, proposing modifications if necessary."
"I would like to conclude my remarks by stressing that I very much hope Parliament will confirm with its vote its support for the proposal made by the rapporteur, and I will encourage the Council to do the same as soon as possible."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0020/2006) by Mrs Mechtild Rothe on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on heating and cooling from renewable sources of energy [2005/2122(INI)]."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Piebalgs, we – and you, Commissioner – can take it as read that this House will, today, and by a large majority, call upon the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal for heating and cooling using renewable energies."
"As our means to this end, we opted deliberately for a legislative own-initiative report, which is very seldom used and requires a qualified majority, and we did so in order that our initiative might carry a good deal more weight."
"The fact that our report was adopted in Committee unanimously but for a few abstentions shows that a wide range of Members from all the political families will call on the Commission to at last do something about this, and I use the words ‘at last’ in view of the fact that the Commission ought to have stirred itself into action as long ago as May 2004, when its communication on the share of renewable energy in the EU was presented."
"That communication made it quite clear that the predicted failure to achieve the goal of doubling the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption by 2010 was, in essence, attributable to poor market penetration by renewable heating and cooling technologies."
"At present, some 10% of heat is derived from renewable sources of energy such as solar thermal and geothermal energy and biomass – far less than half than what is potentially feasible in the medium or long term."
"Experts work on the assumption that it will, by 2020, be possible to derive at least 25% of the heat and cooling that we need from renewable energy resources, but those sources will be usable only if framework conditions change."
"The fact that the subsidies accorded by at least some Member States are dependent on their own budgets has, however, meant that development has not been really continuous but has been on a stop-start basis."
"What is needed is for broad market penetration to be brought about by a European framework directive."
"It is not reasonable to prescribe a European support system, and nor have we done so."
"What shape support is to take is for the Member States to decide; what matters is that they should actually give some and that all barriers that hinder progress should be removed."
"That means that administrative obstacles must be done away with, that transparent rules on competence must apply and that procedures relating to applications for authorisation must be unambiguous and streamlined."
"With this report, we urge the Commission to present a proposal for a directive obliging the Member States to legislate in favour of heating and cooling from renewable energy sources and also to draw up action plans for future development."
"The intention is that action should be taken on the basis of effective national goals and result in at least a twofold increase across the EU by 2020."
"Many people in the European Union, Commissioner, are waiting for the Commission to take action."
"They worry about the environment and our climate; among them are many small and medium-sized businesses with great potential for employment, who particularly want to make their contribution to the production of heat from the sun, the earth, and from biomass."
"We were delighted to note that the biomass action plan included the announcement of the eventual production of a directive."
"I have since seen a preliminary draft of the Energy Green Paper, which has been floating around the corridors of Brussels, and was shocked to see that nowhere in it is there any reference to the need for new things to be done about heating."
"In this draft Green Paper, incredibly, there is scant reference to renewable energy sources at all."
"I hope that you, Commissioner Piebalgs, will be able to allay my concerns following the reading of this draft Green Paper, and also that you will again display the commitment to efficiency and renewable energies for which we know you."
"I hope that you announce that the Commission will, this year, produce a proposal for a directive on heating and cooling from renewable sources of energy."
". Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Rothe for her work and her very strong commitment to renewable energy."
"My services have already started to prepare an impact assessment on an action in favour of heating and cooling from renewable energy sources."
"There is no doubt that the very complete and balanced report presented by Mrs Rothe will be very useful to the Commission when preparing action in this new field."
"The international energy situation, our strong dependency on imports and the fight against climate change remind us of the urgent need to address the issues related to renewable energies."
"As you know, the Commission intends to adopt a Green Paper on a secure, sustainable and competitive energy policy on 8 March."
"Whatever you have seen to date, it is not the Green Paper."
"The Green Paper will be adopted on 8 March by the whole college, and there will be no backtracking from energy efficiency and from renewable energies."
"It will also show that all these measures are necessary to build security of supply, to fight climate change and to achieve environmental objectives, as well as to increase competitiveness."
"We will strive to achieve a balanced approach, but that does not mean backtracking; that is clearly not the way we would like to present it."
"However, there is still some time before the Commission completes its work on this Green Paper."
"Since 1997, the European Union has been working towards the objective of 12% of renewable energy balance by 2010 but, to date, we have achieved only half of that goal."
"While we now have legislation on the promotion of electricity generation from renewable energy and on the promotion of biofuels, the production of heating and cooling from renewable energy – the third pillar of the renewable energy portfolio – lacks a specific strategy."
"Without a vigorous development of renewable energy in the sector of heating and cooling, the overall objective of 12% renewable energy by 2010 will not be achieved."
"Promoting heating and cooling from renewable energy will contribute to a number of important objectives: it will reduce our external energy dependency, it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and it will create a European industry and promote local employment."
"It will therefore help us make progress towards the goals of the Lisbon strategy."
"I would like to react to some of the issues raised by Mrs Rothe’s report."
"I agree that we should take practical steps to promote heating and cooling from renewable energy more vigorously."
"I can promise you that we will work hard to table a legislative proposal as quickly as possible and certainly before the end of this year, since that is already in the 2006 work programme."
"However, there is a need to take a different approach from earlier directives, because the key problems lie in market confidence and attitudes rather than costs."
"Subsidiarity is another key issue."
"By nature, all these energies are decentralised and will, therefore, have to be implemented at local level."
"We have to tailor our legislation to take account of this."
"Beyond a legislative instrument, it might be interesting to evaluate what progress could be made through standardisation."
"I am convinced that we should set the scene for industry to develop a market for this type of equipment."
"Mrs Rothe’s report contributes to the objectives of the European energy policy, and I very much welcome it."
". Mr President, Commissioner Piebalgs, whilst we know that heating and cooling account for nearly half of the energy consumption in the European Union, nothing has been done about a more efficient use of energy."
"This directive is, in actual fact, the keystone of European energy policy."
"Mrs Rothe’s report, which is one of Parliament’s initiatives, is therefore very timely."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the European Parliament have decided in favour of doubling the present share of renewable energy sources in energy consumption for heating and cooling by 2020."
"In many cases, this energy can be generated locally, and the technology needed to do so – not least that using sun, wind, water, bio-mass and soil heat – has improved substantially."
"Whilst Europe is ahead in terms of technological expertise, we are lagging behind where its practical application is concerned."
"Europe must become the front runner in product innovation and commercialisation."
"If this rate of development in the sector is set to continue, many jobs will also be created."
"We only have to look at the German example, where between 1998 and 2002, employment in the energy sector doubled to approximately 125 000 jobs as a consequence."
"In order to implement this policy, the Member States must put forward viable national objectives and provide for an energy mix within the constraints of their own possibilities."
"The PPE-DE Group is opposed to overregulation and binding objectives at the present time."
"This may be ambitious, but it is mainly realistic, and that is why we have decided in favour of effective national objectives combined with viable targets."
"Finally, I should like to ask Commissioner Piebalgs to make better use of the scope for financial support from the Structural Funds in the period 2007-2013."
"The guidelines provide for opportunities, but it is up to the Member States to decide whether or not to seize them."
"In this incentives policy too, we must ensure that these priorities are in place with the Union’s and Member States’ existing funds."
"This is a cry from the heart which I would like you to take home."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to Mechtild Rothe."
"We support the approach she has chosen and, obviously, her idea for a framework directive."
"The last few months have shown in no uncertain way how important it is to develop alternative energy sources and make energy savings."
"It is vitally important to reduce Europe’s dependence on imports of fossil fuels and energy once and for all."
"How will we be able to cope with a dependence rate of 70% in the year 2030?"
"Our future will be in outside hands, therefore, if we do not change the situation."
"There needs to be support in the European Union for new technology and innovations which make use of alternative forms of energy for heating and cooling."
"These innovations could substantially extend our range of energy sources."
"The use of biomass and new technologies will create jobs and business opportunities, and so they are a good thing from this point of view as well."
"I am happy that the Commission has just approved the work programme which will begin the implementation of the Intelligent Energy Europe programme."
"I believe that Parliament will give this measure its support."
"Under this programme, a series of SWOT analyses were undertaken on the Union’s initiative."
"These aim specifically to promote heating and cooling though the use of renewable energy sources and heat pumps."
"This new technique has now already proved to be a way of significantly reducing electrical consumption in heating and cooling – by up to a third, in fact."
"By using equipment such as this, which can be assembled and installed easily anywhere in a building, we can achieve enormous savings in energy."
"I believe that it is better to cut down consumption, which is also a good guiding principle in life generally."
"This was brief, but I wanted to say it."
"I believe that our Commissioner has now heard what we wanted to say."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by echoing this own-initiative report and calling on the Commission not to delay in presenting draft legislation concerning the proportion of renewable energy within the heating and cooling sector."
"There is broad support here in Parliament for what such a directive should contain."
"In accordance with the ambition stated in the Commission’s 1997 White Paper for a Community Strategy and Action Plan, ‘Energy for the future: renewable sources of energy’, we are eager to supplement the two directives on the promotion of renewable energy sources in relation to, respectively, electricity and transport with a third directive, this time in relation to heating."
"Of Europe’s total energy consumption, almost half goes on heating."
"Given today’s warning signals concerning climate change and in view of the fact that we are so dependent on imports of traditional energy sources with consequent high carbon dioxide emissions, it is extremely important for us to exploit the huge potential for renewable energy sources in Europe, together with our existing resources in terms of such renewables."
"There are great benefits to be gained from increasing the proportion of these within the heating and cooling sector."
"Allow me to mention a few of them."
"We should reduce carbon dioxide emissions; we should reduce our dependency on imports and increase the degree to which we are self-sufficient in Europe; we should not be as easily affected by energy crises in other parts of the world; and, by promoting renewable energy sources, we should provide incentives for innovation and technical development within this area which, in turn, would lead to further cleaner and more efficient energy consumption."
"The fact that the choice of renewable energy source would be made in the light of each Member State’s requirements would mean that we should be contributing to regional development."
"Moreover, we should be creating a lot of jobs, as this is one of the few spheres in which we are, in fact, clearly creating new jobs in Europe and are rightly heading in the direction of increased growth."
"These are the needs and the benefits, but how do we meet these needs and obtain these benefits?"
"I believe that nationally binding targets for the proportion of renewable energy is a first step, but it is not enough."
"I hope that the Commission will also create the basic conditions required if companies are to dare to make long-term investments in technology that will permit the increased use of renewable energy sources, and I call on it to do so. I also hope that the Commission will provide crucial research with the resources required for discovering and developing new technology and, again, I call on it to do so."
"Finally, I would draw attention to the technical solutions that already exist whereby we might obtain more efficient use of the energy we exploit to heat houses, namely district heating."
"Technical solutions and choices of energy source go hand in hand."
"Modern, technically advanced district heating is part of the solution, and it may also be combined with what is known as trigeneration electricity production."
"This own-initiative report shows clearly and unambiguously what Parliament wants to see in terms of future draft legislation."
"I hope that the Commission will quickly follow up this initiative so that we lose no time in obtaining the incentives needed for changing over to using an ever higher proportion of renewable energy sources for heating Europe or cooling it down."
"As Einstein once said, a whole new way of thinking is required for solving the problems we have created through our old way of thinking."
"Parliament has made important efforts in this direction."
"We now hope that the Commission will complete the work."
". Mr President, I have only a minute, so I will be brief."
"Many thanks, Mrs Rothe, you tireless campaigner, for this good piece of work."
"I would like to give an example of the potential involved here; in Upper Austria, 1 500 new houses are built every year."
"Ten years ago, 1 200 of them were fitted with oil heating."
"In Upper Austria this year, only seven were so equipped; all the others used biomass, networks or pellets instead for heating."
"That created jobs in the forestry sector, in agriculture, and for local installing engineers, so that today, indeed, oil merchants have gone over to selling pellets."
"That is the way we must go, or, to put it another way, we have to take the good practice that is to be found at the local and regional levels, and put it to work across Europe."
"I might add that Denmark, too, has done exemplary work in this respect, an example that we in this House will, this afternoon, vote to follow."
"It will then be for you to put the work in."
"Just another thing on the subject of the Green Paper, Commissioner: if we are to win Europeans over, there needs to be a chapter in it with the title ‘’ That is what the people of Europe expect of us, and you should not fall short of that standard."
". () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to state that I regard the report as a well-executed piece of work."
"It provides an accurate outline of the current situation regarding the use of renewable sources of energy for heating and cooling."
"On the other hand, the European Parliament has repeatedly declared the need for greater use of renewables, and adopted the correct decisions and recommendations, only for little to change."
"Politicians talk more about the need to use renewables than those who take the real decisions in this area, that is to say the general public."
"One reason for this may be that the Member States have not been able to create the right conditions for the greater use of renewables and have not convinced people of the case for them."
"Consequently, as the report states, northern Denmark uses more solar energy than southern Italy, for example."
"The recommendations therefore attach great importance to informing and persuading people."
"They will only really take this on board, however, when renewables become more advantageous for them."
"The price of these types of energy is therefore important and this is part and parcel of creating the right conditions for the use of renewables."
"A current example of this from the Czech Republic does not directly involve renewables, but is all the more instructive for that."
"When the call was raised for the use of natural gas as a more environmentally-friendly form of heating, it brought a quick response, not only from individuals, but also from local and municipal authorities, who compared it with other fuels and, supported by various instruments, switched to gas."
"Now, however, after several major increases in gas prices they are returning in large numbers to types of fuel that are very bad for the environment, such as cheap and low-grade forms of coal, along with the inefficient burning not only of wood but even of plastics and tyres in local heating plants."
"They can, in short, no longer afford gas."
"It is therefore just as important to create the right conditions as it is to take sensible decisions, to make use of all the elements in the energy mix and to support energy saving measures."
"Otherwise, we may find ourselves following the example of the moth which, in its longing to draw closer to light and heat, often finds only death."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Rothe for the report before us."
"Heating, cooling and the use of renewable energy are part of the broader issue of security of the European Union’s energy supply."
"There is more to saving energy than protecting the environment."
"It also has a significant bearing on the economy and is linked to the development of renewable energy sources."
"The importance of this problem has been highlighted by recent cases of energy terrorism."
"I refer to increasing the cost of fuel, with negative implications for the financial health of businesses and the citizens’ standard of living."
"I should like to mention three concerns."
"Firstly, setting 2020 as the time period within which to implement programmes on energy saving suggests a static approach to the challenge. It fails to take account of activities on the global market, and amounts to inertia."
"Secondly, tax concessions and lower VAT rates should apply to all activities involving the use, exploitation and creation of new sources of renewable energy."
"Thirdly, the use of currently unexploited agricultural land for the production of biomass and sustainable fuels should be speeded up."
"The regulation of agricultural production in the European Union comes into play here, together with the lack of appropriate subsidies for the production of vegetables and fruit, notably soft fruit."
"The area of unexploited land is set to increase, leading to an increase in poverty and unemployment in rural areas."
"If the production of the biomass and fuels I mentioned is developed quickly, it will create employment and improve the security of energy supply for our countries."
"() Mr President, Commissioner, heating and cooling accounts for 49% of the energy consumed on our continent."
"I assume that a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions will form part of any responsible energy plan."
"I firmly believe that, along with the nuclear plants that serve mainly for generating electricity, it is chiefly through the use of renewables for heating and cooling that we will manage to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the future."
"The less we use fossil fuels for these purposes the better, not only from the standpoint of global climate change, but also from the standpoint of reducing dependence on imports from outside Europe."
"The use of renewables also has a largely positive influence on the rural economy, which is where the new energy plants will be located, with the creation of new jobs."
"This report, which the rapporteur has drawn up on the basis of detailed investigations and discussions, presents a whole raft of strategic measures that must be implemented if we are to overcome the obstacles to greater use of renewables."
"Speaking as an MEP from the Czech Republic, however, I must state that the position of renewables on the market weakened after accession to the EU because the mandatory bracketing of, for example, briquettes and pellets made from biomass into higher VAT bands led to a sharp decline in a market that had been showing promising signs of development."
"All of the new Member States are in the same situation."
"It is paradoxical that the neighbouring states of Germany and Austria have exceptions allowing these products to be bracketed in a lower VAT band."
"This has brought about a situation where the Czech Republic’s entire output of briquettes and pellets made from biomass is exported to these countries."
"At the same time, our domestic market is seeing an increase in energy costs and, rather than switching to renewables, people are instead opting for cheaper energy sources, which in our case often means low-grade brown coal."
"I therefore strongly endorse the call from the Commission and the Council for a revision of the Sixth Council Directive, allowing the implementation of lower VAT rates for renewables."
"We can and must do this at European level."
"I support the report and I would like to thank the rapporteur for doing a good job."
"I should also like to say that this offers a promising way forward for the Commission and the individual Member States."
"Mr President, I would like to emphasise that Mechtild Rothe’s report should be greatly commended, above all for the establishment of binding obligations on Member States in the use of renewable energy."
"As we know, the present energy market in the European Union is severely distorted."
"Among other things, this is due to uneven subsidisation and the fact that subsidies for fossil fuels (coal, brown coal, oil shale) and nuclear energy are considerably greater than those for renewable energy."
"In several Member States, this situation has been brought about by the monopolistic position of those power plants that use fossil fuels."
"This situation has also been the primary obstacle to the formation of a common energy policy in the European Union."
"At the moment, given that our external supply reliability is inadequate as well, one can only hope that the lesson Russia taught Europe at the beginning of the year will offer an additional stimulus to the development of renewable energy in the European Union, and that improving cooperation between the Member States will indeed lead us to a common European energy policy."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak in place of my colleague, Fiona Hall, who cannot be here this morning because of a pressing engagement with Commissioner Mandelson."
"I should like to thank both Mrs Hall for the valuable work she has done on this resolution, along with the other shadow rapporteurs, and the rapporteur herself, whose skilful mediation and collation work has led to a text that enjoys broad support in this Parliament."
"The objective that the European Parliament is setting itself with this resolution is an ambitious one in my view."
"First of all, it is ambitious in its methods, because Parliament is taking a proactive role under the Rule 39 procedure and is calling on the Commission to put forward a legislative act that is needed to fill a gap, to put that missing piece in place in the structure of the legislative and legal framework. That will enable us to make significant progress towards the use of renewable energies, in particular for the heating and cooling sector."
"I think everyone is surprised to learn that 50% of Europe’s energy requirements are used for heating."
"That reveals the obvious need for a legislative provision, without which the sector cannot grow – something that was also acknowledged by the Commission in its report on energy efficiency."
"The sector also needs to be given some certainty."
"Without the certainty of possible growth there will be no investment and no research; in short, there will not be that kind of concentration of resources and energies that will enable the sector to make a qualitative leap."
"Secondly, Parliament’s objective is also important and ambitious in that it sets a deadline of 2020."
"Some may perhaps consider that deadline to be rather timid and limited, but I believe we should see it as a target to beat."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about a share of over 20%, we are hoping to achieve a significant percentage, more than double the current share for renewable sources of energy."
"To conclude, I believe that there is a clear commitment in Parliament and from certain Members – I see Vittorio Prodi is here for the subject of biomass."
"We also call on the Commission – and, subsequently, the Member States when implementing the directive – to work particularly hard to reduce our energy dependence, which might have a serious effect on our future growth and development."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, security of energy supply has, over past weeks and months, been the big issue, and there are numerous things that we need if we are to address it."
"I do believe, though, that we must make a big issue of heating with renewable energies too."
"Why?"
"Their potential is particularly great."
"The association for that industry in my own country, Germany – the one I know best – talks in terms of our being able, in the space of ten years, to increase the proportion of newly-installed plant running on renewable energies from 8 to 80%, that is to say ten-fold."
"That involves a tenfold multiplication of the new installations rather than the share in energy use across the board."
"It is not Greenpeace that is saying this, but an industrial association."
"The use of renewable energies for heating purposes is also good value in comparison to other sources of energy, such as solar radiation or photovoltaic cells; prices can often differ by a ratio of 1 to 45."
"We have, then given the least support where there was the greatest potential, and so something has to change in this respect."
"I also believe that this is not just a national issue, but also a European one, for the reason why heating and cooling with renewable energies is not yet the order of the day has nothing to do with the generally complex technology."
"What is needed instead is for the equipment to be produced in larger quantities in order to achieve a critical mass at which the equipment becomes better value for the end user."
"It will of course be easier to reach this critical mass at European level than it would be if every country were to work for itself."
"I do not think that endorsement of Mrs Rothe’s report in any way contradicts my support, and my party’s, for nuclear power."
"I believe that both renewable energy and atomic energy are needed."
"The false antithesis must be done away with; it must be removed from the Green Paper, too, and it is for that reason that I also endorse what has been said about that document."
"What is needed, and as soon as possible, is a concrete proposal from the Commission, and I am obliged to Commissioner Piebalgs for announcing that one will be forthcoming in 2006; that means that umpteen billions spent by European consumers on imported energy can be saved and the money invested in something more constructive."
"I would like to express my thanks to Mrs Rothe for her excellent report."
"There are only a few regions in Europe that have formulated and implemented successful strategies for energy generation from renewable sources."
"Differences in development are not based on differences in opportunities but on political agendas."
"The only way forward is to set major targets jointly, I reiterate the word jointly, and to monitor their attainment."
"I would like to emphasise that it is essential to offer incentives to investors who go down the road of renewable energy sources."
"One of the proposed incentives, also mentioned by my colleague, Mr Březina, would be to offer a lower VAT rate."
"It is a good incentive, but on the other hand it will not motivate countries with a flat-rate tax."
"I believe that the future of Europe will not move in the direction of the flat-rate tax."
"However, we need to take account of the fact that countries that have already implemented the flat-rate tax will not be willing to give it up."
"In conclusion, allow me to provide an example."
"The city where I have held the office of mayor for the past seven years is generating 15% of its energy from renewable sources."
"Thanks in part to the Structural Funds, that proportion will reach 50% in two years’ time, something for which I would like express my gratitude."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the recent cuts in natural gas supply in Ukraine have brought us face to face with a problem to which we had perhaps not attached the importance it deserved."
"Furthermore, over recent weeks, the price of a barrel of crude has oscillated between 60 and 65 dollars, a price that would have seemed unthinkable a few years ago."
"If we add to all of this the unstable situation in the Middle East, the conclusion is clear: the European Union must act urgently."
"We cannot carry on taking a complacent view of our dependence on external sources of energy."
"We must act intelligently and decisively, because there is no time to lose."
"I do not doubt that the initiatives announced by the Commissioner will have significant benefits for the Union’s future, but we cannot forget the legislation that has already entered into force and that has not been transposed into national legislation by certain Member States with sufficient rigour."
"There is no question that current oil prices provide a reference for the thresholds of viability for replacement technologies: there is a great opportunity here for renewable energy sources to reach competitive prices with public aid, in line with the legislation on State aid."
"As the Commissioner has correctly diagnosed, compliance with the directive on renewable energy sources is turning out to be difficult."
"Biomass must play a fundamental role, since its potential is under-exploited."
"The directive on energy efficiency in buildings already contains certain provisions, on the use of biomass in heating, which need to be enhanced."
"We believe that a new directive on heating and refrigeration that takes account of the excellent report by Mrs Rothe, and hence of renewable energy sources, must include objectives that are both ambitious and realistic: clear guidelines on funding mechanisms and an exemplary role for the public sector."
"We are sure that the Commission will respond once again to these expectations."
"– I would like to congratulate rapporteur Mechtild Rothe and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"This initiative will encourage EU states to embrace the use of renewable energy sources for heating and cooling and to create economic incentives for this."
"When discussing standards of energy efficiency in buildings, it is worth underlining a problem common to Lithuania, all of the Baltic countries and some of the other new EU Member States."
"A large proportion of the urban population there live in poor quality apartment blocks, built 20-40 years ago, if not earlier."
"These buildings have little heat insulation, heat use is regulated from a central boiler, and residents are unable to select the desired temperature."
"Both national governments and the European Commission should devote more attention to this problem."
"Money from the Union and Structural Funds should be allocated for the renovation of such buildings, in order to guarantee that homes are heated efficiently."
"The Commission could collate the best examples of similar house reconstructions, in order to help national governments decide whether to renovate or demolish such buildings."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very clear report, particularly the explanatory statement, which uses illustrations."
"This is marvellous and I wish it happened with other reports."
"I speak as the President of the Forum for Construction in the European Parliament."
"I cannot overemphasise the need for proper building insulation and, as my colleague just said, the need to stop the waste of energy in these enormous slab blocks in the Eastern European countries that are now in the European Union."
"Some action is desperately needed in that area."
"I apologise, on behalf of the United Kingdom, that it has not been up to speed with other countries in these renewable energy, heating and cooling measures."
"I am sure we will go up the league tables in the next few years."
"I fully support the rapporteur’s point that there should be national support schemes."
"She highlights the fact that the Member States can use these as a matter of principle, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"She points out that any support should be limited in time and gradually reduced."
"I could not agree more."
"She then goes on to say that there should be incentive mechanisms to achieve a high degree of market penetration and, finally, that associated heating and cooling networks should be encouraged."
"This report is to be welcomed by the industry and the European Parliament and will ensure that we have safe and secure energy supplies in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Rothe on her excellent own-initiative report, which clearly calls upon the European Commission to draw up a legislative proposal on increasing the share of renewable energy in heating and cooling by July 2006."
"Heat and cooling networks and biomass, particularly woody biomass, are important outlets for the timber industry, fit in perfectly with a sustainable European forestry strategy and can support European efforts towards sustainable development, particularly the aim of 12% of all energy consumed being from renewable sources by 2010."
"However, there is currently no legislation governing the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling, and this gap must be filled following the publication of the European Commission's biomass action plan on 7 December last year."
"I would like to emphasise three points that I see as important."
"First of all, on 28 January, the Ecofin Council concluded a political agreement to extend the experimental reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services until 2010."
"The important new aspect for the subject we are now discussing is the inclusion of district heating in the option provided for in Article 12(3)(b) of the sixth VAT Directive, under the same heading as the supply of natural gas and electricity."
"The Member States can therefore now put an end to this disparity in the tax treatment of sales of heating energy and subscriptions to heat and cooling networks using renewable energy, and the supply of natural gas and electricity."
"I fully support the rapporteur's recommendation regarding the use of the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Funds and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD)."
"Promoting the use of renewable energy sources signifies a direct implementation of the goals of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Indeed it brings to the fore concern for the environment, the encouragement of innovation and the infrastructure that must facilitate competitiveness and independent growth in Europe."
"Renewable energy sources are the natural wealth of the European Union, reducing our dependence on imports and improving our environment."
"At the same time their use increases the diversity of energy sources, and improves the reliability of energy supply."
"We must exploit them not simply to produce electricity, but also for heating and cooling buildings, since that alone accounts for more than 40% of the use of all energy in Europe."
"A recent Eurobarometer survey showed that people support a common European energy policy."
"For this reason in Europe we must also formulate clear guidelines and incentives in the area of cooling and heating."
"We must set ourselves a common goal, but leave it to the Member States to formulate their own national goals, which should be rational and binding."
"Goals must be set relative to the natural features of individual countries, since they do not all enjoy the same conditions, for instance in the exploitation of solar energy or biomass."
"In fact it is precisely with biomass that we should exercise particular caution over how to encourage its use."
"It is also a raw material for the wood processing industry, and serves to create numerous jobs and high added value."
"By using wood as a natural material, less energy is used in making the final product, while at the same time this reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and the wood retains the carbon dioxide, that has built up in the tree over a number of years."
"May I close by pointing out that for energy purposes it is prudent to use only wood waste that is unsuitable for recycling, while the rest can be processed into useful raw materials."
"The European energy policy must also be formulated to accommodate this."
"Europe is the largest energy importer in the world."
"However, the price of imported energy is rising, and energy is imported from politically and economically unstable regions."
"These facts are forcing us to reduce, and if possible, eliminate our dependency on imported energy and our vulnerability."
"To this end, apart from rationalising our energy consumption and making it more efficient, we must also increase the use of renewable energy sources situated in Europe."
"The steps taken in this respect by the European Union in the last decade have proved to be successful: in respect of wind energy, the EU reached the target set for 2010 as early as the end of last year, biomass power plants are spreading dynamically, and biofuels are gaining ground spectacularly."
"What is the secret of this success?"
"I am convinced that it is mainly the EU regulations and mandatory standards accepted here, in Parliament."
"I am against overregulation, but it would be difficult to deny that the legal constraints imposed by the European Union and the targets that we have jointly set are efficient means in urging Member States forward."
"Cooling and heating in the household sector constitute 40% of our current energy consumption."
"On average, renewable energy is used in 10% of European homes, but this figure is only due to the outstanding performance of a few countries, such as Austria, Germany, Greece, etc."
"Other countries, including my own, are hardly using any renewable energy at all, they are not supporting investments in this area and have no government programmes – on the contrary, they are creating administrative obstacles."
"This area must be regulated at European Union level, to enable us to reduce efficiently and at a relatively low cost the utilisation of fossil energy in households, the emission of greenhouse gases and our energy-dependency."
"This is why I support the creation of a directive that addresses this issue."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Rothe for her wholehearted commitment to renewable energy, and also Mr Turmes for warmly commending the Austrian province from which I come for the exemplary work for renewable energy that it is doing, and doing it, moreover, right across the economy, since what matters to us, quite simply, is that energy production be cheap, safe and clean."
"These three considerations must always be seen in context."
"The slogan ‘think globally and act locally’ also applies here."
"We must be constantly aware of the global situation, while also focusing on how measures can be put into practice."
"When issuing building permits or permission to develop land, the authorities should give priority to installations using renewable energy and hence helping to achieve the Kyoto goal."
"I regard the proposal that a decision should be required two months following submission of the application as being an absolute priority, for time is catching up with us, and we should also provide for the burden of proof to be reversed in this regard if the authorities turn down a plan."
"It is also necessary that projects should yield a return on investment in them, and here a wide range of options are available to us."
"I see energy services as presenting, in future, a tremendous opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Some of those Members who have already spoken have – in view of the services directive that we will be agreeing to adopt this week – highlighted the wholly new challenges that cross-border energy supply presents to each and every Member State and the need for simplified procedures in this area."
"One particular priority is that bureaucracy should cease to put obstacles in the way."
"What matters in the final analysis is that domestic resources be used and small circuits promoted."
"That is what we aim to do, and we want to achieve it together with the Commission."
"Mr President, there have been very frequent debates in this House about the demands made on us by energy issues; we have debated the time it takes for resources to burn out, the natural demand for them – which is limited – and also the additional demand that arises from large countries with expanding industries."
"We have, since January, been debating our dependence on individual suppliers, and we have become aware of the need for action in this area."
"It is right, then, that we should also be asking ourselves how we can develop new and additional capacities for heating and cooling."
"That is both right and vital, and I am grateful, too, for the many amendments that have been accepted and incorporated."
"My concern is that we may well be setting ourselves the right goal – of cutting back on consumption and accessing new and renewable energy sources – but that this may be giving us tunnel vision and causing us to believe that this way alone is the right one, that it alone is rationally justifiable and the way of salvation."
"I am wary of approaches that give people the idea that there is but one thing that needs to be done and then all our problems will be solved – what Mr Turmes had to say just now tended in that direction."
"I am firmly convinced, on the other hand – and I agree with those Members who say this – that, while this is an additional option, and one that we must avail ourselves of, it will not spare us the need to answer other questions, for example, to questions like, ‘How do we handle nuclear power?’ or ‘How do we go about using the fossil fuels that we already have in a cleaner way?’"
"I also have my doubts when it comes to the method we should adopt or the means whereby we arrive at the new regulations for the future, for the question arises, and it is a pressing one, of whether we are on the right track if we believe that the only way to come up with solutions to political problems is by way of devising new regulations or by this House adopting them, after which we relax and tell ourselves that everything has now been sorted out."
"Directives making new impositions on the Member States are not the answer."
"This morning, we were told by the Commissioner that 42 directives have been adopted in the energy field alone, with 22 of them dealing with energy efficiency, and even so, we are not satisfied and claim that we are not moving forward fast enough."
"To cut a long story short, the way ahead must be to promote new technologies and benchmarks and develop standards and indicators, so that those who ultimately have to take the decision as to whether to take a new tack are enabled to make comparisons and see where the opportunities and their own advantages lie."
"Dreams will not be enough; what will be are ambitious but realistic objectives differing from nation to nation and dependent on different natural environments and different individual markets."
"It is for that reason that ‘one size fits all’ answers are no use."
". Mr President, I should like to thank you for the very interesting debate, and I also again thank the rapporteur, Mrs Rothe, and all the shadow rapporteurs, for their work."
"I know that you all feel passionately about this subject, and this is definitely not the only answer that we should be looking for in the energy sector."
"I am also passionate about this report."
"The vote in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the debate today have demonstrated very impressive support for the ideas expressed in the report."
"I believe the Commission has already taken strong steps in this direction."
"In the Biomass Action Plan in December 2005 the Commission announced that it would work towards an initiative on heating and cooling from renewable energy sources."
"But at the same time, as some Members have indicated, we care about better legislation and delivering legislation that can be implemented properly and respect the principle of subsidiarity."
"That is why I have asked my services to deliver an impact assessment in this area, because it will also be very important later on in the debate to steer the proposal on the basis of a proper impact assessment."
"On the basis of this impact assessment, I will take a further decision on how to take this important subject further."
"However, at the same time I can tell you that the Commission will meet your expectations, as Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca mentioned, and we are working not only in this direction but also for the implementation of legislation."
"Today I am pleased to inform the Committee on Industry of exactly what we are doing in this respect."
"We have adopted the Biomass Action Plan that I have already mentioned, and recently we adopted the communication on biofuels."
"That shows that the Commission is very serious about achieving better penetration of renewable energies in a European energy mix."
"I thank you for your huge interest in this debate and I hope that by the end of this year I will be able to present a legislative proposal to this House."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, on a point of order, while you are probably the best Vice-President we have in this Parliament, you have already made two mistakes today!"
"And at a recent voting session with Mr Mauro in the chair, he said that one amendment was rejected, when in fact it was adopted by 584 votes to 41."
"How much longer are we going to put up with this ridiculous system?"
"The problem is that when it is not a roll-call vote, people tend not to put their hands up."
"I try to encourage them, but I cannot force them."
"That is why we have so many checks."
"As the first part has been rejected, I suspect the second and third parts should fall."
"Can you help us on that, Mr Hökmark?"
"Mr President, I tend to agree with you that parts two and three do not make sense following the rejection of part one."
"It is not one of my amendments, but I would say that the vote we already had is enough."
"You are the rapporteur."
"The next two parts fall."
". I would like to move the following oral amendment, which has been agreed with the shadow rapporteur of the PSE Group: ‘whereas state aid which does not distort competition is a permissible means of promoting economic development and can thus be one means of promoting the Lisbon Agenda for economic growth and jobs, alongside other tools, including Community funding, such as the structural funds’."
"Mr President, the amendment is already in the Minutes, but I shall read it out again anyway."
"‘Points out that, in its relations with third countries and in the context of promoting democratic principles and human rights through the “democracy clause”, the European Union is called upon to pay special attention to implementing policies for gender equality and women’s rights, whilst satisfying itself that the third-country authorities uphold the fundamental rights not to be arbitrarily arrested, tortured or executed and that their citizens have access to an impartial court of law as a priority;’"
". Mr President, I wish to speak briefly on my report on access restrictions to fisheries under the common fisheries policy."
"I call on colleagues to give their full support to this report on access restrictions to the CFP, which cover the Shetland Box and the Plaice Box."
"This report is good news for sustainable EU fisheries policy as it recognises the need to make sensitive use of access restrictions."
"I should like to thank the PSE Group for its invaluable backing."
"The restrictions covered by this report are of obvious importance, and I call on all colleagues to vote for paragraph 8 and for the resolution as a whole."
"That concludes the vote."
". The text of Council Regulation (EC) No 1786/2003 contains a number of errors, which should be corrected without delay."
"Accordingly, following the amendment to the Combined Nomenclature, CN codes 1214 90 91 and 1214 90 99 should be replaced by CN code 1214 90 90."
"The guaranteed maximum quantity of dried fodder of 4 855 900 tonnes should be replaced by 4 960 723 tonnes, which corresponds to the sum of current national quantities."
"Furthermore, the method of calculating the reduction in support in the event of this quantity being exceeded needs to be amended."
"The Commission’s proposal meets the need to correct Council Regulation No 1786/2003."
"The proposed amendment is appropriate and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s favourable opinion should be supported by Parliament."
". The partnership agreement between the EC and the Solomon Islands is based on the mandate conferred on the Commission by the Council in June 2001 to negotiate bilateral tuna fishery agreements with ACP countries of the Central West Pacific, with a view to setting up a network of tuna agreements for the Community fleet operating in the Pacific region."
"I wholeheartedly support the rapporteur’s position in this document, but wish to highlight the importance of Amendment 5, which states that, when the first meeting of the Joint Committee is held, the Commission must inform the Solomon Islands authorities of the attendance of shipowners’ representatives at subsequent meetings of the Joint Committee."
"I therefore back the adoption of this report."
"This report in essence exports the EU's disastrous common fisheries policy to the Solomon Islands, and has little to recommend it; therefore I voted against, and am saddened that the House has chosen to endorse it."
"The common fisheries policy is an unmitigated disaster which should be swept away, not perpetuated and exported to third countries."
"The report discusses an issue in connection with which the value of the internal market has to be weighed up against national self-determination."
"A relevant case (C-156/04) is under way in the European Court of Justice at this very time."
"We do not believe that discussion of the matter would be in any way advanced by means of a statement here and now by the European Parliament."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against this report, but we wish to emphasise that we are not adopting a substantial position in the continuing debate."
"The European Court of Justice must first adopt a position and give a judgment."
"Subsequently, the Greek authorities and the national parliament will have to discuss how they are to deal with the European Court of Justice’s decision."
"Mr President, with regard to the report by my colleague Mr Őry, I am torn between three feelings: satisfaction, regret and a wish."
"My satisfaction is at the completion of the efforts initiated in 1994 to take a concerted approach to the risks faced by workers."
"The attitude of our societies towards life's risks is a key element in the European social model that differentiates it from many others."
"My regret is that the European Commission, under pressure from the Council, was not willing to negotiate with Parliament regarding the most reasonable solution, namely invoking the subsidiarity principle."
"That would have relieved our fear that the states would be obliged to transpose the rules on solar radiation because they are referred to in the framework directive."
"The Council turning its nose up at the subsidiarity principle in collusion with the Commission – that really is a paradox!"
"My wish is that in future we will be able to deal with the issue of solar radiation flexibly, without pointless legislation or bureaucracy."
"For example, the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work, based in Bilbao, could launch a major information campaign aimed at European workers, warning them of the risks presented by exposure to the sun."
". We abstained from the vote because the Commission and the Council gave way to pressure from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the liberals and excluded solar radiation from the scope of this directive."
"This position is all the more appalling given that optical radiation is known to fall under the category of electromagnetic radiation, which mainly comprises direct light, infrared and ultraviolet rays, and laser rays."
"Solar radiation is composed of ultraviolet and infrared rays, and direct light."
"The effects of such radiation on people’s health are known to bring about changes to the immune system, and to cause skin diseases, eye diseases, cancers and psychological conditions."
"The quality of life of many millions of people in the EU working in farming, fishing and building, in open air salt works, quarries and mines, as well as in leisure activities, is adversely affected due to exposure to solar radiation in the course of their work."
"Accordingly, whilst we did not vote against this directive – containing, as it does, a number of significant improvements as regards artificial radiation – its scope is limited due to its omission of solar radiation."
". I voted in favour of this conciliation outcome."
"The fact that the title and scope of the directive have been amended to cover optical radiations from artificial sources only is to be welcomed."
"I hope the Commission will learn from this, having originally brought ridicule upon the EU by proposing to ban sunshine - giving a public relations gift to eurosceptics and their ever-supportive media."
"That unnecessary row could have been avoided, but I welcome this belated acceptance of the European Parliament's commonsense decision."
"Now we will have a directive which legitimately seeks to protect workers who work with lasers and electrical welding equipment, those in the steel and glass industries and those in artificial tanning businesses."
"The accepted guidelines are designed to prevent the acute and long-term effects to the eyes and skin that can occur with high levels of exposure."
". I welcome this report on the protection of workers against risks arising from optical and artificial sources of radiation."
"I believe it is sensible for Parliament to establish exposure limit values, as this provides workers with a safeguard against artificial sources such as lasers, cathode tubes and welding instruments."
". I naturally voted in favour of the directive intended to protect workers from the risks arising from exposure to optical radiation."
"This text is a continuation of three previous directives that also aimed to protect workers from the dangers of various 'physical agents' such as exposure to noise, vibrations and electromagnetic fields."
"This directive primarily relates to radiation sources such as lasers and infrared lamps."
"It refers in particular to adapting working methods in order to reduce the risks of radiation and the duration and level of exposure."
"It also calls on the European Commission to draw up a practical guide for employers, in particular SMEs."
"This latter measure is worth emphasising, because I feel that the EU needs to do more to help SMEs, which are a real spearhead of innovation and job creation in the Europe of 25."
"This applicable legislation combines flexibility for employers and safety for employees."
"It is therefore a specific example proving that, contrary to the ideas propagated by the specialist and non-specialist new Eurosceptics, the European Union takes care of both salaried and non-salaried workers, in the East and in the West, and often advocates standardising the social legislation of the Member States at the highest level."
"I voted against this proposal at first reading, but the governments of the Member States have now improved it."
"This directive does not involve extensive new legislation but merely applies already current laws to areas in which the EU has already assumed competence."
"The bizarre proposal to include solar radiation has been removed."
"Moreover, the rules are based on international conventions and, where there are no such conventions, national legislation is accepted."
"Health surveillance and subsequent checks are to be carried out in accordance with national practices."
"This is, therefore, a decently balanced and acceptable proposal."
"The advantages in terms of protecting workers outweigh the problem of having further legislation, because this directive does not in practice lead to any new EU powers."
". This is a classic example of the often painfully slow nature of the European decision-making process."
"The proposal on which we voted today has been on the table since 1992, even though it addresses an issue as crucial as the protection of workers’ health."
"It has taken 13 long years for Parliament’s approach to prevail."
"The text that has just been adopted addresses the exposure of workers to artificial radiation and excludes natural source radiation from the scope of the directive. It was decided that, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, the latter is an issue that should be addressed at national level, depending on national conditions and needs."
"I voted in favour of this report because I agree that it is unworkable for the EU to oblige employers in the 25 Member States to assess the health and safety risks to workers exposed to sunlight."
"I feel that assessments of this nature should be carried out at national level, commensurate with the situation in each country."
"Under this directive, employers must implement measures relating to choice of equipment, workplace design and length of time of exposure with a view to preventing or reducing their employees’ risk of being exposed to artificial radiation."
". This directive now more clearly applies to artificial radiation, and I welcome it back to Parliament and was pleased to vote for it."
"It is unfortunate that the initial drafts of the legislation gave rise to so many silly stories about the EU attempting to regulate sunlight when the aims of the legislation - to protect European workers from harmful radiation - are so worthy."
"I am glad that Parliament was able to make this legislation sensible by doing our job, and I am pleased to vote for it today."
"Mr President, I should like to give an explanation of vote to clarify why we in the CDA Party have voted against the report."
"We have done so because, whilst we are in favour of animal welfare, certainly in the poultry sector, it is unacceptable that we should not prescribe the same requirements for imports."
"A second reason is that this report leads to more bureaucracy, while we in Europe need less of it."
"We want less red tape, also because the impact of the introduction of this directive is only assessed after the event and not before."
"That strikes us as cheap politics on the back of European poultry farmers, which is not what we want."
"What we do want is improved welfare, provided this is established on the basis of a fair distribution of the burden between consumers and producers."
"I would like Mrs McGuinness to be given another opportunity to speak on this subject."
"Mr President, I share the concerns of my colleague, Mr Maat."
"I think this directive will force a race to the bottom."
"It will force broiler production out of the European Union, outside our borders and we will not be in control of what is happening."
"People will be none the wiser, because we do not have labelling."
"Mr President, I am in complete agreement with the previous two speakers."
"It is true that whilst the extent of civilisation of a society is partly defined by the way in which people in that society treat animals, I am also convinced that farmers, in this case the chicken farmers in our countries, should certainly not be accused of cruelty or insensitivity towards those animals."
"I would, above all, though, draw your attention to the fact that our European companies have to face unreasonable competition from meat imports from non-European countries, such as Brazil and Thailand, where totally different standards apply to such things as stocking densities, food safety, retracing, the use of animal meal and antibiotics."
"The European broiler chicken farmers certainly do not want to return to an era where ‘anything goes’, and are prepared to breed in an animal- and environmentally-friendly manner, provided that all the imported meat complies with the same standards, which, at present, is unfortunately not the case."
"It is sad to say, but we are actually leaving our own European breeders high and dry."
". Today in the votes on the report on 'Rules for the protection of chickens kept for meat production', I voted to maximise the protection of our poultry industry against the threats of cheap imports, which already has robbed Northern Ireland of a poultry factory in recent weeks."
"It is understandable to be concerned about poultry welfare, but there is no sense in so hyping welfare requirements in the EU that we drive producers out of business and become dependent on imports from Far Eastern and South American countries where no enforceable welfare restraints apply to production."
"That serves only to increase the number of poultry reared in appalling conditions."
"Thus, we need to balance animal welfare requirements in the EU with ensuring a viable industry survives."
"I therefore today in the votes in the Parliament opposed any further reduction in stocking density as such will inevitably severely affect the economics of broiler chicken production within Europe."
". I registered an abstention on the final vote on the Berman report."
"As a vegetarian, I have strong reservations about the whole meat production business."
"If the business of rearing livestock for meat continues, and I accept that it will, then I very much believe it should be organic and natural."
"Failing that, standards must be as high as possible."
"We voted in favour of this report. Although we do not endorse all of its recommendations, we are broadly in favour of the thrust of its aims."
"We believe it is necessary to strike a balance between the improvements that must be made to animal welfare, the rights and interests of small and medium-sized farmers and consumers’ rights."
"We know that it is necessary to implement a system for assessing the welfare of all flocks in the slaughterhouse, but we also know that there are costs to be taken into account and that small operations do not usually have the conditions in place to carry out these assessments."
"We therefore advocate an extended deadline to allow for a trial period and subsequent adaptation to a system that does not exist in Portugal."
"We also feel that, as things stand, some of the proposals that have arisen in plenary have been excessive, and do not support them given the detrimental consequences that they may have for small producers, if there is no trial period."
". This report is very timely, coinciding as it does with the first ever action plan on animal protection."
"Again the EU is taking a lead in improving animal welfare standards."
"The proposal addresses public concern that the current welfare standards for chickens kept for meat are too low."
"The result is that broiler chickens suffer from leg disorders and lameness, enlargement of the heart, sudden death syndrome and ammonia burns."
"The report calls for reduction in stocking density, minimum depth of litter, improved ventilation and a nesting period of at least six hours of uninterrupted darkness."
"It also looks at the cruelty of beak trimming and only allows it when other measures to prevent cannibalism are exhausted."
"I welcome the report, even if some of the above proposals fell."
"I wanted it to go further but what is here is good for chickens and consumers."
"Healthier birds produce a better quality product."
"We are not exporting poor animal welfare provisions, rather raising standards for both poultry and people."
"We have, to the best of our ability, voted in favour of better animal husbandry."
"A number of amendments to be voted on were, however, rather too detailed for elected political representatives to adopt positions on."
"Detailed issues relating to periods of darkness, foot pad lesions and first-week mortality in connection with chickens kept for meat production are difficult for a layperson to decide about."
"We should have welcomed being able, instead, to take decisions on general principles, with experts subsequently designing the more precise regulations."
"What we have here is a consultation procedure for the European Parliament and not a codecision procedure, which might have enabled us to make a more principled statement on the matter."
"We also wish to emphasise how important it is to make further progress in negotiations within the World Trade Organisation in order to achieve an across-the board consensus in favour of more stringent production requirements where food safety and animal protection are concerned."
"I supported amendments, tabled by my own Group and others, which would have strengthened the proposal, in particular those which sought lower stocking densities, and highlighted the food safety implications of poor welfare conditions."
"Although most of the stronger amendments failed, I voted for the report in the hope that the Commission proposal will lead to some progress in addressing significant welfare problems in the chicken meat sector."
". I welcome this report and believe it is very timely due to the recently adopted results of the first ever Action Plan on Animal Protection."
"The report shows that once again the EU is taking a leading role in actively improving animal welfare standards."
"The proposal addresses a difficult issue of public concern as the current welfare standards for chickens kept for meat production are very low, leading to painful leg disorders and lameness, ascites (enlargement of the heart), sudden death syndrome and ammonium burns."
"I welcome the Agriculture Committee's proposals but I believe the proposals did not go far enough."
"It is for this reason that I supported the Jørgensen amendments and I am disappointed that they were not adopted by Parliament."
". Is improving the welfare of chickens really a topic worthy of parliamentary debate?"
"Does it have a European dimension that justifies devoting 50 minutes of debate to poultry intended for meat production?"
"These are two questions that begin to answer themselves!"
"True, this is not the first time that the European Parliament has expressed its opinion on subjects unrelated to the concerns of the citizens."
"Even so, I do not think there is any benefit for the European Parliament in adopting the slogan 'a meddling Europe'; on the contrary, I am convinced that there is every benefit in calling a halt to the regulatory frenzy."
"This is particularly true in cases, like Mr Berman's report, when the pernickety rules proposed are utterly absurd: battery-reared chickens will have two health inspections a day, access to dry litter, and an ambient temperature no more than three degrees higher than that experienced by their alter egos living in the great outdoors!"
"Those are just a few examples among many equally grotesque proposals."
"In conclusion, Europe has nothing to gain from this kind of legislation."
"In fact, it runs the risk of getting its feathers torn out!"
"I voted in favour of this very weak report because, in spite of everything, it entails improvements in most countries and is concerned with minimal legislation, which means that we are allowed to have more stringent rules."
"Our amendments concerning reduced stocking density were extremely sensible compromises which received almost unanimous support in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"It is tragic that these were not adopted."
"Parliament is supporting short-term interests instead of humane animal husbandry that consumers can rely on, and by acting in this way it is not doing the industry any favours."
"I voted in favour of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s proposal for a stocking density not exceeding 34 kg by 2013 for the sole reason that it is better than the original proposal."
"With quite a few of the countries represented on the Council wishing to exceed 38 kg, it will be possible to invoke this proposal against the Council."
"The European Parliament does, in any case, indicate a different direction that might be taken."
"Chickens will continue to suffer more than any other animals."
"How we treat our animals says a lot about how developed our civilisation is."
"On this matter, we are shown to be barbarians."
". Mr President, this report on the welfare of broiler chickens is long overdue."
"It is time the EU took action to improve the wellbeing of broiler hens across the EU, many of which live in apalling circumstances during their short lives."
"It is unfortunate that a number of my group's amendments to this report did not pass, though the report itself goes some way to raising standards and I was glad to support it."
"It is well known that State aid is an important economic policy instrument that helps to revitalise economic, social, environmental and regional development. The principle objective is to enable countries to take action to implement their strategic policies, to guarantee funding for public services and to compensate undertakings that promote so-called ‘services of general interest’."
"With this report, which has a decidedly neoliberal slant, the majority in Parliament is seeking to restrict State aid to a ‘last resort’, on the basis of an ideologically biased drive to reduce the role of State intervention in the economy, in the name of the holy cow of the benevolent ‘market economy’, and to prevent so-called ‘unfair competition’."
"This is why we voted against."
"The rapporteur supports the Commission’s proposals for reform, which are aimed at giving greater prominence to competition over State aid, at providing incentives for reducing State aid and at restricting it to horizontal policies related to the Lisbon Strategy, such as issues concerning innovation and research and development."
". For decades, State aid has been authorised or forbidden by the Commission purely according to the needs of the god of competition."
"Although it is regrettable that it has taken until 2006 to consider taking account of common-sense criteria such as employment, innovation, growth, economic and social cohesion and so on, we must not reject this reorientation of the policy, because we cannot prevent its existence."
"However, I am concerned about the fate reserved for services of general interest, in particular about the fact that they are not really protected from Brussels' ability to make a nuisance of itself."
"The consequences of the liberalisation of network activities (postal services, rail transport, electricity and such like), which privatises the profits and nationalises the losses, should be a lesson to those who call on the Commission to legislate in this field."
"I am also worried about the way in which respect for competition is given priority over all other criteria, which is characteristic of a policy that continues to favour its dogmas over the interests of Europeans."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise that many activities, even emerging ones, would not need subsidies or aid if they had the benefit of a favourable, international fiscal and regulatory environment – an environment that Brussels' policies are largely helping to destroy."
"Any analysis of State aid must be based on a clear idea of differences between income and costs relating, on the one hand, to private finances and, on the other, to public finances, that is to say an idea of the existence of external effects."
"This report bypasses fundamental analysis and thus ends up with general conclusions that cannot be substantiated."
"What is more, there are no serious attempts in the debate to assess external effects."
"In spite of this, we have voted in favour of the report because, in general, it counsels against State aid."
"Experience in general shows that State aid is too widely used for protectionist reasons."
". The purpose of this report on reducing the overall level of State aid granted by the Member States is to channel the granting of aid towards the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The rules governing state aid established by the EU and the attitude of the Member States need to undergo radical change if we are to meet this challenge."
"The Commission’s rules on regional aid are also being amended in line with the ‘less and better targeted state aid’ principle."
"From my point of view, as a rapporteur, I wish to express my broad support for this EU initiative."
"I was pleased to note that the Commission has incorporated into the reform of the new guidelines on national regional aid that the outermost regions will continue to be given least favoured region status, irrespective of their GNI. As such, they may be compatible with the common market of aid earmarked for promoting the economic development of regions in which the standard of living is unusually low, and may also continue to enjoy operating aid."
". State aid is presented as a means of rectifying market shortcomings, yet, as the rapporteur rightly points out, often leads to injustice and inefficiency."
"Accordingly, we share the Commission’s concern in this area, in line with the rapporteur’s position."
"It would be both unrealistic and wrong to seek to put an immediate end to all State aid."
"Yet the fact that this aid has been dwindling in recent years – and this has been very much according to the will of the EU – is a positive sign for those who believe that an economy that fully respects the rules on the smooth running of the market is one that offers the greatest benefits for consumers, producers and workers."
"In other words, State aid is a model that ought gradually to be replaced by fairer and more efficient ways of fostering a genuine market."
"The Swedish Conservatives have today voted in favour of the report on the effects of globalisation on the internal market."
"We agree with the assumption underlying the report that, as a result of globalisation, economic reforms will be required in order to maintain European competitiveness."
"We are not, however, in favour of setting up a globalisation fund, because the consequences of globalisation are best dealt with by means of a dynamic market economy."
". To err is human; to persist, diabolical."
"That could apply to any of the many reports that Parliament dedicates to globalisation and its impact, bemoaning its negative effects but offering no definitive solution except giving Brussels, and Europe, more powers."
"It has never questioned globalisation itself, or the way in which it has been imposed on us by Brussels."
"That, though, is the real problem."
"The European Union is sacrificing our jobs, our industries, our agriculture and our social protection systems on the altar of global free trade and the dogma of international competition; it does not protect our economies from unfair competition or social or monetary dumping, or from piracy and counterfeiting; it does not support our businesses when they are faced with multiple tariff and non-tariff barriers in the competing countries where they want to trade, or when they are faced with increased competition at home, because our economies are some of the most open in the world; it piles on the disabling standards and regulations."
"The inescapable conclusion: Europe is the fall guy in the farce of globalisation, and the citizens of Europe are its main victims."
"It is time for their interests to take precedence over the utopian pursuit of ultraliberal dogmas."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Herczog on her important report on the effects of globalisation on the internal market, which has my full backing. I especially welcome the reference to the need to create a healthy and supportive environment for small and medium-sized enterprises, and to strengthen their position and access to innovation and financing tools."
"I also feel that the creation of an internal market in services is essential in order to increase the EU’s competitiveness."
". I welcome this timely report on the challenges posed by globalisation to the internal market of the European Union."
"This is an issue whose importance was emphasised on 27 October 2005 by the Heads of State and Government of the European Union at the UK Presidency's informal summit at Hampton Court."
"As a member of the International Trade Committee I have been pressing for social and environmental concerns to be taken into account in an era of globalisation and against the background of the rise of China, India and Brazil."
"This is not simple protectionism: my concerns arise from the need to ensure that liberalisation of the world economy, particularly through the multilateral trading system, should not lead to a lowering of employment and social standards or a race to the bottom."
"Whilst I therefore supported amendments to increase preferential access to the EU market for those third countries which have ratified and appropriately applied core international labour and environmental standards as an added incentive, I believe that the Commission should work more closely with the ILO to investigate and inform itself of the observance and enforcement of these core standards in practice, so as to safeguard against future abuses of the new GSP+ system."
". Globalisation offers fresh opportunities in terms of access to the world’s markets, and yet many European citizens take a dim view of it, given the far-reaching effects on the European textiles industry of the restructuring and relocations currently taking place."
"The EU must meet these challenges head on, without abandoning its historical and social values, which are reflected in the core characteristics of existing social protection systems."
"At the same time, the EU must offer incentives to increase the competitiveness of European industry by developing a whole range of instruments, as referred to in the Lisbon Strategy."
"With 1% or 2% increases, there is no room for manoeuvre. Consequently, in order to complete the internal market, reforms of the economic side, especially those aspects relating to the market liberalisation, are all the more pressing."
"Lastly, in terms of external policy, the EU must impress upon the future major world powers, such as China, India and Brazil, that the various development processes must take place on the basis of a balance between social and economic policy."
". This report was an opportunity to take a view of what sort of impact globalisation has had on the internal market, but sadly this report has missed that opportunity."
"My group was therefore unable to support it."
"Mr President, the EU may well have made a great thing of respect for human rights and democracy – indeed, admission to the European Union is dependent upon them – but it has certainly failed in that respect where Turkey is concerned."
"Not only is that country nowhere near finally acknowledging that the Armenian genocide actually happened, but it also threatens punitive sanctions against those journalists who voice any sort of criticism of it, and it also has to be said that there have been markedly retrograde developments on the freedom of opinion and of the press front since negotiations began."
"The fact that, in 2004, 11% of applications for asylum by Turks were accepted, and that Turkey, in 2005, was the member state of the Council of Europe most frequently condemned by the European Court for Human Rights have to be seen in this light."
"It follows that its record on observance of human rights cannot be a particularly good one."
"Over and above that, the recent murder of a Catholic priest in Turkey – a crime motivated by politics and religion – shows that Turkey is either unable or unwilling to protect the minorities within it."
"It will take more than the EUR 500 million pre-accession aid paid out this year to make Turkey top of the class on human rights."
"The report discusses the issue of the human rights clause included in agreements concluded by the European Union."
"An example of such an agreement is the Cotonou Agreement, which the EU concluded with the countries in the ACP community."
"The clause has existed for ten years, which is why the rapporteur now thinks it appropriate to evaluate it."
"In the present situation, the European Parliament is not allowed to open talks if it believes that a country has breached the clause."
"Among the proposals put forward by Mr Agnoletto is one to the effect that Parliament should be given the opportunity to begin talks of this type."
"What is more, the rapporteur also wishes to see the European Parliament allowed to participate in the whole procedure where the clause is concerned."
"It may be seen from the above that there is a desire to give Parliament increased powers, something to which we are opposed in principle."
"We have therefore voted against the Agnoletto report in today’s vote."
"Demanding that our economic and political partners respect human rights is an excellent sentiment, but the European institutions need to start by putting their own house in order, particularly given that Turkey is their next-door neighbour."
"The discrimination suffered by the Christian minority, the suppression of information on the Armenian genocide, the occupation by the Turkish army of a third of the island of Cyprus – none of these flagrant violations of the law have prevented European leaders, notably Messrs Chirac and Villepin in France, from opening Europe's doors to this Asiatic country."
"Is the prospect of accession encouraging the Turkish authorities to share the values of our civilisation?"
"We doubt it."
"The rise to power of the Islamist party, the AKP, in 2002 is threatening, in particular, the few rights previously granted to women."
"Two facts illustrate this phenomenon: the violence used to suppress a peaceful demonstration by women last year, and the return of polygamy."
"At a time when, even in our countries, Islamist organisations are challenging the freedom of the press, the European Union, in welcoming Turkey, would be reneging on the values on which it claims to base its foreign policy."
"After the partnership agreement between the ACP countries and the European Union, which was signed in Cotonou and amended in Luxembourg, the issue of having a human rights and democracy clause in EU agreements seemed to have been resolved."
"Indeed, accepting the principle of protecting human rights was a great step forwards."
"However, there still seem to be some gaps in the implementation of this principle."
"It is not a simple issue. It is complicated by the fact that, if we wanted to suspend a signed agreement because of violation of the human rights clause, we would have to avoid hurting the population of the offending country."
"Alongside the human rights clauses, there are also analogous requirements regarding compliance with basic democratic standards and respect for minority rights."
"I can mention the particular case of the negotiations with Croatia, during which I have never had the feeling that the European Union has been at all interested in or has protected the rights of the Italian minority or those of the Giulian-Dalmatian exiles, and it has even justified its attitude by saying that those are bilateral issues."
"I must point out to the Commission, however, that protection for minority rights must be assured by more than just bilateral relations."
"It is a fundamental right, especially as we are not dealing with a trade agreement here but an actual accession treaty."
"This problem has not been solved even by this report."
". The interest and concern displayed by the rapporteur on the human rights and democracy clause in European Union agreements are worthy of commendation."
"Ten years after it was first drafted, the time has now come to evaluate how it has been implemented and how it can be improved, and there is one aspect, to my mind, that our evaluation should make clear: the impact of this provision needs to be assessed."
"I welcome the fact that the EU includes this clause and deems it one of the guiding principles of external and cooperation policy."
"That being said, if this simply becomes a mantra repeated in all our agreements, and fails to make a genuine difference, especially when its terms are violated, it will of course be worthless."
"The idle repetition of good intentions is a cause of mistakes and failures in international policy."
". The rapid liberalisation of world trade, characterised by lax rules on work and the environment, poses a considerable challenge for the competitiveness of the European economy."
"The EU cannot, and must not, compete with economies which are based on export subsidies, which fail to comply with basic environmental and social rules, and which violate human rights."
"European integration is based on solidarity, respect for human rights, compliance with environmental and social rules, and sustainable development."
"The values of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms lie at the heart of the European project."
"The EU has succeeded in incorporating a ‘human rights and democracy clause’ in international agreements with third countries."
"I am deeply disappointed, however, that a clause as fundamental as this one remains absent from the agreements on textiles."
"China is known to have systematically flouted the rules of the game since it joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001."
"In this particular case, the EU would be well within its rights to impose minimum social and environmental rules in its forthcoming agreements with this partner."
"If there is to be competition, it must be on a level playing field."
"The report before us does not raise any objection to the Commission’s proposal. Rather, it accepts and supports all of the ideas put forward."
"The move to maintain the Shetland Box and the Plaice Box is a timely and balanced response to the review of the functioning and effectiveness of these boxes and to the consultation carried out into this area."
"The recommendations in this report will make it possible to defend the fundamental principles of the new common fisheries policy, namely to manage the exploitation of marine living resources in a sustainable manner whilst guaranteeing sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions."
"I therefore support the adoption of this report."
"The June List is opposed to the EU’s common fisheries policy and wishes to see this policy area phased out in the long run."
"We thus believe that the EU should not decide about whether the Shetland Box and the Plaice Box should be retained."
"This issue can better be resolved by existing international bodies."
". I voted in favour of this report, which had been substantially strengthened at committee stage through the adoption of all nine amendments I had tabled."
"The overwhelming decision of the European Parliament to support an area of protected waters around the north of Scotland is very welcome indeed."
"MEPs from around Europe have recognised the importance of these waters to Scotland's northern communities."
"The Commission must now recognise that the principle of unrestricted access to waters is unsustainable."
"Fishing rights must be allocated to the communities who depend on them."
"That is now the political will of the European Parliament and no amount of lobbying by those who demand equal access to waters and resources should be allowed to undermine that."
"Parliament's vote is a rare example of good news coming from Europe for Scotland's fishermen and I call upon the Council of Ministers, who will make the final decision, to follow our lead."
". I welcome the report on the Shetland and Plaice Boxes."
"I am delighted that the Commission decided to retain the Shetland Box and the Plaice Box and I welcome the fact that Parliament has backed this proposal; the three-year extension is good for conservation and good for Scottish fishing interests."
". Mr President, I personally welcome our rapporteur on this important issue back to Strasbourg."
"I was pleased to support the report, as the measures in it are important in ameliorating the disastrous effects of the common fisheries policy."
"The CFP should be swept away; it has been a disaster for fishing communities, the fishing industry and indeed the fish themselves."
"It does Europe no favours, as it clearly diminishes the EU in the eyes of our citizens to have such an unworkable policy."
". One of the greatest challenges facing the countries of Europe is their energy policy and their ability to use renewable energy to reduce their dependence on petroleum and gas supplies and on the fluctuating price of these resources."
"These renewable energy sources should take on a dominant role in the field of heating and cooling, which currently represents almost 70% of energy consumption in Europe."
"We therefore support measures that could encourage the use of renewable energy: informing users, removing administrative barriers, providing implementation aid, encouraging research and so on."
"However, we will be particularly vigilant in ensuring that the sovereignty of the Member States is respected with regard to energy supply, and on the taxation aspects of any proposals put forward."
"We have not yet seen all the consequences of the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets on national energy balances."
"And there is no question of giving the Commission, through fiscal proposals, additional powers over energy policy that it was not given by the treaties, but that it has already been able to appropriate by indirect means."
". Mr President, this important report highlights an important potential for Europe."
"My own country, Scotland, is potentially a world leader in renewable energy advantages, but because of domestic inaction we have not yet capitalised on this."
"This report shows how the EU can help encourage growth in this vital future technology and I am pleased to support it, even though a few of the key recommendations were not passed by the house."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0409/2005) by Evelyne Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on services in the internal market (COM(2004)0002 C5-0069/2004 2004/0001(COD))"
"Parliament is fully aware of the importance of this debate."
". Mr President, Mr Bartenstein, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, today, we come to the final round of what is – next to the Constitution for Europe – the European Union’s most important legislative project, and we have made no haste about getting here."
"I could quite easily describe the efforts of the last few months, and the mountains of paper we have had to surmount, but the only thing is that it would take me hours to do so."
"I will therefore limit myself to a few basic observations, which will not be to everyone’s liking, but I have to say, Mr President, that they matter to me."
"Services must be as freely mobile in Europa as goods and money, and so the Commission’s production – after a long wait – of the draft services directive is an event to be welcomed."
"It is however, regrettable that the impression has been given that this draft is intended to set the interest of the 15 ‘old’ Member States against those of the ten ‘new’ ones that joined us in May 2004."
"The reason for my putting ‘old’ and ‘new’ in quotation marks is that all members of our community of states have the same rights and responsibilities irrespective of the length of time that they have belonged to it."
"The European Union exists to promote the well-being of its 470 million citizens on a basis of equality; it does not exist to serve shareholder value or the interests of sabre-toothed liberalisers and their market mechanisms."
"I see it as being of the utmost importance that what we do politically and in legislation should put people first and foremost."
"Our primary concern must be with workers and their families rather than with big business and its markets, and we must also spare a thought for small businesses and artisans, who must not be allowed to be trampled underfoot."
"It was for these reasons that this House needed to give the Commission’s draft a thorough makeover, and we have made considerable progress despite the ideological dividing lines between us."
"I am confident that the plenary vote will see us being able to take the final, crucial steps."
"The end product must be a directive unencumbered by massive bureaucracy, one that benefits the workers on whom Europe’s ability to compete depends."
"Such a directive must respect the idiosyncrasies of the Member States and obviate the danger of a downward spiral in working conditions and wages, in quality, and in the protection of consumers and the environment."
"First of all, then, we must abandon the country-of-origin principle with all its devastating effects."
"I have proposed a simple solution, according to which a business legally providing services in any one Member State would be allowed to offer those services in any other Member State as well, provided, that is, that the rules and laws of the country of destination would apply to the performance of the contract."
"The simplicity of this reflects our experience of real life; for example, a German driving licence entitles me to drive in England, but I am not allowed to drive on the right there."
"It is thus that the free movement of services is provided for and fair competition ensured."
"My second proposal was that this freedom of movement be accorded only to marketable commercial services, with all other excluded from the scope of the directive."
"In no way, for example, should Europe be obliged to accord freedom of movement to the modern version of slavery engaged in by temporary employment agencies."
"We also have to ensure that services of general interest – in the broad sense of the term – are not affected, by protecting municipal self-government and the desire of citizens to manage their own affairs in everything from the water supply to nursery schools."
"Parliament will be able to adopt the services directive subject to the necessary adjustments being made to the Commission’s original draft."
"We have worked through the original draft in detail and turned it inside out; in so doing, we have frustrated the creation of a job-creation scheme for lawyers that would have been beyond the financial reach of small businesses."
"As I see it, this complicated piece of legislation could still do with being made a bit clearer and simpler, but something else that is called for by such a complex enterprise is the strength to make compromises."
"I have gained the impression that the Commission values this House’s constructive work and is not indissolubly attached to the old version that has caused such outrage in the Member States."
"The combined voices of trade unions, artisans’ associations, municipalities and all the other interested parties have had a powerful and visible effect."
"We have now come to a tricky corner."
"We can enact the sort of law that is imposed on us neither by the Commission nor the Council."
"If we do, we will have given services in the European Union the freedom of movement that they need, and, at the same time, this would represent a major step towards a social Europe; the rights of workers would be secured, and quality and the environment protected."
"With such a result under our belt, this House could take pride in having served the interests of the 470 million people in our Community."
"With that in mind, I would like, again, to thank all my fellow Members in every group for their very constructive cooperation."
"I do believe that we will, in the final discussions that still await us this afternoon, tonight and tomorrow, find the right solutions, which really will enable us to put together a large majority in this House, one that will force both the Commission and the Council to go down the road that we in Parliament have now mapped out."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner McCreevy, Mrs Gebhardt, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs Gebhardt has just said, it was in February 2004 that the Commission put forward a proposal for a directive on services in the European single market, the idea being that implementation of it would bring us a bit closer to the Lisbon objectives."
"In November 2004, the report of the high level group of experts chaired by Wim Kok – which, I might add, was appointed by the Commission to prepare for the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy – called for the creation of a European market in services, which it saw as presenting the greatest opportunity for more growth in Europe."
"From an economic point of view, a growth spurt is just what Europe needs, and we know that – growth, and the employment that results from it, are top priorities for all of us."
"In its first ten years of existence, the European internal market has chalked up some considerable successes, not least the creation of 2.5 million new jobs."
"It is precisely for that reason that all its remaining loose ends need to be tied up, but the legal and administrative hurdles that the Commission has put in the way of service providers have demonstrated to us how fragmented the European services markets are in reality, resulting in needlessly high prices, consumers losing out as a result of insufficient competition, and missed opportunities for increased growth and job creation."
"The proposal to which I have already referred was brought in by the former Prodi Commission, the Commissioner responsible for it being Frits Bolkestein, and it has, since February 2004, been the subject of in-depth discussion in the relevant working party of the Council."
"In the context of public debate, it has come in for a great deal of criticism, some of which has been justified."
"There are those also who have used it – without any justification – as the occasion to spread anxiety."
"It has to be said that the directive is quite clear about what it is intended to do, and there is widespread support for the principle behind it, that being the further freeing-up of service provision and the systematic removal of unjustified barriers to service providers."
"Now is the time for the Commission to revise the means by which that is to be achieved, and the vote in your House will be essential as a basis for this."
"The intention is that the completion of the internal market in services should bring benefits and advantages to Europe’s citizens, consumers and businesses, while leaving no way open whereby the European social model might be undermined or jeopardised."
"The people of Europe have every right to an internal market in services free from the risk of wage dumping or social dumping."
"If they are to get one, the services directive will have to be neutral in terms of labour law; there will also have to be clear and unambiguous rules to ensure that the directive on the posting of workers is not compromised, not least as regards the options for monitoring."
"It must also be made clear beyond any doubt whatever that this services directive does nothing to compromise services of general interest in terms of their quality, the universal provision of them, or their affordability. Mrs Gebhardt has already referred to the need for this."
"From within the Presidency of the Council, all eyes are now fixed on your House, as the Presidency, and the Council as a whole, look forward to the outcome of the first reading with great interest, and, if as large a majority as possible were to be achieved, that would be particularly helpful in terms of the draft’s further progress within the Council."
"With that in mind, we also welcome the initiatives and efforts of the two big groups in your House to achieve broad consensus by means of a good compromise, especially on controversial points, in which respect they have evidently been successful."
"Once your House’s plenary has voted, which it will do the day after tomorrow, that is on 16 February, it will be for the Commission to take an active role in the codecision procedure."
"The Presidency will – in close cooperation with your House, but of course also with the Commission – be pressing for an even-handed directive, one that will to a large degree take into account the misgivings that have been voiced about the present proposal while also creating the legal basis for a functioning internal market in services that will make the best possible use of our potential for growth and job creation."
"We have now been informed that, according to two studies – one from Copenhagen and the other from Vienna – the possibility exists of the services directive resulting in the creation of some 600 000 jobs."
"The Presidency also welcomes Mr Barroso’s announcement in Vienna to the effect that the plenary vote would very soon, and in good time for the March European Council, be followed by a proposal as to the points essential to a political agreement."
"The Austrian Presidency will then discuss these in depth and take them further – and I stress that it will do this with the full involvement of the social partners."
"We have the opportunity to maximise our potential for growth and job creation by means of an internal market in services, while at the same time building up public confidence in a social Europe."
"That must be a goal for us all."
". Mr President, Mr Bartenstein, Mrs Gebhardt, ladies and gentlemen, this week is a crucial stage for the services directive, for the completion of the internal market and for our strategy for growth and jobs in Europe."
"I am therefore delighted to see that the European Parliament is prepared to express an opinion on this proposal and to accept its responsibilities to the citizens of Europe."
"I would especially like to thank Mrs Gebhardt and all the Members most directly involved, particularly the shadow rapporteurs, who, over the past few months, have done some admirable work to enable us to reach the stage we are at today."
"Today's debate and the vote to be held on Thursday represent an important moment for the future of the European Union, and this, may I say, even goes beyond the very important matter of services in the internal market."
"There is no doubt that we still have much to do if our economies are to be able to make the basic freedoms laid down in the Treaty a reality and to benefit from them."
"In a moment, Commissioner McCreevy will remind you of the progress made on this matter."
"Before that, however, I would like to stress a very important aspect that goes far beyond the purely economic dimension: is the enlarged European Union of 25 Member States capable of reaching agreement on appropriate solutions to deal with extremely difficult and sensitive problems?"
"Let me be quite clear: I am convinced - and the Commission shares this view - that it is desirable to achieve strong consensus within Parliament in favour of this directive, a strong consensus that, we hope, will enable us to reach agreement in the Council and to create the conditions for convergence between our three institutions."
"I am confident that, this week, Parliament will be able to give shape to the acute sense of responsibility that it has demonstrated throughout this process."
"As you know - and we must be frank in this matter - this directive, which was presented in January 2004 by the Commission of my predecessor, Mr Prodi, gave rise to some serious concerns in some parts of our Member States and, in general, within European public opinion."
"Even though they were based on legitimate fears relating to the protection of the social acquis, some of these criticisms were based on real misunderstandings."
"However, in some cases these criticisms also fed polemics entirely unrelated to the directive itself."
"I, and the Commission over which I preside, have always made it absolutely clear that we do indeed want a real internal market in services."
"We want a market that works and that brings added value to our economy."
"We now want to translate into reality the principles of the four freedoms bequeathed to us by the founding fathers of Europe."
"We also want to respond to the legitimate concerns that have been raised."
"The result will therefore be, if you please, ladies and gentlemen, the fruit of a compromise."
"By definition, we need a compromise – a compromise that honours and respects the principles of the Treaty and forms part of our programme for growth and jobs."
"In this regard, the Commission is prepared to support, and to include in its revised proposal, all the elements constituting a step forward on the path to creating a true internal market in services that are supported by a large majority within this Parliament."
"Following almost two years of debate, it is now high time to leave the divisions behind us, to build bridges and to create the conditions for an agreement."
"It is time to prove to our citizens that the Union of 25 Member States does work, that it is conscious of its common destiny, and that it is able to achieve results in everybody's interests."
"We now need to understand what is realistic and feasible at this stage."
"Following a difficult year in 2005, we are now on the way to restoring trust in the European Union."
"We must work on pragmatic solutions to respond to the real problems of our citizens."
"If the first reading in plenary on the services directive leads, on Thursday, to a vote that balances the demands of competition against our social concerns, it will be a victory not only for you, ladies and gentlemen, in the European Parliament, but also for the Union as a whole."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you need have no doubts about our ambitions for Europe."
"On that subject, let us be quite clear on the economic question."
"Is it acceptable that we have 20 million unemployed within the European Union?"
"Do we need any stronger arguments to justify our initiative?"
"Is that not one of the main reasons for the lack of confidence in the EU?"
"Today, the two main sectors that can create jobs in Europe are services and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We must therefore give priority to those sectors, by creating a true market in services and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It is they that have the most to gain from this directive."
"Even though this is just the first step, I really do not think that there is any strategy more social than one that creates high-quality jobs."
"Before I pass the floor to Mr McCreevy, I would like, with your permission, Mr President, to wish you all a fruitful, constructive and positive debate."
"Let us work together to produce a services directive that will translate our ambitions for Europe into reality in a balanced way: an enlarged Europe, a more modern and more competitive Europe, a Europe founded on the four basic freedoms bequeathed to us by our founding fathers."
". Mr President, since its birth two years ago, this proposal has been in the headlines."
"Both its supporters and its opponents see it as a symbol."
"During all the controversy about this proposal, which focused on a relatively small number of issues, it was easy to forget that there are many other areas in which, I believe, broad agreement exists and in which the benefits of the proposal are recognised."
"Firstly, thanks to administrative simplification, it will be easier to establish a business in the EU."
"This is crucial for fostering entrepreneurship, a vital element in promoting growth and jobs."
"Service providers will be able to obtain information and to complete administrative formalities through single points of contact in any Member State, thus simplifying, accelerating and reducing the cost of the authorisation process and obviating the need to deal with different levels of authorities."
"It will also be possible to fulfil these procedures electronically, so that businesses save time and avoid incurring considerable costs in having to make visits in person – sometimes several times – in order to complete the necessary formalities with the relevant authorities."
"Secondly, it will be good for consumers."
"Improving consumer confidence is a key component in boosting the possibilities that the internal market offers them."
"They will benefit as key information about businesses and the service they are providing will be made easily available."
"This will enable them to make informed choices when they are purchasing services."
"Rights of consumers are clearly set out, and any discrimination on the basis of nationality or place of business must be removed."
"Thirdly, Member States will have to implement administrative cooperation to ensure that businesses are properly and efficiently supervised across the EU, while avoiding duplication of control."
"This legal obligation will be underpinned at a practical level by an electronic system enabling authorities to exchange information directly and efficiently."
"These, amongst many others in the draft directive, are provisions which will bring forward significant benefits, both for businesses and consumers – I know that you have never lost sight of this."
"In assessing the amendments adopted in the lead committee’s opinion, and the further amendments tabled since, the Commission is taking a highly constructive and positive position."
"In particular, we intend to take on board and incorporate in our revised proposal those amendments that we believe to be supported by a broad majority in this House."
"The Commission broadly welcomes amendments put forward by the European Parliament which aim to clarify and improve the Commission’s initial proposal."
"These relate mainly to administrative simplification, establishment and administrative cooperation."
"The Commission also broadly welcomes many of the amendments adopted by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection in relation to services of general interest."
"This is a sensitive question that has split opinions during the entire debate and it is clear, in my view, that the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection vote has achieved a great deal in this respect."
"On the other hand, I believe that services of general economic interest should stay within the scope of the proposal."
"Any further exclusions of sectors from the scope of the proposal should be extremely limited."
"The compromise texts I have seen give us a good basis for producing our amended proposal if they are adopted."
"But we need to be clear about how we will deal with possible deletions from the proposal."
"If Parliament votes to delete Articles 24 and 25 of the proposal concerning the posting of workers, then the Commission will produce guidance to address any undue administrative burdens which may hinder the opportunities for enterprises to avail of the Posted Workers Directive."
"This can be done relatively quickly."
"There is well-established Court jurisprudence which needs to be complied with."
"Equally, if health services are excluded from the scope of the directive, this does not take away from the necessity to address the increasing jurisprudence of the Court of Justice with regard to patient mobility."
"A separate proposal from the Commission addressing this issue will therefore be necessary."
"The compromise texts also recognise the freedom that service providers should have to access markets in other Member States and to exercise their activities there."
"I welcome the fact that they recognise that a whole range of barriers to the provision of these services will have to be abolished while, of course, permitting certain restrictions on well-defined public policy grounds."
"It is important to underline that any amendments we accept must meet the objective that this directive should represent a step towards the creation of an internal market for services."
"As Guardian of the Treaties, we also need to carry out our responsibility to ensure that what emerges is compatible with the fundamental freedoms as set out there and in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice."
"In addition, any restrictions that Member States may apply to service providers from other Member States have to be judged against the criteria of non-discrimination, necessity and proportionality."
"This must be borne in mind, particularly when we look at whatever modifications are voted to Article 16 and the freedom to provide services."
"I am sure most Members will agree that this is the only way we can ensure that the real added value of this proposal is maintained."
"It will facilitate the cross-border provision of services and, at the same time, ensure that legitimate public policy considerations can be safeguarded."
"That is the balance we are all working for."
"It seems to me to be the essence of the compromise amendments on Article 16."
"I confirm that, following the vote on Thursday, the Commission will bring forward a revised proposal with a view to facilitating a common position as soon as possible – hopefully, before the end of April."
"Where there is broad consensus in this House on the amendments to be made, the Commission will, subject to what I said earlier, base its modified proposals on these amendments."
"In the meantime, I look forward to today’s debate and, ultimately, the outcome of Thursday’s vote."
"Parliament has a real opportunity to show that, after two years’ work, it can provide the basis for taking forward in a consensual way an important but hugely controversial proposal."
"It is a challenge I believe most MEPs want to rise to."
"I urge you to continue to work for the consensus which I believe is within your grasp."
"You can deliver a better services directive which unleashes the enormous economic potential of the services sector."
"This is the basis on which we will be judged by the European businesses, workers, consumers and unemployed people that stand to benefit from it."
"I would like to inform the House that an enormous demonstration is currently taking place outside this building."
"The Strasbourg police estimate that some 30 000 people have gathered between the Parc des Expositions and the Place de la République."
"I would like to point out that it is a peaceful demonstration."
"I am told that it is taking place in a very good spirit with live music and a whole series of attractions."
"There has been free access to Parliament until three in the afternoon."
"I am sure that this massive presence of European citizens at the doors of our Parliament will provide us with an enormous stimulus to carry out our work responsibly."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group welcomes the demonstration, for what it shows is that Europe’s people are at last waking up to the fact that this House is powerful."
"I have to say, though, that I have my doubts about whether the demonstrators’ concerns are justified by the facts, for they are demonstrating against something that is no longer even under consideration, but it is in essence a good sign that the demonstration is happening."
"The March 2000 European Council in Lisbon sought to make the European Union better able to compete."
"It took note of the fact that the services sector was one of the most important in terms of our economy, yet Europe was making no use whatever of its potential."
"The freedom to provide services has been, since 1958, one of the four freedoms that the Founding Fathers enshrined in the Treaty, yet – in contrast to the movement of goods and capital and personal mobility – it has never been anything other than neglected, and the reason why it has been neglected is that it has been in this area that the Member States have been least willing to fully implement the Treaty, and they have left it to the Court of Justice to make up the rules by way of rulings in individual cases."
"The intention behind the services directive is that all that should be changed. The directive is at the very heart of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It will make European service providers more able to compete; it will help to create jobs in this sector and will give consumers and commercial customers greater freedom of choice."
"It has to be said, though, that the directive is, first of all, the result of a political decision, the decision in favour of the clear implementation of the Treaty."
"That makes it a test case for the Commission and for the Member States; it also shows how serious we in this House are about our affirmations of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The proposal put forward by the Commission was an ambitious one; parts of it were open to question, others missed the mark, and it was the subject of criticism, some of which was justified and much of which was not."
"What became known as the Bolkestein directive became the occasion for expressions of disquiet about the consequences of globalisation, of the enlargement of the EU, about the pressure of increased competition and misgivings about economic realities in general."
"Even here in this House, people had some misguided ideas, which manifested themselves in attempts to block the directive itself or make it easier for the Member States to erect barriers within the internal market."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats came up with some substantial improvements to what the Commission had proposed, and I am most grateful to our rapporteur, Mr Harbour, and to all those in our Group, those in the other groups, and also the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, for all the work that they have put in."
"Our group virtually rewrote the directive, and the document we have before us today is the result of those efforts, in the course of which we showed all the willingness to compromise that was required."
"While we do want broad agreement on this directive, we do not want compromise at any price."
"What we do want is for the business of setting up in more than one Member State and of rendering services across national borders to be substantially improved and made much simpler."
"We do not want the case law of the European Court of Justice to be transposed word for word, along with all its imponderables and the specific circumstances of individual cases."
"What we do want is for businesses and the authorities in the Member States to have more legal certainty; we want the Member States to cooperate more in combating illegal temporary work and bogus self-employment."
"Most of all, though, we want a directive with clear and fair rules that establish once and for all an internal market in services, an internal market in which all service providers, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, and all consumers too, really can participate."
"We want a directive that really does make us better able to compete internationally, that ensures the rapid integration of the new Member States into the internal market, a directive that enable us to make the best possible use of all our potential for growth and job creation while remaining faithful to the principles of the social market economy."
"What we would like to see, at the European Council’s Spring Summit, is a political agreement founded upon the outcome of this House’s vote."
"It must include those points that are backed in that vote by a broad majority."
"Then, before this year is out – perhaps even, Mr President-in-Office, under your presidency in its first half – we will be able to adopt the Lisbon Strategy’s most important legislative component."
"Every day that is lost to us means less competitiveness, less of an internal market, and hence less employment and growth."
"We have to show the people of the European Union that we take their concerns and fears seriously. We also, however, have to give them the leadership that will restore their hope and confidence and give our great European project a future."
"This European Union of ours is our shared project, and as such we must defend it and lead it into the future."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will begin with a word of thanks to our colleague Mrs Gebhardt, who will, I hope, on Thursday see her ordeal, which has lasted weeks, brought at last to a happy conclusion."
"I will also express my gratitude to Mr Harbour, who can no doubt look back on even tougher weeks, to whom I wish an equally successful conclusion."
"Returning to my own group, I also wish to thank Mrs van Lancker, who has made her contribution to our labours under the most difficult of circumstances."
"This directive is the most controversial and contentious draft to come up for debate in recent years, and rightly so, for it has to do with the question of what social model we want in Europe – no more and no less than that – and we will be giving the answer to that question this week."
"What is plain to us European Social Democrats is that every one of the economic and technical advances that we can point to as the successes of the second half of the twentieth century went hand in hand with raised incomes, more social security, more environmental rights, greater protection for consumers."
"That is what we mean when we talk about our social model."
"What Frits Bolkestein was aiming to do was to create growth on the assumption of less income, less social security, fewer environmental standards and less protection for consumers, and it is precisely that that we are putting a stop to today."
"From today, ‘Bolkestein’ is no more."
"That is the first piece of good news to come out of this debate."
"The second point that must be central to our debate is that Europe will not allow itself to be divided."
"In both the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and our own group, it has become clear that the attempt to divide us, inherent in this Bolkestein directive, has been fought off."
"Bolkestein’s philosophy was that those who earn less and have lower standards should be given free access to the market so as to achieve a downward adjustment where wages and standards are high."
"That was an attempt at playing the new Member States off against the old ones, setting Old Europe and New Europe at odds with one another."
"Here in this House, we can show that the attempt to do so has failed."
"In my own Group just as much as in the PPE-DE, delegations from the old and new Member States are working together to solve this problem."
"That is another item of today’s good news."
"There is also a third message about which we should harbour no misconceptions: many have attempted to use this services directive to promote their own interests and fashion the European internal market in the image of their own liberal-purist thinking."
"I am pretty certain that what I have described is what Mr Bolkestein wanted."
"I did get the impression that, for a time, that was what Commissioner McCreevy wanted as well, but, in the light of the real balance of power, of which he will get written evidence on Thursday, he has come to see reason."
"It was thus with a great deal of interest that we heard that you – Mr Barroso and Mr McCreevy – wanted to base your future actions on what comes out of this House’s deliberations, for it is quite clear that a broad majority is forming itself in this House in favour of a new services directive, a services directive founded on the idea that free market access should be guaranteed subject to the condition that services should be subject to the laws of the country in which they are rendered."
"The consequence of that is that the rights in relation to social security, wages, the environment and consumers that have been built up in the Member States will be maintained, that it is on that basis that these services are rendered, and it is precisely that that we have achieved."
"We have, so to speak, turned ‘Bolkestein’ round to face in the right direction, and the attack by those who wanted the opposite has thereby been thwarted."
"If I may spell it out in plain language, that means – and I am speaking for my group when I say this – that those who want to alter the European social model or destroy it will meet with determined resistance from Europe’s Socialists."
"It is a good thing, too, that they are evidently meeting with determined resistance from a substantial section of Europe’s Christian Social movement, and we are glad to see it."
"We hear there the sound of dissent, but I can tell Mr Langen that the PPE-DE’s minorities generally express their views forthrightly."
"That we do know!"
"There is, though, underlying what we are discussing here today and what we will be deciding on Thursday, a message for the institutions;"
"Mr Bartenstein has got the message, and so has Mr Barroso."
"Both of them have grasped – and let me stress that it is a good thing that they have – that, irrespective of what fundamental decisions they try to take, decisions that will determine the future direction of the European Union, there is no getting round the European Parliament."
"Just as the Council failed in its attempt to foist upon us a Commission that we did not want, so, too, it will fail with its ill-advised Financial Perspective."
"The Council has had to take note of the fact that it was Parliament that adopted a proper and balanced chemicals policy."
"It was Parliament that kept the enlargement debate on rational lines and did not allow it to be carried along in a rush, and, on this occasion, it is Parliament that is showing the other two institutions that it is possible to do what my own country’s late President, Johannes Rau, called for in almost every speech, namely to be the protector that the little man must have in a deregulated world."
"The big multinationals can hold their own in global competition, but the ordinary citizens of Europe – workers in ports and factories lorry drivers in their vehicles, those who work for the postal services or on the railways, artisan craftsmen in their workshops and nurses in hospitals – need protection in this struggle for what we call the European social model."
"They do not have shareholder value on their side; they need someone to defend their rights in a deregulated Europe, and that someone is, today, the European Parliament, and it is to be hoped that it will do so by an overwhelming majority on Thursday."
". Mr President, I can assure the House that Frits Bolkestein is alive and kicking, and that is why Martin Schulz is looking so bruised these days!"
"This Parliament must make a choice."
"Down the route of reform lies a dynamic, competitive Union which creates jobs, wealth and opportunity for its citizens."
"Down the path of protectionism lies short-term gain for some, and long-term loss for all, especially our 20 million unemployed."
"70% of Europe’s economy and workforce relies on a healthy service sector, a sector being slowly strangled by a mindless mass of regulation."
"Mrs Gebhardt says ‘think of small businesses’."
"It is because we think of them that we want the country of origin principle."
"90% of service companies are SMEs."
"The country of origin principle allows them to assess, and then to test a foreign market."
"They send people over to do market research."
"Then they trade to test it before setting up an office or a subsidiary."
"Doing away with the country of origin principle reduces the growth effects of this measure by half."
"Liberals and Democrats favour a search for compromise, but compromise between mutually exclusive policies is no compromise."
"We call it the ‘Berlin blockage’."
"This directive does not usher in social dumping."
"If they are in any doubt, Mr Schulz and Mr Rasmussen should read the 1996 directive on the posting of workers."
"It is still in force."
"Rather, the draft before us transforms principles like the free market of goods, services, capital and people into reality for 450 million people."
"These are founding principles of our Union which are simply not compatible with second-class citizenship for our new Member States."
"Certainly there will be hard decisions to take, but our task is not to protect one sector over another."
"It is to legislate for the good of the European economy as a whole."
"If we can create a single market in services to rival our single market in goods, we can raise GDP by nearly 2% and create up to 2.5 million new jobs."
"That is what Frits Bolkestein wanted for Europe."
"To allow Member States to justify barriers to service provision on the basis of social policy and consumer protection would drive a lance through the heart of his proposal."
"However, we would not be contemplating such an emasculation of draft legislation if Mr Barroso and his Commissioners had defended their draft directive instead of tilting at windmills."
"Does Commissioner McCreevy believe that his cabinet’s lobbying of Parliament last week advanced the case for Europe’s single market?"
"Does he not know that paragraph 3 in compromise amendment 293 is contrary to ECJ jurisprudence and the Treaty’s provision on the free movement of services?"
"I hope, Commissioner McCreevy, that you will answer that point in your reply."
"No, rather than showing the way, this Commission cowers in the shadows of public opinion and Member States’ hesitation."
"Greater productivity, more jobs, higher wages, stronger companies: these are all within our grasp and that is why I urge the House to vote to make Europe a dynamic marketplace for jobs and services."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, there are three things I should like to say at the very outset."
"For a start, seldom has any European legislative measure polarised European societies to such a degree, and so I give all the more credit to Mrs Gebhardt, the rapporteur, for having succeeded in taking the edge off the Commission draft."
"I have to say, though – and this brings me to my third point – that this has been done to the detriment of clarity and legal certainty in this framework directive."
"If you want a reason for that, you only have to look at the material she had to work with, for the Commission’s draft is opaque and scarcely comprehensible, the precise opposite of ‘better regulation’."
"That is something that needed to be spelled out."
"It is unfortunate that this House was unable to concentrate on what was fundamental and feasible."
"That we need a European framework directive on services is not a matter of dispute."
"The provision of services across borders brings with it many problems that cannot be solved, as such matters formerly were, through the law courts, but need to be dealt with by those who have authority to enact European legislation, namely Parliament and the Council."
"The threat inherent in what we have before us is that they will end up before the judges again."
"There are alternatives – clear and simple alternatives that do, as is intended, reduce the bureaucracy involved in cross-border service provision."
"Our proposal, which the rapporteur supported for some considerable time, is essentially bipartite, involving, on the one hand, this directive being explicitly limited to commercial services, with due regard being given to existing legislation of relevance to them."
"What are termed services of general interest – and let me say for Commissioner McCreevy’s benefit, that by these I mean services for the benefit of all and in their general economic interest – should be described and dealt with in a separate directive, for they do not belong in this one."
"In place of such a clear demarcation, we have at present a catalogue of individual derogations."
"It still does not include everything: it does not include education; the position of social services is yet to be resolved, as does that of the building of social housing."
"Some services are excluded altogether; others – such as the major services provided by grids or networks – only partially."
"The whole thing adds up to a patchwork of individual rules and regulations, making any overview of the whole difficult and lacking in transparency and legal certainty, and it has been the latter that everyone has had something to say about today."
"It is above all the small and medium-sized businesses that need it, or else they will not invest, and consumers will not buy their products."
"Our proposal also has to do with Article 16, the country-of-origin principle, which is such a bone of contention."
"To this too there could have been a simple and clear alternative, in the shape of the opening-up of market access for services based on the country-of-origin principle for the EU as a whole, but combined with the proviso that the services would have to be provided in accordance with local laws and standards."
"Instead of that, the Great Coalition is currently proposing a regulation that refrains from naming the country-of-origin principle and instead opens up markets by outlawing certain local restrictions, yet this too leads to unresolved issues, with a lack of clarity and certainty about what the law actually is, and leaving the last word to the courts."
"We cannot endorse this draft directive. It does not encourage confidence in Europe’s ability to make its own laws, and by it, this House is undermining itself."
". Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Bartenstein, we could have marked St Valentine's Day by debating a more romantic subject than the Bolkestein directive."
"Things being what they are, though, what comments can the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left make on the latest rehash of such an emblematic draft directive?"
"First of all, we cannot help but notice with pleasure that the exceptional social and political movements against this directive, which have been growing for more than a year, have achieved their first result: we have managed to put the supporters of the directive on the defensive."
"After all, as Mr McCreevy, the Commission's spokesman and Mr Bolkestein's successor, has just emphasised, we have to be realistic – there have been referendums in France and in the Netherlands."
"Or, as John Monks, Secretary-General of the European Trade Union Confederation, said, the success of the 'no' vote 'changed the European landscape [because] everyone subsequently understood that social matters must be at the heart of European policies'."
"That is why we are not turning our noses up at the changes made during the various negotiations on the directive in the Commission."
"However, the question that arises is whether the directive, in its amended form, has become a good directive – whether its essential substance has changed. In short, can workers now, as some claim, be reassured as to the future of their social rights?"
"Unfortunately, our answer to that is 'no', and I think that those who claim otherwise have a heavy responsibility."
"Firstly, they are seriously underestimating the impact of the current Community acquis that this directive, if it is adopted, will fit into."
"On top of the treaties themselves, current jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, to which Commissioner McCreevy has just referred insistently and very significantly, systematically protects businesses that provide services on the basis of the country of origin principle, and consistently criticises the rules of the host country that are accused of hindering the activities of those businesses."
"Faced with this hijacking of sovereignty, I think that we need to organise a proper counter-offensive if we are going to put a brake on the race to the bottom with the social acquis."
"By removing all explicit references to the country of destination principle, though, the compromise reached by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats leaves itself open to the harassment of the Commission and the Court."
"The supporters of this compromise also greatly overestimate, in my view, the effect of the social guarantees they claim to have introduced into the draft directive."
"For example, all a business based in a country with less rigorous social standards will have to do is provide its services throughout the EU using 'self-employed' people, and the host country will lose the right to require it to comply with local rules."
"Another example: it has been said that the provisions on the posting of workers now included in the draft directive make it possible to ensure that employees in other Member States stick to the maximum working time."
"Big deal!"
"I would remind you that the maximum working week is 48 hours in the EU and even 65 hours in some countries."
"These same provisions are also supposed to guarantee respect for the collective agreements."
"In fact, nothing is less certain."
"This is a grey area in Community law, as was recently acknowledged by the spokesman of the Commission's 'Internal Market and Services' Directorate-General."
"In such an uncertain context, we must rule out any ambiguity, any half measure and any room for interpretation given to the Commission and the Court."
"The right message to give them is clear: we must reject the directive in Thursday's vote and, if we do not succeed in that now, it will remain our aim throughout the process."
"In the meantime, my group will, at the very least, work to insert into the directive a specific reference to the precedence of the rules of the country of destination and to limit the scope of the text as much as possible, in particular by excluding all public services."
"From the Atlantic to the Baltic, from Lapland to the Peloponnese, we say yes to equality, yes to solidarity, yes to the promotion of the rights of all, and thus no to the Bolkestein directive."
"In this spirit, I join with you, Mr President, in warmly welcoming to Strasbourg the tens of thousands of employees who have come to defend their rights and a concept of a Europe in which they can once again find their way."
". Mr President, how well I remember the declaration of the Lisbon Agenda in this very Chamber."
"We were going to become the world’s most dynamic and vibrant economy, with full employment."
"Well, here we are, over halfway through, and what do we have? Twenty million unemployed and, in the eurozone, desperately low growth rates and a complete collapse of foreign direct investment."
"We are stumbling around in an economic desert, but rather like the soldiers – the French Foreign Legionnaires in – suddenly we have seen a vision: the services directive."
"It is going to give us a free market, liberal economics and the solution to all our woes."
"Sadly, of course, it is a mirage, because nothing is ever as it seems in the European Union."
"This belief that yet more legislation will improve things is wrong every time."
"When we talked in 1999 about the creation of a single market in financial services, all my friends in the real world in the City of London said: ‘Nigel, you have got it wrong’."
"I am fairly used to people telling me that I have got it wrong."
"But, seven years on, what has happened?"
"We have a financial services action plan, we have the implementation of 42 new directives and the burden on financial services is heavier than it was before."
"Businesses are leaving every day and moving to Switzerland and Bermuda and the same thing will happen with the services directive."
"The application of this directive will vary from country to country."
"The Commission will say that we need more harmonisation measures to make it work."
"The burden on business will increase and, worst of all, it will be the European Court of Justice that can legislate and decide on all this."
"This directive represents yet another massive shift of power from the Member States to these failing institutions."
"They will no longer be able to run their own economies."
"We shall vote ‘no’."
"Mr President, one of the fundamental aims of the founding fathers of the European Economic Community was the creation of an internal market within which there would be free movement of people, goods, capital and services."
"Fifty years have now gone by and this aim has not yet been achieved."
"In the services sector, any activity beyond the national market is still classed as the provision of services abroad, and not within a single entity, namely the European Union."
"The thousands of provisions in place and permits currently required are an obstacle to the development of the whole European services sector."
"I would remind the House that the services sector currently accounts for 70% of the European Union’s GDP."
"The European Court of Justice has repeatedly ruled in favour of the right of service providers to benefit from their freedom as entrepreneurs and from the free movement of the services they provide in other Member States."
"There are many reliable indications that full implementation of the proposed directive will lead to the creation of 600 000 additional jobs across the European Union and will also reduce the existing barriers to the provision of services by more than 50%."
"In addition, there will be a reduction in the cost of the services covered by the directive, which will benefit consumers and firms making use of the services alike."
"European consumers, enterprises and governments will also benefit as a result of increased productivity, higher employment and higher wages."
"This Parliamentary sitting will provide us with the opportunity to show what kind of Europeans we are."
"I am confident that we shall demonstrate courage, responsibility and wisdom."
"I advocate compromise, an approach that has long been adopted by this House."
"I cannot, however, accept a situation in which, despite the difficult compromise achieved and enshrined in the report by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, certain responsible political groups are once again likely to succumb to scare-mongering, blackmail and sham reforms."
"After all, how else could one describe agreeing to further restrictions to the scope of the directive and doing away with the fundamental principle of the country of origin?"
"I also hope that the House will refuse to remove the provisions banning illegal barriers for workers posted abroad to provide services."
"These barriers do not affect citizens of specific countries they actually restrict the freedom and mobility of all Europeans, consumers and entrepreneurs."
"I shall conclude with an appeal to Mr Barroso, the President of the European Commission, and to Commissioner McCreevy to continue their efforts to achieve a genuinely free market and economic development for Europe."
"That is also what the citizens of Europe expect from us."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just as he did on his five-year term of office, just as he did on reduced VAT rates for restaurateurs, Mr Chirac has lied for the third time about the Bolkestein directive."
"It was not withdrawn in March 2005 as he promised, but just went into hibernation during the referendum on the European Constitution."
"It has returned to the European Parliament today, one year on, amended and modified, it is true, but still just as controversial."
"To judge by the large number of amendments tabled – 404 – it certainly cannot be said that the consensus for which the rapporteur for the services directive, Mrs Gebhardt, has worked so hard has been achieved."
"We are told that agreement has been reached between the two main groups in the European Parliament to withdraw the country of origin principle, which was the main stumbling block in the directive."
"There is nothing of the sort, because this compromise was only signed by the representatives of the groups, and was not submitted to the groups themselves."
"That is a strange idea of representative democracy passed on with the complicity of the media."
"We are not impressed by these false rumours, but are continuing to look at the text of the report."
"This report is complicated, unclear, ambiguous, contradictory and, what is more, dangerous."
"Not only do services of general economic interest, in other words public market services, still feature in the report, with a few exceptions, but some of the safeguards have also been removed."
"In the name of simplification, the prior authorisation system has been abolished and replaced by the very bureaucratic system of the European one-stop shop."
"Bolkestein is, in fact, simply the sock-puppet of the WTO, with the General Agreement on Trade in Services which will impose the country of origin principle on the states, all of them happy to throw themselves on the Genevan bandwagon."
"The risk of social dumping has not been removed, inasmuch as the European Commission can rely on a majority of liberal states wanting to benefit from their comparative advantages."
"Given that all of our powers have been transferred to Brussels, particularly when it comes to competition, we should not be surprised to see our public services challenged, our professional organisations opposed and our characteristics disregarded."
"The new world order does not permit national resistance."
"Everything must be standardised by the law or by the market; for lack of time, the market will take care of destroying the jewels of our industry, of our commerce, of our crafts and of our liberal professions, before it attacks our health and education services and our culture."
"That is what we are fighting against."
". Mr President, on behalf of the Budgetary Control Committee, I should like to say how pleased we were that all our points were taken up by the rapporteur."
"Everyone in this House knows how much time has been spent on this directive."
"Judging by the compromise amendments tabled by the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group, there has been quite a lot of St Valentine’s spirit around in the past month."
"It is a shame that these compromises go so far from the text adopted in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, after some heroic efforts by Mr Harbour, the shadow rapporteur."
"Personally, I can understand that there are times when concessions are necessary, but not these compromises, not now in a Europe where there is an obvious need for economic reform."
"President Barroso, as a reformed Communist, knows that often in politics the most noise comes from the political extremes."
"Very often it is the Left that shouts the loudest."
"Indeed, about 30 000 people are marching in Strasbourg today, wanting to protect the markets in which they operate."
"Whilst that may make them feel more comfortable in the short term, it does not help them in their employment prospects in the long term."
"They forget the 20 million people currently unemployed across our continent."
"If we do not liberalise, if we do not maintain the country-of-origin principle, that 20 million will be joined by many others in the future and many others will continue to stagnate."
"As you would expect, Mr President, as a Conservative I do not often agree with my Prime Minister, Mr Blair."
"However, I agree with his government when it says that this directive has been watered down too much already."
"I wonder if his own MEPs do."
"It is a challenge to this House, through voting for the amendments passed in the Internal Market Committee, to fashion a directive that allows Europe to walk the walk and not just talk the talk of liberalisation, and that creates new jobs and does not just protect the status quo."
"Mr President, I owe the privilege of speaking in this debate to the unfortunate outcome of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' examination of Mrs Wagenknecht's report. In the end, she removed her name from the report following the committee's vote."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, our draftsman, Mrs Wagenknecht, wanted to propose to reject this directive on the basis that Article 16 laid down the country of origin principle, which is incompatible with the subsidiarity principle, endangers services of general interest and risks leading to fiscal, social and environmental dumping, thus endangering the very foundations of the European social model."
"Our rapporteur also proposed to oppose the country of origin principle and the so-called 'Bolkestein' directive, which we should now call the 'McCreevy' directive, on the basis that it placed 25 legal systems in competition with each other, created legal uncertainty and risked resulting in unfair competition between businesses that would no longer be subject to the same conditions."
"Unfortunately, in its vote, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not follow her recommendations."
"Particularly with regard to the country of origin principle, our committee thought that it should be the rule, even though it will probably be challenged in plenary."
"However, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did feel that a number of services should be excluded insofar as they are subject to specific regulations in other Community instruments."
"This particularly related to financial services."
"Fortunately, the risk of inconsistency in such a basis for exclusion was removed by the vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"I hope that it will be the same in plenary."
"The fact remains that, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we also ruled out the liberalisation of services of general economic interest and the privatisation of public service provision bodies and defended the idea that this directive must not attack the Community rules governing competition and state aid."
". Mr President, at the moment, there are certainly more than 30 000 demonstrators outside this Parliament building, which is where I have just been."
"These people have come here to demonstrate against the Services Directive, and this is not the first time that the people of Europe are letting us know that they are not in favour of this liberalisation proposal."
"Whilst I am aware that many of the Members present will probably back the directive, it is not the first time that this House has appeared totally incapable of representing the European public."
"One example I could give of that is the failure of the European Constitution."
"Much has been said about the notorious compromise between the two major groups."
"It is typical that an important subject such as this should so often be the product of so much backhanded scheming."
"That is unworthy of a democracy."
"It is a cowardly compromise too, because rather than taking a clear political decision, everything is now being passed on to the courts."
"Whilst Bolkestein’s original proposal was unacceptable on all fronts, it was at least clear."
"With this compromise, Parliament is only displaying its political lack of power and soon, workers, consumers and the environment will be at the receiving end of this lack of power."
"How different was this in the Committee on the Environment, Pubic Health and Food Safety, where an overwhelming majority had the political courage to reject the original proposal, the country-of-origin principle, and the undermining of public services and social structures."
"It is unfortunate that the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection displayed less common sense by the way they voted."
"I do hope that this House shows much better judgment on Thursday."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, this is a quite crucial week in terms of the credibility of the European Union and of this House in particular."
"Demands are being made of European policymakers and of this House, and we have to face up to our responsibilities and discharge them."
"We constantly affirm our desire to reduce mass unemployment, so we are credible only if we do something for those people who have no work, and we can do it now."
"This week sees us voting on the services directive, which, if implemented, will be capable of creating 600 000 new jobs in Europe, provided that it is adopted in the same form as it has been by my own Industrial Committee or in that approved by the Committee on the Internal Market."
"The compromise had taken on board the justified criticisms levelled at the Commission’s original draft, while also ensuring that new dynamism would be injected into the EU’s services market."
"My opinion was accepted by the Industry Committee with only six of its members voting against doing so, but the attempt at a compromise that we now have before us, the result of haggling between the two major groups, testifies to their contempt for the specialised committees and the laborious work done by them."
"The common denominator is, in the final analysis, so small that it does not justify the efforts of the past years."
"This compromise is not only an assault on the principle of the internal market, to which we owe our prosperity and integration, but also a slap in the face for the new Member States, who have been virtually excluded from the negotiations on it."
"The vote on the services directive gives us at the European level the opportunity to make our contribution to the Lisbon Strategy, for we do indeed know that the Member States are making heavy weather of at last doing what they said they would, and it would be a sign of this House’s bankruptcy if we failed to send out a clear message about the need for more new jobs."
"The trade unions, who continue to spread untruths and panic, are left cold by these arguments."
"Today, we can expect to see 30 000 well-organised trade unionists trying to prevent the creation of 600 000 new jobs."
"Some are here to try and hang on to what they already have."
"We now have the chance to clearly affirm our desire that Europe should be a better place in which to do business."
"Let us make good use of it."
". Mr President, back in 1957, the six founding Members of the European Economic Community made a commitment to creating a single market in which people, goods, capital and services could move freely."
"Almost 50 years on, only the freedom of movement of services has not yet been implemented."
"In the form put before us today, the proposal for a directive on services, which forms part of the economic reform process launched by the Lisbon European Council with the aim of making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy in the world by 2010, represents a major political step forward for the European Union."
"Over 18 months, the European Parliament has endeavoured to rewrite the Commission's original proposal to produce a significantly amended version."
"This new version is balanced, and aims to reconcile economic efficiency, in opening up the market in services, with social justice, in preserving the social standards that protect the EU's citizens."
"It also recognises the specific characteristics of certain services, in particular of cultural and audiovisual services."
"These services carry identity and value and, in this sense, cannot be regarded as consumer goods or market services like any other."
"Furthermore, audiovisual services are also subject to a sectoral approach at Community level in the form of the 'television without frontiers' directive."
"This directive meets the aims set by the services directive, in that it guarantees the free provision of services whilst still allowing other objectives to be pursued, such as promoting European content, respecting cultural diversity and promoting pluralism of programming."
"Taking account of these principles, a large majority of the Committee on Culture and Education, followed by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, came out in favour of inserting a cultural reservation clause and of excluding audiovisual services from the scope of the directive."
"It is vital that the 'television without frontiers' directive, currently undergoing revisions, must remain the only reference text on the subject."
"It is equally vital, however, that a services directive must be adopted so that we can create a true internal market in services within the European Union."
"I would like to end by congratulating Mrs Gebhardt on the quality of her report, and also Mr Harbour, Mrs Thyssen, Mr Toubon and Mr Karas on their hard work to produce a text for which we are happy to vote on Thursday."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just two minutes – enough time for a few bullet points."
"Following the public debate, one could get the impression that freedom to provide services was something that this directive had invented, but it does in fact have the force of law."
"The problem is that it is a law by which many countries do not abide; instead, they have erected barriers and use every kind of chicanery to frustrate it."
"All that in fact needs to be done is for this protectionism, which is what this chicanery is all about, to be done away with, and this directive provides us with the appropriate legal means to do that."
"The political and economic integration of Europe in the services sector, which accounts for 70% of GDP, will be of benefit to all."
"It is not, however, of crucial importance to the big global players or in terms of shareholder value, and on that point I would refer back to what was said by President Barroso and by Mr Watson."
"The big global players do not need the directive, for they have branches and agencies everywhere, through which they can offer their services, but it certainly is crucial to small and medium-sized businesses."
"It also offers benefits to private individuals in the shape of more choice and freedom, especially to workers, in that it will bring more employment, and employment – that is to say, more jobs – is the best kind of social policy."
"Some are now using a Commissioner who is no longer here to defend himself as a pretext for conjuring with terms like free-market liberal, free-market radical and neo-liberal, all of which is a load of scaremongering that gets us nowhere."
"What matters is the text, for it is with that that the crucial progress will be made."
"I, too, would have liked to see rather more – that is to say, fewer derogations – emerging from the votes in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and in the Legal Affairs Committee, which I represent here today."
"There are a few things, though, that I do regard as decisive."
"Firstly, nothing is being done to make the present situation worse."
"Secondly, progress is an absolute certainty; the only question is whether it might perhaps not be enough."
"Thirdly, nobody is being prevented from taking the next steps later, when the time is ripe."
"It may indeed be that that time will come sooner than we think."
". Mr President, there is nothing wrong with wanting to reduce unjustified obstacles to the free movement of services in the internal market, provided that it is done in a responsible manner, ensuring that it does not undermine social and environmental rights, and moving towards the harmonisation of the legislation on services at European level."
"In its proposed form, however, this proposed directive leads to many risks, many of which have already been mentioned."
"In my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I shall refer specifically to those relating to the gender dimension."
"The risks to women relate basically to the creation of jobs for women and to women’s working conditions, as well as to their status as consumers of services."
"Firstly, the implementation of the directive in its current form would undoubtedly have negative effects on women’s employment, particularly in sectors in which the majority of the workforce are women."
"What is needed today, as has been said on several occasions, is greater investment in training and hence an increase in public spending and not, as this directive proposes, simply greater competition."
"It is also worrying that the Commission has not carried out an analysis of the social and employment impact, particularly in view of the effects we have seen in the case of previous liberalisations, which have led to the destruction of many jobs and have also often eroded social cohesion."
"Furthermore, the liberalisation of health and social services could lead to a deterioration of social welfare and health care cover in favour of private insurance, which would affect women in particular since they are the main consumers of these services."
"Finally, applying the principle of country of origin, which has been mentioned so often, to providers of services could lead to abuse and manipulation, since in fields that are not harmonised at European level, which are the majority, this principle would allow for the co-existence of several national systems and would also allow the possible juxtaposition of twenty-five different national sets of regulations, the effect of which would be that consumers would not know to whom, or when, they should complain."
". Mr Presidentthe Committee on Petitions supported the initial draft of the Services Directive."
"We welcomed the even earlier draft tabled by Commissioner Bolkenstein."
"I am bound to remind the House of this."
"In the course of our discussions and deliberations on the subject in the Committee on Petitions we also stated that, as we understand it, European integration is based on what we signed up to, and that was first and foremost the four fundamental freedoms."
"These four freedoms were to represent a new opportunity for Europe."
"They were to make it possible for the Lisbon Strategy to succeed."
"We wanted to make European integration a reality."
"We are completely in favour, but only to the extent of what we signed up to."
"What we signed up to was essentially European economic integration."
"We have been distressed to hear it said that certain new Member States are not contributing to integration."
"I would point out that we were not the ones to reject the Constitutional Treaty and we are not the ones wanting to put Europe’s economy in a straitjacket today."
"I have to say that I am concerned about the notion of reaching some compromise here and glossing over the differences of opinion."
"This would mislead European public opinion."
"The public actually needs to know that just as opinion outside is divided, so too is this House."
"We do not want to create the impression that nobody actually wants economic freedom and that nobody wants to help Europe to become the main driving force and not one of many driving forces of European success."
"I was saddened to hear references to social dumping in the House today."
"This is not consistent with a normal, healthy economy."
"I am not surprised that today’s demonstrators are in such high spirits because it seems they will achieve success."
"They will achieve the kind of success that well-paid trade union activists always achieve."
". Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to extend warm congratulations to Mrs Gebhardt on the hard work she has done so far."
"I am simply in awe."
"I should also like to thank the members of the other groups."
"I think that we should be proud of the work we have done in the last few weeks."
"Nothing has been discussed in closed meetings or in subterranean vaults; there has been every opportunity for open debate."
"I am also indebted to the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. We are indeed sending a strong message, because this House now has a great responsibility."
"We must prove that it is possible to create an internal market for services in a bid to fully develop our social model."
"Accordingly, we must vote for a directive that leaves social dumping well and truly behind."
"That also echoes one of the messages which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has sent out."
"I think that the people in the streets of Strasbourg can go along with those messages, and so can most of our fellow MEPs."
"First of all, I think there is enough material on the table, such as the full observation of labour legislation, social protection, collective labour agreements and industrial relations, including collective actions, on which this House can build in order to provide absolute guarantees."
"Secondly, my committee has said that the Services Directive should under no circumstances undermine existing European social provisions."
"The Posting of Workers Directive, in particular, is of course a sensitive issue in this respect."
"Very often, the Services Directive is seen as giving to the phasing out of workers’ labour conditions and to wage cuts, and in some countries – quite a number in fact – incidents have been reported lately that are the result of fraudulent practices."
"We have seen examples with Laval in Sweden, Struik Foods in Belgium, and Irish Ferries, but there are many more."
"Invariably, these practices are simply illegal, but as the Services Directive threatens to make inspection even more difficult, it is important that we clarify that Articles 24 and 25 are deleted while the Services Directive remains fully in force."
"That is not the end of it, though."
"Indeed, Mr McCreevy, we will need to take measures in order to grant employers better access to information and counter bureaucratic measures, but Commissioner, we will also need to take measures in order to ensure that the legislation on the posting of workers, which is in theory sound, is observed."
"It is too easy to side-step this legislation and there are too many instances of misuse."
"Thirdly, my committee has spelled out that something really needs to be done about the scope of this directive."
"It is a good thing that there is already consensus to remove social services, health services, temporary employment agencies and security services from this directive, for they work in a completely different manner."
"In fact, my committee took the view that all services of general economic interest should be excluded, for the simple reason that they have no commercial motive, but that it is the intention, first and foremost, to provide a service of general interest with it, in other words guarantee basic human rights."
"I think it would be good if these could be deleted from the directive after all."
"I can be brief about the country of origin principle."
"According to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, this principle is unacceptable."
"I think that the compromise that is on the table is sound, because it allows countries where the service is provided to continue to take legislative measures for the benefit of general interest."
"By way of conclusion, I hope that, on Thursday, this House will be able to send a strong message – in the shape of a new and completely overhauled text – to the Commission and the Council about the radical social adjustment to the Commission’s original document of which this European Parliament is in favour, for only then will we be able to persuade public opinion that what this House has produced is not a licence for social dumping."
"Mr President, it is more than two years since I started working on this directive and I have been convinced from the beginning that its objectives and the ambition to tackle the barriers to the internal market for services have been absolutely right."
"Why has it taken two years?"
"We had it at the end of the last Parliament; we have seen some of the issues raised by the many speeches here today, which, in many cases, have vastly overplayed the problems but underplayed the opportunities."
"With some of the high-flown rhetoric we have heard today about issues like social dumping and so on, which I have never been in any way convinced would arise from this directive, it is most important that we do not forget the opportunities, so I shall talk a little about those tonight."
"Firstly, I particularly want to thank all the members of my group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection who have worked so tirelessly with me to reshape this text."
"I calculate that three-quarters of all the amendments to the text that we will vote on on Thursday originated from our group."
"In particular, the whole idea of a central clause called ‘freedom to provide services’ was developed by us in the run-up to the committee vote."
"That will form the basis for the compromise that I want to commend to all my colleagues this afternoon."
"I also want to thank our colleagues in the ALDE and UEN Groups who helped us achieve a very important result in the committee back in November."
"This is one of the subjects to have attracted the most debate and argument over the last two years."
"This will be the final debate of this cycle, but I am sure we will have many more."
"At the heart of the debate has been Mrs Gebhardt, a very hardworking and determined rapporteur."
"Even though she is not listening to me – I think she is working on her voting list – I want to pay tribute to her and the very courteous and painstaking way in which she has led our work on a very complicated and difficult proposal."
"I said that I wanted to look at the impact of the directive as a whole, because we should be thinking particularly about small and medium-sized businesses, which are constantly frustrated at their inability to access the internal market at the moment."
"There is a whole range of provisions in this proposal – no less than 81 provisions on Member States – to deal with these sorts of barriers, because businesses want to be able to go into markets; they want to be able to start up without unnecessary and bureaucratic barriers; they want to be able to send their experts to other countries."
"But they also want to know that they will not be subject to disproportionate and unnecessary restrictions and that includes requiring them to comply with duplicate sets of rules and authorisations when they have already complied with them in their own country."
"I do not think that is reasonable."
"The European courts do not think that is reasonable and that is contained in this compromise."
"If that is the devastating country-of-origin principle, then what have we been arguing about all this time?"
"It is there in the law of the Court of Justice."
"My reading of this compromise is that it is not in any way eroded and we must make sure that it is not eroded when we come to the vote."
"The role of the Commission has been mentioned."
"If Commissioner McCreevy will also listen to me – everybody is having conversations while I am addressing them –he, as the Commissioner, has a crucial responsibility to take this forward."
"I do not want him just to produce a proposal based word for word on this text."
"We need to do more work on it, because it needs to deliver benefits for business, otherwise there is no point in having it at all."
"I think we can do that."
"I say in conclusion to Mr Bartenstein – and I am still wearing my Austrian tie, because I told him I would wear it for as long as we were in sight of a clear agreement – he can still get this on the table of the economic summit in March if he puts his mind to it."
"Madam President, it is rare for a draft directive to incite such passions."
"Mr Bolkestein has become the saviour for some, and the Antichrist for others."
"Listening to some of the speeches, however, it is clear that few people have actually read the initial text."
"Many of its opponents have not realised that Parliament has completely rewritten the so-called 'Bolkestein' proposal, and yet they are still calling on us to reject it."
"I would encourage them not to do so."
"Parliament must do its job as a legislator, otherwise the European Court of Justice will impose its case-law, which could be dangerous."
"There are currently 53 cases relating to the free provision of services pending before the Court of Justice."
"The Court is obviously waiting for clarification from the European legislature."
"If the European Parliament did not do its work, the Court would do its own."
"I would encourage you to vote in favour of the compromise drawn up by Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Harbour, which opens up the internal market in services, whilst avoiding brutal and unfair competition and protecting the right of every state to defend its social model and its public services without discrimination."
"Mr Bolkestein's proposal was clumsy, and it attempted to bypass the Community principle of gradual harmonisation with the country of origin principle."
"However, this principle is not laid down in the Treaties, even though it has been used, following Court of Justice case-law, to promote the free movement of goods."
"Nevertheless, services are provided by human beings, who have to be protected against social dumping."
"The country of origin principle encouraged a race to the bottom in regulatory terms, but the country of destination principle encourages stark and stupid protectionism."
"We have to abolish the protectionism and barriers to trade that have built up since 1957, particularly in the founding Member States."
"The Treaty of Rome enshrined the aim of free movement of services."
"We are far from reaching that goal, even though our countries have essentially become service economies."
"Not all services can be exported."
"Public services will continue to be a matter for the public authorities."
"For public market services, the states are able to define what they mean by services of general economic interest by regulating how they are organised and financed."
"In some countries, people are trying to deify the idea of public services without asking themselves whether public services are really services to the public."
"It is hard to accept, for example, that France is trying to protect its markets in what it calls public services, while French public and private companies are plundering other markets."
"The balance reached thanks to the work of Mrs Gebhardt, Mr Harbour, Mrs Van Lancker, Mrs Thyssen and others will guarantee that the states have control over the services provided to the citizens, whilst avoiding discriminatory measures."
"I will end, Madam President, by saying that adopting this amended directive will consign Bolkestein to oblivion."
"Thanks to the new facilities, particularly provided via the one-stop shops, the Union's internal market will make progress."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the services directive has given rise to some powerful emotions, and we are still not completely out of the woods."
"In democracy, a decision comes about through debate – sometimes lengthy debate."
"As a result of debates in the European Parliament, the proposal by the Commission has been improved; it has become acceptable."
"The directive has not been watered down with amendments: this is a matter of the workings of democracy."
"Some say that the Members of the European Parliament are afraid of undertaking bold reforms and that we are afraid of pushing through the original directive."
"In reply to this I would say that we are not working in an ivory tower."
"We address legitimate causes of concern whenever necessary, and we will amend the directive if we see fit to do so."
"We listen to public opinion, and this is as it must be."
"This is called democracy, which the Union says it respects and which it even markets to the outside world."
"I am prepared to support reasonable proposals for compromise, because it is better to have some sort of vague harmony than major discord."
"I am sure, however, that we will be able to achieve a strong consensus with regard to this issue."
"It would be good for the European internal market."
"On the other hand, we must take care that the Member States are not given a free hand to prevent the movement of trade in services on grounds that are just too flimsy."
"In closing I would like to thank Evelyne Gebhard, and everyone here including Commissioner McCreevy."
"Madam President, I, for my part, should like to join others in thanking Mrs Gebhardt and Mrs Van Lancker not only for their excellent work, but also for the fairness and the spirit of cooperation they demonstrated with my, and other, groups."
"That being said, having heard Mr Harbour speak after Mrs Gebhardt and Mrs Van Lancker, I am not really sure that the famous joint text means the same for everyone, which worries me and reinforces my belief in the idea expressed by Mrs Rühle that the text is perhaps a compromise that increases, rather than reduces, legal uncertainty."
"Mr McCreevy, Mr Barroso spoke about a misunderstanding."
"It is clear that the misunderstanding mainly stems from this notorious country of origin principle."
"We all want job creation, but jobs are not created merely by increasing competition and lowering prices with a view to increasing demand."
"Demand rises when people – citizens and workers alike - have confidence."
"If they are to have confidence, they must be convinced of the fair nature of the rules of competition."
"That is why the country of origin principle not only does not legally exist in the Treaties, but would also be, in my opinion, economically disastrous."
"We do not want a Union of 25 in which a ‘national rule versus national rule’ competition would take place."
"If we want to send positive political signals to the citizens of the new Member States, then let us provide ourselves with a budget that is equal to the solidarity we need to show; let us follow the Commission’s advice – and, in saying that, I address the Presidency of the Council – and see to it that all the Member States remove the restrictions on the free movement of workers; and let us see to it that 1 May 2006 is actually a 1 May for all the workers of the 25 countries of this European Union."
"Finally, Mr McCreevy, during the last parliamentary term, the majority of MEPs speaking in plenary twice called on the Commission to draft a proposal for a framework directive on services of general interest - otherwise known as public services - in order to prevent these services from being contingent on the case law of the Court or the subject of derogations with regard to competition law."
"What is stopping you from issuing this proposal?"
"Here is an election commitment we had made: to deal simultaneously with a framework directive on services of general interest and a directive on the internal market in services."
"By not issuing the proposal, you, your attitude and your Commission create an imbalance and give rise to, or increase, the mistrust felt by a small proportion of Europeans."
"From this perspective, you do not encourage the creation of a Union of 25 in which the dominant themes are solidarity between the East and the West and fair treatment for all workers."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is always the same lies that are used to justify neo-liberal policies – that jobs would be created and growth promoted, and we have heard them time and time again today."
"In fact, though, the neo-liberal reconstruction of Europe over the past fifteen years has had precisely the opposite effect."
"Each succeeding round of liberalisation measures has put hundreds and thousands of people out of work and deeper into poverty."
"Every encroachment on workers’ rights reduces their purchasing power and thereby throttles growth."
"There are those who want unfettered capitalism, and the Bolkestein directive is one of their big projects; if it becomes reality, we will see the dawn of a Europe in which market forces and the profit motive reign unchallenged, in which quality and environmental standards are downgraded and the downward spiral of wages and social security provision is accelerated in an intolerable manner."
"The feeble compromise on which the conservatives and social democrats have agreed still tends in that direction; in essential areas such as water supply or education, the radically free-market thinking of the original directive is still there."
"The country-of-origin principle has not really been laid to rest – that much has become glaringly apparent from the speeches by both sides – but has, instead, been left to the interpretation of the European Court of Justice."
"Thinking back to that court’s past rulings, the big business lobby is not likely to have any problems with that."
"We do not want a Bolkestein directive; we do not want a Bolkestein Europe."
"For we do not want a Europe that uses the concepts of equality of opportunity and freedom to provide services as a pretext for creating the best possible conditions for big business and enabling it to maximise its profits at the expense of workers and consumers."
"We do not want a Europe in which basic services of general interest are made the playthings of capitalist market forces."
"The mania for privatisation needs to be stopped and reversed."
"The resistance to this brutal neo-liberal project must go on."
"It is thanks to this compromise that these protests are happening at all, and so I believe that this cannot be the end of the story."
"The fight against the directive must go on until it eventually ..."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are spectators of the Bolkestein masked ball, which has returned here to the European Parliament."
"This compromise, this window dressing, this deception is both a lie and a scandal."
"It is a lie because we are led to believe that the Bolkestein Directive has been stripped of its substance, of its content."
"Nothing could be further from the truth."
"The country of origin principle is in there, and most definitely in there, together with the freedom to provide services, which specifically relates to self-employed craft workers."
"The principle of national law taking precedence over European law is missing, and we heard several speakers explain to us on several occasions that this entire matter was passing under the control, under the arbitration, of the European Court of Justice, in whose case law we are already well versed."
"This is scandalous."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"Now, looking at the latest amendments jointly submitted by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group, it seems a shame that the Services Directive was not adopted before the European Union’s last enlargement."
"Clearly, public opinion in the older Member States, to which both of the largest political groups have paid heed, currently perceives all market liberalisation measures as threats, although in fact the aim of these measures is to make the European Union stronger."
"I would therefore firstly like to rebut the erroneous view that the liberalisation of the services market is beneficial only for the cheap end of the market, namely, for the new Member States."
"Already today in high added-value services sectors – in financial business and consultancy services – this flow is greater from the older to the new Member States."
"The movement of services following liberalisation is not and cannot be one-way."
"Thus, for example, the proportion of the older Member States in total added value in the European Union construction sector constitutes 95%, while in the business services sphere the percentage is even greater: 98%."
"For this reason the markets of the new Member States will definitely have a permanent place for the services sector of the older Member States, with its high added value, capacity and capital."
"The application of the country of origin principle to the provision of services would open up the European Union’s internal market to the largest service providers in the Member States – small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Maintaining the country of origin principle would channel a portion of competition pressure in the labour market into the business sphere."
"That would have a beneficial impact on the development of business activity in the whole of Europe."
"Employees working outside their own countries would retain a close link with their countries of origin through their national businesses."
"The new Member States are interested in the export of goods and services, not in the export of the labour force."
"One of the arguments against the country of origin principle is the fear that living standards in the older Member States would be under threat, but the removal of the country of origin principle or its significant restriction would make the Services Directive ineffective, and that would definitely erode those standards in the future."
"Mr President, the initial text of the Bolkenstein directive represented an opportunity for the Europe of the Twenty-Five, and also an opportunity for the Europe of the Fifteen."
"Little remains of that text now."
"National interests have superseded European ones and the principle of solidarity has been swept aside by the egoism displayed by certain countries."
"Is the concern about social conditions not just a smokescreen for concern about national markets?"
"Is there any value in the compromise reached between the Right and the Left, and can it be trusted?"
"During the recent debate on the European Constitution in France, serious misgivings about the latest enlargement of the Union came to the surface."
"Nonetheless, negotiations with Turkey were opened."
"The new Member States do not pose a threat to the Union."
"In its initial form the Services Directive was an opportunity to redress the imbalance arising from the unfair accession conditions imposed on the new Member States."
"Their citizens do not have the right to work elsewhere in the Union and the agricultural subsidies are very low."
"At the same time, foreign supermarkets and other firms, mostly French ones, are notching up record profits in Poland."
"They are employing people at a fifth of the normal wage, until 10 p.m., on Sundays, and they hardly pay any taxes into the Polish Government’s coffers."
"Mr Schulz, leader of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, need not lose any sleep over our situation."
"Our countries know best what is good for them."
"That ambitious programme seems to be dead and buried, even though it complied with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"We had the choice of travelling to a better Europe by express train or on a push bike, and we chose the push bike."
"Today is St. Valentine’s Day, but there is not much evidence of love between the Member States of the old and new Union."
"Madam President, right from the moment when this proposal for a Services Directive saw the light of day, the Flemish Christian Democrats were among those who regarded it as extremely controversial."
"Its scope was too broad for our liking, the drive to deregulate too strong, the devolution of powers to the Member States was not sufficiently respected and the proposal was ambiguous in too many places."
"All of this resulted in a widespread fear of the impact this directive might have, which has been used and abused and has gradually developed into the very symbol representing the chasm with the public."
"At the same time, we have always known that completing the internal market for services is a necessity and can make a real difference to our level of prosperity."
"If we as Parliament want to shoulder some of the responsibility with regard to the strategy for growth and jobs, a sound Services Directive is our instrument ."
"The potential for creating 600 000 jobs is not something we can simply ignore."
"That is why we have never voted in favour of rejection and have, from the outset, been in favour of its revision, and so far, we have succeeded in our objective."
"Anyone who has read the texts and placed them in context can testify to that."
"With the vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we MEPs have given direction to the debate."
"We have proven that the proposal can be amended in a way that the objective of cutting out the red-tape and irresponsible obstacles to the free movement is achievable without affecting social protection."
"I am very proud of the result which our group, under the direction of Mr Harbour in that Committee, managed to achieve."
"With the help of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and the Liberals, we managed to force many of our amendments through."
"This was unmistakably the basis for further persuasive action and tying up loose ends in the negotiations over the last few weeks."
"I would thank all fellow Members, including those of the Social Democratic group, who have contributed, for we have all done our bit to ensure that a sound package is now before us."
"We should not now get bogged down by small print."
"We are bound to hold differing views on certain things."
"Sensitivities in the parties and in the Member States are different, after all."
"Instead of looking to the left or right, we should look at the total package that is before us and that will help us a long way in our common search for more growth and jobs."
"An overwhelming majority in Thursday’s vote will also help us close a triple gap: the gap between the institutions and the public, the gap that has come about between the old and the new Member States – let us be magnanimous enough to admit this – and also the gap between the theory of the Treaty and the factual obstacles that have hindered the development of the services market far too long."
"We are looking forward to the proposals which the Commission has announced, and I hope that we will succeed in our goal on Thursday."
"() Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate only confirms the level of passions aroused by the draft Services Directive."
"Both opponents and supporters are producing arguments that in some cases are rather suspect."
"It has already been stated here a number of times that the free movement of services, which is one of the four basic principles underpinning the single internal market of the European Union, is not being implemented in practice."
"This situation has now prevailed for a long time and it is only a matter of chance that we are attempting to change it shortly after a substantial enlargement of the EU, which is in itself one of the reasons for the emotional response."
"If the agreed changes are adopted, the trade unionists demonstrating in front of this building can rest easy."
"Their fears of cheap labour being exported to provide services will not materialise."
"As a former trade unionist, I welcome the fact that there are trade unionists from the new Member States among the demonstrators."
"Many people are asking why this should be."
"The answer is because they feel solidarity with trade unionists from the old Member States and because the enlargement of the EU will continue."
"What some may see as unnecessary today can look very different after another year has gone by."
"The issue is whether the Directive before Parliament will be good or bad."
"The wider issue is whether the Directive will be regarded as having become so incomprehensible after the flood of amendments that it would be better to reject it."
"If we adopt the Directive together with the agreed amendments, it will create a great deal of work for lawyers in all of our countries."
"In my view, just as in many previous cases, European institutions are failing to produce directives that are clear and concise, in a way that makes it easy to monitor whether they are being implemented and adhered to properly."
"I am not surprised that the business community is taking such a close interest in the fate of this Directive."
"Business in the service sector, especially where public services are concerned, is free from the sort of competitive pressures that we see in manufacturing."
"In my view, the problematic provision allowing the Member States to demand fulfilment of further requirements relating to social policies or consumer protection must be removed from the Directive."
"I do not want to see consumer protection distorted into protectionism."
"At the present time many opinions are being vented on the common theme of the mistrust felt by the old Member States towards the new ones."
"Let us take a step towards removing one of the elements of that dispute and vote in favour of the Directive, provided that the compromises we have reached are implemented."
"Mr de Villiers, I should like to point out that we had a problem with the timing."
"You should have one-and-a-half minutes, when only one minute was allotted."
"That was a mistake and we cannot clarify where it came from."
"However, when I give someone the floor I always state how much time is allowed."
"I would appreciate, in future, that if there is a discrepancy, you point it out immediately."
"I will now allow you one minute of speaking time as it is impossible to speak coherently in the remaining 30 seconds."
"Madam President, I obviously find it very regrettable that, as fate would have it, this mistake crept in when one of France’s leading spokesmen for the ‘No’ campaign in the referendum was speaking."
"You therefore cut me off; you can protest."
"The people of France cast their ‘No’ vote on 29 May 2005; they said ‘No’ to the Bolkestein Directive."
"I also find it regrettable that I am being cut off, with my speaking time slashed by a third, just when I am in the middle of saying that the Bolkestein Directive was unceremoniously thrown out by universal suffrage, with a kick up the backside from the people of France, and now it goes and makes a comeback here in the European Parliament."
"For the people of France who are tonight going to see the images on television screens across the land, this is quite simply a provocation. It is a provocation because the people of France heard Mr Chirac, the President of the Republic, say back in May: ‘the Bolkestein Directive is finished’."
"It was not finished – this is a provocation!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the representatives of the Union for French Democracy are obviously ardent supporters of the free movement of services."
"There is a real need to stop the Member States’ discriminatory and protectionist practices, and we are therefore in favour of a directive on services drafted in this Parliament and not via the case law of the Court."
"We do, however, demand that a balance be struck between, on the one hand, this freedom promoting the economic development of Europe and, on the other, respect for labour law, environmental protection and consumer protection."
"It is true that we would have preferred genuine harmonisation to the clumsy and foolish text proposed to us."
"All of us in this Chamber ought to have known that this draft would be overwhelmingly and justifiably rejected by European public opinion."
"At the stage we are already at with this matter, we could have prevented this further blow to the way in which European integration is viewed."
"I must say, Madam President, that the Commission’s lack of political judgment was only matched by that of the French governmental authorities, which unexpectedly revealed themselves to be party to this series of blunders."
"Getting to the heart of matters, though, I should like to say how pleased I am about the progress that has been made during our debates within this Chamber."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we can ensure that labour law is protected by deleting Articles 24 and 25."
"We can reject the country of origin principle by adopting the compromise contained in Article 16, which has become ‘compromise’ Amendment 293. This amendment, moreover, paves the way for the harmonisation for which we all hope and pray."
"We can, I hope, succeed in excluding social services and services of general economic interest from this directive by voting in favour of our amendments."
"Throughout this process, we have supported the rapporteurs, Mrs Gebhardt and Mrs Van Lancker, whom I thank for their listening skills and their spirit of openness."
"If, as we hope, Parliament really wants to proceed along these lines, then we will be able, in the final vote, to support this text because it will have been thoroughly amended."
"Madam President, I too would like to add my voice to those who have thanked Mrs Gebhardt and Mrs Van Lancker for their considerable work on this."
"Listening to the debate this afternoon, I have a feeling that the vote has already taken place, because people are talking with such certainty about what is in and what is out. Nothing is out until we vote on Thursday morning."
"It is certainly clear that this directive needed a rewrite."
"It is a pity that Parliament is doing it; we asked the Commission to take it off the table and rewrite it, but it would not do so."
"As others have said, many of us here have found that the Commission’s behaviour during the whole debate about the directive has been highly problematic."
"We have been unable to get clarity; unable to get answers to specific questions; and there has been a lack of public response to amendments tabled, not least in our committee meetings, as well as a lack of an effective social impact assessment, which might have gone some way to allaying public fears about what is in this."
"It is true that there are few issues of disagreement, but they are certainly extremely important ones."
"If we are looking at the international context, to some of us that is about GATS, where we have heard certain things about what is really, in theory, on the table and then we hear about background negotiating positions which are leading to something else."
"Many of us have had big problems with the whole country of origin theory – I do not think it is a principle – and how this, for example, might fit with the ability of Member States to seek higher standards, which is also allowed."
"Again, many of our questions about how the overriding public interest will come into play in this have not been fully answered."
"I would agree that health should be taken out of this directive; it should never have been there in the first place, and many of us look forward to a speedy proposal from the Commission on the issues of patient mobility and not service mobility, which is why it should not have been in the directive in the first place."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a huge demonstration today in Strasbourg has told us loud and clear that there is a need for a different Europe."
"This desire for a different Europe is the opposite of the Bolkestein directive and can find no satisfaction even in the compromise, which comes nowhere near to understanding this need."
"What it creates, in fact, is a predominant right to profit from services as commodities, so that trade rules and GATS become the basic law, rather than rights and best practices."
"Who decides what is necessary, proportionate and non-discriminatory?"
"This directive will end up creating a great many legal disputes."
"That is made worse by the fact that the compromise does not exclude public services and civic services from the scope of the directive, while it is striking that it does exclude the professions and financial and insurance services, namely the powerful sectors."
"The self-employed are left at the mercy of dumping, and it is easy to imagine what will happen."
"We want some new ideas, but instead we are offered the old ones again."
"That is why we shall vote against this directive and this poor compromise."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are and always have been against the directive, even in its amended version."
"The amendments that have been introduced do not, in fact, entirely eliminate the serious consequences that the directive may entail in terms of social dumping and, above all, of weakening the role and powers of regional bodies."
"Furthermore, the general proposal of bringing down barriers to the entry of foreign service providers is liable to reduce the quality of services rendered to the public, as regards ensuring that organic food is supplied to school canteens, for instance, and the actual licensing of certain services."
"Then there is a whole raft of regulations that the Member States and local authorities have put in place to protect consumers and users that we shall have to give up for good."
"In addition, this compromise throws the door open to an enormous amount of litigation and will certainly not enable us to cut out red tape and streamline the services market."
"One need only think of all the disputes that will be submitted to the Court of Justice for examination and thus to European case-law, which is becoming a real European superlaw that will crush the Member States’ own legal systems as well as local and regional bodies of law."
"That is why we say a decided ‘no’ to this surreptitious attempt to impose a principle that is said to have been toned down in the directive …"
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to say this, but the European Parliament is running the risk of creating a monster with this directive."
"Unfortunately, the objective of bringing down those hateful bureaucratic barriers that effectively strangle the free movement of services has substantially failed."
"What remains of the directive is a pastiche, the outcome of the rationale that compromise should be taken to the extreme, lumping together views that cannot coexist, namely unbridled liberalisation and protection for the corporate privileges of certain categories and sectors."
"It is in fact important to realise that all the powerful sectors have been excluded from the scope of this directive – telecommunications, banking and financial services, insurance and legal services – in other words, all those sectors that have been strong enough to keep out of the directive, whereas it will apply to all the weak sectors that need greater social protection and are less able to be represented and to exert pressure."
"Even so, I want to see the cup as being half full."
"I note that the country-of-origin principle has rightly been removed, and we hope that all services of general interest will be excluded from the scope of the directive."
"I should like to highlight two contributions that we have made to the text."
"First, the Commission is obliged to submit a report to the European Parliament on the implementation status of the directive, in order to check that it is being implemented properly and to ensure that the directive does not breach laws protecting workers’ and consumers’ rights."
"Secondly, we have called for a national monitoring body to be set up in each Member State to draw up an annual report and check that the directive is being implemented, so that it does not violate workers’ rights or result in practices that cause social dumping."
"The body must also check that workers are afforded all due health and safety protection in the workplace."
"In conclusion, I call for the body to monitor …"
"Madam President, in the tension between totally free market access and the preservation of indigenous national employment, I unapologetically see the priority as protecting local jobs."
"Hence the country-of-origin principle, particularly in its original form in the proposed directive, is for me a bridge too far: it would be injurious to home-grown employment to permit service providers to operate in the host country of their choice without, unlike local providers, being subject to the same costly restraints in labour, consumer and environmental legislation."
"Thus local employers, employees and, ultimately, local consumers, would be the losers."
"Competition must not just be free: it must also be fair, and it seems to me that principle is being swept aside."
"My second area of objection to this directive is its scope."
"I cannot accept that it should apply to core public services."
"Every nation owes a duty to provide such services and that duty should not be evaded, or the quality of such services diminished, by allowing them to be provided by the cheapest cowboy source."
"Commercial services are one thing, but core public services, like social housing and welfare provision, are something quite different and should not be the plaything of profit-driven providers."
"Thus this is a directive which I cannot, and will not, support."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, things have for some time been looking good for the services directive."
"The Council is present today, represented by the Minister for the Economy and Labour of a country in which social partnership works and in which the social market economy is a living reality."
"Unity between the social partners, the social market economy and the compatibility of economic growth and competitiveness with social security are also the principles on the basis of which the Members of the European Parliament have, over recent weeks, come to agree among themselves and to rewrite the Bolkestein directive."
"Over the past weeks and months, though, much of what has been said and written about the services directive has been false, with deliberate attempts being made to stir up anxieties and prejudices."
"To this day, there are those who would rather demonstrate than inform, who prefer to take to the streets rather than negotiate and seek division rather than sound political solutions."
"We, here in this House, have taken another road, yet even here there are those who misinform without having first read."
"To Mrs Wagenknecht, I have to say that this directive is not about liberalisation or privatisation, and our friends in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance need to be reminded that the first sentence of Article 16 reads: ‘Member States shall ensure free access to, and the free exercise of, services’."
"What this directive does do is to remove bureaucracy and legal uncertainty; it creates economic growth and jobs whilst maintaining social security."
"It takes as its starting point the freedom to provide services and goes on to regulate what is to be done with that freedom."
"What we have done by rewriting the Commission proposal and the resolution on the internal market, and through negotiations between the groups, is to produce a business card for the European model of the social market economy."
"We are not playing off one against the other."
"We have also listened to the people and have, in the work we have done in this House, taken their fears and concerns on board."
"Europe needs this services directive."
"It will ensure more growth and more new jobs in Europe, and will be good for workers, entrepreneurs and for Europe."
"There is not one single reason to reject this directive in the form in which we will be putting it to the vote, and nor, today, is there even a single reason to demonstrate against this directive in the shape in which we will be adopting it."
"The demonstrators have recognised that, too, for of the 35 000 who came to Strasbourg, fewer than 1 000 turned up outside the Parliament building."
"They, too, know that we are working for them."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to offer you my sincere thanks for arranging for three Austrians to speak just before the break."
"It is a tribute to the Presidency."
"That is how I see it, at any rate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner McCreevy, the Commission President and Minister Bartenstein are in fact right when they say that Thursday’s vote will be a very important vote, both for the development of the market in services and of the internal market in general and for the question of enlargement."
"That these two matters coincide has of course given rise to much anxiety that competition will now increase or there will be social undercutting."
"Our criticism of the directive in its present form was in fact that it will produce those very things."
"I do believe, however, and everyone must be convinced of this, that we have committed ourselves to the internal market as one of the instruments of European Union, and we must progressively make that internal market reality."
"We have also committed ourselves to enlargement."
"That means also allowing the neighbours who have joined us to take part in this internal market without discrimination."
"What we must do with this directive is to make this a reality from a social point of view."
"I come from a country that lies on the interface with the enlargement countries."
"Much of what has perhaps not yet happened formally is in fact already reality."
"I know there are problems, and if I use the term ‘social dumping’ I know that some of my colleagues in my own group will say that is discriminatory."
"I am not talking about workers, however. I am talking about a small number of businesses that use cheap labour to practise social dumping."
"We therefore need to prevent even a small number giving the enlargement process or the internal market a bad image, because the internal market and enlargement are good things in themselves."
"I am quite sure we have made progress on this."
"Journalists today are asking us whether this directive will bring any benefits at all."
"Article 16 in particular is important as it stands, because it clearly says what can be done and what cannot be done."
"I agree with the Commission that things which are discriminatory should be abolished and rules that are disproportionate or unnecessary for achieving the objectives should be abolished."
"On the other hand, it is important to make clear that this is not a contribution to social dumping or about undermining the progress that has already been made, because no one would understand if we were to use enlargement or the internal market to block progress or undo the progress that has already been made."
"With this in mind, it is right and important that we should tomorrow be able to implement the compromise we have reached today."
"The demonstrations have helped to draw attention to this."
"They were after all not against a directive but for a better one."
"If the presidency and the Commission help to create a better directive, then we can really be content."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with you and with Commissioner McCreevy that we now have a better directive in front of us, one which I hope will find a very broad majority at first reading;"
"I say this not only as a result of having followed this debate, but as a result of the work of the last few weeks and months."
"Whether by chance or thanks to the wisdom of the President, I am pleased to be able to speak as a fellow-countryman of the two previous speakers, Mr Karas and Mr Swoboda, not only because they are my fellow-countrymen, but because they have both played a considerable part in reaching this compromise in the last few weeks."
"I have already expressed my thanks to Mrs Gebhardt and I would like to thank both of them, and also of course Malcolm Harbour, and many others besides."
"I am sure you will be able to wear the Presidency tie in the next few weeks and months, Mr Harbour, because this directive will continue to be a good directive and will open the way for greater freedom to provide services."
"It is and was one of the most controversial dossiers – perhaps the most controversial the European Parliament has dealt with, certainly one of the most substantial, when I look at the number of amendments that have been tabled."
"With , too, which was on a similar scale, the European Parliament did some excellent work and really opened the way for a sensible chemicals directive."
"The European Parliament can be proud of that."
"The important thing is that there should be a large majority the day after tomorrow, not only as a matter of principle, but because we all know, for example, that there is a letter from six Member States to the Commission, that there are also still some questions open in the Commission and that a large majority in Parliament will of course send the Commission and the Council a signal that they must go along with Parliament’s opinion on this."
"In my view and in that of the presidency, this compromise text achieves a great deal, on the one hand delivering clear added value on the internal market in services and the freedom to provide services, while on the other saying a clear No to any risk of social and wage dumping."
"I personally do not believe that social security in Europe is an obstacle to European competition and strength, but that it is in fact a prerequisite for making Europe even more competitive."
"This is also a directive of great symbolic meaning."
"Although Mrs Thyssen said that in the last few weeks and months this directive has been the symbol of a gulf between Europe and its institutions on the one side and the public on the other – which was a pity, but was unfortunately the case – it is also symbolic of the question of whether this Europe is capable of taking us forward in the direction of greater growth and employment."
"On the political side, we do not have so many occasions for providing growth and employment. The Services Directive is one such occasion."
"Seen in that way, it is an important symbol in many respects, and we are on the right path."
"In the last few months I have had the impression that all the stakeholders, including the social partners, all the responsible stakeholders, that is, want this Services Directive to succeed, because we need it; and I would like to point out that the General Secretary of the European trade unions has said it is a good compromise that ought to be adopted; many have also said they would be demonstrating a better directive today."
"If we want to fill the Lisbon Strategy with life, if we want to give people a signal that we are working for growth and employment, then we need this Services Directive."
"Our presidency will be continuing to work hard in the weeks ahead."
"We will take on board Parliament’s views and position, we will be putting it up for discussion with the social partners on 9 March and in the Competition Council on 13 March, and it will be debated by the European Council on 23/24 March."
"As soon as Charlie McCreevy and the Commission send us the new, revised, proposal at the end of April, which will to a large extent be based on Parliament’s work, and make it public, we will do all we can to make as much progress on this dossier as possible."
"I promise you that, and I also promise the European Parliament that we take its position on this very seriously and we will follow it to a very large extent."
"Madam President, I deeply regret that the presidency cannot stay until the end, for we need to decide what our priorities are, and I find it deplorable that people from the smaller groups will have to take the floor this evening without the presidency being present."
"I am disappointed about that, and that is at the same time, in fact, the response to all the comments already made."
"I wanted to get this off my chest first."
"It is also regrettable that the smaller groups are not involved in the negotiations."
"The failure to invite them is simply not an acceptable way of working."
"That the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament should now come to an agreement is, to my mind, very much to be regretted."
"If that is the shape of things to come in politics, I think we have taken the wrong turn and democracy in Europe is increasingly being eroded."
"These are two more cries from the heart which I wanted like to get off my chest."
"This directive’s objective is to make a strong European economy, not with a view to competing against each other, but with a view to competing against the rest of the world."
"The aim is to strike a balance between consumer and employers’ interests and to position our economy well compared to the rest of the world."
"I hope we will be able to find an acceptable compromise by Thursday morning."
"Failing that, I fear we will be making the same mistake as the Egyptians at the height of their civilisation."
"They only protected their achievements and no longer focused on preserving their prosperity for the future, and we all know what happened to Egyptian culture."
"For that reason, ..."
"Madam President, I am afraid I must disturb the show of harmony somewhat and point out that the Commission has done the European union a disservice with the Bolkestein Directive."
"It does not even have the excuse of having inherited it, since it failed to withdraw the directive last March."
"Bolkestein divides Europe into poor and rich, into east and west."
"Bolkestein is a draft with few winners and many losers."
"It is not a step forward, but a step backward for European integration."
"We need a services directive with a win-win situation, a services directive that combines freedom to provide services with recognition of each Member State’s social rights and the protection of workers."
"The country-of-origin principle, on the other hand, risks a downward spiral of social rights in Europe."
"Many people from all over Europe, from France, Italy, Poland and Germany, are on the streets of Strasbourg today to protest against it."
"They are not protesting against the European Union, they are protesting against Europe’s drifting into neoliberalism, against the splitting of Europe."
"We already have laws in the European Union that have introduced the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work at an equal workplace’ into legislation in the cross-border provision of services."
"That is a win-win situation in legislation."
"And that principle is now to be undermined."
"Do I understand that rightly, Mr Bolkestein? If Parliament deletes Articles 24 and 25 from the Commission draft, you intend bringing forward a new proposal?"
"That, Mr Bolkestein, no: that, Mr McCreevy – it was a slip of the tongue, but perhaps it was right – means you must undermine the Posted Workers Directive retrospectively!"
"Not if we can help it, Commissioner! What you say shows there was good reason for so many to be on Strasbourg’s streets today."
"– We are vehemently opposed to this proposal for a directive aimed at liberalising services."
"We cannot overlook the fact that this is one of the most important instruments of the so-called Lisbon Strategy – one of its very cornerstones, in fact – aimed at stepping up the liberalisation and privatisation of public services, and at fomenting social dumping and competition between workers to the benefit of economic and financial groups."
"Although pressure from the public, social movements and the workers’ struggles, including today’s demonstration, has led to some fine-tuning of the original wording, the central objective remains in place."
"Rejection of this proposal is therefore crucial if we are to avoid letting this legislation in through the back door."
"In the cause of legal certainty and of the protection of social, labour, environmental and consumer rights, it is vital that this proposal be rejected, and this is the way we shall be voting."
"Madam President, I support the gist of the directive, subject to the restrictions on which the two major groups have agreed."
"In that way, justice is done to the environmental and working standards that apply in the Member States."
"It is important that the directive helps reduce the administrative burden for service providers who are active in other Member States."
"There is every reason to assume that the country of origin principle will disappear, and that is something that I welcome."
"I wonder, though, whether the Council and Commission can guarantee that the Member States can render services conditional on the requirements of medical ethics."
"Drinking water is a topic that is equally problematic and is, for that reason, best kept outside of the directive’s scope."
"The same applies to social care and services."
"The recipients of those services are often not in a position to choose their providers."
"That is why care for people with a disability is liable to suffer."
"The directive is not about the working conditions of temporary staff, for those are provided for in the Temporary Employment Directive."
"Consequently, there is no reason why the directive should not apply to the temporary employment industry."
"The directive must be fleshed out in practice."
"The quality of its enforcement will be decisive in this respect."
"Madam President, for too long Europe has been dominated by the politics of fear: fear of globalisation, of immigration and of a race to the bottom."
"However, in reality, the fear is a fear of change."
"This is as true for Ireland as it is for every Member State."
"In Ireland, such fears have not been grounded on concrete economic analysis but on anecdotal evidence of the negative change that the Services Directive bring."
"It is vital, of course, that workers’ standards and conditions are protected and not undermined; guarantees have to be retained that the progress made on workers’ pay and conditions over the years is not undermined in any way."
"It is vital, therefore, that we support a compromise that ensures the effective control and enforcement of workers’ rights by keeping the original purpose of the directive."
"However, no barriers can protect us from the forces of globalisation."
"Europe needs to take a confident and unified step forward."
"The real danger for Europe is not the danger of a race to the bottom, but relates to the need for Europe to make sure that it is winning the race to stay ahead and that it does not sink to the bottom."
"Gaining a workable consensus on this directive will demonstrate to our citizens that the European Union is committed to, and capable of, competing globally."
"Further economic stagnation of European markets should be avoided."
"Most reforms start off as good intentions but can lose their original purpose in Parliament through amendments."
"We cannot allow a situation to develop in which, as one economist was quoted today as saying, ‘the Services Directive could end up as a good example of “death by Parliament”’."
"It is essential, as Commissioner McCreevy stated, that we deliver a better Services Directive which will unleash the enormous economic potential of the services sector in Europe."
"() Ladies and gentlemen, I am fully in favour of the European Parliament passing the Services Directive for the internal market."
"This includes the key measures of Article 16, which states clearly that service providers are subject only to the national provisions of their Member State."
"I also support the proposal from the Commission contained in Articles 24 and 25, which will greatly ease the movement of workers within the EU market."
"It is only by adopting the Directive in this form that we will establish firm foundations for implementing a single market in the services sector."
"I will now quote from the first agreement between the states of the Union on economic integration, namely the Messina Declaration, which it is now 50 years old."
"The statesmen of the time set themselves the goal of creating a common market and gradually introducing the free movement of labour."
"I quote: ‘The governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands firmly believe that the time has come to take a further step towards a united Europe’."
"They believed that it was necessary to achieve this goal primarily within the economic sphere, and that a united Europe must be created through the development of common institutions, the gradual linking up of national economies, the creation of a common market and the gradual harmonisation of social policies."
"I regard such a programme as essential, if Europe is to retain its position and renew its influence and prestige in the world, while continuing to improve the living standards of its inhabitants."
"Here ends this fifty-year old quotation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I hereby call particularly on those members from the aforementioned states to remain true to the aims of their political forbears and not to abandon the ideal of an open economy."
"To do otherwise would risk unleashing from the bottle the black and red genie of populism and nationalism, the genie that has in the past brought this continent only tyranny and poverty."
"The debate is now suspended and will continue at 9 p.m."
"We come now to Question Time and I would like to thank the Council Presidency representative, Mr Winkler, for being flexible and allowing us to run slightly over time."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0002/2006)."
"I should like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to the new procedure, under Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure, which was already in operation during January’s part-session."
"I should therefore like to ask for the cooperation of the Council and the Members of this House in order to ensure that the maximum number of questions can be discussed and answered."
"According to the new arrangements, there are now two parts to Question Time."
"Answers in part one will be given by Mr Winkler, the Austrian representative on the General Affairs Council, and in part two by the relevant minister, depending on the subject matter under discussion."
"The following questions have been addressed to the Council."
"The European Council meeting in Thessaloniki (20 June 2003) decided that all the countries of the Western Balkans should have the prospect of European integration."
"However, Serbia-Montenegro remained excluded from European proceedings and it was only on 10 October 2005 that Mr Olli Rehn, the Commissioner responsible for enlargement, launched negotiations with a view to a Stability and Association Agreement between the European Union and Serbia-Montenegro."
"Can the Commission say to what this delay is attributable?"
"Will absolutely the same criteria apply to Serbia-Montenegro as to Croatia?"
"Does the Council consider that Serbia's stance in negotiations on the final status of Kosovo will influence the negotiations on the Stability and Association Agreement?"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in answer to Mr Papadimoulis’ question I would like to stress that the same criteria of course apply to all the countries of the Western Balkans."
"The Council has always upheld that principle and it goes without saying that it also applies to Serbia-Montenegro."
"May I remind you that at the November 2000 summit in Zagreb the Heads of State or Government of the EU Member States and the countries of the Western Balkans expressed their commitment to the stabilisation and association process."
"It was made clear that accession to the European Union can only take place if the terms of the Treaty on European Union are observed, the Copenhagen criteria satisfied and progress is made on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"It goes without saying that all countries must satisfy these conditions equally, without any discrimination."
"There is also a commitment to regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations, which are very much essential parts of the stabilisation and association process."
"That commitment was reaffirmed in the Thessaloniki summit statement in 2003, which also noted these countries’ European perspective."
"I would at this point again like to point out that one of the Austrian Presidency’s priorities is to reaffirm that European perspective by focussing on the Balkans during the six months of the Austrian Presidency; the countries of the Western Balkans must have the opportunity of joining the European Union if the conditions for that are satisfied."
"Now so far as Serbia-Montenegro is concerned, that country has enjoyed trade concessions and financial and technical assistance since the year 2000 as part of the stabilisation and association process."
"Since 2001, the European Union has also provided Serbia-Montenegro with political advice through the consultative task force, which was later replaced by the strengthened permanent dialogue in preparation for negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"If progress is to be made in the various stages of the negotiation process, Serbia-Montenegro will have to continue to cooperate very closely and consistently with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia."
"That applies just as much for Serbia-Montenegro as it did for Croatia and as it also applies for all the other countries at issue here."
"The European Commission is also monitoring Serbia-Montenegro’s cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal during the negotiations for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"Should the Commission conclude that cooperation is not unreserved, it can, together with the Council, decide to suspend those negotiations."
"As I have already pointed out, Serbia-Montenegro and all the other countries of the region must of course satisfy the Copenhagen criteria."
"These include political stability, respect for human rights and the ability to meet the particular requirements of the stabilisation and association process."
"The honourable Member also raised the matter of Kosovo."
"I would like to point out that the European Council made clear what the European Union expects of the parties with regard to Kosovo in June 2005."
"It called on both Belgrade and Prishtina not to obstruct the introduction of the necessary standards in Kosovo."
"As you know, negotiations on the status of Kosovo are ongoing."
"Both sides will have to demonstrate their good will in this process, however, if a solution is to be reached that is acceptable to both sides."
"The Council said on that occasion that any solution must be fully consistent with European values and standards and contribute to realising the European perspective for Kosovo and the region."
"It went on to say that the final status of Kosovo must result in greater security and stability in the region and that any unilateral solution or one imposed by force would therefore be unacceptable."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for your reply."
"I noted with particular interest that the Council and the Austrian Presidency will have exactly the same criteria and will demonstrate the same interest for the European prospects of Serbia and Montenegro as for Croatia."
"I should like to ask you, more specifically, exactly how in the Council you link the European prospects of Serbia-Montenegro with discussions on the future of Kosovo."
"Mr President, honourable Member, the talks about Kosovo are currently taking place under the aegis of the United Nations."
"The stabilisation and association process is a process taking place under the auspices of the European Union."
"It would probably be unwise to speculate at this time about what would happen if this or that were to occur."
"Both these processes must continue."
"Ultimately they will have to merge."
"It is of course also clear, whatever status is decided for Kosovo, that Kosovo too must have a European perspective, whatever form it may take."
"We should not allow ourselves to be influenced by the question of status negotiations at this point, but press ahead with the stabilisation and association process for Serbia-Montenegro."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council is undoubtedly aware of the fact that during the bombings at the beginning of the war in Kosovo in March 1999, many thousands of people were abducted and disappeared."
"To this day, 2 500 are still missing, which is causing much suffering in Kosovo."
"Brothers, sisters, parents and children do not know where their relatives are."
"A joint committee composed of Serbs and Croats has been put in place to resolve this matter, but the Serbs are not really pulling their weight."
"Does the President-in-Office share my view that one of the conditions for accession to the European Union should be that something should be done about resolving these human problems, so that it may be known where these people are, whether they are alive or dead, and so that they can be brought back to Kosovo?"
"Mr President, I would like to point out that all questions relating to human rights are of course addressed in the talks and negotiations with Serbia-Montenegro."
"Common European values are of special importance in these negotiations in particular, and the questions the honourable Member has mentioned are also addressed."
"Mr President, in the interests of the stability of the European Union, the fact that Austria is involving itself in South East Europe is very much to be welcomed."
"We now know that there may be a vote on the independence of the territory of Montenegro in April."
"To what extent can or will the European Union’s strategy towards this new state of Montenegro change?"
"What forms of support should the EU then give for the building of a stable country?"
"Mr President, in answer to this question I would like to say that it would probably not be wise at this time to anticipate how the potential outcome of a possible referendum might affect the relationship between Serbia and Montenegro or between a possible new state of Montenegro and the European Union; we do not even know under what conditions such a referendum will be held."
"At all events, the Presidency and the Commission want to see Serbia and Montenegro make the fastest possible progress on integration into European structures."
"That is our aim."
"We cannot at present say how this will be interpreted if the two parts of the existing state are separated."
"However, and this is perhaps the direct answer to your question, we certainly do not want the process of convergence with the European Union to be interrupted, even if Montenegro should become independent."
"We must be prepared for all possibilities."
"For the present, however, the process must be continued coherently and we must be prepared for all eventualities."
"Does the recent criticism of the Court of Justice by Council President Wolfgang Schüssel have the support of the Council as a whole?"
"Does the Council consider that the case law dating from 1985, applying the principle of non-discrimination on the ground of nationality to access to higher education, is illegitimate?"
"If so, why has Council not expressed this view before nor requested the Commission to bring forward proposals to change the legal situation?"
". The institution of the European Court is without question an important part of the European Union."
"No one has ever doubted that and it is certainly not something that the Council has ever discussed as such, because it is beyond question."
"If any politician, and for that matter the Austrian Chancellor, contributes to the debate about the functioning of the European institutions, that certainly does not call into question the institution of the European Court itself."
"We must be permitted to debate and discuss the functioning of the different institutions of the European Union, including the European Court, but, I repeat, that in no way means we are calling the institution itself into question."
"It is also something that the Council, as an institution, has not discussed and I therefore cannot give you an answer on behalf of the Council."
"I believe that it is justified to discuss and think about how the Court and the other institutions function."
"That was a contribution to the debate on the future of Europe."
"Thank you for that answer, but may I remind you that, unlike the United States Supreme Court, which is appointed by the federal institutions of the US, our Court of Justice is actually appointed by the Member States, yet it seems to be Member States themselves that complain about some of its judgments."
"The Court cannot intervene in any issue: it can only deal with disputes that are referred to it."
"I shall finish with the words of a former President of the Court of Justice, who said, ‘the Court does not take political decisions but it does sometimes have to remind politicians of the decisions that they have taken’."
". I take it that this is not really a question that I can answer."
"We certainly accept that the Court is an institution set up, as you have described, by the Member States; and we accept that the Court decides and passes judgment and that the Member States have to accept that judgment."
"That does not mean that one cannot comment on the judgment."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, there was a material background to the Austrian Chancellor’s criticism, namely the fact that there are problems of numbers and financial problems between Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany over access to higher education, similar to those that have arisen between France and Belgium."
"Because of the differences in size, it is hard for the smaller Member State in each case to guarantee everything, financially and organisationally, that completely unrestricted access to higher education would require."
"Does Austria see any answers to the specific problem of access to higher education, and if so, what?"
"Mr President, Austria’s criticism of the European Court of Justice’s judgment on access to higher education, which you mentioned, was in fact concerned essentially with the actual problems that have arisen as a result of the judgment and the – in our view – overly strict application of the ban on discrimination in the area of education policy."
"In that connection, the comment was also made – and that, too, is something that really ought to have been taken into account – that it would have been fully consistent with the tradition of supreme courts to have set transitional periods and not to have stipulated retroactive effect."
"These are all points constituting material comment on this judgment."
"This judgment has in fact interfered with Austrian citizens’ access to many areas of higher education, especially areas that are important for Austria’s supply of, in this particular case, doctors."
"This disruption in what is after all a very important national affair is something that needs to be remedied."
"A solution must be found to ensure that enough doctors are trained every year in Austria – or in Belgium – to meet the country’s needs; that is surely a legitimate request."
"Ideas have been put forward to overcome and remove this problem."
"One of them, which must ultimately be decided by the European Parliament because it will have to be in the form of a law, is to set a quota for the study of medicine – dentistry and human medicine – that will be based not on nationality but on possession of the Austrian school-leaving certificate that guarantees access to higher education."
"This will ensure that the number of medical students, of doctors, that Austria needs for its health service nationally is safeguarded."
"We believe this solution is compatible with European law and also with the judgment of the European Court of Justice, which after all itself found that the only failing was that this disruption was not numerically documented."
"One year on, this documentation is now available."
"I believe that this solution, which is very similar to that between Belgium and France, will also stand up to scrutiny in the light of European law."
"I believe we are on the right way to a good solution here."
"Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy is a priority objective for the Council, the Commission, Parliament and ultimately also for the European public up until 2010."
"What role do you believe education policy and the question of access to higher education have to play in the Lisbon Strategy?"
"Like the European Parliament and the Commission, the Council rates the potential of education very highly for achieving the Lisbon Strategy’s objectives."
"It has a very important contribution to make and is certainly also one of the things on which we need to concentrate if we want to achieve the objectives that the Lisbon Strategy has set for itself."
"As well as approving the new integrated guidelines for growth and employment, which comprise the broad guidelines for economic policies and the employment guidelines, we believe it is also important to give some thought to the mutual compatibility of the Lisbon Strategy and the Bologna Process in the ongoing debate about the future of the European Union and its institutions."
"The Bologna Process, which will involve the establishment of a European area of higher education by 2010, is of great importance for our young people in particular."
"The reason for this is probably that the rules governing access to higher education are caught between the rights of the EU’s citizens in the internal market on the one hand and the strict observance of Member State responsibility for course contents and the shaping of the education system, which is anchored in the EC Treaty, on the other."
"This tension exists in other areas of the Lisbon Strategy as well, where national competences confront European objectives and solutions have to be found that do justice to both principles."
"It is particularly great in education."
"That is why it is important that we find common solutions in this area in particular, because we shall not be able to achieve the Lisbon Strategy’s objectives without improving access to education."
"In the Joint Statement with the European Union during the EU-Russia Summit in Rome on 6 November 2003, Russia took the responsibility of quickly concluding border agreements, which at that time were still unfinished, with Estonia and Latvia, thus precluding any questioning of its State borders with the enlarging Union."
"Nevertheless, in 2005 the Russian Government announced that it ‘does not intend to endorse’ two already finalised border treaties with Estonia, just signed by both sides and ratified by the Estonian Parliament."
"Thus Moscow unprecedentedly withdrew the signature of the Russian Government and recently urged Estonia to go back and reopen over 10 years of negotiations."
"The position of both the Council and the Commission remains unclear, even if Russia’s provocation is jeopardising the credibility of the entire Union in the eyes of the new Member States. One more possible task of it is to get a new frozen conflict, this time with the EU on a common border."
"Is it acceptable for the EU leadership to remain on the sidelines in the role of an indifferent observer?"
"Is it right for the Council to refuse to take sides in a dispute on behalf of the EU?"
"Mr President, Mr Landsbergis, I can only agree with you."
"The Council fully shares your concern – and the concern of many – about Russia’s continuing reluctance to sign and ratify the border agreements with Estonia and Latvia."
"I cannot agree with you on another point, however."
"The European Union is by no means an indifferent observer, as you put it, but is regularly and quite clearly voicing this concern in talks with Russia, most recently at the Troika meeting of the foreign ministers of the European Union and Russia in November 2005."
"It will continue to do so for as long as is necessary."
"If I remember rightly, there is another Troika meeting between Russia and the European Union tomorrow, at which this matter will no doubt also be raised."
"The situation with the EU-Russia border in Estonia will become a real challenge for European solidarity if Estonia is left alone under Russia’s pressure and mockery."
"Therefore, what is the general message of the Council?"
"Is the Council in favour of a clear solidarity, or of a misty gas diplomacy and a situation without responses?"
"Professor Landsbergis, I can only answer this question with a clear 'yes': of course the European Union shows solidarity with a Member State."
"There is no doubt about that, and there can be no other considerations that would take away from this solidarity."
"Mr President, the Russian side repeatedly complains that the Baltic States are not meeting their obligations, especially so far as the Russian minorities in those States are concerned."
"There have been difficulties, especially in Latvia, over the question of naturalisation and the full restoration of civil rights for the Russian minority."
"What does the Council intend to do with regard to these Member States?"
"Or how do you see this problem?"
"Mr President, in its dialogue with Russia the Council regularly points out that, as Member States of the European Union, the Baltic States have of course satisfied the Copenhagen criteria and that the treatment of the Russian minority is therefore also consistent with the relevant standards of international law, especially the Council of Europe and OSCE recommendations, and that the way to naturalisation and obtaining full civil rights is open to the Russian minority."
"The Council is therefore perfectly plain in underlining that the rights of the minorities are respected and that the European Union is also making great efforts in practice to combat every kind of discrimination in the Member States."
"Such discrimination is not in accord with the relevant rules or the Copenhagen criteria."
"It goes without saying that every Member State of the European Union is required to abide by those rules."
"Mr President, I would just like to ask whether the Council is aware that the Baltic States’ problems arose because the Baltic States were occupied for decades under the Hitler-Stalin Pact in violation of international law."
"Today they form the border between Russia and the European Union."
"Does the Council believe that recognition of that border should be made dependent on any conditions, or is it not rather up to Russia to recognise this border with the European Union as a precondition for good and fruitful relations?"
"Mr President, of course the recognition of borders cannot be made dependent on conditions, let me make that absolutely clear."
"Let me tell you something from my own experience, Mr Posselt."
"I was Austria’s Permanent Representative to the Council of Europe when Russia and also the Baltic States were admitted."
"Of course I am aware of how this situation came about historically."
"We must be clear that it is the result of a historical development."
"The important thing is that, as Members of the European Union, the Baltic States should satisfy the relevant provisions, norms and rules of international law, of the Council of Europe and the OSCE in particular."
"Because the standards which, thank God, we have in the Europe of the Council of Europe, but especially also in the Europe of the European Union, are actually higher than in international law in general."
"We can be proud of that."
"The Council also feels obliged to comply with these stricter rules and standards."
"On 21 December 2005, the Council adopted conclusions on improving openness and transparency in the Council."
"Point 4 of these conclusions provides that 'the vote on all legislative acts adopted under the codecision procedure is taken in public' and that 'the outcome of the vote is displayed visibly on the television screen relaying the vote to the public'."
"Can the Council confirm that from the information provided, it will be possible to ascertain the voting position of each and every delegation in Council in these votes and that a public record of these votes and the positions taken by each and every delegation will be later available on the Internet?"
"Mr President, I can answer Mr De Rossa’s question about public voting in the Council as follows."
"As the Federal Chancellor said in his speech about the Austrian Presidency last month, transparency is something the Austrian Presidency wants."
"So far as possible and insofar as the rules allow, we want to achieve the greatest possible transparency between the institutions."
"While we must be clear about the fact that this does have its limits, the Presidency will gladly do what it can in the five months that still remain to us, and we are also talking to the Finnish Presidency about it."
"The position at present is as follows."
"If the Council is acting as legislator, the outcome of the vote, the Council Members’ explanations of vote and the statements entered in the Council minutes are published."
"Information on how the delegations have voted is published and is accessible on the Council’s website."
"The site also provides information about the legislative acts finally adopted by the Council in a given month and the monthly list of the Council’s legislative acts."
"That list also shows any votes against or abstentions, explanations of vote and the voting rules."
"We are endeavouring to make further improvements."
"The Council Secretariat is currently taking steps to also post on the Council’s website the outcomes of Council votes on legislative proposals accepted under the codecision procedure, where the public will be able to view them."
"Finally, I would also like to point out that when a legislative act has finally been adopted the General Secretariat makes available to the public, without restriction, all documents already produced in connection with that act to which no exceptional rules apply."
"We in the Presidency want to try to ensure that the restrictions that exist and are laid down are applied as little as possible."
"Thank you for your reply and for your commitment to transparency."
"Can I ask you specifically whether the debate on the services directive in the Council over the next couple of months will be open to the public, and whether the decisions made by the Member States individually will be available to the public?"
"If not, why not, bearing in mind that this is one of the most controversial issues to be debated by the European Union in many a long day and one in which there is huge public interest?"
"If we are serious about bringing Europe closer to the public, to Europe’s citizens, then this is the kind of debate we need to make public in the Council."
". I confirm that we are unquestionably committed to bringing the European Union closer to its citizens."
"We will act in relation to the services directive in the same way as in all codecision procedures – there are very clear rules – which means that at the beginning and end of the procedure there is an open debate."
"Whether there is any readiness on the part of Member States to go beyond what is in the rules is something that I cannot answer at this stage, but we will certainly abide by the rules, as far as the services directive is concerned."
"The rules already open up certain segments of the procedure to the public, and that would apply to the services directive as it would to any other."
"The results of the vote, the explanations of vote, the statements entered in the minutes, are all made public."
"I agree with the honourable Member that we are not as far on as we would like to be."
"The process was set in motion by the December agreement."
"The Austrian Presidency is now in the process of implementing it, and is trying to go beyond that – together with our Finnish friends, because it will be a long process."
"We are trying to make the rules more transparent, but it will take a certain time."
"I welcome this excellent initiative taken under the British Presidency. However, I ask whether the Council agrees that the principle that it should legislate in public should logically be applied to all legislation and not just to codecision legislation?"
"Will the Council consider in due course extending this decision, so that all legislation is enacted in public?"
"Arguably, it is even more important that, when legislation that does not necessarily need the approval of this House is enacted by the Council, it is enacted as transparently as possible."
". I confirm that this is a goal that one should have, but I am not sure that it is achievable at this stage."
"As I say, it is a long-term process and it will take some time."
"At this stage, we should be content to take as many steps as we can, to work further on what we already have, to interpret the rules more extensively and to try – if not in our Presidency then in the next one – to change the Rules of Procedure once again to achieve even more transparency."
"This is the goal, but it is something that will take some time."
"I am sorry if I repeat myself, but this is what it is."
"Would the President-in-Office agree that, if any other legislature in the European Union took decisions and then issued its minutes and some notes about what discussions had gone on and offered to put the information on an Internet site, people would think there was something very undemocratic and shady about it?"
"Is it not time once and for all for the Council of Ministers to meet in public on all these matters when it acts as legislator?"
"I appreciate the progress that has been made, but it is totally unacceptable in the 21st century that legislation continues to be made in this way."
". I am afraid that I cannot add much to what I have already said."
"The long-term goal must be more transparency."
"There is no doubt about that and the Austrian Presidency certainly shares that goal."
"However, there are rules that need to be changed; there are procedures that we need to adapt and we can only work with our eyes on that goal."
"I certainly agree with all the honourable Members who have spoken that we need to get closer to the public and help them understand better what is going on in the European Union and in all its institutions."
"In its resolution of 18 January 2006, Parliament clearly underlined that its priorities for the new financial perspective 2007-2013 are prosperity, competitiveness, solidarity, cohesion and security."
"Cohesion is important not only to the new EU Member States, but to the old ones, i.e. Spain, Portugal, Greece and others."
"Parliament rejected the Council's conclusions of 15-16 December 2005 and expressed its willingness to enter into constructive negotiations with the Council on the basis of the respective positions provided when the Austrian Presidency is entrusted with a real negotiating mandate."
"Has the Council agreed upon the mandate?"
"Does the Council share Parliament's position that cohesion should remain a priority during 2007-2013 along with competitiveness, security and prosperity?"
"Mr President, in answer to Mrs Andrikiené’s question, I can only say at this stage that the Council’s position on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 is of course the position agreed at the European Council meeting of 15-16 December 2005."
"The European Council has stressed that the objective of economic and social cohesion must continue to be at the centre of the European Union’s policy for the duration of the next Financial Perspective."
"This is also reflected in the fact that the European Council has agreed to devote more than 35% of total budget resources for the period 2007-2013 to this area of policy."
"The truth is that time is running out, and both budgetary authorities of the European Union – the Council and Parliament – are aware that in order to achieve an agreement in time they have to enter into constructive negotiations without delay."
"When will the Council be ready to enter into constructive negotiations with Parliament?"
"When will the Council have a mandate?"
"What are the priorities of the Presidency in the negotiations on the new financial perspective?"
". Let me assure the honourable Member that we are engaged in constructive negotiations."
"It is in our interests; it is in the interests of the Council as much as it is in the interests of the European Parliament that these negotiations are brought to a fruitful conclusion."
"In order to be credible, the European Union as a whole must act swiftly and constructively."
"The Council is prepared to act as swiftly and as constructively as possible."
"I can assure you that already, at the traditional meeting of the Commission with the members of the Austrian Government on 19 January, it was agreed between the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Schüssel, that the Commission proposals should be submitted as soon as possible and that the Council would negotiate as swiftly as possible and in good faith."
"According to the agreement between the three institutions, we are hoping for and working towards a conclusion of the negotiations on the interinstitutional agreement in April."
"I cannot be more precise."
"However, that is a credible goal which we hope to achieve."
"I can assure the honourable Member that we are working very hard to achieve that."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, the question of course still remains. Has the Austrian Presidency already received a specific mandate from the Council to enter into these negotiations?"
"If not, at what level and with what end in view can the talks at the level of the Permanent Representatives Committee II take place in the time until a mandate is given?"
"Mr President, I can answer Mr Rack’s question by pointing out that according to the Presidency’s work plan the trialogue meetings will be prepared by the Permanent Representatives Committee II."
"All that is already under way."
"I can assure you – because I know from my own experience – that they are working hard on it."
"You will understand, however, that I cannot at this present time comment on the precise state of the necessary clarifications between Council and Commission, wherever the dossier is at this stage."
"That would be to prejudice the negotiations."
"I would like to repeat once again, and emphatically so, that we will of course do all that we can, in the Council’s own interests and also in the European Parliament’s interests, to see that these negotiations are begun, continued and brought to a good conclusion as quickly as possible."
"We owe that to Europe’s citizens."
"The European Union’s credibility will also depend on how quickly and how well we come to an agreement on this matter."
"Mr President, Minister, we all know what great efforts the Austrian Presidency is making to bring the new Financial Perspective to a conclusion."
"My question is therefore: Is the Council still convinced that the common agricultural policy and the policy for rural areas are making an essential contribution to achieving the Gothenburg and Lisbon objectives, and does the Council still consider ensuring the necessary resources are available, in the Financial Perspective in particular, to be a priority?"
"Mr President, honourable Member, I have already mentioned, and I repeat, because this is the Council’s position: we stand on the ground of the agreement that was reached in December."
"That is the framework in which we are moving, and the priorities that follow from that will now have to be set in the negotiations."
"Of course we are committed to the objectives you have mentioned and will continue to be so."
"As they deal with the same issue, the following questions will be taken together and the answer will be given by Mr Martin Bartenstein, representing the Council."
"How does the Council view the EU’s chronic dependence on energy from Russia and the Gulf countries, and what, in its opinion, is the potential for reducing this dependence via the systematic promotion of renewable raw materials and alternative energy sources?"
"To what extent is the Council concerned about Europe's fuel security?"
"Mr President, in answer to both these questions I can say that security of energy supplies, together with competitiveness and sustainability – they are, after all, the three relevant pillars – has for years been one of the main concerns of European energy policy."
"This is also true of the new energy policy for Europe that is now being developed."
"The gas dispute in particular, the price dispute of the last few weeks and months, has made clear that consideration must also be given to the concerns of our neighbours and international partners."
"The European Union maintains close ties both with energy producers like Russia and OPEC and with important users like China and India. In this connection, I would also like to remind you of international arrangements like the Energy Charter Treaty and the South East Europe Energy Community."
"Diversification of energy sources, the promotion of domestic energy sources, renewables in particular, and energy efficiency are important aspects of the security of energy supply."
"The great importance of investment in both infrastructure and exploration should also be stressed. Transeuropean energy networks are also part of both these aspects."
"A host of instruments have therefore been adopted in the European Union in different fields."
"On security of supply, particular mention should be made of EC Council Directive 2004/67 of 26 April 2004 concerning measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply, on diversification of energy sources the directive from 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources, which aims to see 22% of the Community’s electricity generated from renewable sources by 2010, and the 2003 directive on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport."
"I should also mention the December 2005 proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on energy end-use efficiency and energy services, which is expected to be adopted in the next few months."
"Neither should we forget the Sixth Research and Development Framework Programme and in particular the ‘Intelligent Energy for Europe’ Programme, which seeks, among other things, to promote new and renewable energy sources at local and regional level and in developing countries."
"The Council is also showing the importance it attaches to renewable energy sources in the non-legislative domain."
"In their contribution to the Spring European Council in March 2005, the energy ministers support giving priority to a strategy for renewable energy sources beyond the year 2010."
"Energy policy and the security of energy supplies in particular will also appear on the agenda – no doubt prominently – for the Council’s next meeting in the spring."
"Two further areas on which the Presidency will be focusing are the Biomass Action Plan and the proposed Energy Efficiency Action Plan."
"In its contribution to the international action plan of the June 2004 International Conference for Renewable Energies in Bonn, the Council noted that EU energy policy should aim to increase the use of renewable energy sources significantly and that increased use of renewable energy, improved energy efficiency and sustainable energy use will also contribute to security of supply as complementary areas of policy."
"At its meeting on 29 November 2004, the Council adopted conclusions on renewable energies which highlighted the importance of making renewable energies more competitive by reducing production costs, among other things."
"All these instruments and measures are a solid basis for the short, medium and long-term security of energy supplies in the European Union, which have also proved their worth in actions of solidarity in connection with the consequences of the disastrous weather events of last year."
"Mr President, as a Munich Member with a Styrian mother, I am pleased to observe the progressive policy Austria is pursuing in the area of biomass."
"My question relates to that."
"What are you doing to introduce this very progressive policy increasingly into the Council of the European Union, and how in particular do you rate the importance of biomass, not only for motor fuel but also in particular for heating?"
"Mr President, as an Austrian and a Styrian, but the son of a German mother, honourable Member, I am pleased to hear this agreement in your supplementary question."
"I am sure that renewable energy sources – biomass in particular, of course, but not only biomass – will have greater market opportunities in the months and years ahead, because the price of oil is not going to fall to 10 or 20 dollars a barrel again; that will be a good thing, because it will be an opportunity to increase Europe’s independence."
"We should not deceive ourselves, however: it may make it possible to reduce the rate of increase in dependence on fossil fuels, but only the rate of increase, not the rate of dependence."
"At the same time, that will mean additional sources of income for many rural areas and for many people, farmers in particular, not only from producing food, but also from producing energy plants."
"In the long term, biomass and renewable resources could in fact be the source not only of carbon but also, indirectly, of hydrocarbons, which could then be used to run private cars."
"I believe the way forward for power stations and the like may lie in a different direction in the long term, but that fossil fuels in particular, which are used almost exclusively in transport today, can gradually be replaced by renewables and hydrocarbons from that source."
"I repeat, the chances for that are better, it is easier to make renewable resources, renewable energy sources, a marketable proposition if the market price of a barrel of crude oil is around 60 dollars or a kilowatt of electricity costs two and a half times as much today as even two years ago."
"One megawatt-hour costs 50 euros today; I can still remember when it was 20 euros."
"The President-in-Office said that a host of instruments are available, but despite that, the EU-25 import dependency for energy, which was 48% in 2002, is projected to rise to 71% by 2030."
"The EU-15 is dependent on Middle East countries for 31% of oil imports, on Russia for 30% of gas imports and 28% of oil imports, and on Algeria for 22% of gas imports."
"Given the steps taken by Russia recently and the vulnerability of some Member States to Russian petulance, would the President-in-Office not agree that the essential element of maintaining security of supply lies in the complete liberalisation of the energy market in the European Union, and will he take steps to bring that about?"
"Mr President, honourable Member, what Europe needs is a coherent energy policy, an energy policy that is geared more to our common interests."
"We must learn the lessons, on the one hand those from the realm of climate protection, on the other those from the marked rise in the prices of fossil fuels – due not only but mainly to a shortage of refinery capacity, plus hurricanes, plus geopolitical difficulties – and also the lessons from 1 and 2 January this year when, for whatever reasons, the quantity of Russian natural gas flowing to Europe through Ukrainian pipelines was greatly reduced."
"Those are three reasons why we should rethink our position."
"Once again: we must expect Europe’s dependence on imports, especially of fossil fuels, to increase over the next few years, probably decades."
"However, that should and must not stop us looking increasingly to renewable energy sources of our own and in the end also tightening the screw of energy efficiency."
"That is where I agree with the Commission when it says it is already hard enough to get the Member States to commit to 1% a year; we shall see whether a 2% a year commitment is possible in future."
"There are still things we can all do in energy efficiency and we can improve things there; the new Member States normally have greater potential in this area."
"Their efficiency in terms of gross domestic product per unit of energy consumed is much lower than in the countries of the EU 15, where they began to break the link between energy consumption, gross domestic product and growth back in the 1970s as a result of the 1973 and 1974 oil shocks."
"We need a coherent energy policy that does not overlook any of the possibilities already mentioned: renewable energy sources, increased energy efficiency, but at the same time also diversification in fossil fuels, that is in gas, and of course also diversification in pipelines."
"The basic problem was not the shortage of gas, the basic problem on 1 and 2 January was that there is only one pipeline through Ukraine supplying a lot of European countries and that 80% of all the gas coming from Russia to Europe flows through that pipeline."
"It is certainly sensible for contracts to be concluded between the companies in Germany and Russia."
"It is certainly very important that the European Parliament and the European Commission should also support the Nabucco gas pipeline project that could bring some 12 billion cubic metres of gas a year to Central Europe from the Caspian Sea via Turkey from 2011 and around 30 billion cubic metres of gas a year from 2020."
"In the matter of gas, however, we should not forget liquefied natural gas, either; apart from a few southern Member States, Europe has not set much store by it up until now."
"We need that as well if we are to reduce our dependence."
"I also very much welcome the announcements made by Russia and its finance minister at a recent G8 summit in Moscow that they are going to reconsider or abolish Gazprom’s export monopoly."
"Unfortunately, they did not say when that would happen, but there was the announcement at least."
"Cooperation with Gazprom has stood the test of time, it is true, but this means that we will also be able to speak, negotiate and work with other Russian partners some time in the future."
"As I see it, the route Europe has taken so far in liberalising and deregulating the energy sector has been important and correct."
"It, too, has helped to stabilise prices in particular, but in the next few years we shall have to walk a tightrope between greater security of supply – and ultimately also giving investors the security of recovering their investments through long-term contracts – and nevertheless creating more of a European internal market in energy, also integrating South East Europe, Ukraine too, and perhaps even Russia."
"If we cannot do that through the Energy Charter, then perhaps it will be possible through the Energy Community, and that is a concrete proposal that the Commission will probably be presenting in the next few weeks."
"We must take all these approaches."
"Energy policy is top priority, and the last few months have shown us just how important it is."
"Mr President, Mr Bartenstein, energy dependence is priority number one. The security of the energy supply will be keeping us very busy in future."
"Will the Energy Council give its attention to the Kyoto Protocol and with the period post-2012, and to the impact that joint implementation will have in this domain?"
"Will it be a focus for investment in Europe, and what is the most efficient way of achieving the overall CO2 reduction target?"
"Mr President, Mr Rübig, with regard to the Kyoto Protocol and climate protection, I can inform Parliament that, when asked at the World Economic Forum in Davos what he saw as the world's priorities over the coming years, the former US President Bill Clinton said that the top priority was climate protection."
"That might now sound rather audacious coming from an American, but it was the former US President who said it, and he did sign the Kyoto Protocol."
"As we know, though, Congress then did not ratify it."
"I fully agree with you and with many others that climate protection is a top priority."
"It is a necessity, because the global climate is under threat."
"However, we in Europe need to bear in mind that we are currently responsible for around 14% of global CO2 emissions, and by 2050 the figure will be about 10%."
"In other words, currently around 86% and in future 90% of CO2 emissions come from elsewhere."
"It makes a big difference whether we in the European Union are going it pretty much alone or whether we at least have our partners in the USA – who are of course our competitors as well – on board."
"That is not foreseeable at the moment, though."
"Another question, of course, is how we should deal with countries such as China and India, which have no obligations under the Kyoto Protocol."
"I expect that these countries will say – and this is quite understandable: 'you Europeans generate around 10 tonnes of CO2 per capita, the Americans around 20 tonnes, and we produce between one and two tonnes."
"Getting China, India and other developing and emerging economies on board as soon as possible and convincing them of our arguments is a very sensitive issue."
"We in Europe should go a step further, but at the same time we need to bear our competitiveness in mind and protect the climate as cost-effectively as possible."
"Joint implementation is very valuable in that connection."
"If we can invest in European countries, for example in the new Member States, and thus reduce CO2 emissions for less investment than would be possible in, for example, the EU-15 Member States, then we should go down that route, and this is laid down in the Kyoto Protocol."
"That in turn means that climate protection is of the utmost significance. At the same time, however, we are also aware that energy prices have an effect on competitiveness and thus on employment."
"We are going in the right direction, and in the next few months we will find out how the second post-Kyoto phase will be implemented in the EU Member States and what the national allocation plans will look like."
"Trading in CO2 certificates has made a good start, and the prices are considerably higher than we expected – at one point there was talk of EUR 10 per tonne, and the most recent listing, as far as I know, was EUR 28, which is almost three times as much."
"If we are now going to tell European industry that it will be allocated less than in the past, then we will have to find some good arguments."
"In the interests of employment in good old Europe, I would quite clearly advocate that we tread very, very carefully and softly when it comes to our energy-intensive economy and industry."
"With respect to the future of Kyoto, I am very much in favour of making progress and of an offensive approach, but this approach must not put any jobs at risk of being relocated from Europe to countries that still pay no attention at all to climate protection."
"Mr President, Mr Bartenstein, in the very first days of your term as President-in-Office of the Council you had to deal with the difficult problem with Russia and Ukraine."
"Initially, the problem was not that the gas was being cut off, but simply that Russia was demanding a much higher price for its natural gas."
"Does the Austrian Presidency now plan to tackle this vulnerability to energy prices, which affects not only Ukraine but also, of course, the European economy?"
"We all know that a massive increase in energy prices would trigger high inflation and could considerably slow economic growth or even result in recession."
"What do you intend to do with regard to the vulnerability of the European economy to energy prices?"
". Mr President, thankfully our economy and our gross domestic product are much less sensitive to fluctuations in energy prices than they were in 1973/74."
"The OECD and the European Commission both estimate that this vulnerability, this sensitivity has reduced by about half, precisely because our management and production are now much more energy-efficient."
"However, that does not of course mean that, even today, we can easily cope with an increase in the oil price from USD 30 to USD 60 just like that; and there are voices – which I hope will never be proved right – predicting three-figure prices in the near future."
"With respect to gas, it must be said, to be fair to our Russian friends, that their intention was to get Ukraine to pay the world market price, although the world market price is a relative term, so it would be better to say the standard price in Europe, of about USD 220 per thousand cubic metres."
"This was ultimately agreed in the night from 3 to 4 January in the negotiations between Gazprom and Ukraine."
"The compromise provides – and the contracts have now been drawn up and signed – that a mixture will be produced of Russian gas at about USD 220 and much cheaper gas from Central Asia, and Ukraine will pay about USD 95 for that mixture."
"With regard to world market prices and European gas prices, you should be aware that the US buys its gas at a much higher price than we do in Europe."
"We obviously do not yet have a standard world market price – the differences for gas are considerably greater than they are for oil."
"That, in turn, is an argument in favour of a more long-term approach to energy policy and in favour of increased partnership."
"This dialogue between the European Union and Russia on one side, and OPEC on the other, must be continued and strengthened."
"A greater degree of transparency is desirable in this connection, to build trust in both groups of partners."
"I would also very much recommend that we pay greater attention not only to working with the energy producers, but also to establishing dialogue with consumers."
"It is important for us in Europe to reach agreements with Japan, the US, and similarly with other consumers, to achieve a goal for which the oil-producing countries are also aiming: stable long-term prices."
"It is quite incorrect to believe that it is in the primary interest of the OPEC countries to reach a price of USD 100 as soon as possible."
"They are well aware, firstly, that it would not last long and that market mechanisms could then reduce the price to a relatively low level."
"They are also well aware that the functioning of our economy, and continual growth, are ultimately important for their oil and gas sales, too."
"There is therefore a common interest in creating stable, reliable energy markets and guaranteeing secure supplies and stable prices. We will be able to make good progress in this over the coming months."
"The Green Paper that the Commission is currently discussing is not yet officially referred to as such, but in practice it is one."
"It will in future be a guiding principle for us."
"As the author is not present, Question no 8 lapses."
"Does the Austrian Presidency intend to revert to the Commission proposal for a directive on the portability of additional occupation pensions? What would its approach be?"
"Mr President, as this is the first time I have taken questions from the European Parliament, I am still rooted in the traditions of my own parliament, where questions are always repeated."
"I am sure I will learn the ropes by the end of the Presidency: after all, we still have another four and a half months to go."
"Supplementary occupational pensions are an important subject, including in connection with our concept of 'flexicurity' – flexibility through security."
"The Council has already started examining the proposal submitted by the Commission at the end of October 2005 for a directive on improving the portability of supplementary pension rights."
"By the end of February, the preparatory body responsible for examining the matter, in other words the Council Working Party on Social Questions, will have discussed the proposal in six meetings."
"The Austrian Presidency has included the proposal in its draft agendas for the Council's meeting. In view of the fact that the matter is very technically complex, however, we still need to examine how far this work will have got by the time the Council meets in June."
"I will not hide the fact that, quite apart from the general complexity, there are still some key questions that need to be answered, but in principle I believe that it will make, and must make, a very important contribution to improving the mobility of employees in Europe."
"Mr Bartenstein, I can reassure you that you have nothing to learn, because you are already much better than many of your predecessors straight out of the starting blocks."
"I would like to expand on what you have said by saying that the point is that, when it comes to occupational pensions, we obviously also have to deal with the differences in competences and in tax systems. The differences in competences in the Member States have led to major barriers to mobility."
"Do you think that we need European minimum standards in this field, a common cost base for European products and a more comprehensive European pensions debate, whilst safeguarding national competences?"
". Mr President, Mr Karas, this proposal for a directive certainly is a step in the direction we want and have to take."
"Anybody who wants employees to have mobility across European borders must make it possible for them to take their supplementary pension rights with them without too much difficulty."
"On the other hand, it is quite clear to see that, when it comes to social security, each country has its own traditions and therefore that any attempt at harmonisation would be doomed to failure. We do not want that; where social security is concerned, one size certainly does not fit all."
"This is therefore certainly an issue in areas where it is sensible and appropriate to establish minimum standards. In the field of pension rights, we should not forget that most European countries use a contributory system as the basis for state support."
"At the same time, we know that it would be appropriate to supplement this contribution-based system in part by one based on capital, including in the state sector."
"In addition, as part of this opportunity – we must of course also take account of the incomes of European employees and savers – we should of course also encourage private and occupational pension provision."
"I am working on the assumption that the Member States will, and should, retain their decision-making authority and competence over the relatively long term, but that we should also establish – in particular through this directive – ways to make it easier for European employees with pension funds to transfer their pension rights throughout Europe, which the introduction of minimum standards would of course make considerably easier."
"Mr President, Mr Bartenstein, I share your view that the possibility of transferring supplementary occupational pensions undoubtedly increases mobility."
"Any measure that increases mobility at the same time increases job security."
"I am quite sure that, as part of your Presidency, you are planning further measures to increase mobility and thus job security."
"Which of these mobility-increasing measures will you be proposing to the other Member States in the course of your Presidency?"
"Mr President, we know that the citizens of Europe have less mobility than citizens elsewhere."
"Many of the available statistics show that mobility is twice as high in the USA as in Europe."
"Of course, we cannot remove Europe's linguistic barriers overnight – and perhaps we do not want to do so – nor can we institute the federal principles applied in the USA just like that."
"Nevertheless, in general it gives our young people an opportunity to increase their mobility and opens up to them a European market in interesting jobs and career opportunities."
"With these qualifications, as we certainly do not want to adopt the American situation here overnight, more mobility for employees and young people is a goal of ours."
"Improving workers' mobility involves taking measures, step by step."
"With regard to this specific directive, I can tell you that the Commission has declared 2006 to be the European Year of Workers' Mobility, that there will be a job portal, EURES, an improved version of which is going to be presented at a meeting in the next few days, namely on 20/21 February in Brussels, where the starting pistol will officially be fired."
"I myself will have the honour of taking part, and Commission President Mr Barroso, Commissioner Špidla and the President of the European Parliament have also agreed to be there."
"This meeting will include discussion of the topic of 'mobility, a tool for more and better jobs', and this discussion will continue in workshops."
"We do not just want the directive on the portability of supplementary pension rights – what we want is a general mainstream."
"It is also important that a best practice process should be initiated between the authorities, trade unions and the private sector, and we also want to broaden the knowledge base."
"This therefore forms an important part of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The European Year of Workers' Mobility is just starting; the final conference will take place in November under the Finnish Presidency."
"However, I think it is a good thing that there are already plans to follow up on this first European Year of Mobility."
"Mr President, Mr Bartenstein, I am sure we are all aware that mobility is particularly high among academics and young people who have enjoyed a university education, but what specific plans does the Presidency now have for apprentices and people with lower levels of education?"
"What can we do to increase their mobility?"
". Mr President, I think that all people in Europe, of whatever educational level – and in the German-speaking countries this includes a large number of apprentices undergoing vocational training – should have the same opportunities that perhaps used to be restricted to people with tertiary, academic educations."
"I know that there are best practice examples in Austria of apprentices in training having the opportunity to spend time abroad."
"I think it is absolutely essential – with the greatest respect for all the language regimes we operate in Europe – that we primarily give our young people knowledge of English as the language of mobility."
"I hope I will not now be deluged with protests from Paris or elsewhere."
"If we want to give Europe's young people career opportunities throughout Europe, we must naturally also be prepared to set up programmes during training and to grant subsidies, so that young people can have a first taste of this mobility in the context of such programmes, leading to them being able to get jobs in other European countries later in their careers."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"We shall now resume the debate on the report by Mrs Evelyne Gebhardt on services in the internal market."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, as a new Member of the European Parliament, I should like to say that, having attended these debates for 18 months now, I have discovered the richness and the quality of the work done in this Chamber."
"I should like to pay tribute to our Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, to its late chairman, Mr Whitehead, to its rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt and to the draftsman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Van Lancker."
"I should like to thank those at the helm of our group, to whose work we owe the draft we are debating today: Mr Harbour, the shadow rapporteur and coordinator of our group;"
"I should also like to pay tribute to the work of Mrs Descamps and of Mrs Bachelot, who are both members of the French delegation."
"Thanks to all these men and women, we have made a significant breakthrough: the compromise is a new text."
"First and foremost, it establishes the internal market in services."
"This draft takes away from the Court of Justice the de facto monopoly it has been exercising for the past 50 years with regard to implementing the principles of the Treaties."
"The internal market in services is based on mutual confidence and entails administrative cooperation, the simplification of administrative procedures and the abolition of protectionist obstacles, in terms both of the setting up of service companies and of the temporary provision of services."
"The draft applies to services of general economic interest only where the freedom of establishment is concerned, while it excludes many essential services such as audiovisual services and the cinema, gambling activities, health care and the legal professions."
"The compromise therefore proposes that Parliament vote in favour of a framework act geared towards economic growth, innovation and employment. That is what the nations of Europe want."
"Yet the compromise also respects our model and our national collective preferences."
"Will the directive lead to the dismantling of our social standards?"
"Will it cause a levelling down effect?"
"With the Commission’s first proposal, the risk was plain to see."
"That is why we rejected it."
"The compromise proposed to you, however, constitutes a barrier to social dumping, is based on subsidiarity and adopts a sensible and restrictive approach to implementing the freedom to provide services."
"It is made absolutely clear that the compromise excludes social standards and labour law."
"Competition in the social sphere is prohibited."
"Many national rules are respected where freedom of establishment is concerned, and the freedom to provide services is accompanied by the guarantee that Member States can apply their national rules when doing so is justified by the public interest."
"This is a true compromise: it is the subject of criticism from both sides, which clearly shows that we have found a happy medium."
"On behalf of my French colleagues, I therefore hope that you will support the compromise by voting in favour of it by a very large majority."
"Doing so would be a victory for the European Parliament and it would be a victory for the European Union."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Winkler, it is one thing to complete the internal market, which is an objective that we share."
"Yet, it is quite another thing to dismantle the European social model, which is a move that we strongly oppose."
"We strongly oppose it because it runs counter to the interests of the citizens and to the interests of workers and of European consumers, but also because it jeopardises citizens’ support for the European project."
"The initial draft Bolkestein Directive was overwhelmingly rejected because it was seemingly designed to make the completion of the internal market dependent on the reduction of social rights and on the reduction of environmental standards and of the protection of those consumers who had attained a higher level of protection in some Member States than in others."
"By seeking to base the internal market no longer on competition between businesses, but on competition between the social systems of the various Member States, the Bolkestein proposal has made it seem as though it is playing the Member States’ interests off against one other."
"It has created a suspicious atmosphere between old and new Member States, running counter to the European Commission’s task, which is to unite all Europeans around a common project."
"By including many social services and some services of general economic interest in the scope of the directive, the Commission has tried to subject activities that are crucial in terms of social cohesion to nothing other than the logic of competition and of the market."
"With the country of origin principle, the Commission has turned its back on the Community method, which is aimed at sector-specific harmonisation. It is a method that has always consisted of bringing together the provisions in force in the Member States and is therefore strictly designed to promote mutual recognition and economic integration without jeopardising the European social model and – I repeat – the higher level of protection attained at times in certain countries."
"It was a question of upwards harmonisation."
"With this draft, the European Commission has, for the first time ever, proposed a law that, unlike the Community method, encourages the disparity in national laws and rewards the least demanding Member States."
"Admittedly, the present Commission was not responsible for the initial proposal."
"Nevertheless, it does have a responsibility: once you recognised that this text was badly thought out and badly put together – as you pointed out, Mr McCreevy – it was your responsibility to withdraw it and to propose another text that was more in keeping with European social principles and liable to restore people’s confidence."
"That is why the French members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will vote in favour of an amendment to reject the text."
"Mr Barroso, you stated that the Commission was willing to include the amendments that would help us make progress with the internal market in services, but you did not state what you would do with the amendments aimed at safeguarding social rights, environmental standards and consumer law."
"Nor did you state what you had in store for the amendments that would exclude social services and certain services of general economic interest from the scope of the directive."
"On the contrary, Mr McCreevy even stated this afternoon that he wanted to retain some services of general economic interest in the scope of the directive."
"You therefore give the impression of not listening to Parliament or of only listening to it when it comes out in favour of liberalisation."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, I will conclude by saying that this afternoon’s demonstration witnessed to the expectation of a Europe that is more protective of the social sphere than is the Commission."
"Our vote in favour of the compromise will be subject to the exclusion of all public services from the scope of the directive, to the removal of the country of origin principle and to the stipulation of clear legal rules with regard to the applicable law."
"The compromise currently proposed sadly does not include these changes, and we have therefore tabled amendments along these lines."
"– I am the shadow rapporteur for the report by Anne Van Lancker of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I will talk about the regulation of the movement of workers in the Directive."
"Mr President, I travelled abroad for the first time in 1990, when Lithuania declared independence."
"Prior to this, the Communists would not let me leave, as my father was an opponent of their regime."
"Lithuania has now rid itself of Communists and we are in the European Union."
"We joined the Community wanting to be useful."
"We believed that we would be equal partners and citizens of the Union."
"Sadly, this is not so."
"Most of Europe's old-timers are more afraid of us than bird flu."
"2006 has been declared the year of free movement for workers in the Community, but its members do not want to open the doors at all."
"The Directive proposes new restrictions."
"The Commission's figures show that there is a clear advantage for countries, which have liberalised their labour markets."
"Politicians, meanwhile, threaten people with an invasion from the east and ignore the facts."
"Why are illegal immigrants from the former Yugoslavia tolerated in Austria, Moroccans in France and Turks in Germany? But Slovaks, Poles and Lithuanians there are seen as the greatest threat."
"The old members of the Community have long benefited from the markets of the new countries."
"We say that this is fine, because we believe in mutual benefits."
"Our business communities are also looking for new markets and are ready to compete honestly."
"They know that competition equals progress and growth."
"They also know that only an integrated and united Europe will endure the challenges posed by globalisation."
"But do we know this?"
"Unfortunately, for the Lithuanian the proposed Directive means that little has changed since the days of the iron curtain."
"Mr President, Europe may remain split if its peoples are played off against one another."
"A united Europe is one where all citizens have equal rights."
"Above all, freedom of movement and freedom to provide services."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I request that, during Thursday’s vote, we schedule an interruption of the sitting just before the final vote."
"Parliament and the Commission ought to erect a statue of Mr Bolkestein, the most famous European in 2005 and 2006, so that everyone remembers that we no longer want a proposal of this kind, based on an initiative of the European Commission."
"Admittedly, we have moved on today from the stage we were at with the initial Bolkestein Directive: our parliamentary committees have worked, and they have worked hard."
"Is that a good enough reason, however, to accept this compromise?"
"I – indeed, we - genuinely do not think so."
"There are still too many grey areas in this text, not least where the opportunities for monitoring labour law, environmental law and consumer law are concerned."
"We cannot accept services of general economic interest, social services or social housing being affected by this directive."
"If the aim is to restore confidence among all of our fellow citizens, who increasingly doubt the part played by European integration in improving their everyday lives, then we must quickly switch to a real form of upwards social harmonisation, not least by making it our priority to draft a directive that defines the notions of European public service."
"Mr President, the proposal for a Services Directive is reactionary."
"It threatens employees’ rights and it is in danger of leading to social dumping."
"We therefore want the proposal to be rejected in its entirety."
"If it is not, we shall vote in favour of each proposal that limits the harmful effects of the directive, for example proposals to do away with the country of origin principle and to exempt certain sectors from the directive."
"The proposed compromise between the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats removes important defects from the proposal, but major ambiguities remain, which are supposedly to be resolved by the European Court of Justice."
"We, for our part, do not want employees’ rights to be determined by the Court."
"We cannot accept a situation in which employees’ rights, together with legislation designed to protect our citizens, are sacrificed on the altar of the free market."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the many demonstrators who, in a dignified manner, today showed their opposition to the Bolkestein Directive."
"Like the demonstrators, the June Movement wishes to reject the Bolkestein Directive."
"The compromise between the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats does not alter the crux of the matter."
"The country of origin principle is being removed but is not being replaced by a clear host country principle."
"The Posting Directive continues to give low-wage countries the right to undermine our own wages and the Danish model of collective bargaining."
"Sensitive areas are being removed from the directive, so that it is left to judges to liberalise public services and make them subject to the market."
"This has already happened within the areas of education, health and social affairs."
"The European Court of Justice is directly invited to legislate by means of Amendment 5, which confirms the Court’s principles of non-discrimination, necessity and proportionality."
"These principles sound good, but the three words reflect the fact that it is the judges in Luxembourg who will decide whether national legislation can be regarded as unlawful if foreign companies are not in practice equally entitled under it to tender for work and to provide services."
"The June Movement welcomes Polish plumbers and all other foreign workers, but they should be paid non-discriminatory wages, not dumping wages."
"We wish to see free competition, but it must also be fair, and we therefore propose services regulated by the open coordination method so that our democracies are not turned into unlawful trade barriers by the judges in Luxembourg."
"– Everyone agrees that the Services Directive would legalise the movement of services within the territory of the European Union."
"And if it was adopted without major amendments, it would not discriminate against the new countries."
"I mean, above all, the preservation of the country of origin principle."
"On the other hand, particularly when one takes into account the dangers posed by most of the amendments, this directive could drift far from the original draft and become an insurmountable obstacle to the further development of the European Union."
"Another question is the range of services."
"I agree that in reality education, according to both the Community Treaty and the Directive, is, above all, a matter of national responsibility, and the European Union only funds general education programmes."
"However, if there is a lack of national responsibility and the funding of general European education programmes does not increase, then the Services Directive, by only confirming the responsibility of the national authorities, while neglecting education services, does not help to solve the problems surrounding the expansion of education in Europe, it simply perpetuates them."
"This, by the way, is confirmed by the decrease in funding of general education and culture programmes for 2007-2013, which was the subject of a persuasive letter by the Committee on Culture and Education to all the group leaders of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, it is a very strange debate that we are witnessing today."
"To listen to the representatives of the major parties, you would think that we really had found a solution – but what sort of solution?"
"The mountain has laboured and brought forth a bureaucratic chimera."
"Just take a look at it, those of you here who call yourselves social democrats."
"How exactly are you planning to implement what you think you have negotiated?"
"And we find the same desperate situation on the other side."
"Those who really think they can create a more open market have also failed."
"What do you do in such a situation in real life, where there is no room for wastefulness or mutual admiration?"
"You go back to square one."
"You start again from the beginning."
"It is a tragedy for Europe that you have not done that here."
"It is a tragedy that you have not listened to Mrs Rühle."
"It is those who actually want to stand up for the idea of Europe who will have to bear the consequences of all the problems that have now been built in, and also of the complaints that will be coming our way."
"Mr President, the prosperity and well-being of the EU’s citizens are based on recognised freedoms: the free movement of goods, persons, capital and services."
"While the promotion of the free movement of services fits within the framework of the Lisbon process, being necessary to achieve growth and jobs, the proposal that was before us, turned out to be a quick-fire solution, one which, whilst it may be lethal, can also have positive effects."
"It turned out to be beneficial for the new Member States, but I warn you that the social unrest it may cause may mean that we will go from bad to worse, and the directive would not only lead to social unrest, it would also undo the good work."
"There are a number of other problems."
"The posting of workers is one that I would mention."
"What does the Commission intend to do in practice now?"
"Being from a border region myself, I am aware that we must prevent administrative obstacles from hampering the posting of workers, or preventing it altogether."
"We must pull out all the stops, not least with a view to putting the temporary employment dossier back on track in the Council."
"Once everything runs along smoothly in the temporary employment sector, I for one will be in favour of bringing this sector within the scope of the Services Directive, but that point has still not yet been reached, what matters now is that this Temporary Employment Directive be put back on track."
"Everything hinges on the monitoring procedures that will be put in place: monitoring the posting of workers, monitoring self-employed sole traders … As for the former, we are not only examining social security and taxes, we could also stipulate that minimum wages be specified on the forms used."
"This is what makes the process of the Services Directive so effective and I am pleased with the compromises that have been reached."
"Mr President, the compromise that we have before us and on which we are to vote on Thursday is a services directive quite different from the Bolkestein Directive."
"I can therefore say to Mr Bonde that the thousands of honourable trade unionists demonstrating outside Parliament today support the compromise arrived at in this Chamber."
"Mr Bonde needs only to read the press statement by John Monks, General Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, to know that this is so."
"I have to say, too, that I am in no doubt as to why they support it."
"I have myself been involved in moving things in that direction."
"Agreements and labour legislation will be decided on by individual countries and individual trade union movements."
"This arrangement will provide more jobs."
"The public sector will be safeguarded, and we shall have avoided a split between the new and the old Member States."
"On Thursday, we shall be voting on a balanced opening-up of the internal market."
"I have said for a long time that the European Union must not develop into a form of competition between states."
"That is something we have avoided by means of the compromise now before us."
"We shall now obtain competition on fair and transparent conditions, and we shall obtain protection of those interests that serve the public and the individual citizen in the public sector as variously manifested in our societies."
"I think that what we have here is an important compromise, and I also think that it represents a crucial developmental trend on which we must build further, irrespective of whether we are talking about the Working Time Directive or the many other matters we have to tackle."
"In my capacity, too, as President of the Party of European Socialists, I can therefore recommend the compromise now before us."
"It will definitely move us in the right direction."
"Mr President, we have been discussing this Services Directive all around Europe for almost two years."
"It is, of course, excellent that there is finally something for people to take an active interest in among the subjects we tackle in this Assembly."
"Sometimes, a lot of misunderstandings arise and, sometimes, these misunderstandings are exploited in a quite distasteful way."
"The Services Directive is designed to remove all the thousands of bureaucratic obstacles that make things difficult for European companies, especially small companies."
"We must not forget that it is companies that create jobs."
"Without companies, there would be no employees at all."
"The services sector is a growing part of our economies, offering major opportunities for jobs and growth."
"We must open up and reform the European economies as a matter of some urgency."
"The country of origin principle is clever inasmuch as it creates a genuine internal market without discrimination."
"That constitutes significant progress for people and companies."
"The principle was clarified and specified in the IMCO’s compromise, which states that it is the host country’s rules governing labour law, public health and safety that apply."
"The compromise now circulating among the big groups has introduced an extremely woolly concept, namely that of social policy."
"That is deeply unfortunate because it opens the door to protectionism and to a great many different legal interpretations."
"It can, indeed, be heard how representatives from the various groups are already interpreting the compromise."
"It now seems, however, as if that compromise is on the way out, in which case that is a state of affairs we cannot but welcome."
"The Services Directive is about how Europe is to hold its own in a globalised world."
"It is about growth, the economy, employment and freedom of choice."
"Since the Treaty of Rome, our aim has been to establish freedom of movement for services too. Now is the time to do just that."
"Mr President, Parliament is capitulating today and renouncing its political role."
"The compromise means that the concept of the country of origin principle is being removed and replaced by a political vacuum."
"This vacuum will then be filled by the European Court of Justice which, in turn, will reintroduce the country of origin principle, because the Court consistently puts internal market considerations before everything else."
"The Court cannot be dismissed, and nor can it be held accountable."
"Is that democracy?"
"Only large companies with armies of lawyers will be able to use the Services Directive to uphold their interests."
"The only unemployment to which the directive will put an end is that of the lawyers."
"The losers will be the municipalities, public employees, consumers and small businesses."
"Let us vote down this directive."
"Instead of enforcing the liberalisation of everything, we should respect democratically taken decisions to preserve sectors from short-term thinking focused on the market."
"The EU cannot live on economic efficiency alone."
"We also need democratic efficiency in which people are not constantly ridden roughshod over by bad directives."
"– Mr President, the directive on the free provision of services and freedom of establishment forms part of the more general anti-grass policy of the European Union and is based on the Maastricht Treaty and on the ratified objective of the Lisbon Strategy to create a single market, with the primary objective of strengthening competition, maximising the profitability of the monopolies, by privatising public and public utility services, and striking at the fundamental employment and social rights of the working classes."
"The vows to remain true to the principle of the full unaccountability of the monopolies were repeated in an arrogant manner today by the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso."
"The political agreement between the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, with the package of amendments, does not change the reactionary nature of the directive, the basic principle of which is the country of origin, in other words full unaccountability for capital and the destruction of thousands of small- and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed people."
"The recommendations on alleged respect for workers' rights constitute an attempt to gild the pill and deflate the workers' reactions."
"The argument that liberalisation will mean cheaper services for the peoples does not stand up, given that, with the directive, services will be concentrated in fewer hands and the monopolies will determine quality and prices in keeping with increased profits, which is why we shall vote against the directive."
"You are sowing winds and you are sure to reap hurricanes."
"Mr President, the Swedish June List defends an efficient internal market and is therefore well disposed towards the Services Directive."
"At the same time, we value national self-determination."
"There must be good reasons for the Member States to transfer power and competences to the EU."
"If we accept the country of origin principle, we give up national sovereignty."
"We believe that the benefits of this principle are too limited for us to be prepared to do that."
"This principle mainly affects services such as construction, cleaning and consultancy."
"These are important sectors, but they do not have a decisive influence on Swedish prosperity and GDP."
"It is also a good thing that national monopolies on services should not be included in the directive."
"If these are to be reorganised, they should be so in a democratic spirit, that is to say by means of a broad debate in those countries that believe that such a change is desirable."
"We shall support the compromise."
"Mr President, the common European market was supposed to be based on three freedoms."
"I refer to the free movement of goods and services, the free movement of capital and the free movement of people."
"Over recent decades, the implementation of the first of these freedoms enabled the old Member States to achieve surpluses of tens of billions of euro in their balance of trade with countries such as Poland."
"This helped secure hundreds of thousands of jobs in the old Member States."
"The second freedom allowed entrepreneurs from the old Member States to be involved in the privatisation of the Polish State Treasury’s assets on exceptionally favourable terms, notably in the baking and insurance sector."
"Unfortunately, when it comes to free movement of persons, the very freedom that would be most beneficial to the new Member States, we face significant restrictions."
"The so-called Services Directive might have helped to improve matters."
"Regrettably, the current draft contained in Mrs Gebhardt’s report is a far cry from the version tabled by the European Commission and has very little to do with the idea of the free movement of services."
"This is particularly surprising as services account for almost 70% of the European Union’s GDP, and the free movement of services would undoubtedly accelerate the rate of GDP growth in the old Member States as well as in the new ones."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us imagine the follow-up to our work."
"It is time we reminded ourselves that we are in a codecision procedure here."
"Cleverly, our colleague, Mr Harbour, was able to abandon the idea of a parliamentary victory, which was the likely outcome but which led straight to the slow agony of drafting a crucial text on services."
"His tour of the European capital cities confirmed to him what we already know."
"The compromise drafted with Mrs Gebhardt – to whom I should like to pay tribute - is the only one possible within the Council and between Parliament and the Council."
"There is no qualified majority vote within the Council for the kind of internal market that some people want."
"To persist in wanting this kind of market would be a Pyrrhic victory."
"What, moreover, is chiefly apparent is that the difference between us has become a difference between the East and the West."
"On the basis of this observation, it is the logic of enlargement that is today called into question."
"Let us not forget that the failure of the Services Directive would be added to a list that includes the collapse of the Constitution, the concerns about the financial perspective and the doubts about the Lisbon Agenda."
"We must now participate in a reconciliation strategy in order to keep the Community ambition alive."
"I identified a real problem in the discrimination felt by the new Member States when faced with the restrictions imposed on the free movement of workers."
"I want helpfully to say to those countries that it is not by rejecting the compromise and thus, in the long run, the Services Directive or by bringing into question the Posting of Workers Directive that they will overcome this discrimination – quite the opposite."
"That was the thinking behind the work that we, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, carried out under the aegis of Mrs Van Lancker when we deleted Articles 24 and 25 from the initial text."
"From now on, we must solemnly call for the moratorium to be abandoned and for all the restrictions on the free movement of workers from the new Member States to be lifted."
"It would also be worthwhile linking these issues during the Council debate on the Services Directive."
"However, a study of the text has also demonstrated the many shortcomings in the Community’s legal arsenal."
"Some Members have voiced legitimate fears, and these fears must be dealt with."
"Let us take stock of the undeniable progress constituted by this text, because our job as legislator has only just begun."
"In the year I was born, President Kennedy said, ’Ich bin ein Berliner’."
"At the time, everybody understood this and agreed with him that the division of East and West was a historical transgression."
"If I said today, ‘Ich bin ein Polish plumber’, I wonder whether all of us would realise that the issue is still the unity of Europe, and whether we would all agree."
"The Services Directive extends beyond interests and it addresses values."
"It addresses the four fundamental freedoms laid down in the Treaty of Rome, and equal opportunities."
"In 21st century Europe it is unacceptable to discriminate against a service provider on the basis of origin, nationality or mother tongue."
"An important goal is to reduce the number and vulnerability of those who are forced into the black or grey economy."
"We want a better Europe!"
"We want a Europe where service providers enjoy legal certainty in the Member States."
"We want a better Europe, where service providers can create European jobs and meet consumer needs legally."
"We must create a certain, stable and clear legal background."
"This is particularly important for small and medium enterprises."
"The Socialist MEPs of the new Member States have always made a point of supporting this common interest of Europe."
"We have been constructive, we accepted the total removal of labour law from the Directive."
"We acknowledged that instead of the country of origin, we must regulate the freedom of the provision of services."
"We acknowledged that the Directive may not come into conflict with other, existing European legal standards, and it cannot overwrite the Treaty."
"We cannot loosen the certain, stable and clear framework that is being established."
"We cannot accept any undefined exceptions, because these would leave room for the arbitrary decisions of Member States."
"We do not support the total removal of public services of an economic nature, but we are ready to examine sectoral exceptions individually."
"We recognise and indeed welcome the protection that European consumers are entitled to everywhere and at all times, but we do not accept that consumer protection should restrict the freedom of service provision."
"And last but not least: in the challenge of global competition, Europe cannot afford to spend the jointly produced GDP on administrative supervision."
"Mr President, this is a fateful time for Europe."
"On Thursday we have two choices."
"Either we can demonstrate, in particular, the long sought-after solidarity with our new Member States and show that we take the citizens of Europe seriously, together with consumers’ desire for more and cheaper alternatives and the demand for more jobs, or we can dupe Europeans by adopting a Services Directive at any price, involving the lowest common denominator, and by adopting a document that changes none of the current protectionist conditions in the services area – a document that does not even preserve the status quo but that, to top it all, is a retrograde step inasmuch as it creates still more obstacles for our businesses."
"The Commission, has, unfortunately, already made its choice, Mr McCreevy, and contributed unhelpfully to the compromise between the two big groups."
"I had fully expected the Commission to have been the standard-bearer for a genuine internal market for services which is, of course, the very cornerstone of the Commission’s high-profile Lisbon process."
"The big groups’ compromise will under no circumstances bring the EU closer to its citizens, which is of course what we normally strive to do."
"Only a genuine internal market for services can create the jobs we need so much in Europe."
"Anything else is marketing gone wrong."
"We must repudiate in no uncertain terms the scare campaigns, misinformation and manipulation in which certain circles – some of them in this Chamber – have engaged on the subjects of social dumping, mass unemployment and other outrages."
"Their action is scandalous."
"Mr President, as many Members have pointed out, the European Commission’s initial proposal is socially dangerous, badly drafted and legally complicated. In short, it is exactly the opposite of a sound piece of legislation, that is to say of one that is beneficial to the European project and to Europeans."
"We, in this Chamber, represent the citizens."
"There were many tens of thousands of them this afternoon in the streets of Strasbourg."
"I believe that the demonstration was a healthy exercise in democracy in which the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteurs took part with the aim of rejecting the directive as it stands and of proposing some substantial changes to its content."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance obviously wants a European market in services, but is categorically opposed to its being governed by competition between national laws, which is what the country of origin principle implies and which, in fact, would result in downwards harmonisation."
"That is why we will vote in favour of the proposal."
"We have, moreover, tabled some amendments that break with the country of origin principle and that exclude services of general economic interest from the scope of the directive."
"I urge you to reject the services directive."
"The recent Irish ferries dispute illustrated what the future could hold for workers and workers’ rights under the services directive and similarly many of Commissioner McCreevy’s public comments in recent times have highlighted dangers to workers’ rights and collective bargaining."
"The directive commercialises almost all services within the EU."
"It will deprive millions of quality public services."
"It disproportionately affects women, both as the majority of workers in the service sector and as users of those services, and I agree with points made this evening about decisions ending up with the Court of Justice."
"People marched in their tens of thousands today to oppose this, but we put governments on notice: the struggle will be at its most intense at national level."
"Mr President, the European Union’s growth rate has been falling for years, and recently it has dropped below 2% a year."
"The world is leaving us behind because when it comes to competing at global level, it is those who contrive to lower costs and prices and create new products that take the upper hand."
"The European Union is falling behind as it has a costly agricultural sector and an erroneous, economically costly and ineffective policy of subsidising that sector."
"The Union also has a costly industrial sector."
"It is burdened by excessive social privileges, the common customs policy, and expensive bureaucratic regulations."
"Most importantly of all, the Union has expensive services."
"The services sector creates the most jobs, but cheaper service providers are prevented from accessing the market."
"The attempt to hold up the liberalisation of services is reminiscent of the attempt to hold up the flow of cheap consumer goods from Asia."
"It is expensive and ineffective."
"It is expensive because it requires a sprawling administrative system, and it is ineffective because it contributes to the boom in illegal services that is detrimental to workers."
"Those who defend the existing European Union provisions on services argue that they are fighting for their citizens’ jobs and fighting against a rise in unemployment."
"My counter argument is as follows."
"Consider what happened in Ireland and in Great Britain."
"Both countries opened up their markets."
"Did the employment rate increase or decrease?"
"Is unemployment rising or falling?"
"There can be only one conclusion."
"The state of the services market contributed to accelerating economic development."
"I believe that cheaper services are the key to speeding up the Union’s development."
"Cheaper services would reduce the cost of production and consumption."
"The market must also be extended and new technologies introduced."
"Cheap services are the only way to resolve, or at least alleviate, the problem of finding resources for …"
"Mr President, the issue of the challenges facing the European Union in the contemporary world of global competition arises in nearly all the debates held in this Parliament."
"We would like Europe to develop in a dynamic fashion and become the most competitive economy in the world in a few years’ time."
"The citizens of Europe would like this too, and they are confident that the decisions we take in the House are driving the Union towards that goal."
"We shall fail to live up to these expectations, however, if we do not find the courage to create a genuinely common market that would allow all European firms a chance to grow, regardless of where their headquarters are located."
"The right conditions for development will never be created if we agree to protectionist practices."
"These practices are also a form of discrimination, and not just along the East-West divide, though that is where they are most evident."
"They also tend to be particularly painful for the citizens of the new Member States."
"The European economy is crying out for development and the citizens of the Member States are crying out for jobs."
"The draft directive we are debating today, prepared under the previous Commission, was an appropriate and rational response to these demands."
"Given that services amount to 70% of the income generated within the Union and provide jobs for the majority of Europeans, we ought to be doing everything in our power to ensure that this sector can develop without unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles."
"Unfortunately, this is the sector in which the most obstacles to freedom of movement exist."
"This runs counter to common sense and also to the provisions of the Treaties."
"Emotions on the draft directive ran high from the outset."
"A number of amendments were introduced, and latterly a compromise version was agreed in the course of the work undertaken by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"This really is a far-reaching compromise."
"It significantly alters the meaning of this text."
"Further changes to the text, however, will mean shying away from the challenges facing Europe."
"The Union will be unable to compete successfully on the global market if it is paralysed by fear of internal competition."
"Mr President, my predecessor, Mr Philip Whitehead MEP, would have been proud to have spoken on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"He would have been proud of the work done by our rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, and all the Members who have worked so hard to improve and amend the Commission proposal."
"He would have wanted to have been here to witness the mature and responsible way in which this Parliament is building a consensus on behalf of our citizens for the opening of the market on services."
"If we get it right, we can open up the market, boost jobs and growth across the EU and help Europe compete globally with the booming services market in India and China."
"The Bolkestein proposal was flawed because it failed to recognise that if you want the public to support the opening-up of the market you have to convince them of the benefits and reassure them that it will not undermine working or consumer rights."
"If you want to encourage citizens to support change and reform, you have to explain to them what is in it for them, for their own life prospects."
"It is Parliament which is speaking for the citizen and taking up the issues of all our citizens, businesses, consumers, workers and the unemployed."
"So let us make it simple."
"We need to end the ludicrous discriminatory practices that are stopping our businesses from getting a foothold in the European market."
"Why should a business have to apply to join a local chamber of commerce, only to be told there is a five-year waiting list?"
"Why should a business have to set up four offices and pay a EUR 500 000 deposit?"
"The black economy is thriving in Europe in the services sector because these complex and costly barriers are encouraging businesses to engage in undeclared and illegal work."
"Let us make them legal with these rules."
"Let us get rid of protectionism, but protect consumers and working rights."
"I believe consumers can see the benefit of choice and competition if they can be sure that if something goes wrong they can have a speedy remedy in a local court and they do not have to chase down a bad provider to Lisbon, Paris, Warsaw or London to have their rights recognised."
"This is what we are trying to achieve in these compromises."
"Those working in the service sector need the guarantee that their employment rights are protected."
"This is not about old or new Europe."
"This is not about left or right."
"Citizens are looking to us to make the right choice: to get rid of crippling protectionism in the single market in services and protect working and consumer rights."
"I believe that if we get it right it will be a victory for parliamentary democracy and a boost to jobs and growth for future generations of Europeans."
"Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to look at ensuring that these single points of delivery, these one-stop-shops that are so vital to delivering, monitoring and supervising the kind of services we want."
"It should look at setting up an EU trust mark or an EU quality assurance scheme to give the consumer the trust and the confidence to use these services which respect consumers’ rights and working rights."
"Mr President, every now and then one of the dozens of decisions taken by the European Parliament stands out as vital to the future of the European Union."
"This is true of the Services Directive."
"It was intended as a way of implementing the principles of the four European freedoms."
"It is supposed to ensure that there will be no discrimination regarding the provision of services anywhere in the European Union."
"National origin is to be irrelevant, and the citizens of the old and new Member States are to be treated according to the same principles."
"Implementation of the directive will promote economic growth and make the European social model more widespread."
"Implementing economic freedom strengthens the social dimension of Europe rather than weakening it."
"Compromise solutions are clearly an essential aspect of Parliament’s work."
"That is also true in this case, and we should strive for compromise despite our differences of opinion."
"Nonetheless, there are limits beyond which the Services Directive would become meaningless."
"I believe it is rational not to surrender to mercantilism the areas where market logic does not operate."
"I also believe the statement that the directive does not affect labour law is justified."
"I do not, however, see any reason to include exemptions from the scope of the directive when they are unjustified and have no clear legal basis."
"It seems to me that clear legislation is essential in matters of such strategic importance."
"What is required is a rational decision with a bearing on the future."
"The spectres of Frankenstein and the Polish plumber should disappear from European consciousness and be replaced by trust, freedom and solidarity."
"– Mr President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is calling for the withdrawal of the proposed Bolkestein directive and, in all events, we are seeking the abolition of the principle of the country of origin which is being maintained under the new name of the 'principle of the free provision of services'."
"The deliberate obscurity of the new wording throws wide open the doors to the negative interpretations by the Court of Justice of the European Communities about which Commissioner McGreevy spoke to us."
"We are also calling for services of general economic interest to be expressly exempted from the scope of the directive."
"We are calling for uniform European specifications and for the prevention of social dumping and unfair competition levered by companies with flexible social and environmental legislation."
"The fragile compromise between the European right and the socialists, under pressure from reactions and demonstrations by trades union, moderates but does not remove the neo-liberal philosophy and negative charge of the proposal."
"The European Left rejects the disguised Bolkestein directive and calls for amendments limiting its adverse repercussions."
"Mr President, the fear generated in the countries of Western Europe by the phenomenon of the ‘Polish plumber’ has manifested itself in successive attempts to weaken the draft Services Directive on liberalisation of the services market."
"The many compromise amendments agreed mainly in the largest political groups indicate that some of the countries of the old Fifteen do not wish to abide by the principle of the free movement of goods within the Union enshrined in the Treaty."
"If we take Great Britain and Ireland as examples, however, it can be seen that opening up labour markets to Poland and to the other new Member States is beneficial to national economies."
"One can therefore conclude that such strong resistance to the adoption of the directive in its initial form stems from irrational fears verging on xenophobia."
"Mr President, next year will be the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, when the European Economic Community called for the abolition of the obstacles to the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital as the main objectives towards achieving a common or internal market."
"In relation to services, however, we have had over 50 years of Member State protectionism and restrictive practices, from complicated bureaucratic hurdles and time delays to financial penalties to obscure qualification requirements."
"In Austria, foreign ski instructors cannot provide services for more than 14 days."
"In Belgium and France, emergency repairs can only be done after an eight-day prior notification, which is a contradiction in itself."
"In order to place temporary pilots and aircraft engineers with an airline in Italy, a EUR 400 000 deposit and the establishment of four offices are required."
"And each one of those barriers is invariably justified by invoking the specious but emotive defence of preventing a ‘race to the bottom’."
"Protectionist Member States pose as champions of the workers against social dumping."
"In practice, they are encouraging a rampant black economy."
"In fact, those countries that have embraced the enlarged EU market have grown from strength to strength."
"Since 1993 the free movement of goods, capital and persons has yielded enormous economic and social gains."
"Nearly 70% of the working population in Europe is involved in the services sector, which represents 55% of the EU’s GDP, but, at present, services account for only 20% of trade between Member States."
"The incomplete market has created nearly EUR 1 000 billion of prosperity and 2.5 million additional jobs in Europe."
"The Services Directive could deliver 600 000 jobs more."
"There are a limited number of services – especially health services – that should have sector-specific measures."
"I welcome Commissioner McCreevy’s undertaking to propose a separate directive on patient mobility and the whole issue of cross-border health service provision."
"However, I support the remaining provisions of what is already an emaciated directive."
"It is particularly important that the temporary workers’ agencies are not excluded from the scope, given the extent to which staffing and recruitment agencies are used in a modern, flexible labour market."
"And why are transport workers and childcare workers excluded?"
"I support the provisions of Article 16 wholeheartedly ..."
"Mr President, right now, everyone’s attention is on the European Parliament."
"We have every opportunity to set the political agenda."
"We must make use of that opportunity and make an impression on this incredibly important directive."
"This is not the Bolkestein Directive, but a compromise in the making, which is something quite different."
"I shall give a few examples from the area covered by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Labour law, collective agreements and the right to take strike action are not affected by the directive."
"In the future, it will be possible for Member States to require services companies to have representatives able to conclude collective agreements and be responsible for inspections of the working environment etc. Services for the benefit of everyone, such as health care and medical services, education and social services are exempt from the directive."
"Nor are temporary agencies affected, and this in anticipation of a separate directive specifically concerned with such agencies."
"When it comes to services of general economic interest, it is up to the Member States to decide whether or not they wish to open up such services to competition. If they are, however, opened up in that way, so too should the whole of the internal market be."
"This is a constructive compromise which combines the merits of the internal market with security in the labour market and, moreover, protects the public services to which people in our Member States and regions currently have access."
"Some people believe that this is an unclear compromise."
"How do matters stand at present, however?"
"What happens if we reject the directive?"
"How many cases are languishing in anticipation of decisions by the European Court of Justice instead of being resolved by means of a directive through which we spell out the ground rules?"
"I maintain that this directive would emphatically mean progress."
"It is clearer than the regulations we have at present, and we should therefore vote in favour of it."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are all absolutely convinced of the need to complete the internal market in services, by eliminating barriers, restrictive practices and protectionism."
"It is a genuine, widespread problem."
"The initial proposals of the Bolkestein directive were, however, contradictory and, in many respects, ambiguous and wrong."
"Its basic mistake was to have given rise to opposing and negative perceptions."
"On the one hand, there was the impression that the revitalisation of fair competition was essentially being reduced to a for social and democratic dumping."
"On the other hand, because of the perfectly legitimate resistance to such ambiguities, there was a feeling in many countries, especially the new Member States, that the intention was to consolidate or uphold protectionist barriers and obstacles to the free movement of services."
"I believe that, on the basis of the compromise texts that have been tabled, those contradictions and failures can now substantially be put right."
"One justified criticism, perhaps, concerns certain exclusions and derogations for particular sectors, which will have truly adverse effects on the prospects for competitive growth in Europe’s productive, economic and social systems. Those sectors include professional activities, banking, financial and insurance services, and energy supplies."
"Many people maintain that this mountain of a directive is likely to give birth to a mouse of a result."
"To counter that objection I would point out that it is preferable to run that risk than to create a scorpion, since the sting in that little creature’s tail would certainly poison the balance of the European social model."
"– () A commercial television station in the Union told us today that EU workers are protesting against the Services Directive."
"The report forgot to add that these are workers only from the old Member States, whereas workers in the new Member States, second-class citizens in the EU, want the Directive."
"Czechs, like others from the new Member States, cannot freely work in Germany and elsewhere."
"What is truly laughable is the fact that we eat subsidised food from the west and we buy western goods that cross our borders freely and without import taxes."
"The key article is Article 16, which in the wording of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection carefully acknowledges that providers may come under the regulations of their country of origin, has fallen victim to a compromise between the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"This is not a compromise, however, so much as a castration of the entire Directive."
"Buck-passing is no way to operate a law by which providers are to be regulated, as it places them in an uncertain legal position."
"It may involve only a non-binding declaration, but there is extensive reference to public interest as a ground for restricting the activities of service providers."
"This throws the entire text into confusion, because subparagraph 1 indicates that it should be the law of the country of destination that directly applies, while subparagraph 3 can be construed as stating that it is the law of the country of origin."
"If we are to delay exposing our economy even to internal competition within the framework of the EU, how can we expect to compete with the outside world?"
"If we fail to make use of the rapidly developing new Member States to force the pace for greater efficiency in the workplace, we will be depriving ourselves of one of the greatest benefits of Union enlargement."
"() We are on the point of taking a far-reaching decision affecting the fate of one of the basic freedoms of the Union, which has formed part of European law for more than fifty years."
"At the same time as Europe is opening up to the economies of third countries, the countries of the Union are erecting internal barriers to the mutual provision of services."
"The moment has come to either knock down these artificial walls or give them our seal of approval, which would be greeted by applause by the trade unionists."
"The outcome will show how well the Union has coped with enlargement."
"The Berlin Wall has fallen, the new Member States have opened their markets to goods and services from all over Europe, and yet there are still EU Member States that have not duly implemented European legislation on the free movement of services."
"These states are hypocritically protecting their markets against mutual competition, in contravention of the law of the Union and the rulings of the courts."
"We are confronted with Chirac’s idiotic phantom in the form of a Polish plumber, hovering over France and other countries."
"Now is the time to find out who takes the ideas of the Lisbon Strategy and the flexible market seriously, and who does not."
"On what will the opposition be basing their arguments, I wonder."
"They have not presented us with any studies, but have rather used the rapporteur to foist false impressions on trade unionists."
"It is simply not true that the Directive will transform labour laws, nor will it amend laws on workers’ programmes or undermine their protection."
"On the contrary, all of the studies show that it will bring 600 000 new jobs, EUR 37 billion for the economy and an end to discrimination."
"The proposed watering down of the Directive and surrender of country of origin principle goes against the interests of everyone, including consumers, and it would also represent an ideological blow to the concept of deregulation and continuing harmonisation."
"Our experience with the movement of goods has shown that such an option is unworkable."
"The Member States would never agree on it, and more importantly, through bringing further regulation rather than simplification and flexibility, it would only delay the goal of a successful Europe operating within the framework of a global economy."
"The Directive thus provides a test of whether we favour short-term national protectionism or a common European prosperity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, far from doing any credit to the principle of better regulation, this directive, in fact, does the opposite."
"It is you, Commissioner, who must bear responsibility for the annoyance, indeed the indignation of almost all groups in European society, and for what we just heard about from Mrs Roithová – the playing off of Members from the East and West against one another."
"We are not talking about raising the drawbridge."
"The internal market is not an end in itself."
"That is why we needed the three major exceptions: the Posting of Workers Directive, the Temporary Workers Directive, which must remain an exception for as long as the Council keeps the European directive on ice, and in particular the Professional Qualifications Directive, adopted by all of us here in this House."
"An efficient internal market without barriers and without discrimination, with fair framework conditions, is a win for Europe – for providers, service providers, consumers and employees."
"But that is certainly not what this directive gives us."
"I would particularly like to thank the European Trade Union Confederation, which has been working with us to advocate protection, without falling into the trap of national narrow-mindedness."
"The solution is not to reject, but to reshape."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to say that this is not about the East against the West, because I come from the West and I am all in favour of the Services Directive."
"We should not lose sight of the directive’s objective, which is to break down unnecessary barriers for small and medium-sized companies, enabling them to offer their services in other countries."
"With a watered-down directive as proposed by the Socialists and some members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we are at risk of battening up the markets even more."
"Whilst we should protect valuable social achievements, we should not indulge in protectionism, nationalism and certainly not xenophobia."
"In the global economy, it is important to strengthen the European market, rather than fragment and weaken it."
"The services market offers marvellous opportunities to many, and innovative and quality jobs can be created in the services sector."
"The debate reeks of hypocrisy, for, while the old Member States in the West fear competition from the East, they forget that Western undertakings have been doing business in Eastern Europe for the past 15 years, and have been doing very well out of it."
"The directive must be adopted with the widest possible scope, which means that services of general interest or services of general economic interest – and it is perhaps time we defined those terms – that are currently on offer should fall within its scope without further ado, just like health care, temporary employment agencies and gambling."
"The country-of-origin principle, even if we change its name, should simply be left alone."
"I will vote for this directive only if it results in more free movement of services."
"A compromise that intends to batten up the markets even more will not receive my vote."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is a huge step for the EU and a small step for free trade."
"Whether or not it is a step forward will depend on the vote on Thursday."
"There are too many exemptions, and the principle must not be unduly weakened."
"It is important for small companies, and it is especially important for small countries."
"Without added value, the compromise will be worthless."
"The Commission therefore has a special responsibility in the ongoing work."
"EU protectionism that hides itself behind social policy or consumer protection is preposterous."
"Allow me to give two examples."
"Anyone wanting to build 25 identical private houses in Germany has to submit 25 plans to the authorities for approval and pay 25 times over, in spite of the fact that it is exactly the same house that is to be built."
"Is that sensible?"
"No, it is expensive for the consumer and it is absurd."
"If a group of Swedish tourists goes on holiday to Greece accompanied by a diving instructor, the person concerned must actually be able to speak Greek."
"Otherwise, he is not allowed to work with, and talk to, a Swedish group in Greece, in spite of the fact that none of the group speaks any Greek."
"That really is idiotic."
"We therefore need better rules for the cross-border trade in services."
"We can improve this compromise on Thursday by reducing the number of exemptions and also including private health care."
"We should, then, carry through what the Austrian Presidency says it is seeking, namely an ambitious Services Directive that contributes to increased prosperity for us all."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on services in the internal market could be made beneficial, if you were to centre the debate on the harmonisation of employment arrangements, with the objective of their maximum possible improvement and the convergence of economic structures and technological capabilities."
"However, this specific proposal for a directive, on the pretext of institutional deficits and emergent malfunctions, is trying to impose a strategy alien to social interests, which aims to further strengthen capital and reverse the working-class achievements."
"European socialists are engaging in an historic battle."
"Any attempts to find compromises for a better legislative text will fall wide of the mark, given that, if we take account of the recent circumstances, there is no reason to believe that a pro-worker or development regulatory framework will be achieved which will safeguard the Union's social model."
"The principle of the country of origin is the principle that will ultimately be applied, given that the Article 16 at issue, which constitutes the essence and the basic weapon of the directive, does not radically amend it and services of general economic interest are not in essence exempted from the scope of the directive."
"At a time when it is assumed that we want to get closer to the citizens, by trying to simplify Community law, we are being called on to adopt a text with very serious ambiguities and contradictions, a text which, in trying to please everyone, does not clarify crucial matters which ultimately the courts will inevitably have to clarify."
"There is too little time for further technical analysis, but the essence is that the economic liberalism which informs the entire text is not a one-way street."
"Mr President, so much has been said today, but my hope is that whatever form of compromise we vote on Thursday, it will represent a step forward."
"I hope that it will underline and take forward the long-standing basic Treaty freedom to provide services, and that at last we will make this existing freedom more of a reality than it has been to date."
"However, let us learn one clear lesson for the future from all of this: a matter of such importance deserves thorough and long-standing preparation, particularly preparation of Europe’s public – the citizens we seek to represent and who in large number we seem to have managed to antagonise over this proposal."
"Compare this with 1992: the years of preparation, the number of separate pieces of legislation, the final and general excitement to welcome the free market in goods."
"Contrast that with this present method: one far-reaching proposal for a directive literally dumped on the table at the end of the last mandate."
"This cannot be the way to do things."
"I hope indeed that we will learn the lesson for the future about communicating Europe. '"
"Mr President, we are today debating one of the most significant legislative acts for the future of Europe."
"It may well lead to a new dimension for the Union, but it will be one in line with the founding fathers’ original vision."
"The criticisms voiced by certain opponents of this directive are only loosely related to its draft."
"In fact, they are an effort to call a halt to the economic integration of Europe on the basis of four fundamental freedoms."
"We cannot go along with hypocrisy and calls for the restrictions on enterprises’ freedom to provide services and for restrictions on consumers’ freedom to access these services, all under the pretext of protecting national sovereignty."
"Neither can we go along with the proposal to take yet another step backwards from the current legal situation, and the jurisprudence of the Court this year, by limiting the scope of application of the directive and continuing to allow national administrations complete freedom to impose new barriers and retain existing ones."
"We are also concerned that, in certain Member States, the debate has centred on the Polish plumber and on the Latvian or Portuguese construction worker, whilst genuinely discriminatory administrative barriers are actually the most serious problem."
"The single internal market is still plagued by divisions between the old Europe and the new Europe."
"Many Member States implement discriminatory practices with regard to service providers from other Member States."
"This tendency has become even more marked since the enlargement of the Union."
"The result of the discriminatory restrictions affecting the cross-border flow of services is that small and medium-sized enterprises are missing opportunities to develop and create jobs."
"Europe needs a sound Services Directive with a wide scope of application, a strong Article 16 and indeed Articles 24 and 25."
"Such a directive would only remove administrative barriers and would not impact on the Directive concerning the posting of workers, contrary to what everyone is being led to believe."
"Europe needs a Services Directive that will ensure the provisions of the Lisbon Strategy do not simply remain on paper."
"A clear and unambiguous text is required if we are to achieve this aim."
"Thanks to Parliament’s work, parts of the text that were unclear have been improved, but we must not create new difficulties as we vote on the draft."
"The original sense and purpose of the directive must not be sacrificed in the interests of what are often far-reaching compromises."
"Protectionism does not create jobs."
"Protectionism is an evil short-sighted instrument with which to defend workers’ rights."
"It is a manifestation of the national bureaucracies’ lack of political ability to face up to the challenges of the real economic and political world."
"Mr President, first of all I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, Mrs Van Lancker and their shadows in the other groups for the excellent work they have done in seeking to strengthen the services directive."
"It is obvious to most people in this House that a race to the bottom in any area will not win the allegiance, or indeed build the confidence of European citizens in the European project."
"I had hoped that Commissioner McCreevy here today would have demonstrated that he had understood that message, but unfortunately his remarks with regard to services of general economic interest do not encourage me to believe that he has."
"To those who want to vote symbolically against Bolkestein for domestic reasons, I say fine."
"But then please support the broad progressive majority in this Parliament to deliver a ‘de-Bolkesteined’ directive by supporting the key compromise amendments which have been painstakingly negotiated."
"This House will be abdicating its responsibility by refusing to adopt the amended directive now on offer and leaving our services market, our labour rights, our consumer rights and our environmental rights in this area to the uncertainty of case-by-case decisions of the European Court of Justice."
"It is not elected to make law – we are."
"Finally, to Mrs de Brún, who has now left this House, I would say that if she wants to prevent an Irish Ferries-style race to the bottom in the services area, then she should, as an obligation, vote for the amendments that she will be offered here tomorrow, as a first step – not as the only step, but as a first step – to prevent what she fears."
"– In my opinion, the Services Directive is the most important document, which the European Parliament will adopt during this term."
"Why?"
"Because it is a unique indicator of changes in European thinking."
"We will see if Europe is ready to establish the internal market, ready to liberalise it and legitimise the fundamental provision of the European Union."
"It is a pity that the declarations of the Lisbon Goals still fail to be matched with real actions."
"Fear of change, competition and fear of voter pressure still have an effect on the actions of politicians."
"There is no need to threaten people with the destruction of a social model; we must talk to them about reality and the changes that are necessary if Europe is to be competitive."
"Sooner or later we will liberalise the market, but a delay may be disastrous."
"And social welfare in the European Union is like water in connected flasks."
"At the moment, social welfare is available only across the entire European Economic Area."
"Compromises are possible and necessary to a certain degree."
"I believe that the country of origin principle should remain in essence."
"We really must trust one another."
"– The European Parliament has seldom been as much in the spotlight as now, when it is poised to decide on this important Directive."
"The result of our vote is being awaited by the European Commission, the Council, small and medium-size enterprises and labour unions."
"This is a gratifying outcome of democracy and an acknowledgement of those that represent Europe’s citizens."
"However, it requires a good measure of responsibility."
"We are about to decide on a Services Directive that represents a new lease of life and a new dynamism for the revised Lisbon Strategy."
"The Services Directive will directly benefit small and medium-size enterprises, primarily by simplifying and facilitating the provision of services in other Member States."
"Complete services market liberalisation is particularly important to the new Member States."
"I am therefore in favour of the articles on worker assignment being reinstated in the Directive."
"I would like to praise the work of the shadow rapporteur, Mr Malcolm Harbour, who has managed, on the basis of an agreement between right-wing and liberal factions, to maintain the country-of-origin principle, and also called ‘the freedom to provide services’, while the Member States may turn down a service provider for reasons of health protection and environmental conservation."
"However, I have a problem with the compromise amendment that includes, in particular, the possibility of registering a reservation for reasons of consumer protection or social policy, as this enables the authorities in the country of destination to block access to a service provider from another Member State at any time, and thereby negates the country-of-origin principle."
"It seems to me that the public discourse on this Directive has focused too much on criticism of the country-of-origin principle."
"Very little has been written up to now about the substantive benefits of the Directive, which simplifies administrative cooperation, and establishes single point of contact or a standard form available in electronic format."
"In conclusion, allow me to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Evelyn Gebhard, for her hard work in drafting the report."
"Mr President, since the compromise that is before us is in the spirit of the best Dutch tradition of combining open markets with a reasonable level of social protection, it enjoys the full support of my delegation."
"Our Economic Affairs Minister recently said that his main concern was that there were so many exceptions in the directive."
"I cannot share his concern and would like to explain why some of those exceptions are very valid to my mind."
"First of all, with regard to the exclusion of health care and other sectors that are governed by an excessive number of compelling reasons of general interest, those are sectors which I think are better off being regulated on an individual basis, and it is also necessary that a horizontal framework directive be adopted for services of general interest, which clearly spells out the powers of non-central authorities, with a view to imposing rules on sectors of this kind for reasons of general interest."
"Another sector I should like to touch upon is that of temporary employment."
"As you know, we reached a marvellous compromise on this very subject in this House four years ago, one that enjoyed broad support from us but has since been with the Council, frozen, for a long time."
"For the temporary employment sector too, the directive we came up with then and which struck a balance between protection and opening up markets, was a much better basis for imposing European legislation on the relevant sector with more accuracy and care, and I should like to ask Mr McCreevy to deliver on his commitment and to create legislation in the areas of health care and temporary employment that is different from this directive’s."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there has been much talk this evening about the need to open up the services market in the European Union and also the need to remove obstacles to the achievement, or implementation, of some of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"To this end, this services directive is not just a necessary instrument but also an essential one."
"What requirements should this directive, this text, have in order to fulfil the role we have set for it, however?"
"In my view, firstly, it should set some clear criteria, which provide everybody with legal security, both consumers and entrepreneurs and, in particular, small and medium-sized businesses, which make up the majority — some 80 or 90% — of the European Union’s business fabric."
"And furthermore, this text - which should offer legal certainty and, I repeat, be clear - needs to be applied to all of the countries of the European Union."
"I must say that, in my opinion, the text approved in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection met these requirements."
"I have to say, however, that, at this point, I have my doubts as to whether the compromise texts that have been agreed meet the requirements of clarity and legal certainty."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to make a brief observation."
"This evening, some people have tried to set two models for Europe against each other. Those who claim to defend the European social model — and who set themselves up as its only defenders — want to set their position against that of those of us who advocate the need for competition and competitiveness."
"I would like to say that the best kind of social policy is one that generates economic growth and creates jobs."
"I would like to say that the only possible danger to the European social model is a European Union without economic growth, clinging to old prejudices and incapable of competing with other economies, because, if we do not grow, it will be impossible to maintain our social policy."
"Mr President, the European Union is based on four fundamental freedoms."
"These are the freedom of movement of goods, capital, the workforce and services."
"These pillars of the European Community were agreed back in 1958 because even then it was already clear that they were the of the genuine integration of Europe."
"Several decades have gone by but there is still no free movement of services in Europe."
"The main reason for this situation is the weakness of the political class."
"Politicians have been either unable or unwilling to explain to the citizens that the freedom to provide services results in new jobs and faster economic growth."
"Instead of clarifying the meaning of the enlargement of the European Union and highlighting the opportunity offered by competition, politicians have opted to alarm the voters with the spectres of social dumping, the so-called Frankenstein Directive and the notorious Polish plumber."
"This is the background to today’s debate on the Services Directive in this House."
"The adoption of the directive will make life easier for consumers and entrepreneurs, accelerate economic growth and create 600 000 new jobs in Europe."
"Unfortunately, the directive is under increasing attack from those of a populist and protectionist persuasion."
"We have heard time and again that opening up the services market will result in social dumping and poorer working conditions, but these views are totally unfounded."
"A compromise is still possible, however."
"I would remind the House that issues relating to employment and labour law have been removed from the scope of the directive, which should allay the fears expressed by the Trade Unions."
"Services of public interest have also been excluded."
"I believe that this will ensure a balance between the need for competitiveness and the need to protect labour rights."
"I therefore appeal to the European Parliament to adopt the directive as it now stands."
"It will allow competition to be strengthened and the labour markets to be opened up."
"It will also make life easier for consumers and businesses."
"Mr President, I have two pieces of bad news, two pieces of good news and one recommendation."
"The first piece of bad news is that I am rather saddened by the debating atmosphere that we have in Europe today."
"It is one of protectionism, nationalism, near-racism and xenophobia."
"To me, as a pro-European and as a federalist, protectionism is anti-European."
"My second piece of bad news concerns the Commission."
"I am a big fan of the Commission."
"I always support it."
"However, Mr McCreevy, trust me: do not have your office call upon me to water down the Services Directive."
"It is your job to defend the Services Directive, not to defend protectionism."
"Your office wanted to make this into not the freedom to provide services, but into the freedom to prevent services."
"Please let that be the last time!"
"The good news is, first, that I believe we will have a compromise tomorrow."
"I believe we will move forward."
"We need this directive."
"The second piece of good news is that we might get a broad majority in the European Parliament."
"I hope that the Austrian Presidency can get a broad majority in the Council."
"My final point is a recommendation: my modest recommendation is to approve the compromise on Article 16 as it stands between the PSE and the PPE-DE Groups, as long as we get three things into the directive: firstly, health services; secondly, temporary working agencies; thirdly, posting of workers."
"Those are essential."
"I believe that the way in which this debate has gone is very unfair."
"We see it as a case of old versus new."
"It is not."
"It is about protectionism and liberal markets."
"I am afraid that some of us are losing it."
"Mr President, I believe that Mrs Wallis hit the nail on the head when she said that the Commission has worked badly on this issue."
"At the end of the last legislature, they suddenly presented us with a piece of legislation equivalent to the entire package that Delors had prepared for the liberalisation of goods between 1988 and 1992."
"Furthermore, this proposed directive from the Commission does not even deal with the liberalisation of services, because the central issue is the liberalisation of the labour market."
"That is to say, Article 16, in relation to the principle of country of origin, is not going to liberalise services; its intention is to liberalise the labour market, because there are certain concessions made by the then Commissioner that run counter to social protection, environmental protection and consumer protection."
"This Parliament has therefore had great difficulty: it has taken us two years of work."
"The main rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, has worked extremely hard, as have the shadow rapporteurs, including Mrs Van Lancker."
"I believe, however, that Parliament is currently on the point of presenting a genuine directive on the liberalisation of services."
"It must not be mixed up with the labour issue, which is causing so much argument at the moment."
"The proposed services directive, which I believe will be approved on Thursday as a result of the agreement between the two big political groups, is now going to enable services to be liberalised, in accordance with normal procedures."
"We must remember that we already have areas in which services have been liberalised."
"Services have been liberalised in relation to transport, communications, audiovisual transmissions and professional activities."
"We must continue along this route."
"If this directive is approved by the Council — and, as Mr Stubb said, I hope that the Commission will approve the European Parliament's proposals — it will actually enable services to be liberalised."
"Furthermore, one of the amendments introduced calls upon the Commission, in agreement with social actors, to present concrete proposals for the liberalisation of services within five years."
"If the Commission approves Parliament’s amendments, the Council could agree to it and we could see the beginning of a genuine liberalisation of services."
"– Mr President, I personally had many reservations about the initial text which the European Commission presented two years ago."
"Nonetheless, any reservations which anyone had are no longer very important, because this text has been amended a great deal by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection of the European Parliament and I think that it will be amended even more by plenary the day after tomorrow."
"The Commission first presented a text with a great many exaggerations and a great deal that missed the mark and, in this way, did injustice to the idea of completing the internal market in the European Union."
"In other words, it did not seek in the right way to overcome any administrative and legislative obstacles in order to facilitate investments in this sector."
"A correct objective was wronged by the policy, mainly the communications policy, of the European Commission."
"This provoked reactions from various social groups, whereas the OECD maintains that a rational opening-up of services in the Member States could create 2 500 000 new jobs and increasing European GDP accordingly by 1.8%."
"The Committee on the Internal Market has made material interventions both in the scope of the directive and in workers' rights and I think that the amendments tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, improve the text of the directive still further, address certain problems with the initial country of origin and create the preconditions for broad social and parliamentary consent."
"The objective of the majority of MEPs, of all the Member States and of the European trades union is not to reject any form of directive on services, but to have a better directive on services and I think that, all together, we shall achieve that."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by paying tribute to the work of our rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, who has, in actual fact, succeeded in completely rewriting the text."
"How should I go about telling you, Mr Barroso, that Europeans have had enough of this Europe of social dumping?"
"Using language related to the country of origin principle, perhaps?"
"Despite some important advances such as the preservation of the Posting of Workers Directive and the exclusion of health care and services of general interest, I regret that SGEIs and social services are still not excluded."
"I refuse to see these public service tasks made subject to the rules of the competitive market."
"Similarly, it would be very useful to have labour law excluded from Article 2 so as not to cause a dangerous dispute."
"Even if, in the end, the country of origin principle is no longer mentioned, the proposed compromise will hand over the actual power of the legislator to the Community judge, who will decide the direction in which European social policy is steered."
"Applying the country of destination principle to the exercise of service activities and the country of origin principle only to the right of access would have been preferable."
"As for those who falsely claimed that voting against the draft European Constitution meant the death of the Bolkestein Directive, the current situation shows them that, on the contrary, this directive is still very much alive and that it requires us to be extremely vigilant and to keep on fighting."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we are addressing a topic that is important for truly creating the internal market."
"I was the rapporteur for the directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts, on which some 800 amendments were tabled, and for the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications, on which some 600 amendments were tabled."
"In both cases I worked with Mr Harbour and Mrs Gebhardt, as well as many others."
"The results we achieved enjoyed such broad support that last May the latter directive was adopted unanimously by both Parliament and the Council, with just two Member States abstaining."
"I should once again like to thank both colleagues."
"The principles behind the two directives are analogous to the principles that should be inspiring the services directive, and their aims are the same."
"Unfortunately, the Prodi Commission’s proposal incorporated neither the reasoning nor the content that made Parliament have to rewrite the two directives, just as today we are being forced to rewrite the directive we are examining."
"We all want the market to be opened up for work as well as for goods and money, but we believe that that should be done once again by harmonising the national systems themselves and not by overturning everything."
"The five-year-maximum revision clause allows for gradual transitions."
"We want this directive without trauma or ideological clashes, and so we are hoping for a cautious approach with common-sense political solutions."
"The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has already stated a position that I share and, from my personal experience in this field, I do not appreciate those who, rather than seek a compromise, want to reject the whole idea, thus going against the Treaties."
"On the other hand, I do appreciate the compromises that have been reached, and I hope that this directive too will enjoy a large majority."
"Lastly, I should like to thank Mrs Gebhardt again for the work she has done."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a crucial debate for Europe’s future, which resonates in the economic, social and political spheres."
"The compromise solution obtained between the main political groups strikes me as a well-balanced one."
"It is vital that the application of the country of origin principle, temporary work in the areas of health, other social areas, services of general interest, and lotteries be removed."
"It is also vital that the criteria relating to the services of general interest be made abundantly clear, completely removed or set out by each individual Member State."
"As in this compromise, I naturally wish to highlight the importance of not interfering with the directive on the posting of workers."
"Ladies and gentlemen, whilst it is necessary to press ahead with building the internal market, it is no less important to guarantee fair competition in all Member States, not by fomenting social inequality, and certainly not by distorting labour markets or by dismantling labour relations, but by cutting through red tape and by breaking down unjustifiable technical barriers."
"Although this process of establishing the internal market in services is very important for Europe’s economic development, the rules ensuring European social cohesion must be complied with."
"If this did not happen with the initial version of the directive, we can now, as Members of this House, adopt a text that will make a balanced and lucid contribution to the creation of a genuine European market in services that will, at the same time, guarantee social cohesion."
"To this end, clarity and courage are of the essence."
"Mr President, I shall begin by saying that I am going to vote in favour of the compromise, that I much prefer the compromise to the original directive, and that I shall focus on a single issue: the reimbursement of costs generated by a citizen from one Member State for services they have received in another Member State."
"If the President will allow me to employ the case method, I shall use the example of the Valencian Community, although I could be referring to any other region, an Italian region for example."
"We receive more tourists every day; every day more European citizens acquire a second home there; every day we receive more citizens who come to be treated in our Valencian Community, exclusively, given the quality of its medical services."
"This pressure poses a threat to the health services."
"This financial pressure is difficult for us to endure."
"On numerous occasions, the Court of Justice has acknowledged that, pursuant to Articles 49 and 50 of the EC Treaty and the regulations implementing them, the Member State providing medical services has the right to be reimbursed by the State of the citizen being treated."
"But in practice the reality is that this right is not respected, that this right is a purely rhetorical statement."
"The Commission has taken the view that this Directive is a good instrument for making this right a reality, and this view is enshrined in Article 23."
"At the moment, I do not know what the situation is with Article 23 or the amendments intended to remove it."
"I shall simply express my desire that this article be retained as drawn up by the Commission."
"I would call upon the Commissioner not to restrict himself to making a formal statement promising once again that the problem will be resolved."
"We want this article to be approved as it is, and that is how I shall vote."
"Mr President, there are those who think that we have given misleading information about the directive."
"Today, I am delighted that, with the amendments, we have made sweeping changes to the Bolkestein directive."
"I wonder, though, whether, with this amended document, we are providing for legal certainty."
"Along with many others, I fear that we are not."
"Commissioner McCreevy, you would be able to win us over if you said to us today that the services of general economic interest are best kept outside of the scope of this directive, but you have stated the opposite."
"You do not breathe a word about a framework directive on services of general interest."
"In conclusion, in our final verdict, we will take into consideration the fact that the directive that is before us is anything but harmonised – quite the reverse, in fact."
"A decision has been made in favour of legislation on the basis of the differences between the 25 Member States, and I do not consider that to be the right way to go about the integration of markets."
"Some say that a watered-down directive is still better than nothing."
"However, this is not true, because there is a limit beyond which we are no longer helping the free provision of services, but creating further obstacles in its way."
"Unfortunately, a few amendment proposals submitted last week are doing just this."
"If we vote for them, we will destroy the essence of this proposal."
"We have a lot to lose, because in the past decades the European Court of Justice has repeatedly protected the rights of service providers against restricting attempts made by Member States."
"If we now accept a directive full of new obstacles that are conflicting with the spirit and letter of the founding Treaties of the European Union, we cannot hope that the Lisbon Programme, intending to create jobs and new European growth, would be successful, because we would actually restrict this market for another 30 years."
"The new Member States have already opened their capital and goods markets a few years ago."
"This was not an easy decision."
"We, too, could have said that our economies were too weak and unfit for competition."
"This is why many of us, MEPs from new Member States, are shocked to see that now, when we should be jointly opening the services market, several old Member States with a strong economy are hesitating."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is now your turn."
"Will you stand by one of the four fundamental freedoms of the European Union, or not?"
"A strong Services Directive would be good for small and medium enterprises, it would be good for old and new Member States, and it would be good for all the citizens of Europe."
"Fellow Members, let us wipe out from the draft all endeavours restricting a free services market!"
"We, Hungarians, can only support a directive that does more than preserving the Treaty of Rome principle concerning free services in name only."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive we are debating will doubtless be remembered for the tortuous and difficult path it has followed."
"The directive has been openly and strongly criticised right from the start."
"It is no coincidence that even today a large European trade union demonstration has been vehemently pointing out that, for the sake of the European labour market, Europe needs to have a services directive that completes the internal market without damaging social cohesion."
"We in Parliament have been working along these lines in order to contribute to development and growth in the important services sector in Europe, without ever losing sight of the social dimension that Europe must have and the need not to put off the harmonisation process indefinitely."
"The amendments that have been introduced and the compromise we have reached to a great extent address the questions and demands that have been raised concerning both working rights and the so-called country-of-origin principle."
"There are still some unresolved issues, however, including services of general economic interest, which I hope will find a solution during the final vote, on the basis of the amendments that have been tabled."
"I definitely think that some good work has been done so far, thanks in part to Mrs Gebhardt."
"We have not shrunk from confronting the issues, but rather we have helped to identify a number of possible solutions and we intend to remain committed even after the vote at first reading."
"Mr President, following talks with the staff and managers of two dozen small and medium-sized enterprises in Hesse alone, and with representatives of trade unions and employers, things looked gloomy, to be quite honest, for an acceptable Services Directive."
"In the wake of the one-sided Bolkestein approach, the compromise now reached strikes the right balance between removing obstacles and national barriers in the internal market and the need for social cohesion."
"Services of general interest should not be liberalised, and nor should any public companies be privatised."
"Nor will competition law or state aid rules be restricted."
"Fears that it would result in social and wage dumping are no longer justified."
"The new principle of free movement of services provides that the countries in which the services are provided can insist that their national regulations are complied with, and that compliance monitored."
"That applies to guarantees of public safety and order and to environmental and health protection."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs gave the process of greater cooperation added impetus, and that is important."
"We think it is important that industrial safety must not be put at risk and that existing arrangements from tariff agreements must be upheld."
"The Posting Directive has priority, which means that the construction sector and other sensitive sectors in the Member States can be protected, and minimum wages can be maintained."
"In order to prevent business from simply registering a PO Box address in another Member State, a consumer-friendly regulation has been laid down: a branch office will only be recognised if it can be demonstrated to have appropriate infrastructure and a permanent presence."
"Many of the slogans at today's demonstration were not up-to-date."
"People are entitled to protest in public, but they have greater credibility if the content of their protests is accurate."
"The public, the Commission and the Council are awaiting the decision of this Parliament, and there is an awareness everywhere of how important this House really is."
"The inter-group compromise is the right way to go."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has been consistent in its basic intention both to give the internal market a new dynamism – with Lisbon as the watchword – and to maintain social standards."
"Mr President, it is better to accept the proposed compromise than reject it."
"In any case, this is the starting point for a single, viable labour market."
"As legislators, we have to aspire to accuracy and precision."
"Every vague paragraph in a directive is a potential case for the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"When reading the proposal, one has the feeling that the more highly educated or qualified someone is, the more likely his or her field is to fall outside the scope of the directive and be protected from genuine competition."
"Europe needs economic growth."
"Growth is achieved by increasing work or raising production."
"We cannot oppose social dumping by preventing human mobility, but rather by creating a cross-border system in which anyone who commissions services is responsible for complying with the terms and conditions of employment."
"How can we think of competing with China or India if we cannot rid our membership area of needless barriers to competition?"
"Mr President, the European Union is constantly seeking stimuli for development, to help create a Union capable of rising to the challenges of the third millenium."
"This directive was supposed to make the European Union stronger at global level and better able to compete with other economies the world over."
"The fact that we are now a Community of 25 countries and not of 15 seems to have been overlooked."
"Members of this House are increasingly of the opinion that it is the new Member States that are competing against the Union, not China or the USA."
"The European Union seems to be afraid of itself."
"The old Member States that joined forces against this directive have caused a recrudescence of combative jargon."
"The division between the old and new Union is becoming ever more marked."
"Once again, the Member States are being divided into better and worse countries."
"The rich countries support a short-sighted policy based on fear, not on rational indications."
"Paradoxically, the rich countries that hitherto presented themselves as the strongest advocates of integration are the ones resisting the full implementation of the provisions of the Treaties."
"They are spreading alarm through references to social dumping from the new Member States and to possible threats to the European social model."
"I believe that the new Member States will manage."
"Economic growth in the eurozone is practically nil, and the economy is developing slowly."
"Resistance to opening up the services market fully carries with it the risk of losing a key stimulus that would accelerate the Union’s economic growth and create new jobs."
"To date, the new Member States have been described as moaners."
"In the two-speed Europe that is now emerging, they must, however, develop ways of responding swiftly to the tactical coalitions against them that are arising more and more frequently."
"The original draft of the directive represented a new opportunity for the European Union of 25 Member States."
"As it now stands, having lost the articles banning discrimination against firms providing services abroad and the country of origin principle, it is gradually losing its meaning and transparency."
"Mr President, I come from a new Member State."
"I support the compromise; to do otherwise would be socially and politically myopic."
"The way in which the majority in Parliament seems to have converged in order to drastically rethink the Services Directive shows the relevance of this institution."
"We are converting a proposal that could have had disastrous effects on our societies – especially on those most in need – into a much more sensible one."
"We are still not fully satisfied; we want public services to be clearly excluded and we want clearer safeguards on other sectors."
"Nevertheless we must admit that we have a much more realistic piece of legislation in front of us."
"We are renewing our agreement with the principle of freedom of movement of services and facilitating it, but we are agreeing that social rights come first."
"After our rejection of the Port Services Directive, for the second time in a relatively short period we are showing our commitment to a social Europe."
"I believe that Mr Whitehead would have been proud of Mrs Gebhardt and the rest of us."
"Mr President, at the stage we are at with this matter this evening, I am aware that it is politically improper to oppose a compromise painstakingly drafted by leaders of two political groups."
"Each architect of this compromise is claiming victory, which makes me uneasy because I do not like being taken for a fool."
"My colleagues swear to me that the country of origin principle is implicit in the compromise text."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament boast that they have nipped it in the bud."
"I, like others, regard the country of origin principle and the history of European integration as being intimately connected."
"Dogmatically rejecting this connection means going against what we are patiently building and means introducing the principle of widespread suspicion."
"Of course, this principle would be unable to prevail over all the others because we have controlled and managed it."
"We made it clear that the legislation of the country of destination applies to all aspects related to the social sphere."
"Continuing to talk about an attack on social standards is therefore exceptionally misleading."
"We are told not to mix up commercial and non-commercial services."
"Yet, on this point too, we did mix things up and we ended up toning down the directive, which now includes so many derogations that it would be better to define what it does actually apply to, and not the other way round."
"The bottom line is that the rules of the country of destination relating to the posting of workers have never been the subject of dispute."
"So, what more do people want?"
"To go back on the of the Treaty of Rome?"
"The compromise on Article 16 hardly confirms these ."
"This is by no means progress!"
"I believe that, in these conditions, rather than picking apart a directive until there is nothing left of it, it would be much better to stick to the version of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"Mr President, I am not willing to swallow just anything in order to reach a solution that, on the pretext of defending social standards, actually defends protectionist standards, and I will vote accordingly."
"An hour ago, this House heard that trade unionists only from the old Member States were demonstrating in Strasbourg against the Directive."
"In fact, they were also joined by colleagues from the new Member States, and those who listened to them carefully saw that they were not at all opposed to the Directive."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you remember very well how we recently rejected by a large majority a proposal agreed upon by the Council when approving the Financial Perspective for 2007–2013."
"At the time, our preference was for European interests over specific self-interests."
"We were able to unite ourselves in the interest of the entire European Union."
"I was proud that we had resisted attempts to influence us and that we managed to find agreement in the European Parliament."
"A compromise is very important for a fundamental document such as the Services Directive."
"I think that the rapporteur has done a very good job."
"In my opinion, we have achieved a number of acceptable compromises."
"Therefore, I believe that we should vote for what represents a ‘win-win’ situation in support of Europe, offering the best solution for both the old and the new Member States."
"Mr President, having listened to the debate here in plenary, there is good reason for recalling why we need a Services Directive and why we are working to obtain a more open trade in services."
"It is because we are all basically agreed that an increased trade in services will provide more jobs, more new companies, increased growth and greater competitiveness."
"On the basis of the debate in this Chamber, it would seem, however, as if many have forgotten this."
"Free trade in services is something positive, not negative."
"Unfortunately, the opponents of the directive have succeeded in cutting it back."
"This means that we shall obtain less competitiveness than we might otherwise have had."
"It means fewer new jobs and fewer new companies."
"It is not what Europeans expect."
"Together with other Conservatives, I shall support the compromise, not because it is what we are looking for but because it is a step in the right direction."
"I wish, however, to emphasise that I do not accept the picture presented, in terms of which we are concerned here with a conflict between East and West and between new and old Member States."
"What we have instead is a division between those who want to see the trade in services produce further European integration and cooperation, borders that are more open and a greater number of new jobs, and those who take a different view."
"We shall make efforts to have private health care added to the directive, to have the Posting Directive made clearly and unambiguously open to all and to prevent any discrimination against the people of any country."
"We shall also endeavour to make it possible to have temporary agencies included in the area covered by the directive."
"I want to say the following to the Commission: this is a first step, and you have a responsibility to ensure that we take more steps in the direction set out by the Treaty."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am taking the floor to explain why I shall vote for this directive, together with the rest of my delegation."
"We are certain that it represents the beginning of the way ahead and a step forwards in strengthening the idea of completing the internal market."
"From that point of view, mine is a safe vote."
"I should like, however, to comment on what has been happening within the political groups over the last year and a half, and above all in the last few weeks, as well as this afternoon and evening here in this Chamber."
"It demonstrates – and I want to be perfectly clear about this – that effectively there is a difference within the 25 Member States."
"It is the difference between those who believe that we can achieve growth and development by taking a gamble and investing in what is new, in innovation, flexibility, the possibility of working in a freer, more open market and, above all, in a market of almost 500 million people, and those who instead believe that what they have achieved so far can best be defended by closing in on themselves."
"That has been the real conflict."
"That is why I hope that the close of this debate will also see an end to the argument based on a division between old and new countries, because there has never been such a division."
"Instead, there has been a different division, which has led to a directive which, in my view, is only a first step."
"Nonetheless, I shall vote for it with conviction, because I consider that even a small step forwards is, in any case, important."
"Mr President, it is rather ironic that we should be debating the Services Directive on Valentine’s Day, because, for the Services Directive – but certainly also for Mr Bolkestein – this must surely be a case of unrequited love."
"Last month we overwhelmingly rejected the Port Services Directive and, this time round, we could almost have done the same, were it not for the fact that the Commission proposal will be transformed by this House into a compromise – not the best one, perhaps, but one which can still be workable and which, crucially, strikes a balance between our objective of opening up the services market and our intention of addressing the social concerns that are justified."
"I stress ‘justified concerns’ because we all know by now that this proposal has been plagued by scaremongering."
"Coming from a new Member State, this scaremongering seems like déjà vu."
"In my country, opponents of EU membership used to conjure up nightmare scenarios that foreign workers would invade us and take our jobs."
"The same Cassandras played the same act in the old Member States too, but now we know that the doomsday scenarios were just not true: they did not materialise, nor will they materialise with the Services Directive."
"The opening-up of the services market is good and we should say so loud and clear."
"It is good for business – in particular for SMEs – and it is good for jobs."
"We have a reasonable compromise."
"I say ‘let’s go for it’."
"Mr President, it is very late at night for such a serious debate and the Commissioner must be tired."
"I should like to make just a few points which might freshen up the debate, or perhaps make you even more tired, Commissioner!"
"At the beginning of today’s debate I thought that it might be just an ideological clash between protectionism and an attempt to liberalise the market in services."
"I admit that I was a dreamer."
"Unfortunately it is more serious than that: the debate over the watered-down directive is beginning to bear the hallmarks of a clash between the new and the old."
"We are used to listening to endless speculation about why people in the Member States do not understand the brave new European ideas."
"Why should they?"
"I am a Member of the European Parliament representing the Czech Republic and defending the interests of the Czechs."
"The Czech Republic fully liberalised access to its market in the early 1990s."
"Many traditional but inefficient companies had to close."
"That resulted in a higher unemployment rate and heavy political losses."
"Is it not fair to expect the same of the old Member States?"
"Go to any Czech town situated somewhere on the Czech/Austrian border and try to explain to a local service provider that he or she cannot provide their service in the same way as their Austrian competitors – and I stress, – in their Czech town. I bet you will not succeed."
"Try to talk about noble European ideals and say in the same breath that they are not allowed to run their businesses freely wherever they choose."
"The idea of opening the internal market was a brave one, but today’s reality is just the proverbial crying over spilled milk."
"I thank the Czech interpreters for their valiant work."
"Mr President, it is difficult to make any real contribution to the services directive debate in a two-minute time-slot."
"This directive is attempting to achieve a massive amount in one brave step."
"That is why the debate has been so robust and why all groups have had Members working on this directive almost full time in recent months."
"In this regard, I want to recognise the work of Mr Harbour in particular, who has put an enormous amount of effort into bringing the compromise wording this far on behalf of the PPE-DE Group."
"However, in the intensity of debate on specific amendments, particularly relating to Article 16 on the freedom to provide services, let us not lose sight of the overall objective of what we are trying to achieve."
"This is the first stage of a process that aims to create a directive that will promote a more open and better-functioning internal market for services."
"If adopted in the right form, this directive can facilitate growth, job creation and increased economic activity in the services sector."
"The reality is that the EU economy needs a kick-start."
"This directive can contribute to that."
"Sixty-eight per cent of EU employment and over 60 % of wealth creation comes from the services sector and, therefore, services are the key driver for the sluggish EU economy."
"In short, this new compromise directive may not give all political groups all of what they want, but it will remove many barriers to cross-border trade and services and reduce the red tape that businesses encounter when they try to expand into other EU countries."
"A balance between the protection of employment law and collective agreements within the EU Member States and opening up a more efficient market for services has been achieved through compromise."
"I hope this Parliament will give a strong mandate to the Commission to carry this directive forward with renewed momentum following Thursday’s vote, and I look forward to seeing a further improved version of this directive before Parliament in the not-too-distant future."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it probably goes without saying that the adoption of this directive will be a highly important political event."
"If Parliament adopts the directive by a large majority, however, the political signal it sends out will be even more significant, since it will once again confirm the role that we play in the legislative process as mediators between the bureaucracy of Europe and the individuality of each of the Member States."
"As mediators, we have a duty to balance the demands for liberalisation of the market with the rights of the weaker sections of society."
"I consider the compromise of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to be valid in leading towards the liberalisation of a sector that accounts for a very great part of our economy, a sector that the Treaty defines as a fundamental freedom."
"We certainly could have gone further towards liberalisation, but one cannot have everything all at once."
"The five-year revision clause will enable us to improve the text and continue the process of liberalisation."
"With regard to the economic aspect, we have set ourselves ambitious targets in terms of growth and employment."
"I should like to comment on certain amendments that have been tabled, especially Amendments 13, 72, 73 and 86. Not only do they exclude services of general interest, but they leave it to the discretion of each individual Member State to define the concepts and the public service requirements to which such services are subject."
"Amendment 13, moreover, excludes the obligation for Member States to liberalise such services or to privatise public bodies and existing monopolies, such as lotteries."
"Amendments 17 and 80 also propose again to exclude games of chance."
"I believe that we should examine these amendments during the general debate."
"Mr President, the Commissioner will be relieved that we are getting very close to the end."
"I am the third to last speaker."
"It was last April, in the heat of the run-up to the French referendum vote, that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted Mr Chatzimarkakis’ opinion on the Services Directive."
"That opinion challenged the then prevalent hostility to this directive, with the absurdly exaggerated claims about Polish plumbers and social dumping that were then being thrown around."
"From its very first directly elected plenary in 1979, this Parliament has championed the cause of a truly free and open single market, as envisaged in the original Treaties."
"Out of an internal subcommittee of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, of which I was proud to be a member, came the Kangaroo Group and the 1992 single market programme under the Single European Act of 1985."
"I find it difficult to understand or justify why services were left out of that enterprise."
"Now is our opportunity to emulate the courage and foresight of our predecessors and make sure that a real single market in services is implemented."
"Trade unionists, French ‘no’ voters, French plumbers: truly there is nothing to be afraid of."
"Just as a single market in goods has provided new, more and better jobs, so will the Services Directive, if we vote through a strong and liberal version."
"It can provide the opportunities that everyone seeks, especially in SMEs, as an essential element of a successful, competitive and prosperous European economy."
"The opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which took a liberal line, was supported by 34 votes to 6, by conservatives, liberals and even most of the socialists."
"I hope we can look to Parliament as a whole to adopt a similarly courageous and far-sighted position."
"Adam Smith was right: freed-up trade works; a really free and open market in services will work and get more and more Europeans back into work."
"Mr President, I would like warmly to thank Commissioner McCreevy and the members of my group, Mr Harbour, Mrs Thyssen and others, who have been fighting to defend a directive and who have had to watch what we considered to be the best aspects of it disappearing before their very eyes."
"I must say that we politicians and people in power sometimes fall behind society, and I say this because there are two aspects of the directive that are of great interest to me and that are unfortunately not going to be taken up to a great extent: on the one hand, the recognition of qualifications and freedom to work for skilled people and, on the other, the issue of health."
"I believe that in Europe, when people go to another country to work, it is much easier for them to work in manual jobs, in under-recognised jobs, even if they are highly qualified, because corporate egotism does not allow anything else."
"We have not been able to remove this obstacle."
"I would like to talk, secondly, about health."
"The directive included the facility or obligation to return funds to those residents of one country who receive medical assistance in another."
"The Mediterranean is packed with millions of Europeans who have gone South in search of sun and a new life, but their right to reimbursement of the funds relating to the social services – and, in particular, health services - they receive is not recognised."
"They are in a situation of uncertainty and they are in a difficult situation, but, above all, they have been abandoned by the politicians."
"And I would say the same with regard to private medicine."
"I therefore support the inclusion of private medicine, because we have hundreds of clinics that are treating and assisting the Germans, the British and the Swedes who are in the South and in the Mediterranean."
"These citizens have the right to speak in their own languages, to be treated in their own languages and to have services provided in their own languages."
"This situation exists; society has created it, and we do not want to recognise it."
"Mr President, Mr McCreevy, ladies and gentlemen, the goal of the Services Directive is to foster economic growth and employment in the European Union."
"Currently a large number of administrative obstacles impede the effective functioning of the EU internal market."
"The most negative impact of administrative obstacles and the costs associated with them is on the ability of the SME sector to offer services outside their own countries."
"The services sector makes up about 70% of the EU economy, and so the removal of administrative obstacles in this sector would give a significant boost to its development."
"Analysis by the European Commission shows that in the period from 1992 to 2002 measures taken to improve the EU internal labour market and to open up the EU’s internal borders increased the EU’s GDP by 1.8% and created two and a half million new jobs."
"This increase was mainly achieved by ensuring free movement of goods and liberalising the telecommunications and energy sectors."
"The European Commission’s analysis also shows that a properly functioning EU internal services market could bring about equal growth in the economy and jobs."
"It is therefore important to vote for a strong Services Directive which includes the country of origin principle, at least in the variant voted for by the European Parliament’s Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, maintaining those articles of the directive that lay down the rights of service providers regarding the posting of workers to a country where services are being provided, and also restricting the list of exceptions."
"Leaving out these principles would considerably distort the meaning of the Services Directive, and opportunities for additional EU economic growth would be missed."
"Some of the European Parliament’s Members are trying to seriously distort the significance of the Services Directive and to implement a protectionist policy in relation to service providers from the new Member States, without taking into account the economic losses which that would cause to the European Union as a whole."
"The vote by the European Parliament will demonstrate whether the majority of Members see the future of the EU economy as a dynamic and open EU internal market or as a protectionist jungle of 25 Member States."
". Mr President, we have had a lengthy and lively discussion."
"You certainly do not need caffeine to keep you alert during such a stimulating debate."
"I would like to thank all participants for their contributions representing various perspectives."
"We have heard all the arguments for and against this proposal."
"What is clear to me is that despite the divergences there is a strong body of opinion in support of a services directive, a common wish to arrive at a broad understanding of how we should go forward."
"I welcome that."
"It demonstrates the vital role that the European Parliament can play in reconciling the many different opinions expressed in this House."
"On the basis of today’s debate, I feel confident that Parliament can lead the way forward in building the consensus that this proposal needs if it is to be adopted."
"We owe a debt of gratitude to the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and group leaders for their constructive approach."
"I said that the Commission will take full account of those amendments that find a broad consensus here."
"I believe we are close to that consensus, particularly with regard to the scope of the proposal and the freedom to provide services as set out in Article 16."
"I was heartened to hear so many speakers say that they wanted a services directive with real added value."
"That is why we should keep any further sectoral exemptions from the scope to a minimum, and we need to pay particular attention to the wording of Article 16."
"There can be no going back on Treaty provisions or court jurisdiction."
"In reply to Mr Watson’s criticism of our efforts to help build bridges on Article 16, it is a pity he did not check the source of the draft text that he found fault with. It did not come from my office, but then I am used to being accused of many things – good and bad – for which I have no responsibility."
"Turning to the substance of today’s debate and the posting of workers, I have much sympathy for those who are concerned about what they see as unnecessary administrative burdens placed on workers who are posted to another Member State."
"There is Community law and court jurisprudence which must be respected."
"If you vote by a large majority to delete Articles 24 and 25, then the Commission will come forward quickly with guidance on that key initiative."
"It is important that the message that comes with this debate and the vote on Thursday is one of Europe moving forward in proposing a framework for a better services directive which will provide the incentives and confidence necessary for businesses, entrepreneurs and consumers to take full advantage of our internal market by investing in new opportunities and developing and buying new services which will create more jobs and growth."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 10 a.m."
"– The services directive, which will be put to the vote on Thursday in Strasbourg, provides a chance to demonstrate to the 450 million European citizens that Europe and especially Parliament are listening to the people’s demands and concerns and are trying to reconcile them with a strategy of growth and development that only harmonisation and a real opening-up of economic activities can provide."
"The text that I hope will come out of this plenary will be a watered-down document, with grey areas that will need clarification."
"However, in a diversified context like Europe, with new countries seeking opportunities and old countries trying to protect themselves, with small and large enterprises and 25 different legal systems, compromise is the only way to proceed."
"We must therefore welcome the commitment shown by all the political groups and players concerned to reach an agreement."
"It is an important opportunity for Europe to recover its confidence and to relaunch its bid for a kind of economic growth that will not damage our social model; that bid has unfortunately lost credibility in recent months."
"We need growth and we need to revitalise our economy, and the services directive is an important initial measure, provided that the welfare and rights of our workers are not called into question."
"– The directive on establishing an internal market in services was proposed by the Commission when its President was the social democrat Romano Prodi, and has now been taken on by the current Commission under Mr Barroso’s leadership."
"This proposal plays a central role in the onslaught of capitalism in the EU."
"It is a proposal that panders to the interests of the large multinationals by paving the way for them to exploit the workers and dominate further economic sectors."
"What is being proposed is the total liberalisation of services, including public services, which will have detrimental consequences for the workers and for the sovereignty of individual Member States."
"If it is adopted, this proposal would act as a lever, a kind of ‘Trojan Horse’ to undermine salaries, collective work contracts and workers’ rights. It will also act against the Member States’ ability to provide effective protection for public services, and, in general, to control how those services are provided."
"It is impossible to ‘reform’ this proposal, as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are seeking to do, in an attempt to retain the core negative elements of the directive and, at the same time, to save face."
"As the workers have been demanding and as we have been calling for from the outset, this directive must be rejected."
"The existence of barriers in the European market in services leads to higher prices, restricted economic growth and fewer new jobs."
"Are lower growth, fewer jobs and higher prices really what Europeans want?"
"I do not think so."
"Above all else, Europeans want more jobs."
"Why should politicians obstruct this?"
"Certain self-styled defenders of working people want to emasculate the directive, and to render it toothless."
"It could be argued that these individuals are in favour of liberalising the services market or even against doing so."
"I certainly agree that the directive impacts on sensitive issues."
"We cannot bury our heads in the sand, however."
"I wonder if the directive's opponents have given careful consideration to competitiveness and the future of service providers, and whether they really do want a single market."
"There has been a lot of talk about equality, but it seems to be an Orwellian equality, just for those that are 'more equal'."
"There has also been talk of protecting social achievements, but this seems to mean protecting them in the rich countries only, not in the whole of Europe."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises create the most jobs."
"Services make the greatest contribution to Europe's GDP."
"Let us give entrepreneurs a chance."
"Let us give the 20 million unemployed Europeans a chance."
"Let us give the entrepreneurial spirit a chance."
"We have an opportunity to do good."
"We must not waste it."
"That is why we must vote against the amendments that would water down the directive, hamper its implementation and threaten the achievement of the desired results."
"Let us choose real freedom."
"We cannot allow national egoism and protectionism to harm Europe."
"– The report by Mrs Gebhardt on the Bolkestein directive has come to plenary today for debate and vote."
"In essence, this is a reworking of the shadowy Bildeberg Club to impose the steamroller of globalisation and the rules of the new order."
"As an elected member of the European Parliament (and not elected by some party power controlled by the persons of the new order), I am absolutely opposed to the philosophies reworked in the directive in question, which executes in cold blood decades of workers' rights."
"As chairman of the Popular Orthodox Rally in Greece, I shall encourage all the groups attacked by the directive to engage in full resistance."
"I did not take part in the debate, simply because the presence of all those who are ideologically opposed legalises the extreme positions of the person who inspired the directive."
"I voted against the directive and I wish this statement to be entered in the Minutes."
"Seventy per cent of Europe’s GDP is now based on services."
"The biggest gap in completing the Single European Market is in the Services sector."
"If we could create a dynamic single market for services, around 600 000 new jobs could be created in the EU."
"Removing the administrative and technical barriers to companies operating outside their own country is therefore a desirable and important objective and opens up the sector to fair competition."
"However, driving down workers’ rights, wages and health and safety measures has no part in creating a dynamic service sector and that is why I will be voting for amendments that exclude labour law and free collective bargaining from the scope of the directive."
"I also believe that certain services such as health, social services and aspects of education are so sensitive that they should not be covered by this particular measure."
"Mr McCreevy, I was once lost in the rural roads of your home county."
"Asking directions of a gentleman I passed, I was told ‘well, I wouldn’t start from over here’."
"I pass this piece of advice to you, Commissioner: if you want to smoothly facilitate free and easy movement of services throughout our 25 countries, I wouldn’t start from here."
"‘Here’ being a vague and incomprehensible mess that will be defined in our courts."
"‘Here’ being a recipe for chaos, creating a situation where we will potentially become 25 different systems of regulation and business moving to the country with the most regulatory advantages, creating a crisis in which the only solution will be complete federal harmonisation, and who wants that?"
"– The next item is the Commission statement on the new financial instrument for development in connection with the Millennium Goals."
". Mr President, the Commission was asked last week by the European Parliament to make a statement on innovative sources of financing for development cooperation."
"Commissioner Michel cannot be here tonight as he is travelling to eastern Africa to previous engagements which could not be rescheduled."
"He is extremely sorry not to be able to share with you the Commission’s views on this topic and has asked me to step in for him."
"Aid needs to be substantially increased if the Millennium Development Goals are to be achieved."
"The European Union has not shied away from its responsibilities towards its partner countries."
"Quite the contrary: the European Council of June 2005 forcefully restated its support for the Millennium Development Goals with ambitious commitments on both the quality and the quantity of aid."
"In particular, the European Council has committed itself to increasing official development assistance with the aim of achieving a target of 0.7% of gross national income in 2015."
"To that end, a collective target of 0.56% of GNI has been fixed for 2010."
"However, more aid will not be enough."
"We need to ensure that current and promised increases in financing are provided in ways which actually help countries meet their commitments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"In the recently approved joint statement by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on the European consensus for development, the European Union commits itself to the more predictable and less volatile aid mechanisms."
"The Commission believes that innovative mechanisms for financing development have a useful role to play."
"For this reason during 2005, at the request of the Council, the Commission produced a series of staff working papers providing technical analysis of innovative sources of financing for development."
"In addition, in April 2005, the Commission adopted a communication to the Council and the European Parliament, ‘Accelerating progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals – Financing for Development and Aid Effectiveness’."
"Amongst other things, this communication discussed innovative sources of financing and new delivery aid mechanisms and invited the Council to ‘agree to accelerate work on the most promising options for innovative additional sources of finance’."
"The Commission noted that any innovative sources of financing must be assessed in light of a number of criteria. For example: how much would each proposal raise?"
"To what extent would the funds be additional to existing commitments?"
"How stable and predictable would they be?"
"What are the competitiveness and sectoral impacts?"
"What would the launch and administration costs be?"
"Which proposals can go forward fastest?"
"Is universal support required or can proposals be implemented at regional – that is EU – level?"
"The Commission notes France’s readiness to start implementation of one of the proposals emerging from that debate, namely, the imposition of a solidarity contribution on all air tickets sold in France as of July 2006."
"This initiative may have a positive effect on other countries’ readiness to carry forward initiatives in the area of financing for development."
"The Commission would also like to inform the European Parliament that, to support the debate and preserve the momentum on these issues, a technical workshop between the Commission and Member State representatives was held on 9 February 2006."
"The workshop touched upon the existing initiatives, as well as possible alternatives with respect to innovative financing."
"The Commission, however, also looked at ways in which existing aid arrangements could be modified and complemented so as to deliver resources in more predictable ways."
"Finally, the Commission would like to note that, during the workshop, the French representatives gave an update on the high-level conference to be held in Paris on 28 February and 1 March."
"Representatives of the Commission will be present at that event."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union must play a leading role in ensuring that the Millennium Development Goals are attained."
"Ever since the Monterrey Conference in 2002 and the United Nations Summit in September 2005, the international community has recognised the need to rise to the challenge of development by executing a common policy integrating the Millennium Goals."
"At a time when the gap between the North and the South is ever widening and when the growing prosperity of industrialised countries is plunging many countries of the South back into poverty, it is high time the involvement of the international community took the form of practical measures."
"While the European Union is the main donor, it must do more today; it must work more effectively and it must move more swiftly."
"The European consensus on development and the new strategy for Africa are steps in the right direction, as was the recent announcement of the creation of a European fund to finance African projects, and I am delighted at these breakthroughs."
"Despite the increase in traditional public aid, the current figures show that the attainment of the Millennium Goals hinges on the adoption of mechanisms of complementary funding."
"On the initiative of several Member States, innovative and complementary financial instruments are being created."
"The European Union must work on implementing these instruments so as to produce stable and predictable resources needed to meet the unfulfilled requirements of developing countries, particularly in the health care sector."
"Several Member States already support these initiatives."
"Commissioner, you pointed out that some of these countries, including France, committed themselves to implementing international solidarity contributions, for example on flight tickets."
"At the next ministerial conference, the Member States will strengthen the international consensus on the need to introduce innovative and practical sources of funding."
"This meeting must provide the opportunity to build on the momentum generated in New York during the last United Nations Summit."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to talk about the potential offered by the International Financing Facility proposed by the UK Chancellor Gordon Brown."
"The IFF leverages money from international capital markets by issuing bonds which can potentially raise USD 50 billion each year from 2005 to 2015."
"The advantage of this, referring to some of the points you raised in your introduction, Commissioner, is that this money is frontloaded, it is long term, it is stable and it is predictable money."
"It raises one billion a year, which can be used to get children into school and to abolish the fees that jeopardise the education of millions of children in developing countries, especially little girls."
"The IFF has already put in place a pilot scheme for immunisation, which is searching for vaccines for malaria and for HIV/AIDS – the scourge in Africa and many other parts of the world – for which there is no cure."
"The agreement is to provide a global advanced purchasing scheme to make sure that life-saving vaccines are commercially produced at affordable prices and that these are produced in ways of which we in this Parliament should all approve and which we should find essential at this time."
"We acknowledge that meeting the Millennium Development Goals, which is part of the purpose of this debate, is difficult, but if we can put the money in place – predictable money – then we will get every child into school and we will prevent the needless deaths of 30 000 children every day."
"That is what we are talking about; that is about us trying to translate hope into reality."
"When he heard about the IFF, Nelson Mandela said that it was an absolutely necessary and timely initiative that deserves an active response from the international community."
"I very much hope that the European Union will support this initiative firmly and in a very committed way."
". Mr President, my group welcomes this resolution."
"There is broad consensus that under-financing and under-investment, in Africa in particular, have played a significant part in holding developing countries back."
"Economists like the American Jeremy Sachs admit that development assistance to Africa to date has been peanuts when measured against the scale of infrastructure investment that is required."
"The title of this resolution is somewhat restrictive and mentions a new financial instrument as if there were only one solution to the problem, but the text is fortunately much broader."
"The nub of the problem is that we have to find ways to finance development over and above the national commitment to 0.7%."
"The resolution floats the idea of a solidarity contribution on air tickets, but that should not be the only avenue, and like Mrs Kinnock I should like to suggest other possibilities."
"Firstly, Member States can simply decide to accelerate the timetable for reaching the 0.7% GDP target and indeed go beyond it."
"In Britain the Liberal Democrats have pledged to reach the 0.7% by 2011, two years ahead of the deadline set by the present UK Government."
"Secondly, there is a role for foreign direct investment."
"No country has ever been lifted out of poverty by aid alone and countries which have enjoyed the most spectacular rates of development, such as China, have enjoyed high levels of FDI."
"The problem is that when foreign investment is negotiated via bilateral investment treaties or as proposed by the WTO at Cancún, it can involve exploitation of the weaker partner and the waiving of environmental and social protection."
"What is needed is a new international investment agreement under the auspices of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development."
"In conclusion, we should explore as many ways as possible for levering extra investment into development, but the methods we choose must have public support and they must never be covert."
". Mr President, I thank the Commissioner."
"One of the reasons why we are discussing this issue tonight is because there is an international conference in Paris at the end of this month, a key opportunity to make progress on the subject of innovative sources of finance for development."
"My group particularly welcomes the fact that this meeting looks set to agree an air ticket levy with proceeds going to benefit some of the world’s poorest people."
"Of course there are a range of other tools and instruments as well."
"Mrs Kinnock has already spoken very eloquently about the benefits of the IFF."
"However, I believe that the air ticket levy is also important because it marks a turning point in the quest for the introduction of global levies for the financing of global development needs."
"It deserves our full support."
"I would stress, however, that the new finances must be genuinely new: in other words, additional to, and not a substitute for, existing development budgets."
"I am very glad that the Commission will be represented at the meeting in Paris, but I would like to know whether it has plans to encourage the other Member States to go, whether there will be a mechanism for feeding back to Parliament the results of the meeting in Paris, and whether there are plans to share the contents of the workshop that took place on 9 February between the Commission and the Council."
"I am sure that many of us would be very interested to know."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party and as a member of the Committee on Development."
"The data and figures on poverty send this House a deafening appeal for help."
"Over a billion people in the world live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than a dollar a day."
"Millions of children still die each year through lack of appropriate health care, clean water, decent dwellings and adequate nutrition, while 20 000 people a day die of causes linked to a shortage of food."
"In the current state of technological development and agricultural production, the fact that this situation persists is economically irrational, politically unacceptable and morally shameful."
"We are therefore eagerly and hopefully looking forward to the work of the forthcoming Paris conference, although we are well aware that not only are greater resources needed, but also other kinds of resources, which must be diverse, innovative and also, perhaps, predictable and stable."
"The biggest scandal is not that there is still hunger in the world, but that it persists even though the international community has the means to eliminate it."
"The time really has come to turn words into action."
"Mr President, the international debate on substantially increasing development aid from the leading industrialised nations had intensified – and that is a comforting situation – because it is highly likely that we will fail to reach the development goals set by the international community at the turn of the millennium."
"There is international consensus that a significant increase in public development funding is needed if we are to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and thus halve poverty in the developing countries."
"In its 2004 report, the OECD development centre emphasises the importance of the speed with which the additional funds can be made available."
"Time, and the growing poverty in many developing countries, is therefore pressing."
"The European Parliament must use the decision to continue to exert pressure on the Member States to achieve the 0.7% threshold for funding provided for development cooperation and to press those Member States – including my own – that do not yet have a plan of how to achieve this by 2015 to draw up such a plan as soon as possible."
"It is also important for us to emphasise that these innovative funding methods always involve additional resources."
"We must not find any forms of funding that are financed by commitments we have already made."
"It has already been mentioned that the international financial facility is a method of doubling the necessary development funding."
"However, I think it is a shame that the compromise on the table does not take into account other methods that will be required if we are going to provide enough money in the future."
"Perhaps we could improve it further tomorrow."
"Mr President, Commissioner, for 30 years now, the wealthy countries have been unable to fulfil the commitment they made before the UN to increase their development aid to 0.7%."
"This is a scandal, and we are all here to search for new ideas."
"I find it very regrettable that the Commission should have so few of them, and that the communication that you have been asked to read should be so flimsy."
"You did not even mention the British idea of a tax on the movement of capital."
"You only mentioned a French idea of a tax on the movement of aeroplanes."
"In this quest for new ideas, allow me to propose another one to you."
"I believe that it was in its document issued in April 2005 that the Commission proposed the idea of a global lottery."
"Mr Michel, whom I myself questioned during a sitting in this very Chamber, acknowledged that this was an option."
"You did not even take it up."
"Commissioner, I think that the option of a global lottery is easier to follow through than many other options."
"The World Food Programme, which took up this idea with the aim of looking into it further, concluded that, on the basis of an estimated minimum of 1% of our countries’ turnover being spent on each draw, four draws per year would raise an annual sum of USD 400 million, which the World Food Programme proposes allocating to the measures aimed at preventing children in the world from starving."
"Why did not the Commission put its own stamp on this idea?"
"I take no pleasure whatsoever in searching for a solution outside our budgets: our countries should be quite serious about doing what they say they are going to do, but given that they are incapable of keeping their promises, this new idea at least has the virtue of not bothering anyone and of being unrestricted, if, in each of the Member States, it is the legislative authority that allocates this share of the profit to the World Food Programme instead of to the local State authorities."
"Setting up a global lottery is an easy thing to do."
"I therefore suggest to the Commission that it take the initiative in setting up the lottery and firmly encourages our Member States to implement it."
"– I have received five motions for resolutions under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 10 a.m."
"Mr President, I should like to talk about our agenda."
"The issues that we are going to discuss this morning are absolutely essential, and I am delighted that our House is able to do so calmly and in a spirit of mutual understanding."
"Nevertheless, other subjects had been proposed for inclusion on the agenda, in particular the analysis of the impact of Mittal Steel's hostile bid for Arcelor on the European Union as a whole."
"I believe that it would have been appropriate for our House to have given its opinion on that subject."
"Mrs Berès, this is not a point of order."
"I appreciate that you wish to talk about this issue, but if you have risen on a point of order, I am afraid that the Presidency must inform you that this is not one and that unfortunately I cannot allow you to carry on speaking."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the right to freedom of expression and respect for religious beliefs."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the controversy we have seen in recent weeks over the caricatures that appeared in a Danish newspaper undoubtedly represents a most regrettable development, in that it touches on something the EU Member States and the EU itself have been striving for over many years: mutual trust and constructive cooperation among the various religious communities in our countries."
"The trust and goodwill seen in all the Member States and also expressed by the institutions of the European Union in recent years seem to have been badly shaken."
"We have seen violent demonstrations that have even claimed lives."
"EU representations and other Member State institutions in various countries have been attacked and damaged."
"Threats have been issued and boycotts imposed."
"This is a deeply regrettable development, which must prompt us to ask ourselves what has gone wrong and what can be done to prevent such events in future."
"A number of principles of our co-existence are at stake and should be discussed in conjunction with this issue."
"Firstly, there is a consensus that any form of violence, any violent reaction by militant groups, is to be condemned, as the Council Presidency has explicitly done from the outset."
"We also expect the governments responsible to be aware of their responsibilities, including under international law, and to take appropriate preventive measures."
"It is now important to help calm and defuse any violence or violent confrontations."
"The Council Presidency has been exercising its own political responsibility since the very start of these events."
"As early as 30 January, the Council assured Denmark, Sweden and all the other countries concerned of its complete solidarity, whilst the Ministers for Foreign Affairs in the Council also emphasised the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression, which represent a cornerstone of the values championed by the European Union."
"Freedom of expression is an important asset, one we must defend and, indeed, for which we have fought long in our societies throughout European history."
"At the same time, however, the exercise of the right of free expression, as of any right, entails a great deal of responsibility, on the part of both individuals and institutions."
"Early on, the EU, and also the United Nations and other organisations, a notable example being the Organization of the Islamic Conference, issued statements attempting to clarify the principles that must be adhered to in the course of this debate."
"The joint statement by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy of 7 February was very important in this regard, putting particular emphasis on responsible conduct where people’s religious convictions are concerned as well as on freedom of expression, which entails responsibility – a personal responsibility – on the part of the press."
"Our societies do not permit governments to dictate what the independent press may say or may not say, provided it is within the limits set by the legal systems; which is a good thing."
"These legal systems must conform to international standards, in particular to the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The statement of 7 February I referred to also rejects and condemns violent attacks and calls for dialogue."
"On 8 February, Ursula Plassnik, Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs and President of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, had a telephone conversation with Abdullah Gül, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"Our involvement of Turkey in the endeavours to calm the situation has been a conscious decision, as that country is particularly well placed to play a very active, constructive role in promoting dialogue between Europe and the Islamic world."
"Austria has also, therefore, invited the High Level Group on the alliance of civilisations – which is under the auspices of the United Nations – to hold its next meeting in Austria."
"Austrian Chancellor Schüssel, President of the European Council, issued a statement, also on 8 February, expressing his consternation at images on the website of an Islamic emigrants’ organisation in Antwerp and at the call by the Iranian newspaper for a Holocaust-cartoon contest."
"We must also take a clear position condemning and rejecting such initiatives and calls."
"As you know, the High Representative for the CFSP, Javier Solana, is currently in the Middle East."
"On 13 February, he met with the Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, to discuss the possibility of a targeted dialogue between Europe and the Islamic world."
"The Secretary General and the High Representative will continue this discussion with the Secretary General of the League of Arab States and with representatives of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority and Israel."
"The Council, and also individual Member States, will actively promote the dialogue with the Islamic world and continue along this path of dialogue between civilisations, and between religious communities."
"Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs Tuomioja, too, has already announced that dialogue will be a key preoccupation of the Finnish Presidency."
"Our Presidency will also take further steps to help calm the situation."
"The possibility of enhanced dialogue between the EU and the Islamic world will be an important topic at the next General Affairs and External Relations Council on 27 and 28 February."
"The present crisis calls for leadership on the part of the elected political representatives of the EU."
"Of course, this leadership cannot and should not consist in attempts by the state to impose a code of conduct on the media."
"I have already emphasised the importance to EU values of freedom of expression and freedom of the press, and on no account should this hard-won freedom from censorship be put at risk."
"As the European Court of Human Rights has made clear in very many fundamental rulings, this freedom also extends to permitting new, controversial ideas and any kind of discussion, and also entails the freedom to both make mistakes and sharply criticise the mistakes of others."
"As the European Court of Human Rights stated in a fundamental ruling 20 years ago, freedom of expression also extends to potentially offensive or irritating material."
"The Court has also stated, however, that this freedom of expression must of course be subject to limits; that is, where the feelings – particularly religious feelings – of others could be offended."
"The EU’s political leadership must now take the form of our conveying credibly that freedom of expression and respect for other cultures and religions do not contradict each other, but rather complement and are compatible with each other."
"We believe that the response to the present crisis should not be less freedom of expression, but rather credible commitment by a democratic, pluralist Europe to dialogue between cultures and civilisations."
"We must convey to the world’s Muslim communities that we wish to continue to work alongside them in developing a relationship built on trust."
"We must communicate to our Muslim fellow citizens in the EU that this Union is a good place, where they and the adherents of other religions are respected and can feel at home, and where they have the opportunity of democratic participation."
"It is important that our response to this challenge be based, in particular, on the trust that has been successfully built up in all Member States in the past years, both among religious communities and between politicians and religious communities."
"I should like to draw the House’s attention to a number of activities that have taken place in my own country, Austria, as this situation very much calls for Member States, too, to assume their responsibilities; and, of course, the Council is also dependent on the activities of the individual Member States in its role as spokesperson on its own behalf and that of the EU as a whole."
"One of the most important conversations Austria’s leading representatives have held in recent days in an attempt to defuse the situation is the one that took place on 7 February between Foreign Minister Plassnik and Anas Schakfeh, President of the Islamic Communities of Austria."
"This emphasised the importance of peaceful co-existence among the various religious communities in our countries and stated that the important thing now is to stand side by side and ensure that our ongoing discussions, which have proved valuable in practice, are also outwardly visible."
"This is a culture of dialogue that Austria, like all other Member States, has built up over the years, and which now has to prove itself in a crisis."
"In recent months, Austria has seen some very important events, such as a major conference on the subject of ‘Islam in a pluralist society’, attended by large numbers of religious and political leaders: the President of Afghanistan, the President of Iraq, the former President of Iran, religious dignitaries from all religious communities."
"Two days ago, the Austrian Chancellor invited all the leaders of the large state-recognised religious communities in Austria to a meeting, at which all participants were unanimous in emphasising that peaceful coexistence, and peaceful – including critical – dialogue, is the only way to prevent developments of the kind seen in recent weeks."
"It is important to continue this dialogue, therefore; but also to defend our values, such as the right of free expression."
". Mr President, the publication of cartoons in Danish and other European newspapers and the reactions to this have revealed sensitive and fundamental issues."
"The cartoons have aggrieved many Muslims all over the world."
"We must respect these sensitivities and the expression of them through peaceful protest, which is a fundamental right in any open society."
"I share the views expressed by Prime Minister Rasmussen, where he made clear that his government respects Islam as one of the world’s major religions and that it has no intention of insulting Muslims and does not support activities in this sense."
"Today, I should like personally to emphasise my deep respect for Islamic civilisation and the contribution it has made and continues to make to Europe."
"The Commission’s concern is not with the peaceful response of the majority to the cartoons."
"It is with the violent reactions of a minority; reactions which have been disowned by many Muslims."
"Therefore the Commission condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the violence perpetrated against our office in Gaza, and against the missions of the Member States, in particular those of Denmark."
"It is ironic that the aim of these missions is to bring real benefits to the lives of the people of their host countries."
"A trade boycott is not an appropriate way of addressing the issue, either: it would hurt the economic interests of all parties and could damage the growing trading links between the European Union and the countries concerned."
"Trade, and the greater interconnections it brings, is a means to promote mutual understanding."
"Let us be clear: a boycott of Danish goods is by definition a boycott of European goods."
"I have spoken with the Prime Minister of Denmark and expressed the solidarity of the Commission."
"I want here today to send my solidarity to the people of Denmark as well; a people who rightly enjoy the reputation of being amongst the most open and tolerant not just in Europe, but in the world."
"I welcome here today their representatives in the form of a delegation from the Danish Parliament."
"I have also spoken with the President-in-Office of the Council, Chancellor Schüssel."
"The Commission will continue to work with the Austrian Presidency and all parties to resolve the problem peacefully and efficiently."
"This issue raises wider themes."
"Our European society is based on respect for the individual person’s life and freedom, equality of rights between men and women, freedom of speech, and a clear distinction between politics and religion."
"Our point of departure is that as human beings we are free, independent, equal and responsible."
"We must safeguard these principles."
"Freedom of speech is part of Europe’s values and traditions."
"Let me be clear: freedom of speech is not negotiable."
"Like all freedoms, its preservation depends on responsible use by individuals."
"We all condemn all forms of prejudice and discrimination wherever and whenever they are expressed."
"But governments or other public authorities do not prescribe or authorise the opinions expressed by individuals."
"Conversely, the opinions expressed by individuals engage these individuals, and only them. They do not engage a country, a people, a religion and we should not allow others to pretend that they do."
"Freedom of speech and freedom of the press is the basis not only of the possibility to publish an opinion or a cartoon, but also to criticise it."
"Freedom of speech cuts both ways."
"Freedom of speech has limits as well. These must be respected."
"They are defined and enforced by the law and legal systems of the Member States of the European Union."
"It is self-evidently unacceptable to go outside the law that is decided by democratic institutions."
"Freedom of religion is not negotiable either."
"Just as Europe respects freedom of speech, so it must – and does – respect freedom of religion."
"Religious freedom is a fundamental right of individuals and communities; it entails respect for the integrity of all religious convictions and all ways in which they are exercised."
"Muslims are and must be able to practise their faith in the same way as the adherents of other religions and convictions practise theirs."
"The European Union and its Member States have for a long time promoted dialogue between different communities both within the European Union and with neighbouring Muslim countries, and in other parts of the world."
"It is through a vigorous but peaceful dialogue under the protection of freedom of expression that mutual understanding can be deepened and mutual respect can be built."
"I am fostering and will continue to foster dialogue between cultures and with religions."
"This dialogue must be based on tolerance, not prejudice, and on freedom of expression and religion and the values connected with them."
"Violence is the enemy of dialogue."
"We must not allow the minority of extremists to win."
"Let the best of our values win against the worst of prejudices."
". – Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is following the controversy over the caricatures with great concern."
"One thing is crystal clear to us, however, and this forms our guiding principle."
"We shall defend freedom of the press, and we shall protect the feelings of believers, irrespective of their religion, and also the symbols that are important to them."
"We shall defend human rights and the achievements of the Enlightenment, and we shall uphold the right to profess one’s faith, to be different and to be respected."
"It is only possible to achieve all this at the same time if all parties first remain calm and level-headed."
"Therefore, our plea today goes out, in particular, to representatives of the media in Europe, in Iran, in other Islamic countries; it goes out to those who seek to inflate the caricature row to a matter of political principle."
"Meeting polemic with polemic, aggression with aggression, and insensitivity with insensitivity, is not the way to a good future."
"We want an order that defends freedom of expression as one of the supreme human rights, whilst also being aware of its limits, which are to be found in the freedom and dignity of others."
"This order must show respect for the beliefs and religious sensitivities of others, whilst at the same time enabling a peaceful, constructive dialogue on the things that divide us both superficially and deep down at the heart of our being, of our values, experiences and feelings."
"It follows from this that violence as a means of agitating or inciting outrage at differing opinions can never be accepted."
"We condemn all the instigators of the violent reactions in various countries across the world, for this was no spontaneous reaction – it did not take place until several months after the event – but was organised in part by regimes that do not value freedom of expression, but rather repress their people. This, too, must be made quite clear."
"We oppose all forms of violence; not only against people, but also against objects – flags or buildings – and we condemn them in the strongest terms."
"It is important to now add to this a rather more specific approach, as merely pledging ourselves to dialogue between cultures is not sufficient."
"I should like to make two very specific proposals; imperfect ones, admittedly, but food for thought nevertheless. Firstly, because we need to start with the young people, we should set up a committee of experts to examine school books in Europe and in the Islamic world to see the kind of words and values that are being attributed to each other and disseminated by this means."
"This committee should be under the joint auspices of the EU and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and, to make it most effective, the UN Secretary-General should be involved in the choice of experts."
"We, or rather the Islamic world, have become agitated over a number of caricatures in a European – Danish – newspaper and other newspapers; but this is only one instance of hundreds – not to say thousands – of caricatures, including those in the Islamic world making fun of our – Christian – values and our convictions."
"This has to stop: both here and in the countries of the Islamic world."
"Secondly, I was among those Members who participated in the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Barcelona."
"We should use the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly to bring together elected politicians and representatives of civil society from Europe and our partner countries for regular dialogue and targeted discussions within the framework of the Barcelona process."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly could thus be a pivotal forum for the dialogue between cultures."
"Allow me to make one personal remark. From 1999 to this year, 2006, I have visited 16 Arab and Islamic countries."
"I recall a conversation with a very committed, credible senior cleric in Saudi Arabia, which was, all in all, a wonderful conversation."
"He then asked me how Muslims were treated in Europe."
"I replied that we should often like to see better integration, but that Muslims could practise their faith freely."
"I then asked a question in return: is it true that, in Saudi Arabia, the law requires that any Muslim wishing to convert to Christianity be punished with death?"
"I did not receive an answer."
"Tolerance is important; but it is a two-way process."
"Tolerance, reconciliation and understanding must be based on the truth, and that is what we advocate."
"I emphatically welcome what the President of the Commission said: an attack on one Member State is an attack on us all."
"In this sense, we of course stand in solidarity with Denmark, and this debate should send out a signal of tolerance and understanding, albeit based on reciprocity and recognition of the truth."
"Only then will we be on the path towards a good future based on dialogue between cultures."
"– Mr President; Mr President-in-Office of the Council;"
"Mr Barroso, President of the Commission;"
"Mr Schulz, our group chairman, has asked me to talk today on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and that is something that I am pleased to do where this matter is concerned."
"It has been terrible and shocking to see people killed, my own country’s and other countries’ flags burned, ambassadors attacked and boycotts implemented, causing large numbers of innocent people to lose their jobs."
"It has been doubly depressing, given that our countries’ history has also been about tolerance of other peoples and about understanding and respect for them."
"We have led the way in international solidarity and in economic and political aid to poor peoples around the world."
"We have always fought for justice and for peoples’ right to their own independent states characterised by peaceful co-existence, especially in Palestine."
"It is absolutely crucial that the violence we see should not get completely out of hand."
"That violence must stop now, and I should like, personally and on behalf of my country, to thank Mr Barroso for the clear signal he has sent out today in Parliament and for the solidarity he has shown with my country and with all those countries that have been attacked."
"An attack on one Member State is an attack on the European Union as a whole."
"It is also important to emphasise, however, that the European Union stands for the opposite of xenophobia and intolerance."
"European values are based on respect for peoples and religions."
"The whole of our bloody history has taught us the wisdom of mutual understanding, dignity and co-existence."
"The first thing I should therefore like to say today to the whole of the Muslim world and to everyone in Europe is that freedom of expression is not something on which we are able to compromise. No government or ordinary citizen can put a question mark over that freedom."
"Freedom of expression does not, however, exist in a vacuum. It must and will be exercised with responsibility."
"Nor can we compromise on respect for other peoples and religions."
"This is also fundamental to the human rights on which Europe and the UN are based."
"Freedom of expression must therefore go hand in hand with respect for other peoples."
"That is the way things have to be."
"I should like to use my freedom of expression today to criticise and clearly repudiate the cartoons of the prophet Muhammad that appeared in a Danish newspaper a few months ago."
"Publishing them was arrogant and disrespectful and reflected a total lack of knowledge of Islam."
"I should like to emphasise that the cartoons do not reflect the attitudes of ordinary Danes."
"We are well aware, both in Denmark and elsewhere in Europe, that the love of our own country, dignity and religion does not require us to criticise others or talk down to them when what is in question is something they regard as holy."
"I also know that many people in Europe cannot understand why the Danish Prime Minister refused to meet ambassadors from the Arab world."
"That is something that I too fail to understand."
"We cannot, however, change what has happened."
"Most important of all is the fact that the Danish Government subsequently used its freedom of expression clearly to express respect for other peoples and their religions, not least Islam."
"We must now look forward."
"We want to send a clear signal today: we are determined to ignore new provocations, which cannot be used by extremists in Europe and in the Muslim world to inflame violence and intolerance and create new myths about each other."
"We have seen it so many times before from xenophobic and populist parties in Europe and from the extremist movements in the Muslim world."
"We say ‘no’ to those who claim it is ‘them against us’."
"For much too long, extremists on both sides have been allowed to play their false tune."
"Worst of all, they have inflamed hatred and fear and they have gained an audience for their views."
"It is time for moderate and responsible voices to set a new agenda, as Mr Barroso said, a new agenda which clearly and unambiguously shows that there is another way."
"We in Europe do not want to add fuel to the extremists’ fire."
"Here, in the European Parliament, we have a clear message: we want to unite all forces in a new and far stronger dialogue with the Islamic world, building on unconditional respect – a respect extending beyond borders and applying to all people and religions."
"We know that we live in a globalised world."
"That gives us a special responsibility."
"In this globalised world it is not ‘them against us’: we are one."
"And no, it is not a clash between religions or civilisations."
"What we have witnessed are ignorant acts creating humiliation and insult."
"This was used by extremists to inflame hatred and violence."
"However, trying to understand the broader reactions, those cartoons, together with manipulation from extremists, were the last straw."
"Let us not forget the many years of social and economic frustrations in many Muslim societies."
"Let us now realise what humiliation and arrogance from those with power and wealth can result in."
"Let us not fall prey to short-sighted sanctions but, instead, stand by our economic and political cooperation."
"Let us put behind us what the cartoons initiated."
"Let it be the last thing to cause provocation, and let the next step unite us to build a stronger dialogue – critical, open, permanent and constructive."
". Mr President, today the core message from Liberals and Democrats is to safeguard and defend freedom of speech, not only in Europe but also in Kabul and Tehran."
"It is totally unacceptable for violent protests, attacks on embassies, burnings of flags and boycotting of goods to replace dialogue."
"That we have seen examples of a European company boycotting Danish goods is unfortunate and not a sign of European solidarity."
"We have all been shocked and saddened by the terrible circumstances of the last 14 days, and no one has been more shocked than me and my fellow Danes."
"However, Muslims should recognise that the global tensions have merely increased support for far-right, anti-immigration parties and have been abused by extremists in and outside Europe."
"Europeans from all communities must now exercise personal responsibility to quell this rising tide of anger."
"We must not let extremists triumph at the expense of the moderate majority, and we must stand together in respect for Article 11 of the Treaty to condemn violence and intimidation against Member States."
"When the Danish flag and other European flags are burned, the EU should show solidarity, as we have seen today, and reject demands that governments should apologise on behalf of independent media ..."
"... especially since Section 77 of the Constitutional Act of Denmark clearly states: ‘Any person shall be at liberty to publish his ideas in print, in writing and in speech, subject to his being held responsible in a court of law."
"Censorship and other preventive measures shall never again be introduced’."
"It should also rebuff efforts by the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and the Arab League to seek a UN resolution, backed by possible sanctions, to ban attacks on religious beliefs."
"Such a move would contravene the constitutional basis of many liberal democracies and is an invitation to criminalise freedom of thought on a global scale."
"Nobody is denying that Muslims have a right to feel offended by these drawings, just as Sikhs, Jews, Christians or believers of any sort have a right to take umbrage at the press."
"However, complaints must be handled through the appropriate legal channels."
"In a civilised society, offence can never be grounds for violence."
"In a secular, democratic society such as our own, freedom of the press must remain paramount, for it is this freedom that reinforces the principles of democracy and pluralism on which our Union is founded and which are universally acknowledged in international conventions."
"As such, all believers should stand up for those values, which ensure that anyone in Europe can practise their religion freely and openly, but also accept the right to be a non-believer."
"This is not to say that freedom of the press should mean total freedom to cause offence."
"It is self-evident that, after 9/11 and the bombings in Madrid and London, greater care must be taken to ensure that relations between different communities remain as harmonious as possible."
"However, Liberals and Democrats are convinced that the current situation cannot be resolved by the ‘thought police’, but only through dialogue."
"From that perspective, we support the Alliance of Civilisations initiative proposed by the UN Secretary-General, and we applaud Justice Commissioner Frattini for organising a round table with media bosses, journalists and religious leaders."
"But, Mr Frattini, we draw the line at supporting your proposed code of conduct for the press, and we encourage Mr Solana to draw exactly the same line."
"That way lies greater distrust and mutual antagonism, because if communities cannot discuss issues on their cultural fault lines, how will they ever grow into acceptance?"
"Before I close in Danish, I just want to thank personally the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and my colleagues here in this Chamber for showing their solidarity."
"Freedom of expression is a right, but not necessarily a duty."
"It is, however, a right that must be neither called into question nor compromised."
"If we begin to compromise our freedom of expression and, at the same time, suspend our right to subject all religions to critical analysis, the fundamental right to think and to express ourselves freely will be restricted."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Hannah Arendt described freedom as being disturbing and painful, saying that men may even flee from it, as it can sometimes be difficult and unpleasant."
"I believe that there is one thing that we, as politically minded people and politicians, must not do, and that is to attempt to define boundaries for the press, for example."
"That is something that politicians cannot and must not do; only society knows what is common sense."
"We politicians can of course discuss those actions of ours that are causing offence – for example where, as in Denmark, legislation on foreign nationals has been passed that offends and fails to respect immigrants."
"That can be criticised here, as the Council of Europe did in Denmark’s case."
"We can also express criticism where, for example, a questionnaire for Muslims has been drawn up by German that shows Muslims a quite blatant lack of respect."
"Politicians can by all means criticise and discuss such things."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this whole discussion on limits is a matter for society."
"Commissioner Barroso is right: people are entitled to publish caricatures poking fun at us politicians, at me, at Mr Poettering or anyone else."
"In society, we are entitled to express disapproval."
"Muslims are entitled to hold demonstrations in protest – we respect that – in the same way as members of the Jewish community demonstrated against a play by Rainer Werner Fassbinder."
"This is a debate that should be held within society."
"We cannot draw up a code of conduct for the press; either the press does that itself or it does not – it is not our job."
"In the international debate, it is always pointed out that religions are to be respected."
"That may be so, but religions are in the public domain, and as such will be the subject of blasphemous caricatures."
"That is as integral to religion and democracy as air is to breathing; it is just the way things are."
"It does not mean that one has to approve of these caricatures or consider them to be in good taste."
"Freedom is not a matter of good or poor taste."
"Freedom is something we have fought for, and no civilisation has yet fallen on account of too much freedom, but always on account of too little; much too little."
"I can tell you, therefore, that I do not sympathise with the caricatures."
"I can tell you which ones made me smile, which ones made me laugh, which ones I found repellent."
"I do sympathise with all those who have fallen victim to violence in this dispute."
"I think it dreadful what, for example, large European enterprises such as Carrefour and Nestlé have done, running advertisements in Saudi Arabia with the slogan ‘We are not Danish, we are French’."
"That is in bad taste, that is a legitimate target for our criticism."
"I ask that we all refrain from self-righteousness."
"Let us not exempt religion from the social debate, as religions, too, have the right to say what is right or wrong."
"We are not supposed to caricature them when they talk nonsense on the issues of abortion or homosexuality; yet we have the freedom to do so, and this is a freedom that we wish to defend."
"If we were to show immigrants more respect in this world, if our laws were to show them more respect, they would have the opportunity to discuss our freedoms differently."
"Give them the freedoms that we claim for ourselves, and they will use them responsibly."
". – Mr President, of all the peremptory judgments expressed so far with regard to the cartoons of Mohammed, there are few I find very convincing."
"This issue lends itself to all kinds of oversimplification and I believe that this is a trap that we must avoid at all costs."
"It is urgent that we reflect on the various facets of the problems we are facing calmly and in depth."
"First of all, there is the issue of freedom of expression, clearly the touchstone of democracy and also the touchstone of the existence of a secular public space to which we quite rightly attach great importance."
"In this space, a critical spirit, a personal relationship to one’s faith and tolerance are supposed to prevail."
"These principles must not be compromised, but at the same time let us agree that the defence of these principles must not allow for insults, generalisations or stigmatisation, let alone justify them."
"We are constantly saying that we all live in the same world, a world that is getting smaller, in which everything is interdependent and of which neither Europe, the West in general, or any other region, is the centre."
"We must draw every possible conclusion from this."
"We are constantly being watched by the whole of humanity."
"We must therefore strive to create a kind of global public spirit."
"Everybody must exercise their freedom while respecting everybody else."
"On the other hand, what should we make of the entirely disproportionate reactions of certain Arab States to these incidents, which are surely intended above all to restore the rather tarnished reputation of their leaders amongst their populations, resulting from their submission to a great power that is far more blameworthy than peaceful Denmark?"
"Elsewhere, the Islamic radicals compete with the European far right to exploit this kind of issue to galvanise their respective troops and to silence the reasonable, courageous and progressive voices with whom they are battling."
"The worst thing would therefore be inadvertently to fuel their cause, rather than doing everything possible to break this vicious circle."
"We must look beyond this current unrest and the entirely unacceptable excesses that it has generated, and consider the absolutely essential issue that lies behind it, that is to say the heightened expressions of identities wounded by a profound sense of injustice, domination and humiliation, for which the West, from Palestine to Iraq in particular, is responsible."
"As the great Palestinian poet, Mahmoud Darwish, stresses in a more general sense: 'Arabs and Muslims have the impression of being pushed outside of history'."
"It is here that I believe Europe could play an essential role: building bridges between civilisations."
"But in order for that ambition to be credible, it means being fully liberated from those who, while behaving like the masters of the world, are in reality leading it – we see this a little more every day – to the brink of a clash."
"That also means applying the same international law to all States without exception, in order in particular to put an end to the open wound in the Middle East, which is an endless source of the poison of despair."
"The unfortunate cartoons affair should serve to illustrate the strategic options that we are facing!"
". – Good morning, little EU! Globalisation has indeed arrived."
"I never thought that other people could burn the Danish flag with such passion."
"On freedom of expression we will never give in."
"Freedom of expression and freedom of religion both need to be respected."
"The editor of has apologised for the feelings raised."
"He would not have published the cartoons today."
"Some Danish imams have distributed the cartoons they do not like."
"Why feel so offended by cartoons you spread to as many as possible?"
"The Danish Prime Minister has rightly refused to take responsibility for the content in our newspapers, but when 11 Arab ambassadors ask for a meeting, it is a duty for a prime minister to meet them."
"He should have explained that freedom of expression is limited by the Danish courts, not by the government."
"He should have advised on how to write to the special press authority to have its judgement."
"Blasphemy is a crime under the Danish penal code."
"Every local editor must show global responsibility."
"Cartoons in a newspaper can spread via the internet and global media like wildfire."
"Several people have been killed."
"The Danish Foreign Minister had an excellent press conference when the Danish embassies were burning."
"He talked of dialogue and generosity instead of animosity."
"People could be put in jail in Denmark for burning the Koran."
"I could not agree more: generosity instead of animosity."
"We must learn to respect and cooperate with Muslims, even if we will never surrender freedom of speech."
"My group warned against making fundamental rights a part of EU law."
"Sensitive judgements on freedom of expression and religious rights must be decided locally under international frameworks decided by the United Nations and the European Convention on Human Rights."
"We can offer dialogue in the new joint Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
"We can amend our exchange programmes to allow Europeans to visit the Arab world and young Arabs to visit us."
"We can open our markets more to their products, make peace and prosperity in the Middle East a priority, but state-sponsored trade boycotts against Danish products must be raised by the EU in the WTO."
"Islam is not about the Danish Constitution."
"Danish imams have no right to appeal to other nations."
"Muslims may use the Danish courts in the same way as all other citizens."
"If it is not enough, go to the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg."
"Indeed, globalisation has arrived."
"We all need to open our minds."
"There is no easy one-way ticket back."
"We will all have to change a bit to live in a global village."
"A third world war can be started by a little cartoon, as the First World War was started when a young student shot Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo."
"A student’s shot – or a satirical cartoon – may not be the reason, but let us take the message."
"We must all live together on this globe."
"We have no other globe available yet."
"It is on this planet that we must all live."
". – Mr President, when discussing the right to freedom and freedom of expression, one of the Supreme Court judges in the United States, Oliver Wendell Holmes, said that there are no absolute rights; rights can be restricted."
"The example he gave was that you do not have a right to shout ‘fire’ in a crowded cinema, unless there is a fire."
"One of the difficulties we face in our discussions is the justifiable desire to ensure that the press and media in Europe have freedom of expression, the freedom to poke fun, the freedom to satirise, the freedom, in some cases, to insult people."
"A democracy, by its very nature, needs the safety valve of humour and offence in order to operate properly."
"I do not think anybody in this house could in any way condone the violent reaction in certain countries in the Middle East to the publication of those cartoons and caricatures."
"Unfortunately, what has been forgotten in the debate, discussion and media coverage, is that there were also many peaceful protests, where Muslims and non-Muslims came together because they found the cartoons and the images they represented offensive, not to their religious belief , but to them as human beings."
"Respect for human dignity is as important a right in any democracy as the right to freedom of expression."
"One of the greatest challenges facing us in the European Union today is to ensure that we do not have a knee-jerk reaction to every horror or outrage."
"For me, coming from a small country like Ireland, it was shocking to see a Danish embassy burned and the flag of a country that has stood up for freedom and against intolerance burned in public."
"Likewise, I found it particularly distasteful and very hard to watch the media coverage of a minority element at some of those demonstrations who were inflicting pain on themselves, especially young people."
"There is an old saying in the media that if it bleeds, it leads; the more dramatic the image, the better chance it has of making the headlines."
"How can Europe respond?"
"President Barroso rightly said that Europe stands in solidarity with our Danish colleagues, because a boycott of Danish goods is a boycott of all European goods."
"We must ensure that we can help our colleagues in the Danish Government withstand the pressure they are being put under by voices in the media to go back on their present position."
"Even if we are critical of the politics of the Danish Government and its exercise of tact and skill, Prime Minister Rasmussen did stand up for one principle."
"He said that he would not be backing down on the question of government or parliament controlling the media."
"In 50 years’ time he will be feted for that; it is one of the bulwarks of democracy."
"My last point is that some people on both sides of this argument will try and present it as a clash of civilisations or religions or cultures."
"Respect and tolerance are needed more than anything else now."
"We must respect differences and give a proper and meaningful role to the different religions in the European Union, but we expect mutual recognition."
"Freedom can never be given away."
"It can be taken from you, but the freedom that allows us to have the passions that burn in our hearts and souls must always be preserved and protected."
"Mr President, all in all, I think it is a disgrace how little solidarity most European governments have shown towards Denmark in this situation."
"It is equally shameful how today again, in a grovelling and cowardly fashion, the most carefully chosen words of solidarity are immediately followed by all kinds of caveats so as not to offend the Islamofanatics."
"We should all feel Danish, because the criminal campaigns mounted against embassies, the boycott of Danish products, the threats and violent demonstrations are, in fact, directed against freedom and against the West as a whole."
"Anyone who responds to this threat with a scantily disguised appeal for self-censorship becomes, in fact, an ally of terror."
"Can I, in fact, repeat in this Chamber the question for which the editor-in-chief of a Jordanian newspaper was arrested and put behind bars?"
"What would cause more prejudice against Islam – the publication of a few caricatures, or images of Islamic hostage takers who cut the throats of their victims in front of the camera?"
"Can I also ask the question whether anywhere in the world, there is one Islamic country where atheists or people adhering to other faiths are given the respect that Muslims demand from us?"
"To ask the question is to answer it, and it is therefore high time we stopped beating about the bush and asked Muslims who live in Europe and who, by the way, enjoy freedom of religion, the free expression of opinion and all the blessings of social security, quite rightly so, to take themselves less seriously and to realise that democracy is about differences of opinion and sometimes clashing viewpoints."
"Anyone who cannot live with this would do well to use their freedom to move to one of the many countries where the inflexible and often very cruel laws of Islam already apply."
"I would like to quote the Danish Queen Margarethe II, with whom I am in complete agreement and who appears to be much more spirited than most European leaders put together: ‘These days, we are being challenged by Islam nationally and internationally."
"We have left this issue unaddressed for far too long, because we were tolerant or even perhaps complacent."
"We must show our opposition to Islam and accept the risk of being given unfavourable labels at times’."
"Let us therefore defend, tooth and nail, the free expression of opinion."
"Let the European countries where laws inimical to liberty are already in place to curb the free expression of political opinion – Belgium for example – take the initiative to abolish these laws which muzzle people and thereby send a strong message to anyone who combats freedom."
"We should also draw lessons from this for the negotiations with Turkey, because Turkey can never become a European Member State, simply because it is not a European country, and also because the basic principles of Islam are incompatible with the European values of freedom, separation of church and state and gender equality."
"It is time we mustered the courage to say this, certainly now Prime Minister Erdogan has been arrogant enough to seek to impose restrictions on the free expression of opinion."
"On a final note about this Danish issue, I should like to add an impressive quote from Mrs Doornaert’s column in the Flemish newspaper : ‘Europe appears to be unable to shake off its tendency for appeasement."
"It should have learnt by now that it is impossible to appease a totalitarian monster."
"The more you feed it, the more insolent it becomes’."
"Mrs Doornaert and her newspaper certainly do not think along the same political lines as I do, but those are prophetic words and we would do well to ponder them very carefully."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not my place, of course, to comment on a debate in this House, but I should like to express my most sincere thanks on behalf of the Council for the strong message that has been sent out today: one of commitment to our values, but also to tolerant dialogue with other civilisations and religions."
"I should also like to emphasise that the Council naturally considers it very important that all the institutions of the EU – the Commission and Parliament as well as the Council – agree on this and speak the same language;"
"I consider that most important."
"The debate that we have held here today will also make the Council’s job easier in future."
"On behalf of the Council, I wish to reiterate what I said in my introductory statement – which has also been said by the President of the Commission and also very many speakers: any attack on a Member State of the EU, any boycott against a Member State of the EU, is an attack on the EU, and we of course stand in solidarity with Denmark."
"This I say also on behalf of the Council."
"A number of very interesting ideas have been put forward here, which the Council will be happy to take up."
"I agree with Mr Poettering that it is important to reach out also – or particularly – to the young people: in schools, and also at home, as their education naturally begins at home."
"I also agree with Mr Poettering that it is important to avoid stereotypes and clichés in school books, too, and so I think that the idea of examining these is a good one."
"I could not agree more with Mr Rasmussen on the importance of dialogue between civilisations and on the need for the dialogue to be open, critical and respectful: that seems to me to be most important."
"Indeed, extremists must not be allowed to triumph: this is a fundamental statement that must be made here."
"It goes without saying that no benefit should induce us to bow down to extremists: we must show solidarity and unity on this."
"I could not agree more with Mr Cohn-Bendit, and I also said in my statement that I, too, am of the opinion that the responsibility of the press is a personal one, and that governments should not tell it what it can or cannot do."
"I am aware that, over the years and decades, institutions such as the Council of Europe have made repeated attempts to draw up a code of conduct; all of which have failed."
"I believe that this is a personal responsibility; that is very important."
"In the same spirit shown by today’s debate, the Council will continue to work on improving understanding between civilisations and between religious communities, but will also speak in plain terms when it comes to rejecting violence, and when it comes to condemning the use of violence or boycotts against Member States of the EU."
"We must show solidarity on this."
"To end the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions(1) in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 10 a.m."
"– I voted in favour of this resolution because I defend freedom of speech as a European and universal value and because I condemn violence as an expression of indignation, regardless of its target, and that includes European interests and embassies."
"I also voted in favour because the second paragraph of the resolution condemns incitement to religious hatred and the dissemination of racist and xenophobic attitudes."
"That being said, I feel that the resolution as a whole is unbalanced, because it focuses primarily on freedom of expression and not on the islamophobic intentions behind the cartoons published by an extreme right-wing, racist and xenophobic newspaper in Denmark."
"If it is to promote freedom of expression and the most basic human rights, Parliament must categorically distance itself from islamophobia and must condemn any attempts to correlate Islam and its believers with terrorism."
"My vote for this resolution was also an expression of my solidarity with the people of Denmark."
"I do not, however, approve of the complacent, arrogant attitude of the Fogh Rassmussen Government, which I hold jointly responsible for the fact that extremist reactionary forces, both in the West and in the Islamic world, have made capital from the incident by invoking the ‘clash of civilisations’."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the confrontation between Iran and the international community."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this Council statement on the confrontation between Iran and the international community, I should like to comment on the following issues: firstly, the nuclear issue, secondly, relations between the EU and Iran and, thirdly, the recent violence in Tehran."
"The resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue is a key concern for the international community, which has serious doubts about the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme."
"Over recent years, the EU has spared no effort to find a solution by negotiation and to urge Iran to adopt confidence-building measures with regard to its nuclear programme."
"Iran has been moving in the wrong direction recently by taking unilateral action, most recently resuming uranium-enrichment activities at Natanz and suspending application of the IAEA Additional Protocol."
"The adoption by the IAEA Board of Governors of its resolution of 4 February bringing the matter to the attention of the Security Council of the United Nations gave a clear signal to Iran."
"The large majority by which the resolution was adopted demonstrates that Europe’s deep concern about Iran’s nuclear programme is shared by the international community as a whole."
"The EU is by no means calling into question Iran’s right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes."
"The cause of this conflict lies in Iran’s failure to take sufficient action to date to build the necessary confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme."
"On the contrary, over the last 18 years, Iran has failed to declare a substantial part of its very extensive nuclear programme to the IAEA, and is still refusing to provide it with important information concerning, in particular, the extent of development of its uranium-enrichment technology and the field of ‘weaponisation’ – that is, the militarisation of its nuclear programme."
"The EU’s objective is still to achieve a solution to the matter by negotiation."
"Yet this requires that Iran show sufficient willingness to be cooperative and open, in particular towards the IAEA, and to take urgently needed confidence-building measures such as suspending sensitive nuclear activities."
"The Russian proposal to build a Russian-Iranian uranium-enrichment facility on Russian soil as an alternative to enrichment in Iran is an important contribution and has the full support of the EU."
"Let me reiterate quite clearly that the EU remains committed to a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue, in which the IAEA must play a key role."
"Involving the Security Council is not tantamount to diminishing the role of the IAEA, but rather is intended to strengthen the IAEA’s authority and make it possible to implement the measures required by the resolutions of its Board of Governors."
"On the subject of relations between the EU and Iran, the EU still regards the human-rights situation in Iran with great concern."
"The situation is worsening, and the Iranian authorities are not taking any tangible action to reform legislation or official practices."
"Despite repeated requests by the EU, Iran has failed to make any further commitment to resuming the stalled human-rights dialogue."
"The EU will continue to voice its human-rights concerns, both directly to the Iranian Government and in public statements and international forums."
"The statements made by the Iranian President on Israel have been unambiguously and strongly condemned by the EU and the international community as a whole."
"Iran’s position on the Middle East gives grounds for grave concern."
"It still supports Palestinian groups that the EU classifies as terrorist organisations."
"We note with concern that the Iranian President recently met some of the leaders of such groups in Syria, and we call on Iran to end such contacts. In addition, we call for it to join the international consensus on the necessity of a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict."
"The repeated attempts by the Iranian President to deny the crimes of the Holocaust, and his calls for the state of Israel to be ‘wiped off the map’, are to be firmly rejected."
"Statements such as this are completely unacceptable and, furthermore, are totally at odds with the efforts of the numerous political and religious leaders who are specifically working on all sides to promote a dialogue between the cultures that is characterised by mutual respect, particularly following the events of recent days."
"The EU’s relations with Iran will depend on progress made on all of the issues of concern: the nuclear issue and other concerns in connection with weapons of mass destruction, human rights, the fight against terrorism and the country’s position on the Middle East."
"The options for action by the EU will be kept under close review and weighed up in the light of Iran’s declarations and actions."
"On the subject of the violence: as has been clearly underlined in the debate in this House, the attacks on bodies of the European Union are in no way justifiable, and are completely unacceptable."
"The EU Presidency has condemned these attacks and called on Iran to meet its obligations with regard to the protection laid down in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961."
"In accordance with these obligations, the Presidency has also reminded Iran that responsibility under international law for ensuring compliance with these obligations lies with the state."
". Mr President, it is clear that Iran needs to take visible and credible steps back in order to regain the confidence of the international community."
"For the past few months the nuclear file has been at the centre of EU concerns with Iran, and rightly so."
"The region does not need further tension and prospects of nuclear escalation."
"Despite the persistent efforts for dialogue of the so-called EU-3 and of other international partners, Iran has not engaged in a convincing way."
"That is why, as a result of the vote of the International Atomic Energy Agency Board in Vienna on 4 February, Iran’s nuclear dossier is now to be reported to the United Nations Security Council."
"The Iranian reaction was the decision to step up its enrichment programme and to cease implementing the additional protocol."
"That is unacceptable news, although Iran expected to continue cooperating with the IAEA on the basis of the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"A substantial majority of the international community, including Russia and China, now stand firmly behind the reporting of Iran to the Security Council, agreeing that Iran needs to return to a suspension of its enrichment activities."
"There must be no mistake in Tehran about the resolve of the international community."
"At the same time the door still remains open for a negotiated settlement through diplomatic efforts, provided that Iran takes the necessary steps."
"Iran’s tactic of trying to divide the international community proved unsuccessful on this occasion, as it did last autumn."
"The Russian proposal to enrich uranium outside of Iran is still on the table and needs to be explored fully."
"If Iran returns to a suspension of its enrichment activities and accepts the Russian proposal, the Security Council track may not prove necessary."
"The prospects depend very much on the will of Tehran to compromise and engage with the international community, and to do so swiftly."
"We shall not speculate on further steps, but if the situation continues to deteriorate, we will need to consider options for further action through the United Nations."
"The United Nations Security Council will revert to the issue in the light of Mr El Baradei’s report and the next meeting of the IAEA Board starting on 6 March."
"Conversely, if things evolve in the right direction, more could be done through Community actions."
"If and when the situation calls for that, we must be able to re-engage Iran through a series of EU and Community instruments."
"We are ready to engage constructively, and Iran knows that."
"The nuclear issue is not a dispute between Iran and Europe or between Iran and the United States, but between Iran and the larger international community."
"Nor is it a dispute about Iran’s right under the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"It is about Iran’s failure to build the necessary confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme."
"Indeed, Iran has the right to develop research, production and the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes."
"For that, without discrimination, we need objective guarantees on the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme."
"I should like to say a few words about President Ahmadinejad’s statements on issues that affect regional stability and international relations."
"His unacceptable remarks regarding Israel and the Holocaust sparked global outrage."
"We feel that those statements are a profound offence to all of us."
"It is also totally unacceptable – as the Presidency has just said – that Iran continues to support terrorist organisations in the Middle East."
"With regard to human rights, you may recall that on 12 December the General Affairs and External Relations Council found the situation grave enough to adopt conclusions on the state of EU-Iran human rights dialogue."
"Stating what is for me a fundamental requirement vis-à-vis Iran, the European Union reaffirmed that greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran is essential if there is to be progress in EU-Iran relations."
"I should like to emphasise some points of major concern."
"There have been an increasing number of public executions and death sentences – juvenile executions in particular."
"Iran executed more child offenders in 2005 than in any recent year."
"There are restrictions on freedom of expression, with widespread censorship of the internet and the press – even the former speaker of parliament and presidential candidate, Mr Karroubi, could not get authorisation to broadcast his new television channel from Dubai."
"On the plight of human rights defenders, we are very much concerned about the fate of prisoners of conscience, such as Mr Akbar Ganji and his lawyer Mr Abdolfattah Soltani."
"The list of human rights concerns in Iran remains worryingly long."
"The Commission looks forward to a continued exchange with Parliament regarding the matter of Iran."
"The situation is critical, but the long-term objective continues to be, despite everything, that deeper and broader relations should be established with a country that is an important regional and international player."
". – Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to declare our full support for the policy of the international community on Iran, as revealed in the resolution of the IAEA Board of Governors of 4 February, the position of the EU General Affairs Council of 30 January, and the statement issued by the EU-3 together with the USA, Russia and China in London."
"In the government of my home country, too, Chancellor Merkel and Minister for Foreign Affairs Steinmeier are together resolutely following this course."
"It must be made clear to Iran’s leaders that they cannot create divisions within the international community, nor – naturally – within the individual bodies of the EU."
"Parliament’s resolution today will make that clear."
"We recognise the fundamental right of all parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to use nuclear energy for peaceful, civil purposes; but Iran has crossed so many red lines that confidence in the regime’s honourable intentions has faded."
"Neither its reduced cooperation with the IAEA, its President’s threat that Iran would leave the Non-Proliferation Treaty, its postponement of the talks with Russia that had been scheduled for this Thursday nor, in particular, its resumption of uranium enrichment, are conducive to building confidence and defusing the situation."
"This makes it all the more important to continue to present a resolute, united front to Iran."
"Anything that could now be conducive to giving Tehran the impression of division or compliance is unhelpful."
"Those who believe that our unconditional desire for peace alone will induce our opposite numbers to change course and see the light are doing our natural yearning for peace a disservice."
"Particularly when our counterparts are preaching hatred and hostility, and deliberately acting contrary to the expectations of the international community, we should not disclose to the other side everything that we might do as a consequence of their actions."
"I do not believe that the scope for diplomatic efforts has yet been exhausted."
"We are offering constructive cooperation."
"We are calling on Iran to resume cooperation with the IAEA before the issue is discussed in the Security Council."
"We also support Russia’s offer of uranium enrichment for civil purposes outside Iran."
"We cannot help wondering why Iran wants its own enrichment facilities."
"The country does not operate a single …"
". – Mr President, I should have been surprised if it did not."
"However, I should also like to ask the House to reflect on what is more important: having time for a proper debate, or Members of this House complaining when a vote is taken."
"I should have liked to hear Mr Gahler out, as what he was saying was most fascinating."
"Indeed, the question he raised is one of the ones that preoccupies us most at the present time."
"How do we deal with a regime that is quite blatantly pushing all its boundaries?"
"How do we respond to that as an international community?"
"In my speech I shall try to add some further questions from the point of view of my group."
"It is not necessary to comment in this House on the remarks made by the Iranian President."
"A Head of State who denies the Holocaust, and who calls into question Israel’s right to exist, is not a fitting dialogue partner for us."
"All the values that President Ahmadinejad stands for are the opposite of those we stand for, and I should welcome a debate on values with these people."
"We have already had a debate on values this morning; and that was good – it was a serious, considered debate."
"We should hold a calm, self-confident debate, and see whether there are others in the region besides President Ahmadinejad with whom we can hold dialogue."
"We should reflect on options open to us before we philosophise about options closing."
"Are there not sufficient moderate countries in the region who are open to dialogue and with whom we can cooperate, who may not share our values one-to-one, but to whose interests it is also entirely detrimental to have Iran become a leading nuclear power in the region?"
"Yes, there are, and, in my view, they are suitable dialogue partners for the EU."
"In this connection, of course, the conflict over the caricatures not only comes at the worst possible time, but is even counterproductive in the extreme, for these are the very countries with whom we need a relationship of mutual respect."
"Solving this caricature conflict is also central to solving the problems of the region as a whole, therefore."
"For this reason, I would advise against equating ‘Iran’ and ‘Islam’."
"The actions of one aggressive Head of State of one country do not in any way reflect the views of the vast majority of peace-loving Muslims around the world, with whom we have to cooperate."
"I think it is right that all enrichment activities – that is, those by all countries – should be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency, as proposed by the IAEA itself."
"We should support this proposal."
"I also think, incidentally, that it is perfectly justifiable to refresh memories and say that the debate on nuclear disarmament should not be limited to this region: it needs to be universal."
"In this connection, allow me to point out that treating countries who already have nuclear weapons differently from those who are on the way to having them, and carrying out pre-emptive strikes against countries who did not have any weapons of mass destruction, only encourages regimes to procure nuclear weapons as quickly and illegally as possible, because those who own them will not be attacked."
"This is a logic that also needs to be discussed, one that was triggered by a pre-emptive strike carried out in the same region in the past, which was utterly wrong and which we vehemently opposed."
"I believe that the logic behind this was extremely dangerous, and that is why we have to abandon this strategy of goal-based thinking, as it leads to the militarisation of thought."
"We must reinforce our diplomatic options step by step."
"It was an enormous accomplishment on the part of the EU-3 to bring China and Russia together and thus give Iran a clear signal that the international community will not allow itself to be divided."
"Let us talk about diplomatic successes instead of philosophising about military options."
"The international community should do everything in its power to make it clear to Iran that failure to return to the negotiating table by 6 March will automatically trigger a referral to the Security Council."
"Subsequent action should then be decided there, however, rather than by just any central government."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after two and a half years of intensive research and inspections, the International Atomic Agency has been unable to confirm the peaceful character of the Iranian nuclear programme, and basic questions remain unanswered."
"Iran’s recent decisions to resume the uranium enrichment activities and to suspend all voluntary cooperation with the Agency are particularly worrying, not least in the light of the Iranian President’s statements denying Israel’s right to exist and of the general tightening of rules that has been noted in Iran."
"Now that the issue has been passed on to the Security Council, things are gaining momentum, even though it has been decided to wait for the next report which Mr El Baradei will be submitting on 6 March."
"The stakes are extraordinarily high."
"The non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and of weapons of mass destruction is in the balance."
"The stability of the entire region is at risk, as is the effectiveness of the International Atomic Agency itself."
"It is very rare that I put things in such strong terms, but I am warning you that this issue is placing the whole international rule of law under pressure."
"Even if the conference reviewing the non-proliferation treaty fails, which would be very regrettable indeed, even then the permanent members of the UN Security Council, including China and Russia, and the others – you are familiar with them – together with the European Union, appear today to be of one mind in seeking to prevent proliferation in a peaceful manner, and that is indeed cause for modest satisfaction."
"It is now up to Iran, in full transparency and renewed cooperation with the Agency, to convince the world that it only has peaceful objectives in mind"
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to recognise that this situation is escalating."
"We have to realise that the strategy of President Ahmadinejad is a new one."
"He is intent on a breach with the West, on building up an Islamic region and taking over its leadership."
"We are seeing a mobilisation of national pride in Iran."
"How should Europe respond to this?"
"I expect us to be guided by reason and make clear analyses."
"I agree with Mr Schulz when he says that we have to abandon the ‘strategy of goal-based thinking’, that we need new dialogue partners, and that we must be active in prioritising diplomacy."
"I would also say, however, in view of the difficult negotiations over recent days, that the military option has been discussed, and I ask those who have this in the back of their minds to think it through."
"I expect them to define how they propose to deal with a military escalation, and tell us whether the way they do so will enable us to achieve our objectives, namely preventing Iran developing nuclear weapons and ensuring Israel’s existence."
"I do not believe that it will."
"For this reason, I would appeal once more to this House to take account, in today’s vote, of our argument – which we were unable to push through in negotiations – that we should now refrain from toying with any ideas of a military approach, and subsequently to put the emphasis on diplomacy – in spite of all the hate speeches by President Ahmadinejad."
"The questions as to whether sanctions should be imposed, what sanctions are appropriate and whether world peace is at risk, are not for President Chirac to answer, the man who suddenly issued the threat of France using nuclear weapons; nor are they for Chancellor Merkel to answer."
"The vital issue of world peace is to be decided by the United Nations and no one else, and we should not forestall them."
". Mr President, not being myself a Shiite, I have to say that the Islamic Republic of Iran’s current atomic aspirations really are beyond me."
"After all, the founder of this Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, emphatically rejected nuclear energy as ‘un-Islamic technology’."
"These days, President Ahmadinejad regards atomic energy as a blessing from Allah, so that really does amount to a splitting of the Shiites, if not of the atom."
"At the same time, I am still confused about Teheran’s atomic intentions."
"On the one hand, we hear from the Supreme Leader Khamenei very reassuring words about the use of weapons of mass destruction being prohibited in Islam; it is in line with this that Iranian leaders claim to pursue the peaceful use of nuclear energy."
"On the other hand, the whole Persian atomic programme shows every sign of that country secretly seeking to possess a nuclear weapons capability, hence the cat and mouse game that Teheran has, for years, played with the Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna."
"I ask the Council and the Commission: where do we go from here?"
"Whatever you do, I urge you to stand for no more nonsense from the mullahs, in short, to keep all your options open against a terrorist regime that so far has only played for time and wishes to drive a wedge between the European Union and the US, and Israel, respectively."
"Meanwhile, the Iranian nuclear clock is still ticking ominously; you must persuade the Russians and the Chinese, by a combined effort, to stop it."
"That is the kind of European diplomatic activity that I am expecting to see."
". Mr President, the President of Iran tells us that his country, like any other, has a right to nuclear weapons."
"This might be true if Iran were a normal state, but it is not."
"It is a dictatorship that has openly challenged the right of one of its neighbours to exist."
"Consequently, Israel may well be the first target of Iranian aggression and it should have our guarantee of security right now."
"As things stand, the course of events in Iran depends on the world’s powers standing as one."
"This will be difficult to achieve, since Russia is seeking to profit from Iran’s nuclear programme and is selling weapons to Iran, as is China, while India is planning to build a gas pipeline from that country."
"It therefore falls to Europe to take the lead and play an active role in resolving the conflict."
"Will Europe prove up to the task of working out a common strategy with the United States, or will it succumb to the next delusion born of the fertile Iranian imagination in Teheran?"
"If the UN Security Council is not equal to the task, if we fail to change Iran's policy through a programme of economic and financial sanctions, we should not be surprised to see fighter planes in the skies above Natanz or Isfahan at some point in the future."
"– There was something touching in the way the Austrian Secretary of State stumbled through the script presented to him on the subject of Iran and its atomic energy programme."
"It shows how far removed from these issues representatives of the Austrian Government have become in the first decade of the third millennium."
"That is a good thing; we have learnt our lessons from history, and the first speech by the Secretary of State had a lot to say about responsibility."
"Combining the two, the obvious course of action would actually be to take initiatives, to say that we need an even wider perspective on this conflict than that indicated by the previous speakers."
"We must not do things back to front, we must start with the basics, and that means ‘no nukes’."
"It is incomprehensible why some, the ‘good guys’ – who decides who those are? – are allowed such weapons, whilst others are not."
"If the Secretary of State starts there from an Austrian perspective, he may be able to do a great deal of good in the longer term rather than just being superficially diplomatic and pleasant in the short term."
"Mr President, for some years Iran has sought to export its fundamentalist revolution beyond its Shia lands to Sunni population areas, including Palestine, where, through Syria and its proxy terrorist Hezbollah, it liaises with Islamic Jihad and Hamas, both committed to theocracies under Sharia law."
"A nuclear-armed Iran is therefore particularly dangerous to Western security, and that of Israel in particular."
"There is no consensus on how to deal with Iran, which is in clear breach of the NPT Treaty and its agreements with Britain, France and Germany, but I welcome the 3 February vote by the IAEA to refer Iran to the United Nations Security Council."
"I also welcome China and Russia’s belated support."
"The traditional compact – whereby Iran supports Russia in the OIC over Chechnya in exchange for Russian support in supplying nuclear technology, and its Security Council veto when necessary – seems now to be dissolving."
"China naturally rejects further nuclear proliferation and is also worried by its own home-grown Islamist threats."
"Iran’s intransigence and refusal of the reasonable Russian offer on enrichment of uranium has been a wake-up call to Russia and China."
"Only Syria, Cuba and Venezuela rejected the proposal."
"The Iranians immediately pledged to resume commercial-scale enrichment of uranium, which can be used either as a fuel for power plants or, as they really wish, in the core of an atom bomb."
"They have ordered an end to the unannounced visits by the IAEA inspectors."
"Western intelligence alleges that Iran is using a network of front companies to try and buy components for missile and bomb production from western Europe and to hire impoverished nuclear scientists from the former Soviet Union."
"I agree with all those who say that all options must be left available to the West to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran."
"I ridicule the appeasing statement by the United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who claims that military action is inconceivable, whereas his boss, Prime Minister Tony Blair, rightly refuses to rule it out."
"Mr President, I would like to remind Members of certain fundamental mistakes made by many people during the Iraq affair when assessing the intentions of Saddam’s regime regarding weapons of mass destruction."
"Intelligence, then and today, is largely inconclusive, if not misleading."
"It is based largely on inferences and is often lacking in hard data."
"The best intelligence agencies today do not have a single reliable source in Iran capable of providing information on Tehran’s intentions and capabilities."
"While it may not be perfect, the IAEA is the only means of monitoring any nuclear programme in Iran."
"Between 1991 and 1998, and despite Saddam’s best efforts from 1992 onwards, the IAEA could not declare Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction."
"So let us avoid making further costly mistakes based on confusing mistrust with well-founded suspicion."
"This is what warmongering politicians are trying to instil in our minds, and it is simply illogical."
"One of the lessons we should learn from the Iraq nuclear case is very simple: it was the bombing of the Osirak reactor in 1981 that led Saddam to decide to have a serious nuclear programme."
"I can easily imagine what disasters could result from a so-called ‘surgical strike’ of this kind today."
"We have the time to negotiate, we have solid political and legal grounds to request that Iran comply fully with the NPT and there is a political and social opposition in Iran that is far from toothless, but, if we want to create the conditions for security and stability in the Middle East, we, as Europeans, must make it clear to all sides that international rights and obligations are the same for everyone."
"This also means that our American friends must change the political paradigm with Iran, acknowledging that their past approaches have been ineffective and that they need to adopt a more collaborative policy in order to safeguard everybody’s interests in this crucial part of the world."
"Mr President, the situation in Iran provides genuine grounds for concern."
"Not only is the human rights situation deplorable, but the regime also mocks the world community by violating international principles and ignoring the IAEA’s demands."
"The idea of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons is, of course, incredibly frightening, especially in the light of its statements about, and threats against, Israel and in terms of what such a development would mean for the rest of the region."
"The disturbances surrounding the cartoons of Muhammad also appear perfectly to suit the regime in Tehran, and there are many indications that it is precisely Tehran that is fomenting the disturbances."
"It is time for the EU to formulate a very clear strategy in relation to Iran."
"It should have several different dimensions: international cooperation, clear support for dissidents and forces of democracy, such as the referendum movement, within and outside Iran, vigorous condemnation of the serious human rights violations, pressure on Iran to comply with international conventions and, of course, dialogue and diplomacy."
"This strategy should, however, also include preparing possible sanctions decided on in the UN Security Council."
"Mr President, it appears that our strategy against the Iranian regime has largely failed."
"Nowadays in Iran we are seeing the worst phase of the theocratic regime: executions are continuing, human rights are at their worst in Iranian history; the mixture of religion and politics is heavier than in any other part of the world and the government is mobilising its own people and other peoples in the Middle East against democracy."
"I think everybody accepts that developing nuclear power and nuclear weapons in Iran would be dangerous for the whole region."
"For that reason, I agree that we must act carefully when we speak about nuclear power in the region, because we could give the Iranian regime the ideal excuse to continue with its nuclear programme."
"Iranian leaders could be tempted to say that if Israel does not stop its nuclear programme, then Iran has the right to develop its own."
"We have to be aware of the fact that when we are taking about the Iranian regime we are also talking about Syria and Lebanon, the future of the peace process in Israel and Palestine, theocracy and democracy, human rights and universal values."
"– Mr President, the joint motion for a resolution is very problematic."
"Paragraphs 4 and 7 support the escalating position of the EU-3."
"This time, the EU-3 is greatly contributing to the escalation."
"Jacques Chirac’s remark that he is prepared to use nuclear weapons against ‘terrorist’ states is scandalous."
"The historical comparison drawn by Angela Merkel, too, is completely unacceptable."
"It is not only Iran’s atomic energy programme that is dangerous; the nuclear weapons in the EU – France and the United Kingdom – and the USA should also be disarmed in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons."
"The use of nuclear energy in itself is problematic."
"Summoning Iran before the UN Security Council is the first step towards a military attack on Iran."
"All military options must be ruled out;"
"German SPD chairman Matthias Platzeck is absolutely right about this."
"The war in Iraq is obviously a blueprint for the conflict with Iran."
"The unspeakable comments by the Iranian President on Israel and the human rights violations in the country must not be exploited for the purposes of a policy of war against Iran."
"– Mr President, we need to debate in order to see what we fear: nuclear weapons or the person in possession of nuclear weapons?"
"We fear the person in possession."
"We do not fear nuclear weapons, because when Israel acquired nuclear weapons a few years ago by the same method, we did not kick up such a fuss."
"You will tell me that Israel has a democracy, while Iran has a dictatorship."
"Yes, but Pakistan also has a dictator – Musharef – and we allow it to have nuclear weapons."
"So let us look at the facts."
"The story of David and Goliath is repeating itself."
"Slings and stones were not allowed then, but David used them and his name went down in history."
"What are the facts?"
"The facts are that we want our allies to have nuclear weapons and no one else."
"That is intimidation and it is an-ti-de-mo-cra-tic!"
"We should engage in dialogue, not threats."
"Threats always lead in the wrong direction."
"They lead to invasion, they lead to war, they lead to death."
"No one ever got hurt from di-a-logue!"
"We should provide an opportunity, we should talk, however much the other side digs its heels in."
"We must make an effort, because we are the more civilised."
"Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, it has been clear for some time that the Iranian nuclear issue would be considered at the UN Security Council."
"Let us recall that at the end of last year, when the European Parliament’s report on weapons of mass destruction was debated, it was precisely Iran’s nuclear programme that triggered the most vigorous debates."
"The Members’ call at that time for constructive action was shrugged off with the stance that only the path of negotiation would solve the Iranian problem."
"It is obvious, however, that tensions between Iran and the international community have only increased."
"Ladies and gentlemen, recent months were a time for the consolidation of international action."
"Now, not just the International Atomic Energy Agency but all five permanent members of the UN Security Council unanimously acknowledge that Iran’s nuclear programme is not of a peaceful nature."
"Certainly, it is not the European Parliament that will decide on the further course of events, but we must stress that the inability of the states to agree on joint action at the 2005 review conference of the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons) only gave rise to an obsession among Iran’s leadership."
"Ladies and gentlemen, while the Iranian nuclear issues are considered at the UN Security Council, in this situation the European Parliament and national parliaments must again and again highlight the need for unity among the international community."
"Let us remember that any doubts or lack of conviction provide strength to the Iranian regime, encourage the fanatics and play into their hands."
"Mr President, we must remember firstly that it is Europe that has sold this nuclear technology to Iran."
"We tend to forget this, and it does not put us in the best position to protest today."
"Secondly, we must bear in mind that there is an enormous difference between degrees of enrichment of uranium for civilian and for military purposes."
"Thirdly, returning to nuclear weapons, is it not shocking that our international community has allowed several countries to the east and the west of Iran to acquire nuclear weapons without reacting in any way?"
"Finally, solely in relation to the external aspects of the Iranian revolution, I would remind you that the most radical and hostile forms of Islamism come to us from countries other than Iran, despite what certain speakers have said."
"In conclusion, we have been swamped with so many lies in the past that we have the right to be better informed."
"We must ensure that the rule of law, which we advocate, is the same for everybody."
"This is essential to our credibility."
"– Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we must not let the fundamentalists and those abusing the opportunities that freedom in Europe presents destroy our capacity for dialogue."
"Events from the caricature conflict, to begin with, to the drastic, unacceptable statements by the Iranian President, cannot be allowed to result in the moderates that live in all regions and countries of the world losing the ability to talk to each other."
"I believe that that is a crucial starting point, as, too, is ensuring that a president such as this is unable to win through in Iran, and that the many, well-educated, young people who wish to live a decent life have prospects; and for that reason we have to maintain this capacity for dialogue, in order to support internal reform process here, too."
"This also means that we should not climb the escalation ladder too fast; it is not possible to go down a rung, so careful consideration is required."
"For that reason, I am glad that next Monday, for example, the Committee on Foreign Affairs will have the opportunity for dialogue with the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, which will form an integral part of a debate such as this."
"The international community must be resolute when it comes to breaches of the law – irrespective of whether these occur in the context of freedom of expression – or when it comes to ensuring that Iran abides by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the rules that have been agreed."
"Iran must also realise that, if it has not done so properly by 6 March, the international community stands together and that the matter may then be discussed within the Security Council of the United Nations."
"For this reason, it is important that we ensure this dialogue helps to build a more peaceful world, that we do not now let ourselves be talked into taking steps that render it impossible to use this escalation ladder for peaceful purposes, and also that, in the process, we do not lapse into automatism from which there is no escape."
"– Mr President, we are unfortunately having to realise that the situation in Iran is escalating, and that is certainly not the right way for it to go about assuming a responsible role in the future of the international peace process, particularly in the Middle East, as Iran always likes to see it."
"I do sympathise with a country’s desire for scientific and technological progress for the benefit of its citizens – it must be given this option – but a field as double-edged as nuclear research requires a common effort by the international community; it is unacceptable for any parties to go it alone."
"It is vital to build mutual confidence, both on the part of the USA and Europe and on the part of Iran."
"How is that possible, however, with talk of military options on both sides?"
"The fact is that the political situation in the region is not as stable as we would wish upon the people living there."
"For that reason, we would call on all the countries of that region to enter into a process of dialogue."
"Regional stability and security cannot be achieved through outside intervention, and power games must not be allowed to result in doors being closed to us, so that we no longer know what is happening behind them."
"We should not give fundamentalism or fanaticism any chance."
"Mr President, it is estimated that Iran could have nuclear weapons within three to ten years, although the point of no return in stopping that development could be reached much sooner."
"Dealing with Iran has been made all the harder by the Iraq war, which was not just a disaster but could turn out to be an act of geopolitical folly."
"The Iranian regime cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons."
"It is a religious fundamentalist, barbaric, pro-terrorist and anti-Semitic regime."
"The world became used to the nuclear stand-off between the democratic west and the communist east during the Cold War, but in that confrontation, disaster was avoided because ultimately both sides were rational."
"The religious fundamentalists of Iran are not rational."
"An Iranian nuclear device could turn out to be the biggest suicide bomb the world has ever seen."
"In this situation all the options are dangerous but the most dangerous option is doing nothing at all."
"Mr President, that everyone is agreed that we cannot accept a regime of religious maniacs having weapons of mass destruction at their disposal is not something we have learned only today, so from that point of view this debate is superfluous."
"Far more relevant is the question as to whether we should not have stepped in much sooner."
"Allow me in this minute to draw your attention to the hypocrisy which Europe and the US display in matters such as these in order to pursue ."
"It was, after all, France which offered Ayatollah Khomeini shelter and asylum and which helped ensure that the Shah’s Persia was able to slip into obscurantism."
"If we are shocked today – as we rightly are – by Teheran’s barbaric execution of minors, at the same time as it plays a leading role in the smear campaign against Denmark, should we not also question the human rights situation in the large Islamic country Saudi Arabia, which is claimed to be the USA’s major ally and hence ours too?"
"We have not even mentioned Pakistan, itself a country armed with nuclear weapons."
"What do we do if another Ahmadinejad starts rebelling over there tomorrow?"
"– () Mr President, this morning Iran announced four more executions."
"In January, they executed 18 people and in December 35."
"We sit here talking and talking while Iran goes ahead with the obvious production of nuclear weapons."
"Neither the US nor Israel can protect us."
"A military solution costing millions of lives is not an option at present."
"If we are to find a solution, therefore, we must understand the causes of Iran’s behaviour."
"It would be a gross error to think that Iran is reacting out of fear or alarm."
"The Persians are not Arabs."
"Iran ruled the Middle East in ancient times, and for five hundred years in medieval times."
"The country is convinced of its position as the leading power in the Middle East, and is producing nuclear weapons in order to secure this position."
"Its natural historical partner in this hegemony is Russia."
"Iran is a nation of rapidly growing, impoverished, uneducated, isolated and radicalised masses, who are kept in silence by a hard line totalitarian regime."
"We are not dealing with radical Islam; we are dealing with a radical totalitarian regime."
"Totalitarian regimes need external enemies, they need to attack the West, to block radio broadcasts and to execute their own citizens."
"In contrast to previous totalitarian states, the transcendental nature of Islamist ideology makes it possible that their weapons will be used."
"Let us support dialogue with those that care about it and those that need it."
"We must, however, be clear, firm and principled in our attitude towards totalitarian regimes."
"(Mr President, there is no greater sin in politics than the sin of naïvety."
"A one-minute speech such as this can only appeal to the emotions and the imagination."
"The sin of naïvety is what we all commit when we utter these wise words, when we agree with one another and when we remain unconcerned as these words have absolutely no effect."
"We are forever repeating the same words."
"Iran is constantly creating new situations."
"Has Iran recently come closer to having atomic weapons? – Yes, it has."
"Has it come closer to atomic energy? – Yes, it has."
"Has it come closer to possessing effective means of delivering these weapons?"
"Yes, it has. – Yes, it has come closer, but we continue to utter the same words, the same naïve words."
"Let us prepare for the day when nuclear weapons in Iran become a reality."
"Let us change our defence doctrine then, because Europe will also be affected, and let us remember how dearly the sin of naïvety cost Europe in the past."
"– Mr President, there are certain findings which no one can doubt."
"Of course we disagree with the autocratic model of governance in Iran, we condemn the violations of human rights, but we must all acknowledge that the Iranian people put their new political leadership into place with democratic procedures."
"The second finding is that Iran has an inalienable right to develop a nuclear programme for peaceful purposes."
"The third finding is that the nuclear programme is not identified solely with President Ahmadinejad; it has the support of the broad majority of political forces and of the people of Iran."
"There can be no solution outside the search for a political and diplomatic solution through dialogue, negotiation and respect for international law."
"The European Union and the Presidency and the Commission must help to stop the threat or use of military means or preventive action against Iran."
"The decisive issue for all of us is to build mutual trust on the basis of actual facts and elements, not simple information."
"Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union has every interest in preventing the repetition of a new Iraq in the area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to put a stop to the activity of uranium enrichment, which lacks sufficient transparency."
"The behaviour of the Iranian authorities towards the International Atomic Energy Agency has made it impossible to build the trust needed between Iran and the international community."
"There are still strong doubts about the Iranians’ claims that they only want to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes."
"The recent actions of Tehran, the removal of the seals placed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the suspension of the voluntary implementation of the additional protocol on safeguards run counter to the statements of intent made by the Iranian Government and to our attempts to secure a negotiated settlement."
"On the basis of all that, we conclude that Iran is presenting itself on the international stage as the leading authority of the Islamic revolt against the West, and that it therefore intends to assert its own military might over that of the other Muslim nations."
"For that reason, attacking and demonising Israel becomes a strategic move."
"Iran considers itself to be invincible and unassailable on the economic, industrial, financial and energy fronts, and we therefore fear that any negotiation is destined to fail."
"As the delegation of the party, we therefore propose that the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs be invited to Brussels to take part in a meeting with our EU-Iran parliamentary delegation."
"We need to explain that it will not be possible to pursue a dialogue between our Parliament and the Iranian Government if the latter does not establish an equivalent parliamentary delegation."
"We must therefore request an ongoing dialogue with all of the political forces in Iran, on both the ruling and the opposition sides, and show solidarity towards Israel with regard to the continual attacks it is under, by committing the European Union to guarantee security within the Middle East."
"We therefore call on Members to vote against ..."
"I believe that sensible and peaceful thinking people the entire world over do not have a problem with Iran itself."
"Iran is a country populated by people just like ourselves, with their everyday joys and cares."
"Our problem is not the country and its citizens."
"Our problem is an individual, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who became Iran’s president through circumstance, and his religious fundamentalism."
"All of the problems stem from the sick mind of this one fanatic, be it the renewal of the nuclear programme, the brutal verbal attacks against the state of Israel or the primitive and deplorable denial of the Holocaust, the greatest atrocity and genocide in human history."
"I therefore believe that it is important to distinguish between these two elements and not to identify the president with the whole country."
"Unfortunately, it has been true throughout our history that such sick minds have repeatedly managed to bring war not only to their nations and countries, but often also to whole regions and twice even to the entire world."
"This is where the greatest danger lies."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the situation is serious, though not hopeless."
"However, we can never defeat fundamentalism by substituting a different form of fundamentalism – that is my message to our friend George Bush."
"Responsibility has been vested in us, and we must act with forethought in order to make sure that one day future generations do not blame us for failing to deal with this serious situation."
"– Mr President, in spite of the international efforts, it is becoming increasingly clear that either Iran is raising the diplomatic stakes, or it really is not interested in ending the uranium enrichment programme and the subsequent use thereof for military purposes."
"Today’s Iran flouts the rules of the international community, has apparently no intention of honouring those rules and poses a threat to regional and world peace."
"Today’s Iran is potentially dangerous."
"Tomorrow’s Iran, armed with nuclear weapons, is a definite danger."
"Against this backdrop, the citizens expect the EU to guarantee their security and to be a stabilising factor on the world stage."
"It is primarily up to those who have been given the task of leading the negotiations with Iran to dispel the citizens’ fears, in spite of the risk – clearly a calculated risk – that Iran will not want to heed the international community’s legitimate demands."
"Mr President, simply referring the case to the United Nations and the Security Council is not, to my mind, sufficient."
"We believe that the EU’s first task should be to strive to maintain a cohesive and resolute response among the international community to the regional and global threat posed by Iran."
"We must not allow the current difficulties and these politically sensitive times to lead to rifts, when what is at stake is something as fundamental as our global security."
"Iran needs to know that the diplomatic route remains open, but also that it is up to Iran to restore trust by means of practical, verifiable moves towards the total suspension of its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities."
"It must also abandon its provocative rhetoric on Israel and the holocaust, and must commit itself to a policy, acceptable to the international community, of respect for human rights and for opposition parties."
"What appropriate, effective measures can be taken to achieve these goals?"
"This is the key question to which we must respond."
"Mr President, it is increasingly clear that the relevance of the EU’s role on the international stage depends entirely on its deeds."
"Let us hope that this particularly difficult time will enable the Union to show that it has the means at its disposal to play a role on a world scale, something that this House has often demanded."
"We hope that it succeeds in doing so."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, the word most often used in this morning’s debates has been the word ‘dialogue’; dialogue between cultures, between civilisations and, I may say, even between the European Union and Iran."
"Relations between the Union and Iran have in recent years been based on a three-tier approach, comprising trade cooperation, political dialogue and dialogue on human rights."
"I firmly believe, despite the numerous disappointments and setbacks of recent weeks and months, that this approach is still applicable and still valid."
"It is of course totally unacceptable that the Iranian president should question the existence of another state, namely Israel, and Iran cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, any more than it can be allowed to circumvent international law or the rulings of international organisations. I am, however, convinced that the potential for dialogue and for a diplomatic solution has not been entirely exhausted."
"I am also convinced that it is not in the interests of the citizens of Iran, the Iranians themselves, that their country should become a kind of black hole within the international community."
"I therefore support the dialogue mentioned earlier with the reformist groups within Iran and in the surrounding region."
"Mr President, personally speaking, I feel bound to point out the link between the comments by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad calling for Israel to be wiped from the map and Iran’s decision to resume its uranium processing activities."
"I do not believe that these two events are coincidental."
"Neither do I believe that our institution can reasonably overlook the correlation between them."
"Many countries are developing their nuclear capabilities, but the international community is only worried about proliferation in those countries that pose an immediate threat to peace in the world."
"I believe that, if Iran does not inspire confidence in us today, it is because, amongst other things, its President makes bellicose, revisionist and anti-Semitic comments."
"It is that President’s malevolent intentions that make the resumption of the uranium enrichment programme so worrying in terms of world peace."
"That is why I am delighted with this resolution."
"Mr President, the current debate is very important."
"The debate on the Middle East here in Parliament and in the media has, more often than not, been focused on Iraq and the election in Palestine."
"Now that Iran is the subject of debate, it is the issue of nuclear weapons that is being discussed."
"At the same time, human rights are being violated, a state of affairs discussed by many of the previous speakers."
"As a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and as Vice-Chair of Social Democratic Women in Europe, I receive very worrying reports and accounts concerning violations of both women’s and children’s rights."
"More time must be given to human rights issues, and we should act significantly more vigorously than I think we are doing at present."
"Great changes are taking place right now in Iranian society."
"There are too few of us who talk of dialogue and too many of us who have got bogged down thinking in terms of a major conflict."
"The dialogue between the EU and Iran must be resumed."
"The statements about Israel are unacceptable, as are executions, death sentences and the taking of political prisoners."
"Diplomatic solutions must be preferred to an escalation of violence and other outrages."
"In modern conflicts, it is always civilians, women and children who, more than anyone else, are injured and violated."
"This must be put an end to now, while there is still time."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as this debate has also shown, the resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue remains a central concern of the EU and of the international community in general; for doubts as to the peaceful nature of this nuclear programme are indeed justified."
"I should like to emphasise once more, however, something that has been mentioned by many speakers in this House: that the EU remains committed to a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue within a multilateral framework, in particular within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"That is an important point to emphasise."
"We believe that the Russian proposal to build a Russian-Iranian uranium-enrichment facility on Russian soil would be a good alternative to enrichment in Iran: this solution has the full support of the EU."
"Some have said that Austria should take the initiative, but I am, of course, speaking here in my capacity as representative of the Council, and as such I represent the position held by the Council as a whole, irrespective of any national positions."
"However, as many speakers have mentioned – for which I am grateful – it is also important to bear in mind that the issue of Iran’s nuclear programme is not the only one that is important and fundamental to our relationship with that country, and which must be resolved if we are to improve our relations with its Government, with its President."
"There is also the human-rights issue."
"I should like to remind the House that, since 1975, Iran has been a party, without reservation, to both the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights."
"Iran therefore has a clear obligation under international law to comply with the requirements of these important agreements."
"Finally, I should like to confirm that I share the opinion expressed by Mr Brok and others that we must of course continue the dialogue with the forces in Iran who are favourably disposed to peaceful coexistence and to compliance with the country’s obligations."
"We intend to do so; of course we are willing to engage in dialogue."
"It must be made quite clear, however, that we must not allow this dialogue to be abused, and so we have to be very careful in our choice of dialogue partners."
"The issue of promoting civil society in Iran also seems to me to be particularly important in this regard."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that a crucial point is that, in the international community, and obviously in our Europe, there cannot and must not be any divisions where tackling relations with Iran is concerned."
"Iran has exceeded many limits with regard to its uranium enrichment activities, its systematic violations of the dignity of women, men and, above all, children, and its support for what we rightly define as terrorist organisations."
"Nevertheless, there is still an opportunity for dialogue and for a diplomatic solution."
"As many Members have said – and I recall Mr Schulz’s remarks – Iran and Islam are not the same thing. What is needed, therefore, is a regional dialogue aimed at securing stability and peace, one that primarily involves Iran, but also all the other actors in the region that are interested in a serious dialogue with the international community."
"Iran and President Ahmadinejad are not the same, either."
"Many Members have said so, the last of whom being Mrs Běnová."
"It is clear that Europe can carry out political action through dialogue with civil society and the moderate forces in Iran that are fighting for freedom, that want to think for themselves and be free to choose their own destiny, and that do not trust the remarks of their President, which are designed to incite hatred and violence."
"What are the options for the future?"
"I believe that the Security Council must now show evidence of its credibility and authority."
"Those in this Chamber who questioned the role played by the Security Council are indirectly questioning the role that we all assign to it."
"The Security Council represents the home of international legitimacy."
"No one should be afraid that the Security Council will hold an extensive and in-depth debate on the Iranian crisis, since it is precisely the forum to which such a matter must be brought."
"We have appealed to the Security Council on many occasions."
"The time has now come to give the Security Council the opportunity to really play its due role."
"Mr President, Europe is faced with the choice between, on the one hand, working to achieve peace and regional stability – as I believe is our duty – and, on the other, pretending that nothing is going on, with the danger of an aggressive nuclear power arising in the region."
"Europe has a great opportunity to exercise diplomacy and to show determination."
"Before we talk even only vaguely about any non-peaceful option, I believe that it is better that we emphasise democracy, determination and diplomacy as instruments for resolving the conflicts and the potential violence that we must do everything possible to avoid."
"It is not a conflict that is under way, but a different approach to rights, values and democracy."
"If we surround Iran with democracy and diplomacy, then we will be able to avert catastrophic consequences."
"To wind up the debate, six motions for resolutions(1) have been tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"– What should we do with the ‘nuclear’ mullahs?"
"What initiatives should we adopt in connection with the Tehran regime, which is forging ahead with the construction of nuclear weapons?"
"The European Union must adopt determined positions in order to avoid creating an explosive situation in the Middle East and in Eurasia."
"The ayatollahs’ atomic bomb is a powerful weapon with which to blackmail the Iranian people. It is a weapon used to silence the freest, most broad-minded opinions."
"Iranian society seems to be drowned in silence."
"An initiative is therefore needed to help those in Iran who fight for freedom, human rights and respect for all religious faiths and beliefs."
"The silence of the Iranian people does not mean that they have given in of their own accord."
"It will fall to them – to the men and women of Iran who have their country’s best interests at heart – to defuse the mullahs’ bomb."
"Iran and Islam are not the same; Iran and President Ahmadinejad are not the same."
"Therefore, the dialogue must continue and must be tightened up."
"We are not faced with a clash of civilisations, but rather with a different attitude towards human rights, freedom and democracy."
"We must encourage a more careful and respectful attitude towards every fragment of humankind, because only in that way will it be possible to triumph over hatred and violence."
"The next item is the vote."
"– Mr President, I should just like to protest against the fact that this motion for a resolution is only available in English, since all the other language versions had to be pulped on account of errors."
"In theory, one could refrain from voting altogether."
"I do not wish to block the vote – this is an important issue and we have to vote – but, in my view, it is unacceptable to work in such a slipshod manner here when there are as few resolutions on the agenda as there are today."
"I take note of your objection – which I share – even though the services responsible for these matters inform me that other language versions were available."
"We nevertheless give priority to the need to vote."
"That concludes the vote."
".The report on the air traffic controller licence on which we are about to vote is extremely important within the context of the creation of the Single European Sky."
"The European harmonisation of national licences will allow controllers to work throughout the territory covered by the Single Sky."
"Furthermore, this licence will lead in particular to improvements in terms of the safety of air traffic management and ensure that the training of future controllers is harmonised at a high level of competence."
"This report advocates the approval of the Council’s common position, which takes up the agreement reached a few months ago by our two institutions."
"The compromise that we have reached with the Council takes account both of the legitimate concerns about increasing safety and the free movement requirements of air traffic controllers."
"At a time when Europe is sometimes misunderstood by our fellow citizens, it is important that we look to projects such as this to restore their confidence in European integration."
"I shall end by thanking the European Commission’s services for their cooperation."
".Just this once, we can be pleased with this text for several reasons."
"The introduction of a common air traffic controller licence cannot fail to make a great contribution to the objective of safety that we all want to see for this sector, a sector in which we have unfortunately seen too many examples of tragic aviation incidents."
"To this end, I am also pleased that the supplementary system of black lists of airlines considered to be dangerous has been established and can be applied to all of the States of the European Union."
"Furthermore, I believe that it should be noted that Europe is moving in the right direction in terms of the harmonisation of the professional training and competences of air traffic controllers."
"They are not in fact being harmonised downwards; quite the opposite."
"With regard to the conditions for entry into the profession, the qualifications required and the content of initial training, relatively high social, technical, linguistic and professional standards are provided for."
"This is particularly essential since, all too often unfortunately, air traffic controllers have to manage extreme and dangerous situations such as the hijacking of an aircraft or an air crisis."
"We must therefore protect this profession, because the safety of the passengers of an entire sector depends on it."
". I welcome this Directive, the objective of which is to increase safety standards and to improve the operation of the Community air traffic control system."
"I am glad that the Council and Parliament were able to reach a satisfactory compromise on the amendments that we adopted at first reading."
"The June List wholeheartedly supports the IAEA’s efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the confrontation between Iran and the international community and believes that it is the UN Security Council that is ultimately responsible for deciding on the measures that should be taken."
"Because Iran is not within the immediate vicinity of the EU, this is not an issue for the EU if the Member States cannot achieve unanimous agreement in the Council on a common position."
"It is in the Council that Sweden should make efforts to ensure that Iran does not develop into a nuclear power."
"The issue is not, however, one for the European Parliament to deal with."
"We have therefore chosen to refrain from trying to change the resolution and have voted against it in its entirety."
". The title of the resolution before us, adopted by the majority in Parliament, is indicative of its underlying purpose: to fan the flames of the dispute over Iran’s nuclear programme."
"It is no coincidence that the majority in Parliament rejected the proposed amendment tabled by our group, which urged ‘a peaceful political solution to the dispute over Iran’s nuclear programmes’, reiterated ‘its opposition to any military action or threat of the use of force’, and stressed that ‘an escalation of the dispute would exacerbate the crisis in the region’."
"The same is true of other proposed amendments, calling upon ‘all countries to avoid any threat to Iran’s territorial integrity and to condemn unequivocally any pre-emptive action’."
"Instead of supporting measures aimed at diffusing international tensions, the majority in Parliament supports the idea of the UN Security Council taking control of the situation."
"This measure meets the wishes of the United States, which has long sought Iran’s international isolation, and an excuse for fresh interference and dangerous military adventures aimed at imposing its dominance in the region and at protecting its economic interests."
"Hence our vote against."
". The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports the resolution on Iran, its condemnation of various remarks made by the President of Iran, and its serious concern regarding the present attitude of the Iranian authorities to the nuclear programme."
"The EPLP also gives its strong support to the involvement and initiatives of the EU-3, the IAEA and the UN Security Council, confirming the need to pursue peaceful and diplomatic means to solve the crisis. The British Government's position is that military action remains inconceivable and is not on the agenda."
". Since the unexpected victory of the new Iranian President, Mr Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, an increasingly tense situation has emerged between Iran and the international community, leading to a series of negotiations amongst Member States over Iran's desires for the development of nuclear energy."
"I welcome the development of nuclear power when it is for civil use."
"It is for this reason that all possible diplomatic pressures should be applied to the government of Iran to get it to conform to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, so that any suspicions can be ruled out."
"I must emphasise that the people of Iran should not be demonised or blamed in any way; our dispute is solely with its leadership and I regret the recent comments by President Ahmadinejad on Israel."
". The people of Iran have no prospect of democracy, human rights or guarantees for minorities of the kind with which we in Europe are familiar."
"The state is run by a bunch of people who are absolutely convinced that God is on their side."
"They think they are entitled to decide how their people should live."
"Many people have fled the country and among those who have stayed on, it is mainly women and young people who are desperate for change."
"That is why it is short-sighted to see Iran only as a closed bloc constituting a threat to the outside world."
"Even more so than in Iraq and Afghanistan, a military invasion, as is apparently being considered by the American President, is not the solution."
"The threat to use nuclear bombs, as is being publicly considered by the French President, is even more dangerous."
"Both threats would have the inevitable consequence that the people in Iran would look to their oppressing regime for protection, which would then be the lesser of two evils for them."
"This completely removes any prospect of real change, human rights or democracy."
"Europe would do better to ensure that various organisations of Iranians in exile, who advocate domestic change, could operate within the law."
". – Τhe joint motion for a resolution on Iran by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is firing up tension and endeavouring to prepare public opinion to accept the new war being prepared by the imperialists on the pretext of the nuclear threat."
"Despite the lip-service pronouncements against war, despite the lip-service assurances that the ΕU does not contest Iran's right to peaceful use of nuclear energy, it is obvious that a programmed, aggressive plan by the imperialists is being implemented in order to control energy sources and the area as a whole by any means."
"Any differentiations expressed relate to antagonisms between imperialist countries about their share of the booty."
"At the same time, they are trying to obstruct other countries as well from developing technology and not being dependent on major imperialist countries."
"Within this framework, a new version of the war plan against Iraq is being constructed."
"Irrespective of the responsibilities of the government of Iran, the peoples must not and will not accept the imperialist plans against Iran and other countries in the area."
"Any intervention with or without the consent of the Security Council will come up against a global outcry and demonstrations by the pacifist and grass-roots movement."
"The people of Iran alone have the jurisdiction to resolve any serious political issues which exist in Iran."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Republic of Austria, it is a great honour for me to welcome you to our Parliament."
"We are all pleased to have you here amongst us as President of the country holding the Presidency of the Council of the Union."
"Before you took on the Presidency of your country, many Members of this Parliament including myself, and some who have greeted you in the aisles had the opportunity to meet you during your long career as a distinguished parliamentarian and President of the Austrian Parliament."
"In all of your duties you have demonstrated your undeniable commitment to Europe, to European values, to Austria’s cause in Europe and to Europe’s cause in the world."
"Your visit to the European Parliament today offers us the opportunity to express the great respect we feel for you and pay homage to your considerable personal achievements, and those of your country, and its special place in the history and culture of Europe, as well as Austria’s contribution to the recent development of the Union and the debate on its future."
"You are taking up your post, Mr President, during what is unquestionably a complex stage in Europe’s history, during which we must face significant challenges."
"We are dealing with some of them here in our Chamber during this part-session."
"In a short space of time, the Austrian Presidency has shown that it is perfectly aware of the circumstances in which it is taking up the Presidency of the Council of the Union and of the need to restore the citizens’ faith in the European project, promoting integration and consolidating enlargement, and more specifically, ensuring that we make optimum use of the period of reflection we are in so that, at the end of it, we can revitalise the process of creating a constitution."
"Few countries are in as good a position as Austria to confront these challenges."
"Austria was on the periphery of the Union of 15, but now it is at the heart of the Europe of 25, which will soon be a Europe of 27 or more."
"You are increasingly at the heart of the greater Europe."
"For Austria and the Austrians, therefore, the free movement of goods, workers and services is not merely a formal provision of the Treaty that does not affect them."
"On the contrary, it is a genuine everyday reality."
"You are at the meeting point of all of Europe’s roads."
"We are therefore looking to you and your government, because we hope that over the coming months you will contribute to moving the Union forward in a spirit of integration based on our founding values and objectives."
"Mr President, we consider ourselves fortunate to have you here amongst us and we hope that you will play a decisive role in determining the direction that the future of Europe is to take."
"You may rest assured you and the Austrian Government that the European Parliament will work to defend and promote the common European objective, while at all times taking account of the European citizens’ perception of it."
"Mr President, it is now a great honour for me to ask you to take the floor before the European Parliament."
". Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, let me first express my thanks for the very kind introduction."
"I hope you have not awakened extravagant expectations, but we will do our best."
"A few days ago, a Member of your House with whom I am well-acquainted – she is herself from Austria – advised me, in my speech before your House today, not to spend too much time on introductory commonplaces, for you often welcome to this rostrum Heads of State or Government from the widest variety of countries as guest speakers, and you are more interested in politics than in being paid compliments."
"In that case, I shall act on her advice, and hope that she was right."
"I am sure you will not mind me saying that I regard myself, in a sense, as an old parliamentary warhorse who is happy to breathe parliamentary air, having been – as your President has just mentioned – for more than thirty years a member of the Austrian parliament."
"That is a considerable period of time, and for a large part of it the division of Europe into East and West by the Iron Curtain seemed to be an unalterable fact."
"The Russian intellectual Andrej Amalrik had, admittedly, written a fascinating book entitled ‘Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?’, in which he prophesied the collapse of the Soviet system, but this seemed to be out of touch with the political reality at the time."
"For me, then – and I assume for most of us – the year 1989 and the months before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall were something of a political miracle."
"Ever since then, I have believed in the possibility of political miracles, or at least in the possibility of that what at first sight appears to be a difficult or even hopeless endeavour being, in fact, accomplished."
"At all events, the enthusiasm for the European project received an enormous boost at that time and took an additional dimension."
"Alongside the principles underlying the European project as conceived by its founding fathers, namely the idea of peace and the ideal of personal and economic freedom of movement in the largest possible European area, for millions of people who had to live with all of four decades of Communist dictatorship after the end of the Second World War, it opened up the prospect of being able to lead a life in democracy and freedom after all."
"It was therefore inevitable that, after the collapse of Communism and the enlargement of the European Union from 12 to 15 Member States – which was indeed to Austria’s benefit – the topic of another, new round of enlargement, which was also seen as a kind of reunification of Europe, would appear on the agenda."
"It was not easy, but we have, in the meantime – in 2004 – achieved that, and Bulgaria and Romania may be expected to join soon."
"The name of Croatia may also be mentioned in this context."
"In the wake of this development the issues of the borders of Europe and the European identity are increasingly being raised."
"Much has been said and written about the borders of Europe, but sometimes the answers to complex issues are relatively straightforward."
"Being uncontested, Europe’s geographical borders to the West, North and South are easily defined."
"To the East, the geographic borders of Europe neither correspond to the cultural and historical borders nor are they identical with the existing national borders."
"For the European project of the future we are therefore obliged to draw meaningful political borders – which do not have to be eternal – and, across these borders and through intensive cooperation with the neighbouring countries, to develop partnerships – something that can be summed up under the heading of ‘wider Europe’."
"At all events, both the fulfilment of the accession criteria and the European Union’s ability to admit new members are decisive factors in the definition of the political borders of the European project."
"It is my firm conviction that the Western Balkan states, too, deserve to be offered the prospect of membership, provided that they fulfil the accession criteria when the time comes, but it would be unrealistic at the present time to give binding deadlines or dates."
"The perspective that I have just tried to outline makes an improved set of rules urgently necessary."
"It is to be hoped that everybody now realises that an EU of 25 plus cannot work ideally, or perhaps not even satisfactorily, with the structures of the EU of 12."
"It was, after all, with the purpose of resolving that problem that the European Convention was established, and I believe it did an impressive job of drawing up the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"It was a willingness to compromise that eventually made it possible for all governments and your Parliament, too, to reach agreement on a text which, while not doing all we would wish it to do, is or would be important and useful for the European project as a whole."
"The negative outcome of the referendums held in two EU Member States has not only brought matters to a halt for the moment but has also put a huge damper on the pro-Europe mood – and moods do play an essential role in politics."
"We are now in a phase of reflection, but this reflection must be made visible and audible in order to give people the opportunity to agree with or oppose the ideas presented."
"My personal reflection leads me to the conviction that it would be a mistake to meekly allow the project of a Constitutional Treaty to perish and, in effect, to escort it to the cemetery."
"I also realise that there are powerful arguments against starting the entire procedure all over again, and that leads me to share the view of all those who believe that once this pause for reflection has come to an end, it would be useful to refocus in a mature manner and with fresh energy on the objectives of the Constitutional Treaty, which will also contribute to strengthening the EU’s democratic parliamentarian system."
"The Austrian EU Council Presidency is committed to making an effective contribution and to preparing the ground for this."
"I mentioned the term ‘referendum’ before."
"Frankly, I am not a supporter of plebiscitary democracy and in Austria we make sparing use of referendums, and rightly so, but, if we make use, or want to make use, of referendums in EU Member States on major European decisions, I consider the current practice of holding a referendum in some Member States and not in others, thereby creating a sort of ‘patchwork of referendums’ across Europe, to be rather unsatisfactory."
"I think it preferable that an EU-wide referendum be staged on specific matters of particular importance to Europe and that the system of double majority should apply."
"If this idea were generally welcomed in Europe it would of course also be necessary to reach agreement on the technicalities involved, for example, on how the decision to mount an EU-wide referendum of this kind might be taken."
"One topic of vital importance – and, from an Austrian standpoint, perhaps the most vital of all – that I should like to discuss is the issue of the social dimension, that is to say, the role played by the social component in European politics."
"Although it is not a matter of doubt that the market economy has become generally accepted in Europe, such acceptance, when coupled with acceptance of the process of European integration, requires that that market economy should possess an adequate social component, that is to say, that it should be a social market economy that does not regard the individual as a mere cost factor and that is committed to the principle of sustainability."
"The term ‘human capita’ has always struck me as a rather dubious one."
"I do not hesitate to affirm that, and I do not think that many will disagree with me when I say that it is quite simply unacceptable that 19 million people should be without jobs."
"Unemployment is a millstone around Europe’s neck, diminishing its prestige, and reducing it must be a priority at both the national and the European level if we do not want to jeopardise the acceptance of the European model."
"The two legs that Europe needs in order to stand upright are a sound economy and a sound social symmetry."
"In this spirit I would welcome it if you were indeed to succeed tomorrow in adopting, on the issue of the Services Directive, a compromise that also takes account of the concerns and unease of employees and many businesspeople."
"I also believe – and find this reflected in your House’s debate – that it is important to find viable answers to the question of opportunities for control and enforcement capabilities."
"At the beginning of Austria’s Presidency Salzburg hosted a large discussion on Europe entitled ‘Sound of Europe’, also alluding to the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, with the stage occupied first by politicians, and then by the performers."
"The artists, naturally, made use of their right to hold up a mirror to politicians and to point to the imperfections of politics."
"Whilst I was not actually persuaded by everything that was stated in this context, it remains true that the cultural dimension of the European project contains many buried treasures and still has a lot of untold reserves."
"It has been pointed out time and again that Europe is more and more able to keep pace with the United States in economic terms but that in military terms – as they say – it is a dwarf, although I find the latter less irritating that its social inequalities."
"Should we not, though, give closer consideration to how we compare with them on the cultural front?"
"The consistency and volume of Europe’s cultural output, from the Iliad to present day works of art, represent an incredible wealth of treasures, and one in which we can count ourselves second to none."
"Let us then use this wealth to reinforce our European identity, to remind ourselves of what we hold in common, and, while we are about it, let us not forget that modern art, the creativity of today’s artists, will be the cultural heritage of generations yet to be born."
"What holds true for art also applies to science and education."
"Just under two weeks ago, the German Federal President, Horst Köhler, who will himself soon have the honour of speaking to you as I am doing now, welcomed seven presidents of European states to a dialogue in Dresden, which was followed by a discussion with students from over a dozen countries."
"These students had prepared themselves very thoroughly for this meeting and presented us with a ‘Dresden Manifesto’ containing very concrete demands regarding Europe."
"One of these demands – and to this I ask you to pay close attention – was for an increase in expenditure on research and development of not merely three per cent of gross national product, but to five per cent of it; a very bold target indeed, but one that is well worth striving for if we are to make Europe a knowledge-based society."
"The Dresden Manifesto prepared by young students from a large number of European countries also included another demand: it called for the establishment of a common house for European contemporary history that would report objectively on the history of the 20th century and on Europe today and to give a detailed account of the European project."
"I am sharing – albeit briefly – the content of this manifesto with you today not only to demonstrate to these young people that their requests and concerns are taken seriously by being presented to this highest European forum but also because education and research – as you are all aware – are factors of production of very special quality."
"Martin Walser once wrote that all that was needed for utopia to stop being a utopia was for it to actually exist."
"The very real utopia of European peace and the utopia of a sustainable and ecologically responsible economic order need to be supplemented by a cultural utopia and an educational utopia with the elaboration of very specific goals and their implementation as a priority consideration."
"Austria has held the presidency of the EU Council for exactly one and a half months now and will hand it over at the end of June to the reliable hands of Finland with whom we are cooperating excellently."
"It is exactly four weeks since Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel addressed the European Parliament and presented the objectives of the Austrian EU Presidency."
"I do not intend to repeat what was said then but would only like to add that there have been a lot of activities and developments in these four weeks."
"This relates for instance to the Balkan priority set by the Austrian Presidency, but also to the progress made with respect to the preparations for the EU-Latin America/Caribbean Summit which will be held in Vienna in the middle of May 2006."
"It has to be said, though, that we were particularly hard hit by the enormous tensions and the acts of violence allegedly triggered by the so-called ‘Mohammed cartoons’, which seem to involve a collision between two mutually-irreconcilable positions: the fundamental principle of the freedom of the press and of expression of opinion on the one hand, and the strong need for the protection of religious sentiment and values on the other."
"I regard respect for religious feelings and for what people regard as holy in the truest sense of the word, as an important factor in the coexistence of people and peoples, rather than as an intolerable restriction on a fundamental right."
"If what one might term a ban on pictorial representation constitutes an integral part of a religion, then one ought not and must not offend against this principle twice – not only by disrespecting this ban, but also by reinforcing this hurtful violation of a taboo in the form of a caricature."
"The inalienable freedom of art – for the inclusion of which in the Austrian constitution, let me add, I myself spoke up in the Austrian parliament – is subject to legal reservations and demands consideration and respect, and the same applies in the case of the freedom enjoyed by journalists."
"If billions of people are to live together in peace on one planet, then respect for the values of others and mutual consideration are not luxury items to be discarded at will."
"This, I might add, holds true in all directions."
"However, violence and the systematic incitement to violence and taking the law into one’s own hands are certainly not an appropriate response."
"I respect and hold in high regard those Muslims, in particular, who, in Austria and elsewhere, have made their protest in a clear but peaceful manner."
"I strongly and unreservedly condemn the attitude of governments who allow diplomatic missions, embassies and innocent people to be attacked and exposed to danger."
"The willingness and the honest intention to further intensify dialogue between cultures, religions, civilisations and people remains a priority in this context."
"It is in those terms that I appeal to all concerned."
"Let me conclude by saying that the European project, being based on the many things we have in common, will be a success."
"It is for that reason that we have the right and the duty to strengthen the confidence that we will succeed in our endeavour of shaping both the ‘old’ and the ‘new’ Europe into the Europe of the future."
"I am very grateful to you for having given me the opportunity to speak up for this before Europe’s highest parliamentary forum and to offer you Austria’s services, and my own, in this cause."
"Mr President, I would like briefly to thank you for what you have said."
"You have taken note of the advice given to you by the honourable Member."
"You have followed her advice and got to the point: you have dealt with the issues that are currently controversial today and you have spoken very clearly about certain guidelines that are necessary in order to carry on constructing Europe."
"I am sure that the applause you have received is a good indication of the interest with which Parliament has listened to you."
"I would like to thank you once again, Mr President, for being here with us and I wish you the greatest possible success in your country's Presidency."
"– The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the outlook for Bosnia-Herzegovina."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that, since the Dayton peace accord, there has been great progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina towards the creation of a multi-ethnic democracy, and this is something that we should welcome, and in which we should rejoice."
"Speaking, indeed, as an Austrian, and therefore as someone who saw this going on so to speak over his own back fence, I can say that it seems to me of the essence that we who, ten years ago, watched in horrified fascination the incredible savagery and warfare and the people’s suffering, can today say with some satisfaction that there is only slight likelihood of an armed conflict there."
"The international community, but most of all the European Union, can chalk that up as a great success."
"The beginning of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and Bosnia-Herzegovina testifies to what has been successfully achieved over the past ten years, one important example of which was evident at the end of 2005, when the and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation merged their defence ministries, transferring all defence functions and staff to a single defence ministry for the whole state, which was without doubt a milestone in the country’s development."
"The European EUFOR Mission, ‘Althea’, works closely together with these new joint structures and continues to move defence reform forwards."
"There are yet more examples of how this state is moving forward in terms of its integrity and acceptance of responsibility for itself, one of which I shall mention being the introduction of VAT throughout the state with effect from 1 January this year."
"One quite fundamental step forward in reform was the agreement on the reform of the police, which is now in the process of being implemented, and anyone who has observed and followed these negotiations will know how difficult they were and just how much internal resistance remained between the state’s ethnicities."
"Overcoming these obstacles is without doubt a major achievement, and one on which Bosnia and Herzegovina are very much to be congratulated."
"The EU’s police mission – the EUPM – in Bosnia and Herzegovina will have a major part to play in this reform process."
"It was as recently as 1 January this year that its mandate was extended for another two years, after the original mandate had expired."
"It is tasked with providing even more proactive support to the police in their contribution to the fight against organised crime, and that is of relevance to our own Member States in view of the fact that organised crime in our neighbourhood does, of course, have an impact on us."
"EUPM, EUFOR and the High Representative/EU Special Representative cooperate closely in this area, with the aim of guaranteeing the executive authorities coordinated, consistent and effective support."
"Recent months have also seen efforts being made towards the possible reform of the Dayton constitution."
"Whilst this constitution is constantly criticised for being over-complicated, it should not be forgotten that – as I mentioned at the beginning – it has made it possible for peace to be established in the land, so that there is no longer a risk of hostilities breaking out."
"Although the negotiations that were started last year and resumed at the beginning of this one have now been adjourned , with the leaders of the parties unable, for the present, to agree on a complete package, it has to be said that progress has been achieved, and we can expect it to bear tangible fruit in the future."
"In particular, I would remind your House of the progress made as regards human rights and the reinforcement of the position of the Chairman of the State’s Council of Ministers, which does give cause for a certain optimism."
"This reform process, which includes reform of the constitution, is a process rather than an event at a single point in time, and we must all take a realistic view of it; after all, there are many things that are difficult to do in a democracy in an election year, particularly if the desired objective is fundamental reform."
"In its conclusions in January, the Council affirmed that it welcomed the discussions on constitutional reform and the progress achieved thus far."
"The theme running through all these efforts, and also the role played by the international community and the European Union, is the need for the institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina to accept more responsibility, and one can sum that up in the word ‘ownership’."
"Another important issue that will occupy us in 2006 is the future of the High Representative and the presence of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"That this state will continue to need international aid for the foreseeable future is not a matter of doubt, but the aim must be to replace the international community’s ‘push’ – embodied above all in the High Representative’s all-embracing prerogatives, the so-called ‘Bonn Powers’, by a ‘pull’ exercised from Brussels."
"As part of the transition from having the office of a High Representative as it is today to having an EU Special Representative, the international actors’ prerogatives and capacities for intervention will need to be reduced in line with the concept of ‘ownership’, which involves the transfer of additional powers and responsibilities to the institutions of the State."
"We should be glad that this is in line with the declared objectives of the new High Representative, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, who took over from Lord Ashdown at the end of January, and who has said that, as High Representative, he wants to adopt more the role of a ‘facilitator’ and make the country more European, and make less use of the powers possessed by the High Representative as such, which he will have to use less and less as the reform process goes on."
"We welcome, then, his statement that he intends to have recourse to his powers of intervention only under exceptional circumstances."
"As with the other Balkan countries, it is the stabilisation and association process that provides the framework within which Bosnia and Herzegovina will be prepared for incorporation into the European structures."
"The initiation of these negotiations, and with them of the negotiations on treaty relationships with the European Union, constitutes an important step in the Bosnia-Herzegovina’s movement closer to the European Union."
"The first round of negotiations, held on 25 January under the joint chairmanship of the Commission and the Bosnian negotiator Mr Davidovic, was completed successfully, and further progress, which it is to be hoped will be achieved soon, will of course depend on how far this reform process can be moved forward."
"The President of Austria has today already referred to the Western Balkans as a priority for Austria’s Presidency, and it is one, along with holding out to these countries the prospect of membership of the EU, because such a prospect is the driving force behind the reforms that these countries need and which we want to – and must – promote."
"It is vital that such reforms should involve progress being made in the most diverse areas, that is to say in combating corruption, in reinforcing public administration, in full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia – the last being particularly important for all the countries in the region affected by it."
"That same progress will be needed in many other areas where the reforms necessary in order that Bosnia, Herzegovina and all the other states in the region may become modern and democratic, are implemented."
"So what is the prognosis now?"
"The outcome of the EU-West Balkans summit in Thessaloniki in June 2003 was that the European Union reiterated its commitment to a European perspective for all the states in the Western Balkans."
"This fundamental affirmation that the future for these countries lies within the European Union was reinforced and confirmed by the June 2005 European Council."
"Progress in this pre-accession stage will of course be dependent on the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria and of the conditions included in the stabilisation and association process."
"The communication on the future pattern of relations between the EU and the states of the Western Balkans as presented by the Commission at the end of January this year and warmly welcomed by the Council, maps out the pre-accession steps over and above the Thessaloniki Agenda, and I am sure that Commissioner Rehn will give your House an extensive report on them."
"It is intended that the EU’s objectives in this respect should be reaffirmed on the occasion of the forthcoming informal meeting of EU and Western Balkans foreign ministers in Salzburg on 10/11 March, when agreement should also be reached on how and by what means the EU can deepen its involvement in the region."
"This meeting should provide a good opportunity to agree on practical measures to promote stability, security and prosperity in the Western Balkans through the region’s progressive incorporation into the European structures, with the Commission communication to which I referred earlier serving as the principal basis for this."
"I will conclude by saying what I have said before, namely that this is an important priority for the Austrian Presidency."
"This ‘high-level event’ with the Western Balkans as its theme will, we hope, further motivate and encourage these countries in proceeding with their reforms and with their integration into the European structures."
"We take a confident view of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s future, to which the European Union can make a considerable contribution."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by warmly welcoming the focus of Austria, as the Presidency, on the western Balkans."
"I very much look forward to working together with the Presidency, the Council and Parliament to achieve the next important steps to bring the western Balkans closer to the European Union."
"Bosnia and Herzegovina is genuinely at a crossroads today."
"Last November the country started to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with the European Union."
"A new High Representative/EU Special Representative, Mr Christian Schwarz-Schilling, has succeeded Lord Ashdown in Sarajevo."
"Mr Schwarz-Schilling will make less use of the executive powers and leave more tasks in the hands of BiH politicians."
"We are now in an era of increasing Bosnian ownership and responsibility."
"Before I outline some recent developments and our policy goals, let me apologise in advance if I have to leave the House before the end of the debate today."
"I am scheduled to leave at 4 p.m. this afternoon with President Barroso on a three-day round trip of six cities in the western Balkans, ending in Sarajevo on Saturday."
"So I hope we will be finished by 4 p.m."
"Bosnia and Herzegovina is making its way through the stabilisation and association process."
"Last November in Sarajevo we officially opened the negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement."
"The first real negotiating round took place at the end of January 2006."
"It went very well and our Bosnian partners had prepared themselves thoroughly."
"The Commission’s working hypothesis is that negotiations will take about one year."
"However, meeting this target date will entail Bosnia and Herzegovina being able to respond to all the EU reform requirements."
"In this respect, it is essential for Bosnia and Herzegovina to fully cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"In order to avoid any misconceptions, let me make it clear that there is no short cut: full cooperation is a necessary condition to conclude a stabilisation and association agreement and to make progress in negotiations."
"It is also essential to implement the agreement on the restructuring of the police forces, to adopt and implement all necessary public broadcasting legislation and, not least, to ensure sufficient legislative and administrative capacity to implement the agreement."
"We thus have a very clear message: Bosnia and Herzegovina should seize the opportunity that it has at hand."
"For this, reforms need to continue with the utmost determination."
"It is fair to say that the international community has played an important role in supporting the reforms in the country."
"But credit is also due to the local authorities, which have been able to achieve significant progress in what, to say the least, is a rather complex environment."
"We hope that progress will continue and that local political ownership will increase further."
"We are ready to support this process fully."
"The international community will adapt its role to these evolving circumstances of more local ownership."
"The more the country is able to demonstrate maturity and political ownership, the less the international community will need to intervene."
"I met recently with the new HR/EUSR, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, who shares this view on a new role for the international community and the use of the Bonn powers."
"The reform of the ‘Dayton Constitution’ is another important challenge before the Bosnian political leaders."
"The country needs a constitution that ensures full compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights; allows effective decision-making and efficient governance; and makes the government structure less costly for ordinary citizens and taxpayers."
"In other words, it is necessary for the country to develop a democratic, functional and affordable multi-ethnic state in order better to serve all its citizens and to support the reforms that EU integration entails and necessitates."
"Therefore, I welcome the recent efforts by the leading political parties and political leaders to find practical and workable solutions to these very important challenges."
"I encourage political leaders to continue their dialogue so as to achieve more ambitious results."
"We do not expect a constitutional revolution but rather an evolution."
"Constitutional evolution has to be a consensus-driven process with the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina clearly in the driver’s seat."
"The international community can act as facilitator; we can offer encouragement and support; but the Bosnian politicians must take the lead."
"The constitutional evolution is not as such a condition for concluding the negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement."
"But we need to underline that the European Union clearly has a big stake in this process."
"In other words, Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to make sure that its constitutional provisions guarantee full and effective implementation of the stabilisation and association agreement and thus pave the way for the country’s road towards Europe."
"I look forward to engaging with the European Parliament again on a future occasion on the progress made in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, over ten years on from Dayton, it is in particular the Bosnian politicians who have to ask themselves whether they have done everything they possibly can to ensure a good future for their country’s children, so please exercise your mandate responsibly."
"That having been said, I would like to follow the President-in-Office in stressing just how considerable their achievement has been."
"They now have a home affairs minister and a minister of defence; they have a single system for Value Added Tax and have – on paper at any rate – embarked on the reform of the police."
"Contrary to what is widely believed by our own countrymen, Bosnia-Herzegovina is not a hotbed of criminality."
"The country’s clear-up rate for crimes is higher than would be expected in the EU, and the incidence of ordinary crime is lower there than it is in our own countries."
"We have not just cooked that up; it is evident from the statistics, and it is something for which I think Bosnia-Herzegovina deserves all credit."
"The new High Representative, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, has intimate knowledge of Bosnia-Herzegovina and will, I am sure, be pro-active and very understanding in supporting local politicians, and will not have recourse to coercive methods, in the shape of his ‘Bonn powers’."
"The President-in-Office spoke of acceptance of responsibility, and that will be increasingly in evidence."
"I have to say, though – and I am addressing the Commissioner when I say this – that he will need support from the Commission, particularly involving it helping with the creation of jobs, setting in motion the real agriculture policy that the region has long been waiting for, and real attention on its part to the development of rural areas, for a free trade zone is of no use to the country unless it can produce its own food."
"That will also entail refugees being at last permitted to return to regions such as Posavina in order to repopulate them and make the fertile soil reusable again."
"The Bosnian politicians, too, must at last get started on the institutional reforms that will make ethnic division a thing of the past and build a functioning state for which accession to the EU will be a real possibility."
"Their cooperation with the tribunal in The Hague is an indispensable requirement; there has indeed been progress, but I cannot imagine there being real and complete reconciliation unless Karadžić appears before it."
"Negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement are progressing well, and in that we rejoice; a delegation from the European Parliament will be travelling to Banja Luka this summer to discuss progress with our opposite numbers there."
"We wish the Council Presidency and the Commissioner every success in supporting Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Bosnia and Herzegovina has finally started to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement and these negotiations are making successful progress. This is a good thing."
"It is difficult to find a country anywhere in the world with as complicated and demanding a state structure as that of Bosnia and Herzegovina and this makes their achievements and their progress all the greater."
"I am truly delighted with this and we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support the efforts of the politicians and the impetus of the citizens of Bosnia and Hercegovina and we salute their determination to make even more rapid progress."
"Ten years after the massacre in Srebrenica and the cessation of hostilities with the signing of the Dayton Accord, it is high time that the constitution of the country was modified and that the kind of state, cantonal and local administrative structures were restored that will help rather than hinder Bosnia in the adoption and implementation of the laws and practices that we are familiar with in the European Union."
"They should be building more on the rights of individuals, of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina (and tomorrow citizens of the European Union), and less on affiliation to religious and ethnic groups."
"In this respect Bosnia and Herzegovina can expect a demanding transition period and we all have to help the country during this time – the Commission, the Council and, at this time in particular, the incoming High Representative, who should use his own powers less while encouraging the state agencies of Bosnia to take on more responsibility and jurisdiction."
"The reduction in the military presence in Bosnia and the transfer of the control of the mission from NATO to the EU is clear and convincing evidence of progress in this direction."
"However, without full cooperation with the Hague tribunal we cannot move forward."
"Just as Serbia and Montenegro has until the end of the month to find and extradite Mladić, so Bosnia and Herzegovina, or Republika Srbska to be precise, must extradite Karadžić – this is a prerequisite for forgiveness and reconciliation."
"We must be aware that the road to the European Union will demand more than anything else improved multilateral relations and respect between all neighbours."
"Christian, orthodox and islamic civilisations lived in peaceful coexistence in Bosnia and Hercegovina."
"They spoke the same language and understood each other without difficulty."
"Now three different languages are spoken there but they can still understand each other and there is now increased and better communication between them."
"With the recent problems with the cartoons it is right and proper that we remember the painful history of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Perhaps this will bring us down to earth and perhaps we will then amend the visa regime more easily and with greater urgency."
". – Mr President, it is indeed a good thing that this House is so determined and consistent in giving its attention to the problems and concerns of the Western Balkans."
"That testifies to wisdom and reliability, and, as we have heard again today, the Council and the Commission are also standing by their own commitments, but – and this is something that we all, repeatedly, join in emphasising – progressive integration into Europe will depend, above all else, on progress in the individual countries themselves."
"Ten years on from the Dayton Accord, there is a desperate need for change in the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the country’s status, and so we are glad to hear that the newly-appointed High Representative, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, believes that his most important task is to make his own role redundant."
"It is possible for democracy to put down roots and develop in the long term only – and Mr Winkler emphasised this today – if it is underpinned by being owned by those who live in a given place."
"This has a lot to do with acceptance of one’s own responsibility, not only for the past, but also for a shared future."
"External support on the way to this goal is a good thing and may well continue to be needed for some time, and the EU must be aware of that, not least in its financial and structural decision-making."
"What we do not want, though, is for constitutional changes and administrative reforms – urgently needed though they are – to be forced through by bilateral agreements entered into at haste."
"The risk then is of a second Dayton, or rather of what would be a Washington Accord, under which local people would take on no responsibilities whatever."
"As Bosnia-Herzegovina draws closer to Europe, its civil society, which still too often faces hostility from every side, will need to be reinforced."
"There is a need for dialogue between the three ethnic groups as equals, and discrimination in access to education, employment and housing needs to be done away with."
"It is the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina themselves who will need to work towards these goals, but they will need our support in doing so, and today’s resolution is intended to help make sure that they get it."
". – Mr President, Bosnia and Herzegovina is Yugoslavia in miniature: a state that is home to different peoples, each forming a minority."
"The Bosnians in the middle and North-West, the Serbs in the North and East and the Croats in the South-West all need a model of government that protects their own identities."
"Moreover, the Serbs and Croats, which together form a majority of the population, need open borders with Serbia and Croatia, the neighbouring countries with which they have historical ties."
"The best solution for sustainable peace and conciliation between the three nations is probably a federal structure such as that in Belgium or Switzerland."
"That is why my group argues in favour of solutions from the bottom up, in which the outside world does not try to know better, but helps in the reconstruction, conciliation and transfer of knowledge of good administrative practice."
"What Mr Winkler and Mr Rehn have said fills me with confidence that this viewpoint is being taken into consideration."
"We feel, though, that the emphasis in the proposed resolution is too much on a different type of approach which fits in with the regrettably widespread opinion in Europe that, since the 1992-1995 war, Bosnia-Herzegovina has remained a violent and intolerant chaos for which an external solution must be found with military means and administrative interventions until such time as a strong leader appears."
"That is not the solution."
"We fear that in a possibly unitary state, we would see a permanent struggle for power with regard to the question which ethnic group would take control and who would assume a subordinate role."
"In the past, Muslims, Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs have taken it in turn to rule over the others."
"Strong national leadership leads to ethnic politics and discrimination, neither of which is desirable."
"That is why my group makes its vote for the compromise resolution conditional on the approval of our two amendments in which we speak out in favour of the ability of the nations in question to decide for themselves and against continuing external military interference."
"– Mr President, the day will come when Bosnia and Herzegovina will be in the European Union."
"It is hard to imagine when this might happen, but it is equally hard to imagine a Union without Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Similarly, we ought to be joined one day by such countries as Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia and Georgia."
"These countries will be integrated easily because they are built on a foundation of Christian civilisation like the whole of the Union, something that cannot be said about Turkey."
"For now, let us by all means offer Bosnia and Herzegovina a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, without any guarantee of membership."
"I would propose that after Bulgaria and Romania, countries should be admitted with the agreement of EU citizens, subject to their near-100% backing."
". – Mr President, thank you for making it possible for my intervention to be delayed until now; my apologies to the presidency of the Council, and to the Commissioner, but I have come straight from a meeting of the Conference of Presidents with the President of Austria."
"The situation in south-eastern Europe is a precarious one: negotiations have begun with Croatia;"
"That being so, it is indeed important that we should not close our eyes to the problems that remain in Bosnia and Herzegovina, or forget that they are there."
"If we are to solve these problems, we can only do so together, and ‘together’ means the ethnic groups, the people, the political authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the international community, represented in particular by the European Union."
"As has already been said several times over, the existing constitutional – or rather institutional – framework is not up to the job."
"Not only is it not up to the job of getting Bosnia and Herzegovina into the European Union, but it is also not up to the job of solving the present problems in the country itself, for spending some 50% of the country’s money on maintaining its institutions cannot be described as making any real contribution to its political and economic development."
"Simply changing the institutional framework, though, is no use at all, of course."
"We must also, and particularly, insist on cooperation with the International Criminal Court reaching its ultimate goal, which is that those who are responsible for war crimes or are suspected of committing them should end up being put on trial."
"People cannot think about other important current problems until that is done."
"One pressing problem is, of course, the overall state of the country’s economic development, with its lack of jobs and of investment, one of the consequences of which is that many young and educated people leave, so that its future elite, its future leaders, irrespective of their ethnic origin, are not there."
"This makes it an absolute necessity that this cooperation by all the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, irrespective of their ethnic origin, and involving the international community, should result in a new constitution and in institutional reform, so that ethnicity should be replaced as a criterion by the personal qualities and professional expertise of the persons who are to be elected to shoulder political responsibility."
"Mr President, in order to understand why the situation in Bosnia is so complicated today and why we need constitutional reform in Bosnia, we must understand the background."
"Everyone who experienced the war in Bosnia or who followed the events in the Balkans during the Nineties knows that the Dayton Agreement had one task, namely that of bringing the war to an end."
"It was incredibly important immediately to terminate the conflicts and prevent the country from being forced to experience another winter of war."
"Moreover, no one believed that the solution offered by the Dayton Agreement was perfect."
"On the contrary, there were many who believed that it was not good at all."
"The Dayton Agreement should probably be regarded more as a result of international efforts than as a desired compromise between Bosnia’s various political leaders."
"Since then, the peace agreement has, it is true, led to Bosnia retaining its territorial integrity. At the same time, however, Annex 4 to the agreement stated that the country should consist of two parts: a federation between Bosnians and Croats, and a Serbian part called Republica Srpska."
"Ten years later, we note that the consequences of the Dayton Agreement are such that it is difficult for Bosnia to operate as a normal European country."
"There is therefore no point in our even talking about the hundreds of ministers or the cumbersome state apparatus."
"In my opinion, the main problem is that the Dayton Agreement has led to a situation in which ethnic interests, rather than those of the individual citizens, take priority."
"In that way, the Dayton Agreement has concluded the work begun by the nationalist parties during the first post-Communist election in 1990."
"These parties still wield more or less absolute political power and share a more or less pronounced ambition to rule over a certain territory populated by a particular ethnic group."
"Therein lies the difficulty of agreeing on an economic or political future for all citizens."
"Therein too lies the difficulty of agreeing on a president or on systems of education or customs duties."
"The ethnic dimension has become, and remains, more important than the civic dimension."
"I was born, and grew up, in Bosnia and I experienced the war in that country."
"I am absolutely convinced that, just as when the Dayton Agreement was concluded, Bosnia must receive the practical help it needs from the international community."
"This excellent resolution may be the first step in the EU’s strong commitment to this work."
"I believe that Bosnia is currently at a very sensitive point, which could be described as a transition from a period when its main aspiration was peace to a period when its main aspiration is development."
"Since this is clearly understood in the wording of the resolution as the two opening speakers most eloquently told us, I lend my support to the wording of the resolution."
"I would however like to point out that in my opinion the strengthening of central authority in Bosnia is crucially important to its future."
"I personally do not believe that Bosnia can become a developed and secure state in the future if the decision-making processes in that country are not simplified."
"These highly complex decision-making processes have been and still are to a large extent geared to preserving peace and to fostering cooperation between the three national communities."
"But if Bosnia wants to make genuine progress, its political decision-making must be simplified root and branch and must be made more transparent and, of course, more democratic, with greater power for the central authorities and a reduced presence on the part of the representatives of the international community."
"I believe that all of this is required if the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina are to feel more self-confident, more than you may feel today on the streets of their country if you visit it."
"Mr President, I strongly welcome the trip by President Barroso and Commissioner Rehn as a visible demonstration of our commitment to the western Balkans’ EU future."
"Let us hope that Mr Karadžić and Mr Mladić will be found while they are there."
"Bosnia’s constitutional reform is vital, not as an interesting intellectual exercise, but in order that the state can put in place efficiently the regulations and policies necessary for economic success, including EU trade opportunities."
"I strongly support the recent Commission Green Paper."
"I particularly hoped for visa facilitation to come before too long, as a practical demonstration of the freedom that Europe means for Bosnians, alongside the hard work it entails."
"I hope you will not find me too partisan if I say that, while Lord Ashdown’s tenure has not been without controversy, he has demonstrated enormous dedication to the cause of Bosnia’s European future, helping it on the road from Dayton to Brussels."
"The door is open, and we want Bosnia to come through."
"Mr President, I would like to reiterate, for the House’s benefit, the reasons why my group initiated this debate."
"Bosnia-Herzegovina has at last embarked on the task of amending its constitution, because that is necessary in order that it might draw nearer to the European Union."
"In January of this year, there was a very serious situation when, this very stage having been reached, an American think-tank tried to push this change through suddenly without European involvement."
"This was at a time when Paddy Ashdown’s mandate had already ended and Mr Schwarz-Schilling’s had not yet begun."
"That sort of thing must not happen again."
"I am optimistic that Mr Schwarz-Schilling, as High Representative, will have the interests of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina at heart and will take their own responsibility seriously in ensuring that our political objective has a chance of being achieved."
"By that I mean that, ten years on from Dayton, ten years on from the European Union’s military intervention, he will see to it that ethnic division is brought to an end and Bosnia and Herzegovina are enabled to face the future together."
"– Mr President, Bosnia-Herzegovina is deeply divided along ethnic and religious lines, and long-term peacemaking there is dependent on these realities – which the elections, for example, strongly reflect – not being ignored, but rather respected and integrated towards the reasonable purpose set out in the Austrian President’s speech."
"We cannot do other than rejoice at the end of Lord Ashdown’s liberal dictatorship, which marginalised religious leaders among others, and look forward to Mr Schwarz-Schilling taking a more sensitive approach to arranging the country’s affairs."
"There are two main issues with which we in this House will have to get to grips."
"The first, to which reference has already been made, is the process of reshaping the constitution."
"The country is at present an unequal federation, and unworkable in the long term, with the Bosnian/Croat Federation dominated by the Bosnians, the Serbs and their , and the Croats of Herzegovina, who keep themselves to themselves, but the ones who really are marginalised are those Bosnian Croats who can scarcely find a place for themselves in this scheme of things."
"That is why this structure will not work, even with the excessively bureaucratic addition of cantons."
"What is urgently needed is for the reform of the constitution to bring about a symmetrical federation of all three ethnic groups, and it must at the same time prune the cantons and the bureaucratic superstructures that make it impossible for the country to be run efficiently."
"The second significant aspect is one that I have already mentioned, namely the faith communities and the absolutely fundamental part that they play in the country."
"A lot has been said here about Islam."
"When Bosnia became Austrian, the Austrians set up a public body for Muslims, and it is worth noting that it still exists in Austria today, making Austria the only EU country in which there is a representative organisation for Muslims that Muslims themselves accept as such."
"That is all tied up with Bosnia."
"There is also the Reis-ul-Ulema in Bosnia and Herzegovina itself, which, along with other institutions, is important as a manifestation of a European Islam, and the Christian faith communities in this country, represented by such outstanding personalities as Bishop Komarica, should also be actively involved in the peace process and accepted as legal entities."
"– If Europe's most complicated ethnic and political knots are to be found in the Balkans, then the most intricately entangled one is in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"In no other part of Europe are there so many fresh graves, so many parks and stadiums which are now cemeteries."
"That is why this resolution, which I wholeheartedly support, is so necessary and relevant."
"A year ago I became convinced myself that the prospect of European Union membership is making this ill-fated country calmer and better."
"This is a path, which Bosnians, Serbs and Croats must follow even more resolutely, to return to peaceful co-existence under new conditions and to consolidate this institutionally."
"EU support along this path has been and will continue to be particularly significant."
"Twenty years ago the inhabitants of this country were able to travel freely to both the East and the West."
"Now the citizens of small Bosnia and Herzegovina are fenced in by visa barriers."
"These must be torn down by both Sarajevo and Brussels."
"In particular, I would urge the Commission to make sure that young people are able to study at universities in EU countries, to become acquainted with Europe, its experience in reconciling nations, which were once deadly enemies, and the multi-faceted nature of European culture."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to object to Mr Posselt’s description of Lord Ashdown’s delegation as a liberal dictatorship."
"Whilst Lord Ashdown’s leadership was certainly energetic, I take exception to both the noun ‘dictatorship’ and the adjective ‘liberal’."
"I would now like to turn to Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has been a guinea pig for 15 years, and this is something of which the Bosnian, Croat and Serbian nations have been well aware."
"First, it was the guinea pig of a Communist state that was breaking up. Then it became a guinea pig for an EU which at the time, more than ten years ago, did not have real foreign or security policy."
"It was also a guinea pig for a NATO in search of a new mission and sadly also one for all those who feed off violence and war."
"In recent years, it has been a modern protectorate."
"I hope that both the EU and the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina will seize the prospect of a stability and association agreement to turn their country into a grown-up state, on the road to EU membership."
"Mr President, the 10 years that have passed since the Dayton peace accords were signed have brought peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina but have not resolved major political and social problems."
"A complex institutional structure means that the political decision-making process is not transparent, while expenditure on administration at all levels is a considerable burden on public finance."
"Positive factors, such as relatively good economic growth and reforms in police, defence and taxation matters, should not obscure the fact that without fundamental constitutional reforms, it is difficult to be positive about the future for Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"The European Union bears a special responsibility in this regard."
"The negotiation of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement that began in January is an effective step in the right direction, since the prospect of integration with European structures will reinforce the move towards essential political, institutional and economic reform."
"I am quite certain of this."
"At this point I would like to say that I am strongly in favour of progress in the negotiation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement not being made conditional on progress in the constitutional reform process."
"The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina are counting on a better future with close relations with the European Union."
"We cannot allow this prospect to be threatened by internal political or ethnic strife."
"I would like to thank the initiators of this debate and the authors of this motion which needs no amendment."
"I have in mind Amendment 2 in particular."
"I would also like to wish the Austrian Presidency every success in resolving the complex problems of the Balkans."
"That would benefit Europe as whole, not only the countries concerned."
"Mr President, the civil war in Spain ended in 1939."
"Today, more than sixty years later, the wounds of that civil war are still healing in certain towns and corners of Spain, a war which, from an ethnic point of view, cannot be compared to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and was very much easier to explain."
"I say this so that some people may have a slightly better understanding of the enormous difficulties involved in true reconciliation, the reconciliation that is needed between people, between families, in the streets and towns, particularly given that the peace is purely military, or at the beginning was a purely military peace, an enforced peace."
"The Bosnia process is therefore exemplary."
"It is absolutely exemplary given that in such a short space of time we should have a country in peace and with a project for the future, one that is unstable, but a project nonetheless."
"But it is clear that Dayton cannot be the definitive solution and we must therefore clearly support the constitutional transformation in order to resolve all of the loose ends that Dayton left outstanding, which may have made sense at the time as a temporary solution, but which clearly do not contribute to creating a common political project."
"That is what we must support: the creation of a genuine common political project amongst everybody which must include — and in this regard I agree with something that was said a moment ago — young people, and the young people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and their relations with Europe, and we must therefore make the flow of students between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the European Union very much easier."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am much obliged to you for this debate and for what has been said in it."
"I find myself unable to disagree with any of the interventions that have been made; the opinions you have expressed show that the Council and the Commission are on the right track, and we appreciate your support."
"I can do no other than agree with what Baroness Ludford had to say."
"When we today criticise the structures set up by Dayton, we should not forget that Dayton was the starting point for peace, and for that we must be grateful, that we must acknowledge – even if, of course, we must now admit that those structures are not ideal."
"Almost everyone who has spoken has referred to one of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s current problems being its bureaucratic superstructures, but, while there is no doubt about that being so, let us not forget what motivated their creation."
"They were put in place in response to the mistrust that had prevailed between ethnic groups, which did not trust each other and wanted – and had – to keep tabs on what the other was up to."
"Further to what the honourable gentleman from Spain said about his own country’s civil war, the same was true in this case: we must not forget that these ethnic groups had done terrible things to each other."
"To the degree to which we are able to reduce this mistrust and promote the mutual understanding to which Mr Peterle referred, we will succeed in changing structures, for I do not believe that it would be right to attempt to do that from the top downwards while such mutual trust is absent."
"We in the European Union must ensure that this mistrust is diminished and we must do what we can to help that happen."
"We must do something practical to help European values prevail in this country, and I do of course endorse what has been said about its young people."
"We must do something to support them, such as making it easier for them to travel abroad, and part of the package that the European Union will put together for them will of course consist in making it easier to obtain visas."
"Many thanks, again, for your interventions."
"Together with the Commission, the Council will continue to work for the realisation of all the things that have, today, been set out as goals."
". Mr President, I note the broad agreement in this debate on the need for increased ownership for Bosnian politicians and a new role for the international community."
"I would also like to thank you for this excellent debate, which shows the commitment of the European Parliament and the Presidency to our common policy in the western Balkans and its European perspective."
"We should all be satisfied with the negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement, which has got off to a very good start with Bosnia and Herzegovina, although we have to recognise that there are still many challenges for the country to tackle."
"It is about implementation, implementation, implementation in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Moreover, we all agree that Dayton put an end to the war, but it is certainly a less suitable framework for a properly functioning state and therefore we have to see ourselves as partners in the constitutional evolution in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Many of you have stressed the need for economic development and I fully share that view."
"That is why we put forward several proposals in the Salzburg Communication concerning economic development, trade and investment."
"In our pre-accession assistance we are already moving from reconstruction to economic development."
"In the communication we are proposing the setting-up of a regional free trade agreement to replace the current 31 bilateral free trade agreements, in order to encourage trade and investment and thus production and job creation in the area."
"Finally, I fully agree with those who underlined the need to work towards European accession in the present or next generation, which is why the Salzburg Communication includes proposals concerning visa facilitation and scholarship schemes."
"To show my personal commitment and that of the Commission and President Barroso, this week I shall be flying to Zagreb and later to Sarajevo."
"– I have received six motions for a resolution(1) in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 10 a.m."
"– The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Belarus in the run-up to the presidential elections on 19 March."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it will come as no surprise to you that I should say that the Council is gravely concerned about the adverse developments in Belarus, particularly as regards the elections that are scheduled for 19 March."
"The Council has recently again had cause to consider the issue of Belarus, and we noted with concern that President Lukashenko’s regime is acting in an ever more repressive manner, becoming more and more isolated, not least of its own volition."
"We did of course note with satisfaction its invitation to the OSCE and ODIHR to observe the elections, which is without doubt a positive step, and one that we certainly welcome, but we are still concerned about the worsening situation in Belarus, and have justifiable cause for concern as to whether these elections will be conducted in a democratic manner."
"The General Affairs and Foreign Relations Council last discussed Belarus on 30 January, and the ministers agreed on new conclusions, which carry the clear message that the OSCE’s ability to perform its electoral observation mission everywhere and without hindrance must be ensured."
"The Council also warned of the possibility of further restrictive measures being taken against persons in positions of responsibility if the presidential election did not meet accepted international standards."
"The European Union’s policy towards Belarus was last reviewed in the conclusions of the Council on 7 November last year, which struck a balance between commitment to the people and to civil society on the one hand and, on the other, a tougher line in respect of the regime itself."
"They also referred to the intention of the High Representative, Mr Javier Solana, to appoint a close collaborator as his point of contact for Belarus."
"We are all aware of the need to take a longer view of our work with Belarus."
"There is nothing bold about predicting that the elections on 19 March will bring no real change in their wake, or working on that assumption."
"Considerable efforts have been made to get our message across in the run-up to the elections and to ensure that it is heard clearly."
"It was in fact planned that there should be, at the beginning of February a high-level joint démarche involving representatives of the European Union and of the United States, namely the Council’s Director-General for external relations and political-military affairs, Robert Cooper, and the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Europe, Dan Fried, but the authorities in Belarus refused to issue these two dignitaries with the visas that would enable them to visit the country both at the same time, and that has made such a démarche impossible."
"In making it clear that the authorities in Belarus have failed to seize an opportunity for frank and free dialogue with the international community, we have not concealed our disappointment at this turn of events."
"Still on this subject, I would also like to mention that, on 30 January, the day of the last Council meeting, Alexander Milinkevich, the united opposition candidate in Belarus, who was visiting Brussels, had an informal meeting with representatives of the Member States, among them very many ministers, with over half the Member States represented at ministerial level."
"He also met with Mr Solana, with Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, and with Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner."
"There is no doubt about the fact that this was a clear and unambiguous expression of the European Union’s support for the democratic process in Belarus, even though the EU cannot, of course, endorse individual candidates."
"Whatever criticism Belarus deserves – and must indeed get some from us – I would like to stress that the policy of the European Union is not aimed at isolating that country."
"What we would like to see is a democratic, stable and economically successful Belarus – and it is our intention that it should be all those things, not least a country that is capable of becoming a member of the Council of Europe and that maintains proper, good and strong relations with the international community in general and with the European Union in particular."
"It is for this reason that we have made it clear that, given sustained development in the right direction, Belarus could of course benefit from the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"We want to make clear our willingness to reach out to the people of Belarus and to help that country to become integrated into European structures."
"Although we wish to maintain normal and friendly relations with it, that is not possible under present circumstances."
"The Council will not turn a blind eye to the continuing violations of human rights and civil liberties, and it will continue to give voice to its concerns about the deteriorating conditions in Belarus."
"With the promotion of democracy in Belarus in mind, the Council is still willing to make a serious commitment to it and to cooperation with international partners; at the meeting with Mr Milinkevich that I mentioned earlier, we discussed the ways in which we might help the civil society there in its campaign for democracy, and what options are open to us as regards exerting direct influence on those elements in Belarus that are campaigning for democracy."
"Even though the election result is probably a foregone conclusion, we must make a joint effort to maintain the European Union’s presence and influence in Belarus."
"As I have already said, the project to which the European Union is committed is a long-term one, and the present difficulties must not be allowed to discourage us or cause us to lose sight of our objective."
". Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner had very much hoped to be with you to discuss Belarus."
"She has been intensely engaged in developing the Commission’s activities on Belarus since we took office and I am convinced she will not miss the opportunity to discuss Belarus with the Russian Foreign Minister at their meeting that is being held in Vienna today."
"On behalf of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and the Commission I am pleased to have this opportunity to exchange views with you on the situation in Belarus in the run-up to the 19 March presidential election and on the Commission’s work to support democratisation and to support civil society."
"Let me start by saying a few words on the overall situation in Belarus."
"The Commission is still deeply concerned about the absence of democracy and the lack of respect for human rights in Belarus."
"This situation has further deteriorated as the election date is nearing and has resulted in a severe quashing of the voice of the opposition and the stifling of the independent press over the last few months."
"The fact that an OSCE mission has been invited to observe the presidential election and that a number of contenders to President Lukashenko are likely to be allowed to contest the presidential race is a welcome move, but not sufficient evidence of a functioning democracy."
"At this juncture, when the OSCE observers have started their work on the ground, it is important that the European Union and the Commission contribute to the smooth functioning of the mission."
"The European Union’s opinion and reaction will be based on this mission’s report."
"In terms of the European Union’s response, you are well aware of the unequivocal message that the European Union conveyed to Belarus and reiterated in the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 30 January: the European Union has stressed the importance it attaches to a democratic election process and has also clearly voiced its resolve to issue targeted sanctions in the event that these elections prove to be fraudulent."
"To balance this message with a positive note, the European Union has repeated its offer to have closer relations with Belarus, provided that we see convincing progress towards democracy."
"Let me now turn to the Commission’s specific action and underline that the Commission has made good on its pledge to raise its role in Belarus."
"Faced with growing repression and restrictions by the Government of Belarus on foreign assistance to non-governmental bodies, the Commission has stepped up and speeded up such assistance to Belarus."
"In 2005 alone, up to EUR 8.9 million have been dedicated to democracy and civil society projects."
"Creative tools have been developed to overcome the hurdles to assistance delivery."
"We have thus shifted part of our support to NGOs located outside Belarus."
"The EUR 2.2 million we granted last December to the European Humanitarian University in exile, as well as our support to independent media, are vibrant examples of this novel approach."
"In the field of independent media, I am delighted to say that the Commission has been at the forefront of donors’ action."
"We have started with support to the radio broadcasting of daily news reports to Belarus in both Russian and Belarusian."
"However, our main achievement is a EUR 2 million media project which is now being launched."
"It includes radio and television broadcasting, internet activities, support to the Belarusian independent press, and the training of Belarusian journalists."
"The project will allow the broadcasting of specific TV and radio programmes as from February, well ahead of the elections."
"We believe this high-quality project, which is supported by a Europe-wide team and sharply factors in Belarusian sensitivities – that is, no propaganda, straight news and sheer entertainment – will rightly reach out to large segments of the population."
"In addition, the Commission has decided to open a delegation in Minsk but unfortunately the Belarusian authorities have not yet given their agreement."
"Pending progress on this front, we will post a chargé d’affaires to Kiev who will travel frequently to Minsk."
"Finally, last Monday the Commission brought together all international donors to Belarus in order to plan ahead."
"This meeting has set in motion a common reflection on assistance beyond the election date."
"This meeting was a signal that assistance and coordination will not dwindle after the election date."
"In conclusion, let me emphasise that the democratic process in Belarus is likely to be a long process that will eventually succeed only with the support of the population."
"This is why we must continue our efforts to raise awareness among the Belarusian population at large through support to civil society and facilitation of contacts between the people."
"As Belarus stands at the crossroads, it is more crucial than ever that we all pool our efforts to implement a common strategy and be ready to react to developments in Belarus as they take place."
"The Commission remains committed to doing its part."
". – Mr President, 19 March marks the Belarus presidential election, in which there is still a chance that the country will assume its rightful place in the European family of democracies and conduct a free and fair election."
"However, in reality, the chances are very small, as President Lukashenko, since his election in 1994, has turned his country into a self-isolated police state and a sham democracy."
"The already poor human rights situation has deteriorated further since the passing of the anti-revolutionary law, aimed at suppressing protests, and many opposition leaders are jailed on spurious offences of corruption or, in some cases, simply made to disappear, presumably murdered."
"Mr Lukashenko preaches a curious pan-Slavic, anti-Western nationalism, with an added cult of personality."
"Independent polls give him around 55% support."
"It is believed that he will do whatever is necessary to achieve the magic figure of 77%."
"Registration for candidates is due by 21 February, and I salute the courage of the United Opposition candidate, Alexander Milinkevich, who will be restricted in his campaign to two 30-minute TV and radio interviews, whereas Mr Lukashenko will spend what he likes and appear as Head of State on the media daily, accusing his opponents of being thugs or Western mercenaries."
"I call on Belarus to allow for the right for independent exit polls to be conducted to help verify the results, but this request is unlikely to be heeded."
"Not surprisingly, this Parliament has not been invited to observe the elections, but the Conference of Presidents should authorise a budget for MEPs to attend via the OSCE."
"Russia also needs to be reminded that, as it bankrolls the regime with very cheap gas at USD 50 per 1 000 m3, it should support democracy there, being a full member of the Council of Europe."
"Lastly, I welcome, as Commissioner Borg mentioned, the TACIS EUR 2 million dedicated to free broadcasting in Belarus and supporting civil society."
". Mr President, on 16 December last year, the parliament in Minsk – which is not a democratically elected body – agreed to Lukashenko’s proposal that the presidential elections be brought forward to 19 March."
"This is an illustration of the wholly high-handed way in which Mr Lukashenko operates, and also a demonstration of the absence of any intention on his part to hand over power by way of the election process."
"That is why we once again have to fear an extremely fraudulent course of the democratic process in Belarus."
"The opposition bears the brunt of the decision."
"How can it launch a campaign if its candidates end up in gaol, like the Social Democrat Mr Statkevich, and if all mass media are controlled by the regime?"
"The authorities are trying their level best to make life for the opposition as difficult as possible and they also have more than halved the election campaign period."
"We must continue to draw attention to these blatant violations of our democratic values in one of the EU’s neighbouring countries."
"Whilst we must underline once again that Lukashenko’s policy is unacceptable, we must also emphasise once more that in the event of a change in direction, the road to a closer relationship with the EU is open."
"What more can we do?"
"It is regrettable that the relationship between Lukashenko and the European Parliament has deteriorated to the extent that we have not – unlike the OSCE – been invited to take part in the observation mission."
"Whilst that is, on the one hand, a good sign, in that it is the consequence of our consistently critical stance towards the regime in Belarus, we must also, on the other, ask ourselves why the European Parliament could not simply take part in the OSCE mission as the EU’s official representation."
"We are pleased with the invitation to the OSCE, but we also want to stress that more than lip service is needed in respect of the international standards to which Belarus, as a member of the OSCE, has committed itself."
"We therefore hope that the OSCE mission can go about their normal business and urge the Belarusian Government to lend them a hand."
"Finally, despite the deteriorated circumstances – four years ago, I took part in the observation and I think the situation now is even worse than it was then – we must make every effort, and above all, not refrain from doing anything, to support the opposition which managed to put forward a joint candidate this time round."
"I hope that Parliament, with today’s statement, will in any event give the opposition and candidate Alexander Milinkevich a moral boost."
". – Mr President, I agree with what previous speakers have said."
"Hope that the presidential elections will lead to a new beginning and eventually to democracy is ebbing by the day, and, every day, President Lukashenko devises new ways of oppressing the opposition and those among his country’s people who claim the right to think differently."
"That is why there needs to be more aid from outside the country."
"Nor must we allow ourselves to be discouraged by the way in which democratic involvement there is being nipped in the bud, for the people want freedom, and we know how difficult it is to be committed to that when elections – such as this one – are being interfered with, so we must not lose sight of the fact that this election day does not mark some sort of deadline – on the contrary, we are dealing here with an ongoing process."
"We should keep a careful eye on what the people of Belarus do in a small way to express their desire for freedom and democracy."
"It is because there is real potential for serious democracy there that I would also point out that what the Commission and the Council are doing to build up that potential is quite utterly inadequate – it is too slow, too inflexible, it is ineffective!"
"I would ask the Council to really get down to doing the task it has been given and adapt the rules on external aid to this special situation, and do so as soon as possible, to stop simply talking and put effective means in place, or else we will bear the blame for this problematic situation."
". – Ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the delegation to Belarus on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I do not agree with the draft resolution, and I shall explain why."
"One might be forgiven for thinking, from the debate in Parliament, that the opposition candidate could win the election in Belarus, but we know that Lukashenko will continue in office."
"What will happen next?"
"What sort of relations will we have with Belarus?"
"We must remember that Belarus is not just Lukashenko and the people in positions of privilege, but a nation that has not had an entirely negative experience with the regime, as it undeniably enjoys certain social benefits, for example free education and health care."
"We are well aware of how close relations are between Belarus and Moscow, and the importance of the development of this small country for its large neighbour."
"It is no secret that both countries are preparing to draw closer than they have been before."
"The European Union’s strategy towards Belarus is therefore, in the final analysis, also a strategy towards Russia."
". – Mr President, as usual, I only have a few words in which to express my disagreement with what the Council and the Commission have just said."
"I find it rather facile, as in other cases, to reproach a sovereign country for not conforming in every way to the models we have prescribed in order to recognise one government or another, in reality according to whether or not it suits us for any other reason."
"After the fall of the Soviet Empire, Belarus was left to the mercy of certain gangs of predators which were no more legitimate because they served the interest of some multinational or other, to the point that we saw ministers selling off public assets piecemeal for their own benefit, and often to European companies."
"That was known as liberalisation."
"We all saw Belarus being exploited by certain Western powers, which are only too pleased to turn it, and with it the resources that it offers, against its great sister nation, Russia."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us not be fooled by rather facile propaganda."
"If we are being asked today to condemn the Minsk authorities, it is not for the good of the Belarusian people, but simply so that we can blindly act as an accomplice in a United States strategy aimed at restricting Russian power as much as possible, by depriving it of its most natural historical and geographical alliances."
"That is playing God, as we saw a year ago in Ukraine, and it does not benefit Europe, the real Europe, which must include Russia and all of its allies within its sphere, and it will do so sooner or later."
". Mr President, Belarus represents a major challenge for the European Union, since the pressure we have brought to bear on it so far has been ineffective."
"We must now take action in support of democracy in Belarus."
"This will call for a number of organisational measures."
"Our monitoring of human rights in Belarus should be based on Parliament’s annual Report on Human Rights in the World and on information provided by the special Commission and Council representative for Belarusian affairs."
"Parliamentary resolutions should be reserved for new and critical situations."
"Our actions should be based on the Neighbourhood Policy instrument, or on a separate human rights instrument where the political and legal environment is hostile."
"In particular, EU commitments to finance independent media must be developed, in conjunction with reliable partners."
"The latest Commission competition has raised the doubts that are set out in the most recent question to the Commission tabled today."
"– Mr President, Belarus is a special country, the last dictatorship in Europe."
"It is an impoverished country."
"It is also impoverished in the sense that never in its history has it experienced freedom, unlike many, if not all, of its neighbours."
"How can it now aspire to a freedom it has never known?"
"It does not know to what it should aspire."
"Belarusians do not ask for much and they are very patient."
"If the elections on 19 March turn out to be rigged, the people will wait until they can have free elections at some future date."
"Nonetheless, we should spare no effort right now to ensure that the elections on 19 March are free."
"It is not good for one person to be in power for a long time."
"Let Belarus choose freely between its incumbent president and Alexander Milinkevich."
"In Slovakia, for forty years after what became known as the Victorious February of 1948, we experienced a regime similar to the current one in Belarus."
"The state machinery controlled by the communist party not only suppressed every manifestation of resistance, but also all expressions and signs of a free democratic society and the rule of law."
"People who have not experienced dictatorship can only with difficulty imagine its consequences."
"We note with concern that the Belarus authorities are stepping up repressive measures against civil society."
"Violent dismantling of the independent press and non-governmental organisations continues."
"On 6 February 2006, the Supreme Court of Belarus moved to disband yet another non-governmental organisation, the Belarus Union of Youth and Children’s Associations."
"It is appropriate that the European Union is bringing increased pressure to bear on Belarus."
"I am thankful for the fact that we did not confine ourselves to expressions of concern over the crackdown on the independent media, non-governmental and religious organisations, and some educational institutions in that country."
"I welcome, in particular, the Commission’s decision to sponsor independent radio broadcasting to Belarus."
"The radio station also deserves our praise I hope that the original decision to broadcast in the Russian language has been changed and that the people of Belarus are tuning in to listen to their mother tongue, which is particularly important in these days leading up to the elections."
"According to my contacts with representatives of Belarus democratic forces, broadcasts in the Russian language might have a negative effect."
"Now, before the elections, the objective of European institutions should be to take joint action towards the achievement of concrete democratic changes in that country."
"– Thank you, Mr President."
"I think that, in spite of being a day too late, the European Parliament wants to send a message today, stating its affection for the people of Belarus."
"It is a message addressed to a people who, as the facts make clear, is being denied the freedom to choose its leaders."
"So far, it is of elections that we have spoken in this House."
"I think that, for the sake of correctness, we have, rather, to refer to the forthcoming event as a vicious process of confirmation."
"It should be noted that, during the last few months, the European Union has made huge progress in taking practical steps to benefit the people of Belarus."
"On behalf of the Bureau of the Delegation for Relations with Belarus, I would thank the Council and the Commission, but there is more still to be done."
"We now have to show strong support for the people of Belarus, especially its young people."
"The authorities who want to curtail freedom know that young people are the main protagonists of change."
"The authorities have even closed down RADA, which represents youngsters from Belarus in the European Youth Forum."
"This is a most deplorable act."
"We again extend our support to the people, and in particular the young people, of Belarus, and we promise to be with them at their moment of trial."
"Mr President, there are surely not very many people who believe that the presidential elections in Belarus on 19 March will live up to even the most elementary democratic ground rules."
"We have every reason to expect the opposite to be the case."
"President Lukashenko will do everything to defend his position and consolidate his dictatorship."
"The opposition has been deprived of equal opportunities to send out its political messages, and the election campaign by the candidate for the united opposition, Mr Milinkevich, is shaping up to be a very difficult one."
"We must do everything to support the democratic forces in Belarus in the run-up to the election."
"I want, however, to make a special plea for Belarus not to be forgotten after the election."
"I agree with Mr Winkler that long-term efforts will be required in order to bring about democracy in Belarus, and we must persist with those efforts after the election."
"I would thank Commissioner Borg for his undertaking to pursue just such a strategy."
"Mr President, I belong to that section of my group that believes that the group should have signed the joint motion for a resolution."
"I regret that it did not do so."
"The situation in Belarus is becoming worse and worse."
"The conditions for a democratic election are unfortunately very poor."
"The opposition – both the political opposition and the free trade union movement – is systematically persecuted."
"Critical, independent media have very little room for manoeuvre."
"In this situation, we must do everything we can to support the forces of democracy and make efforts to bring about both a fair election and extensive election monitoring."
"There is only one way of showing solidarity with Belarus, and that is to demand that the Belorussians themselves be allowed to decide their own future."
"For that to happen, democracy is required."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, a free flow of information from Europe is vital in supporting democracy in Belarus."
"I would like to emphasise that, firstly, the resources we have allocated to radio broadcasts to Belarus have to date not had the desired effect."
"The decision by the European Commission to award a EUR 2 million contract to the German/Russian consortium for broadcasting to Belarus, knowing that the Russian television station already has generous contracts with the Belarus Government, and also that broadcasts take place in Russian, is in my opinion an unacceptable waste of money."
"At the end of the day it may provide support to the Lukashenko regime."
"Secondly, the European Union must support the democratic press of Belarus."
"Thirdly, we should consider making it easier for ordinary Belarus citizens, scientists and cultural workers to obtain European Union visas, while at the same time boosting the restrictions on visas for representatives of the ruling regime and their families."
"Finally, I would also like to urge the European Commission and the Council to call more insistently for the immediate release of Mikhail Marinich, the opposition leader being detained on political grounds."
"– The situation in Belarus, with just over a month remaining until the elections, leaves little hope that the Presidential Elections in this country will be democratic, free or fair."
"As yet, not one single candidate is registered officially, and only one future candidate (the current President Alexander Lukashenko) is the subject of an intense propaganda campaign, which is being carried out by the entire state media."
"Press analysis shows that an opinion is being formed nationwide that there is no alternative to the current President, and that an absolute majority of citizens will vote for him because only Alexander Lukashenko can guarantee stability in a country whose achievements are unquestionable."
"Apparently, the President's opponents are useless scoundrels, while the West does not understand the situation in Belarus and seeks to destabilise the country, but will be unable to do so because Belarus has President Lukashenko."
"Repression of the non-state media continues to intensify."
"Within this context European Union support is a vital necessity, but it is insufficient, late and therefore has little effect."
"Is this really all the European Union can do to defend freedom of thought and the press in a neighbouring country?!"
"Mr President, on 19 March the presidential election will take place in Belarus."
"We all agree that it is about time to support the activities of the democratic force in Belarus."
"It should be our top priority to facilitate a free and democratic ballot."
"Full transparency of every process involved in this election, including the counting of votes and equal conditions for all candidates, must be secured."
"The policies of Lukashenko have raised far too many serious concerns."
"The presence of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe during the presidential election is of the highest importance."
"We should insist on the Belarus authorities extending an invitation to both institutions as soon as possible."
"The situation of citizens of Belarus concerning the independence of the media and freedom of expression is gradually getting worse, which is why we strongly support the establishment of radio network broadcasting from Poland, Lithuania and possibly Ukraine."
"Furthermore, the actions taken by the Government of Belarus against the Union of Poles in Belarus and the Roma minority, as well as the decision to ban the reformed evangelical church, are examples of the lack of respect for minority rights, as well as freedom of association and belief."
"– Besides bad news from Minsk, there is also good news from Vilnius."
"Today, the Lithuanian Government registered the European Humanities University, which was recently exiled from Minsk and has renewed its activities in Vilnius."
"This is the result of huge efforts by some Members of the European Parliament, together with representatives of the European Commission and Lithuanian diplomats."
"The students of this university doubtless give real hope for the revival of Belarus."
"At the same time we have received some bad news from Minsk."
"The dictatorship is intensifying its repression of democratic civil youth organisations opposed to the regime."
"The work of the Belarusian Union of Youth and Children's Public associations ‘RADA’ has been banned by a decision of the regime."
"This youth organisation had already won international recognition and was developing relations between young people in Belarus and many European youth organisations."
"I would, therefore, like to appeal to all of my colleagues and trust that they will endorse the demand for an end to the repression directed against the youth of Belarus and their organisations."
". I shall now speak on the Council’s behalf to conclude this debate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by making it quite plain – since this point was raised during the debate – that any state is entitled to raise concerns about human rights anywhere in the world, and that criticism of human rights abuses is not the same thing as interference in a country’s internal affairs."
"That truth was established at the Vienna Conference on Human Rights, which was held as recently as 1993."
"It follows that the European Union is perfectly entitled – as is any other state – to make human rights in another state its business."
"That is what the European Union is doing, and I am grateful to your House for its commitment to this and for the clear affirmations that have emerged from this debate."
"In making them, you are making the work of the Council and the Commission easier, for it is vital, where such matters are concerned, that the European institutions should speak with one voice."
"Perhaps I might be permitted to say, in response to Mrs Schroedter’s intervention, that it certainly is arguable that the instruments available have not, to date, been used in an effective way."
"This is something we are endeavouring to improve, and with that in mind, I would like to say that the creation of the European Neighbourhood Policy as a new foreign aid instrument will improve matters; that is what we want to work towards, so that the more efficient use of resources may be guaranteed."
"Something else I would like to highlight, since several speakers in this debate referred to it, is the fact that it is today that the troika meeting of foreign ministers with the Russian foreign minister is being held in Vienna – this was announced by Commissioner Borg, since Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner is also a participant in it."
"It goes without saying that the order of business for this important meeting includes Belarus, for it is indeed important that Russia should spell out where it stands on this matter, and we all know that Russia does, of course, have a certain influence on what goes on there."
"Something else that has been mentioned in this debate and that we want to take very seriously is the very real need, when promoting links between academics, between young people, and between members of civil society, for such persons to be given the opportunity to travel abroad, and this is indeed something at which we will have to take a closer look."
"These people are staking their freedom on the campaign for democracy, and it would not be right if we were not to enable them to work together with our institutions for the democratisation of Belarus."
"Reference has been made to the presidential elections, which would in themselves present Belarus with an opportunity to take the right road forward."
"As most speakers have said, its chances of doing that are not very considerable, and the Commission and the Council will have to give some thought to how they will respond in the event of irregularities in the elections."
"While we are, of course, prepared to consider taking action in that event, we must, whatever happens, ensure that we do not hit the wrong target – as sanctions so often do."
"We do not want whatever we do to affect civil society – on the contrary, we want to promote its wellbeing, and we want to do everything possible to bring about change in Belarus, in the long term, and from the ground up."
"That is what we want to do, that is what the Council is working towards."
". Mr President, I thank honourable Members of Parliament for all their comments, which, in general, reinforce the commitment of this House to seek democracy and respect for human rights in Belarus."
"As I stated in my opening remarks, the Commission, for its part, has played an active role in Belarus through its support for NGOs and media organisations and action to help raise awareness among the Belarusian population in the hope that this may bring about democratic change."
"The European Union has stressed the importance it attaches to a democratic election process, and we are ready to offer closer relations if and when we see convincing progress towards genuine democracy and respect for human rights."
"In response to what Mr Wiersma and other Members said concerning the presidential election scheduled for 19 March, the Commission regrets that the European Parliament has not been invited to observe the elections."
"This is indeed disappointing, but not a surprising decision, given the situation in the country."
"We will be following closely what the OSCE/ODIHR mission will be reporting on the elections."
"MEPs could possibly form part of the national allocations from Member States to the OSCE/ODIHR mission."
"Regarding the point raised by Ms Schroedter and other MEPs, I should like to repeat that the Commission is seeking to address the situation in a novel way through support for the European Humanitarian University in exile and for independent media."
"Regarding what Ms Záborská said, I would again emphasise that a good part of the Commission strategy is to support independent media in both the Russian and Belarusian languages – in particular – to ensure that they can truly act as a catalyst for change."
"Concerning the emphasis placed by Mr Muscat on youth, I thank him for his comments and assure him that the Commission is indeed focusing its efforts on civil society, including the youth of Belarus, who are the hope for a better future."
"On the point raise by Ms Vaidere, I should like to state that discussions are under way at Council working group-level with a view to finding some practical solutions to the common approach on visa facilitation."
"With regard to Mr Pavilionis’s point, I cannot agree more that we need to support any action in favour of the youth of Belarus and, in particular, in favour of the European Humanitarian University in exile."
"The EUR 2 million media project involves not only partners from Germany and Russia, but also a Polish radio station, a Lithuanian radio station, German and Dutch NGOs and Belarusian journalists."
"It is therefore a Europe-wide project."
"The Russian television partner, RTVI, has demonstrated its fully independent stance from the Russian Government."
"As a matter of fact, RTVI is made up of journalists who have escaped government-controlled media outlets."
"All television and radio programmes will be in both Russian and Belarusian."
"Television programmes aired in Russian will systematically be subtitled in Belarusian."
"– I have received six motions for resolutions(1) pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Before we proceed to Question Time, I have an announcement to make. I can inform that House that Written Statement No 69/2005, on the combating of racism in football(1), has been signed by a majority of Members of this House."
"Madam President, let me give you the score."
"It is EP United 1, Racism 0."
"More than half of our Members have signed Written Declaration 69 on combating racism in football."
"I thank all Members who have signed."
"This is a historic moment."
"Mrs Bozkurt, you will be aware that that was not a point of order, but this House has, of course, sent out an important message with this statement."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0002/2006)."
"We will take the following questions to the Commission."
"Following the introduction of the toll for heavy goods vehicles in Germany, plans to introduce a toll for cars in the near future are also under consideration."
"As this would lead to higher costs for German car drivers, the introduction of a car toll would have to be accompanied by a compensatory reduction in vehicle tax."
"Does the Commission consider that the introduction of the car toll in Germany, conditional to a decision being made to reduce vehicle tax at the same time, is compatible with the ban on discrimination laid down in Article 12 of the EC Treaty?"
". I should like to inform the honourable Member of Parliament that currently, with the sole exception of heavy goods vehicles, there is no harmonisation in the field of vehicle taxes at Community level."
"While Directive 1999/62/EC established minimum annual vehicle tax rates for heavy goods vehicles, Member States are free to lay down national provisions for car taxation as they see fit."
"A similar situation exists in the field of tolls and charges for road vehicles, the imposition of which is often related to, and justified by, the costs incurred by national authorities for the construction and upkeep of the road infrastructure."
"Directive 1999/62/EC provides the framework for levying tolls and charges for heavy goods vehicles in a non-discriminatory and proportionate manner."
"There is no such Community legislation for private vehicles."
"However, national provisions introducing car taxes, tolls or charges have to be in line with the general principle of the EC Treaty and, in particular, should not give rise to border-crossing formalities in trade between Member States and should respect the non-discrimination principle."
"The Commission is of the opinion that, if the imposition of toll charges for road vehicles is not conditional on a decision to reduce car taxes simultaneously, and if these measures do not include any direct or indirect discrimination based on the nationality of the road vehicle, they are not contrary to Article 12 of the EC treaty."
"I would like to recall that the Commission gave a similar reply to an oral question during Question Time at Parliament’s December 2005 part-session."
"According to the information available to the Commission, Germany is currently not pursuing the idea of introducing a toll for passenger cars."
"If Germany were to introduce a toll, as referred to in the oral question, the Commission would of course examine those provisions in depth."
"Madam President, on the subject of the infrastructure costs directive, I should like to ask the Commissioner what the Commission is considering doing in order to further advance the principle of the internalisation of external costs."
"Although we have now adopted the infrastructure costs directive, what is the Commission contemplating doing, particularly by way of studies and expert assessments, to more clearly elucidate the link between pollution of the environment and heavy goods traffic and, on that basis, to present a new and final proposal for an improved Eurovignette directive with less of an impact on the environment?"
". The White Paper on transport policy for 2010 concluded that one of the principal reasons for the imbalance in the transport system is that the modes of transport do not, in every case, pay the costs for which they are responsible."
"The European Parliament confirmed the need for infrastructure charging when it adopted the report of the conclusions of the White Paper on 12 January 2003."
"Distance-based road tolls and charges based on the duration of the use of the road have historically been levied on motorways or other main roads to help finance the construction, operation and maintenance of the infrastructure."
"Increasingly, as technology advances, such instruments could also be used to manage traffic: congestion charges, emissions-related charges and so on."
"Most Member States levy tolls or charges on at least part of their motorway network."
"The Commission policy on road charges and tolls is that they are an important instrument for financing investment in infrastructure, managing traffic and encouraging private-sector investment in infrastructure management."
"So Commission legislation is currently limited to heavy goods vehicles, as I have already mentioned, but it is a part of our policy."
"Does the Commission share my concern about the advertising of so called 'junk food' to children via television, Internet and the media?"
"Bearing in mind the international nature of the market and supply chains, coupled with the obvious detrimental effect of these products, does the Commission consider action at EU level appropriate?"
". Madam President, the Commission attaches great importance to the effects that advertising might have on children’s behaviour."
"This is particularly the case with the advertising of food products, given the potential relationship with children’s diets and health."
"On the general basis, the European Union is equipped with a number of horizontal norms that touch upon this field and regulate those advertising activities that can influence children’s behaviour, and which also cover food products."
"First, in respect of television advertising, since 1989 the Television Without Frontiers directive has provided that such advertising shall not cause moral or physical detriment to minors."
"In particular, television advertising shall not directly exhort minors to buy a product or service by exploiting their inexperience or credulity, directly encourage them to persuade their parents or others to purchase the goods or the services being advertised, or exploit the special trust that minors usually have in parents, teachers and in others close to them."
"A proposal for an amendment to this directive, adopted by the Commission on 13 December 2005, would extend these provisions to other types of audio-visual content."
"In addition, the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which was adopted in 2005, includes similar provisions."
"This will enhance the protection of vulnerable groups of consumers, banning directly exhortations to children to buy advertised products or persuade their parents or other adults to buy advertised products for them."
"At this stage, the Commission does not intend to take any other legislative initiative."
"The Commission now expects self-regulation by the industry to step in and complement in an effective and precise way the provisions of law which are in place."
"It has initiated a far-reaching process to that end."
"The European platform on diet, physical activity and health, for example, is meant to bring about non-regulatory measures and firm commitments by the industry."
"The Commission expects that these commitments will include a number that relate to advertising to children."
"In parallel, the Commission has also reinforced its dialogue with industry and others to assess how to further improve advertising self-regulatory measures."
"In December 2005 the Commission adopted a Green Paper on the promotion of healthy diets and physical activity."
"One of the questions, for which the Green Paper specifically invites responses, is: ‘Are voluntary codes (“self-regulation”) an adequate tool for limiting the advertising and marketing of energy-dense and micronutrient-poor foods?"
"What would be the alternatives to be considered if this self-regulation fails?’"
"The Commission hopes that this approach will produce meaningful commitments to the benefit of all actors concerned and to society at large."
